Firstly, I would like to thank Mr Adam very sincerely for his report. The more I read through it, the more it strikes me just how excellent it is. I urge Parliament to treat this subject very seriously and to read the Adam report in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">The message is clear: we need cooperation, not refusal. Older reactors, especially first generation reactors, need to be decommissioned as quickly as possible, while modern plants need to be upgraded, and we particularly need to cooperate with the CEECs and the New Independent States to develop an all‐embracing energy policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The more the eastern electricity network is connected to the western network, the more important this issue is becoming, as these countries will use their nuclear power stations to sell power to the West as a means of earning income. So it is by no means irrelevant to ask how this power is produced. What is more, the applicant countries – this is what I wanted to say during the debate just now – must also observe other environmental regulations. Not only nuclear power stations but also large combustion plant, cars and every single factory will have to adhere to the EU's environmental legislation. We cannot make any exceptions for nuclear power stations.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, there is one point that I would like to make, and I shall address this primarily to the Commission. It is not just a question of telling each other here in this forum how important all this is – we also need to draw attention to deficiencies. I was recently told about this by a German nuclear power station, Neckar‐Westheim, which has been working with Zaporazhye for 10 years on improvements to valves. As you will be aware – and if not, I am telling you now – an accident took place there on 20 April 1995 along the lines of the Harrisburg incident. Similar incidents have also taken place at two other nuclear power stations in Russia. They should have reacted pretty quickly – it was only a problem with valves, a simple technical matter. Yet it has taken four years, and up to now nothing has happened, although an application has been made. Now there has to be an invitation to tender. If your house was on fire, can you imagine getting quotes to see which fire brigade was the cheapest? Your house would have burnt down by the time they got there! We need to apply different procedures in this case, and Gordon Adam is quite right in drawing attention to paragraph 20, which states very clearly what we should be doing. That is why I am asking for swifter action before the whole thing packs up!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Eisma </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, we in the Liberal Group tabled an urgent resolution a few weeks ago, also signed by Mrs Plooij and Mr Frischenschlager, on the K2 and R4 nuclear power stations in Ukraine. We have withdrawn this resolution now that the Adam report is on the agenda, but we would nevertheless like to say something about this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I entirely agree with the rapporteur that optimum use must be made of the capacity of the safe power stations that are now ready or under construction, at least where this is the least expensive option. I have read various reports that the K2 and R4 power stations in Ukraine are to be decommissioned using EBRD and Euratom money, but we feel very uneasy about this. We originally asked for the Court of Auditors to produce a report on this use of Euratom funding, but Mrs Aelvoet has tabled two amendments that go even further, and we in our group intend to support her. We think that Euratom and the EBRD should not be providing money to decommission these two power stations. Furthermore, the ESPOO Convention requires Ukraine to keep its neighbours informed about its nuclear power stations, which it has not done. Ukraine is not a signatory to the ESPOO Convention, but as Western European institutions we are perfectly entitled to insist that it should meet the ESPOO requirements, in order to guarantee that Ukraine"s neighbours have some say in the future of its nuclear power stations.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pompidou </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the context of building Europe, and also with enlargement in mind, we need to have an energy policy in keeping both with market trends and the real needs of consumers. There is an ever‐increasing role for the EU here.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the context of Gordon Adam's two reports, and he has prepared them with all the rigour and insight that we have come to expect from him. The point at issue is to optimise electricity distribution throughout the whole of Europe, taking into consideration the ineluctable development of the market for gas, of which there are still substantial reserves. The objective is not only to interconnect the electricity networks of central Europe and the EU, but also to facilitate natural gas imports from third countries. The task before us now is to diversify sources of energy supply by continuing to use fossil fuels, whilst endeavouring to minimise CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions. Given the rapid growth in energy demand, we need to develop a realistic percentage of renewables and at the same time exploit Europe's nuclear know‐how.</p>
<p class="contents">Gordon Adam's second report is about improving nuclear safety in eastern Europe. In this context, fuel reprocessing is just as important as operational safety. Improved safety at traditional nuclear power stations is an objective of the PHARE and TACIS programmes, which new regulations have improved for the period 2000‐2006. We are not talking about a replacement for government strategy in third countries – this is about using dialogue and cooperation to achieve essential improvements in the safety and energy efficiency of their reactors. It is particularly important to achieve better management of waste from civil power stations, as well as eliminating 50 tonnes of military plutonium in Russia. The European Union cannot stand by and allow Russian military plutonium to accumulate as a result of implementing nuclear non‐proliferation treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">An integrated energy policy bringing together national governments and the European Union is essential. It should steer industry towards rational use of energy and greater use of renewables, including improvements in the nuclear energy sector as a whole, with a new generation of reactors and management of the fuel cycle, in particular the end of the cycle, in other words nuclear waste.</p>
<p class="contents">We need an ambitious yet pragmatic and responsible programme under which the European Union can use its powers to achieve both short‐term and long‐term benefits. In the short term, we need to make rapid progress with the EPR, the European pressurised water reactor, which is both safer and more profitable, as it will reduce the cost per kWh by over 10 %. Whilst by using MOX fuel nuclear waste can be eliminated in part, we still need to be making preparations for the long term now, and – at the same time – to initiate a study to evaluate the technology involved in hybrid reactors, such as the reactor recently proposed by Carlo Rubia. However, work is also needed on high temperature reactors, which are notable both for their energy efficiency and for their capacity to eliminate 90 % of military plutonium.</p>
<p class="contents">Work needs to be done under the EU framework programme, in Member States and in third countries, to develop the necessary technology. Improvements in nuclear safety and the elimination of waste, coupled with diversification of energy supplies, will enable us to meet the increase in demand throughout Europe and to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. This makes European energy policy a model for others to follow.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bloch von Blottnitz </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, when you look at the Commission communication on nuclear sector related activities for CEEC and NIS states and at the Court of Auditors' report, you could be forgiven for thinking that they were about two totally different subjects. Given that the Commission claims that its communication gives an overview of funding provided and successes to date, together with new guidelines on programme implementation, the document we are considering, with just 13 pages of text and 17 pages of annexes, really is an outrage. Nebulous statements such as – and I am quoting now – ’the European Union has undertaken a great number of activities in the nuclear sector since 1990' and ‘special programmes were created with considerable budgetary appropriations" are not what I would call an evaluation!</p>
<p class="contents">The passage in the communication about radioactive waste management is a real gem of vacuity. Let me quote the following: ‘The radioactive waste programme is giving many CEEC/NIS organisations and institutes a wide insight into western technology and safety culture, and this has helped to specify problems in this area and to better define concrete implementation projects". I think these gentlemen must have been peering into a very deep hole indeed! What projects, what problems? What form does the EU participation envisaged take? Bearing in mind that we do not have a permanent storage solution anywhere in the EU, but just shift waste around from one country to another and then dump it at some interim storage facility, that really is rich!</p>
<p class="contents">Participation by eastern European countries in EU research programmes is portrayed as being highly successful, but we are not given any evidence of this alleged success. Or do we call it a success story when despite the agreements entered into under the Nuclear Safety Account for the closure of high‐risk reactors, all of these reactors are still operating? The Commission and the Council have specifically stressed the importance of this agreement on closures, so I find it all the more amazing that the rapporteur has simply ignored this, instead of stepping up pressure on these states. It is simply not acceptable for us to be using EU tax revenues to increase the danger, instead of minimising it!</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur's assumption that building new nuclear reactors increases pressure to close down older ones is spurious. On the contrary, as history has shown, old reactors which should have been scrapped will continue to operate and export power until they blow up in our faces. And what is more, the disposal problem has not been solved in these countries and the risks of proliferation are mounting. We should not be using EU tax revenues to create new markets for EDF. It is generally accepted that it is cheaper to build combined‐cycle gas turbines and to encourage energy efficiency measures.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no evidence that the money spent so far has in any way had the desired effect, and it is high time that the Commission recognised this and changed its policy. So, although Mr van den Broek has already left again, I would like to ask when we can expect a new communication based on the real facts. And I would like to have an answer this evening!</p>

Not a single one of the reactors which are today euphemistically called first generation reactors has been closed to date, although there has been a substantial flow of EU funds to the CEEC and NIS countries and various agreements have been concluded. The aim of all this has been something which I believe everyone in this House wants: to close down these dangerous rust‐heaps known as reactors as soon as possible, or, even better, yesterday!</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Dr Adam for what I am sure was the very difficult task of preparing his report. In it, he says it is necessary to agree energy plans and strategies with the applicant countries, with the other Central and Eastern European countries and with the NIS, with the objective of closing down nuclear reactors ready for the scrap‐heap, ceasing work on unsafe reactors already under construction, and at the same time meeting the energy requirements of these countries, which are at present to a very large extent covered by nuclear energy. In drawing up such a strategy we will of course need to respect the sovereign right of these countries to decide at national level whether or not they wish to continue using nuclear energy. We will also need to involve regional and local authorities in this process as far as possible, and I believe that an energy plan of this kind will pave the way for renewables, making this an important opportunity for these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Although there are to be various transitional arrangements for the applicant countries in the environmental field, there should be no transitional arrangements where nuclear safety is concerned!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Flemming </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, environmental protection measures will only have a significant impact on competitiveness where a company is directly competing with companies in regions where such measures are not in force. If we apply the same principle to the nuclear power sector, this means that it is absolutely essential for nuclear safety standards in the applicant countries to be brought into line with those in the EU. However, if in addition to closing down nuclear power stations, funds are to be made available for upgrading nuclear power stations still operating, these funds should come from the operators themselves, in keeping with the liberalisation of the electricity market and the polluter pays principle. The source of these funds should therefore be the proceeds of electricity sales and not subsidies or EU funds. Otherwise, the market will be distorted to the advantage of nuclear power in applicant countries, which we mostly certainly do not want.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is only logical to demand that EU funds from the PHARE and TACIS programmes intended to improve nuclear safety in eastern Europe should not be used to finance upgrading, but rather that they should be used solely for supporting nuclear regulatory authorities in eastern Europe, for nuclear safeguards and to create a state‐of‐the‐art regulatory regime. I would ask the House to vote for my amendment on this subject, which has already been approved in committee.</p>

Safety requirements mean that some power stations will have to close. The reaction to this is often that new nuclear power stations will be built instead. It is this response that is unacceptable. We cannot export views that we ourselves no longer hold to other countries. And the truth is that the peoples of Europe do not want any new nuclear power stations. Therefore, the most important thing in the Commission's communication is in fact that it emphasises the need to draw up energy plans for the whole energy sector, and not just the electricity sector, with particular emphasis on energy saving, developing alternative sources of energy and using energy efficiently. All too often, we see that the answer to a growing demand for energy is simply more power stations. What is needed is something else, and not least in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Trakatellis </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Madam President, because of the procedure for the accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the partnerships that have been formed with the New Independent States, the European Union has to take initiatives regarding nuclear safety. In these regions, there are 50 plants with obsolete Soviet nuclear reactors which must be decommissioned, simply because they are extremely dangerous. It is well known that the first generation RBMK and VVER 440/230 Soviet reactors are dangerous, since they are unable to withstand accidents. Reactors such as these still exist and still operate in Bulgaria, Lithuania, Slovakia, Armenia and Russia, while those in the former German Democratic Republic have been closed down for good.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the Commission is called upon: firstly, to abide by the agreements to decommission first generation reactors, such as the Kozloduy reactor in Bulgaria, the Ignalina reactor in Lithuania and those in Slovakia; secondly, not to give financial assistance for first generation reactors; and, thirdly, not to grant Euratom loans to modernise later generation reactors, unless a guarantee can be given that agreements to decommission first generation reactors are pushed through, because these are a threat to the people of Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">I think that he fully covered the difficulties which have arisen and which are set out in the report by Mr Adam. I should like in turn to assure you that the Commission will continue its attempts to achieve the maximum level of safety in respect of nuclear reactors. As regards the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, we will of course incorporate the issue of nuclear safety within the framework of bilateral agreements, and above all within the framework of the attempt to prepare these countries for their adoption of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> and subsequently their accession to the European Union. In other words, this will be an important aspect of the pre‐accession strategy for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the efforts of the Commission to decommission nuclear reactors in those cases and in those countries where safety problems have been identified, I wish to assure you that the Commission, regardless of the respective strategies of those countries, is continuing to stand firm on the agreements that have already been concluded with them. For this reason, we are doing our utmost to coordinate the efforts made by EBRD and, of course, by Euratom, to provide the necessary loans for nuclear reactors.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, I wish to tell you that this morning, in Ukraine, a task force was put into operation with exactly this objective in mind, that is, to help the Ukraine Government to move swiftly towards reorganising its energy sector and to meet all the necessary conditions for these loans to be granted. In the other countries, such as Bulgaria, and in other countries with which the Commission is collaborating, we are trying to use all the possibilities at our disposal to help these countries to achieve a complete reorganisation of the energy sector, so as to give them the opportunity to use other energy sources. For this reason, we are attempting to move the banking sector towards helping to support such plans.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like once again to reassure the House that, in line with the principles supported by the European Parliament and restated in the report by Mr Adam, the Commission is continuing its efforts to ensure the safest possible operation of nuclear reactors.</p>
