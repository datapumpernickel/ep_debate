<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schörling (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on the strategy for the future chemicals policy, which we are to discuss and adopt positions on in this debate, is extremely urgent and important because it will form the basis for a draft legislative text and for new framework legislation for the EU’s chemicals policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Gratifyingly enough, the European Council decided, at the Gothenburg Summit in June, that a new chemicals policy would have to be introduced by 2004 at the latest and that this time limit would have to be respected. The Commission must therefore table its draft legislation in the course of 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate on deficiencies in the current chemicals policy has been going on for quite some time. Among the criticisms made is the fact that there has been a lack of information about the majority of the 100 000 existing chemicals, that the work has proceeded far too slowly and that the present policy has, in practice, failed to protect human health and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s survey of the legislation on existing substances shows that human beings and the environment are potentially exposed to a large number of chemical substances whose dangerous characteristics are not known. We know that the human body contains measurable quantities of 350 chemicals. We also know that the quantity of brominated flame retardants in breast milk has been increasing each year.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if PCB and DDT are now surrounded by tough restrictions, it remains the case that high quantities of these chemicals are still found in the fatty tissue of human beings and animals throughout the world, even in the Polar regions where these chemicals have not been produced at all. New chemicals are added to the list, for example PFOS or <span class="italic">perfluorooctane sulfonate</span>, which does not bind in fatty tissue but, rather, in blood protein. These chemicals are found in a number of products, for example shampoo.</p>
<p class="contents">Through the regulation adopted by the Council in order to overcome the deficiencies, detailed risk assessments should be carried out and recommendations made as to measures, etc. which might be taken. We now know that there are only 140 chemicals on the ‘priority list’ and that risk assessments have been completed in only eleven cases. Even worse is the fact that not a single measure has been decided upon in order to reduce the risks, in spite of its having been shown that such measures are needed for the majority of these substances.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s White Paper, produced by the Environment and Enterprise Directorates-General, is trying to create a high degree of health and environmental protection, at the same time as maintaining the competitiveness of the European chemicals industry. This is done, for example, by saying that chemicals policy must stimulate technical innovation and the development of safer chemicals. In common with the majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I believe that the strategy should be focused on the protection of the environment and of human health and that the point of departure for the Commission’s White Paper should be the debate in the Council and the growing unease about the fact that current chemicals policy cannot offer adequate protection of the environment and of human health. Naturally, the economic and social aspects must be accorded a fair degree of importance as parts of a strategy for sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">If a majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy voted for a proposal that goes further than the Commission’s and shows how an effective, open and consumer-friendly control of chemicals should look in the future, that is completely in line with, and receives strong political support from, the European Council Summit in June when the conclusions drawn by the 15 Member States were significantly stricter and more far-reaching than the Commission’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">There is therefore an express political will to adopt the policy for a new chemicals strategy proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, above all when it comes to the scope of the REACH system. As currently desired by the industry and the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats, only CMR 1 and 2 and POPs are to be included which, in that case, cannot be said to be much in the way of a strategy for the future. Even among industrial companies there is a desire to go further, for a competitive industry cannot be achieved through the unacceptable situation we have at present but only by producing safer chemicals and chemicals that protect human health and the environment. I therefore believe that we should stick to the compromise achieved between the various political groups and to the proposal backed by the majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Harmonisation of chemicals policy across the EU is especially important, but the following three aspects are no less significant. First, the practicability of the registration system. The amount of data to be collected means we must keep a sense of proportion in order that the system is not congested from the start. The principle of proportionality is also to be applied to the required definition of use, so that the manufacturer of a product must be able to restrict the definition to actually intended purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a clear definition of the substitution principle. The definition of this principle varies from one Member State to another, if they have one at all. If it is to be laid down in Community law, it will have to be formulated in a consistent and unambiguous way.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, appropriate protection for test data. Insufficient account is taken of the need to guard commercial confidentiality. At the same time, the security data document should be under copyright in order to protect the applicant against misuse of the data obtained. Mrs Schörling's report is to that extent unbalanced. It takes too little account of the interests of medium-sized chemical businesses and of the industry as a whole, something that can lead to distortions in competition. I therefore recommend adoption of the amendments resulting from the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which contribute to a better balance of the interests of all interested parties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is fundamentally right to unite, in legal terms, old and new materials and combine them with standardised registration and evaluation procedures for all materials over one tonne per annum in a strict time concept by 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">This fundamental line taken by the White Paper strengthens sole responsibility for chemicals management in the industry and takes past experience with individual items of legislation as the basis for proposing a comprehensive reorientation. Parliament's Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has adopted this report by a large majority. The consequences of the White Paper's proposals for competitiveness, international trade, employment and medium-sized businesses had not previously been sufficiently examined, and further studies are still required.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy expressed the view that legislation should be made to apply not to the attributes of materials but only to actual, scientifically verifiable risks. Amounts are merely auxiliary quantities. What is crucial is the amount of risk involved. The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy therefore demands a two-stage screening process.</p>
<p class="contents">We expressly reject the following suggestions made by the rapporteur of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy: that sensitising substances be included in the approval procedure; that approval be granted only for a limited period; that the registration requirement should apply to all amounts under one tonne; that the public be given unrestricted access to all data; that there should be extensive prohibitions on materials; that extensive data and evaluations to be submitted by the industry should be subject to additional examination by peer review; and a number of other points.</p>
<p class="contents">A massive extension of the approval procedure would run quite counter to our common goal of reducing animal experiments. The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy therefore takes a rational line, as demanded by both trades unions and employers in the European chemical industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To a large extent, we could not manage in our society without them. For example, we use cleaning materials, cosmetics, plastics, medicines and much more besides, almost without thinking about it. It is though, equally self-evident that we must know what effects the use of these substances and products has on our health and our environment, and so we need a practical and flexible system to monitor and evaluate existing substances and those materials that may be created in the future. The Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats takes the view that the White Paper must do away with the inadequacy of European chemical policy and give first priority to protecting human beings and the environment, as well as to sustainable development, without thereby jeopardising the competitiveness of the chemical industry and of SME's in the global market.</p>
<p class="contents">The chemical industry is the third largest processing industry in Europe, and, according to the Commission's figures, provides 4.7 million jobs in almost 40 000 firms, most of them small and medium-sized enterprises. With this report, we are deciding on their future. The Schörling report clearly focuses on the ecological dimension, and there are grounds for concern that the excessive demands, on the authorities as well, will paralyse the whole system and condemn it to failure from the outset.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats therefore cannot go along with the obligatory registration of materials of which less than one tonne is produced per annum; the extension of the approval procedure; the substitution and prohibition of substances only on the grounds of their characteristics; an additional peer review process; impracticable duties of notification and databases. It is our opinion that only a balanced system can ensure the production of high-value products within the European Union, the safeguarding of jobs in it, and the improved protection of people and the environment.</p>

It is long overdue. For too long we have seen a gradual increase in allergenic reactions and even worse human health effects and at the same time a series of undesirable effects on the general environment. If we adopt this report, we will be taking a first step towards asking a very important question: whether the 30 000 chemicals in general use today and the 100 000 components that they are used to make are in any way responsible for the things we see happening to human health and the world around us. There is no doubt that we will have to make a very wide-ranging examination of the chemicals in use today and those that we might want to introduce into our environment in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We will have to start considering issues and areas that we have not previously considered. Socio-economic issues will be particularly important. The full effects of changing our chemicals policy and strategy will be wide-ranging across the whole of Europe. However, one would hope that, by taking a serious step forward tonight and starting to formulate a new structure for chemicals policy, we will arrive at a policy which is truly sustainable in the long term; which brings genuine and positive benefits to society as a whole; ends any negative impacts upon human health in the environment and stands as a shining example to other parts of the world as to how they should progress in future. So tonight we are taking a step not just towards a cleaner and better European environment and a stronger and more prosperous chemical industry in Europe but also towards a healthier and better future for the whole world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It all seemed very easy when the Commissioner first put the plan to us. She said that we use tens of thousands of chemicals in Europe. They are essential to our way of life but there is very little public information about them and the real fear is that some of them may be causing long-term damage to the environment and human health. So we must get the information, we must carry out the tests and, while keeping the good and maintaining a strong European chemicals industry, we must identify the bad and weed them out.</p>
<p class="contents">But that was a few months ago. In the meantime all of us have learnt a great deal from the lobbyists about the difficulties of putting the policy into practice, as is well illustrated by the difficulty of identifying even the number of chemicals we are talking about. Sometimes we hear of 30 000, sometimes of 100 000 – quite a big difference.</p>
<p class="contents">At least the chemical industry says it is in favour and supports the Commission's objectives, but it warns that the proposals are impractical, will increase bureaucracy and will be immensely costly. The testing regime, it says, will cause paralysis of the whole system, especially if we extend the requirements. Millions of animals will be killed painfully and perhaps unnecessarily in order to meet the testing requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">All these concerns need to be taken into account. When the draft directive comes before us, I will be listening very carefully to industry's complaints. I recognise that in environmental matters we often hear industry crying wolf, but even so we must ensure that new requirements placed upon the companies are realistic and practical and that they enhance rather than damage a very important business.</p>
<p class="contents">This is only a White Paper. In making recommendations, I support Mrs Schörling in asking the Commission to strengthen its environmental commitments, rather than relax them. But in reality we will probably end up following the Council of Ministers in passing the buck back to the Commission, asking you to find a way around the obstacle course and giving an absolute guarantee that we will criticise you, whatever proposals you come up with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Hundreds of thousands of chemicals have been on the market for decades and we do not know in what quantities they are available and what risks they present. It is as if the precautionary principle was trodden underfoot; these chemicals were, without controls, tested on us and on the environment. Amounts totalling under 1 000 tonnes per annum are not even notifiable, regardless of the dangers involved.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, then, for decades been playing Russian roulette with our health and with the environment. We must put an end to this frightening, indeed irresponsible, situation as soon as possible. If the industry does not put the data on the table within a specified period of time, these chemicals will no longer be allowed to be put on the market. I hope the majority in this House will not allow itself to be made the lackey of the chemical industry, for the aggressive advertising of the German chemical industry in accusatory mode has clearly shown it to be too helpless and incapable of presenting valid arguments at a political level. Complaints about shop closures, raised even by Members of this House, are a positive joke in view of the way the chemical industry, while increasing production in real terms by 25% over the past ten years, brought about a reduction of 14% in its workforce – without a chemical policy along the lines proposed by the White Paper, and we know all too well that the chemical industry only has the chance to offer long-term employment if it offers for sale products that do not harm the environment. Only then can the chemical industry's position be strengthened. We will fight for the new chemical policy as the central point of European policy on the environment. I believe this is about putting an end to decades of the 'ostrich with its head in the sand' policy and implementing a chemical policy which is effective and has a future, a policy which puts health interests and the precautionary principle in first place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Schörling’s report from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which we are now discussing, provides an excellent point of departure for a new chemicals policy. With this report as a basis, the Commission should quickly be able to table proposals for a new directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The strength of the report is that it really puts the environment and public health first, and that must be our main task. We also believe that industry has a lot to gain from strict regulations in as much as they encourage modern manufacturers, promote innovation and mean that old chemicals that have not been investigated are no longer promoted, as they are in fact at present.</p>
<p class="contents">The following points in the report are especially important to our group. Firstly, the proposal as to which chemicals are to be included under the requirements for registration, evaluation and authorisation should be made more comprehensive, as proposed. Secondly, tough requirements should be made of chemicals, and of products containing chemicals, when these are imported. Thirdly, everything must be done to minimise the number of animal experiments. Fourthly, the substitution principle should be made a crucial component of chemicals policy. Great importance should be attached to this so that safer alternatives will always be sought. Fifthly, use of the most hazardous chemicals of all should be considerably restricted.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group is pleased with the committee’s proposals. We nonetheless have some minor amendments we believe could further strengthen the report. We wish to emphasise the demand that it should be those departments of the Commission with responsibility for environmental protection that should approve new chemicals. It is also a question of further tightening up the requirements made of the most hazardous chemicals of all.</p>
<p class="contents">In the committee, the rapporteur chose a very sound and open method of working which gave all the political groups the opportunity to compromise at an early stage, and I think that that is something positive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we should take care, in our enthusiasm, not to bite off more than we can chew. Of course, I too would welcome a complete overhaul, but in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the Commission has already warned that if the chemical substances policy is overloaded, the ship will sink. That seems to me reason enough to remove some of the cargo from the ship. In concrete terms, I mean that the substances below one tonne should remain outside the scope of the new policy for the time being. Furthermore, the ship is reeling from side to side, swaying from a stringent policy on the one hand to the wish to take generous account of social and economic effects on the other. This half-heartedness can be avoided by prioritising the most harmful substances. In that way, the benefits for the environment and public health will be the greatest, and the social and economic effects on industry will automatically be contained. We therefore no longer need to pull the wool over the eyes of industry by positing that the new policy will improve innovation and businesses’ competitive edge.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am of the opinion that the generally recognised criteria for harmfulness, namely dosage and use, need to be maintained. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I am struggling with the White Paper and also with Mrs Schörling’s report, because I believe that the White Paper is not effective on a number of scores. Although Mrs Schörling has worked hard, she too is complicating matters. Let me therefore give a few examples of a system which, in my view, <span class="italic">could</span> function. I know that the Commissioner too has been informed by the Dutch government about where industry initially refused point blank to adopt the new system entitled SOMS. However, industry and the government are now very happy with this system. Allow me to give you a few examples and in doing so, expose a few weaknesses in the White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the industry’s responsibility. Lip service is being paid to this, for the White Paper is limited to risk assessment data and to providing information to downstream users. Responsibility should really be placed with industry, and that means, therefore, that it must also be able to take risk-restricting measures off its own bat. The entire system proposed by you, including heavy-handed interference from the powers that be, has proven that it does not work. That is why a change is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the reach system should be modified. In any case, a possibility for rapid screening must be introduced. Rapid screening can also be done on the basis of a harmfulness profile, for the tonnage is not a determining factor. My fellow MEPs and I have tried to include these provisions in amendments, and I hope that at least Amendments Nos 102 and 103 will be adopted accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are concerned here with the health of all of us, as well as with that of future generations. The Commission’s White Paper is a good point of departure for continued work on the strategy. Mrs Schörling’s report creates good conditions for bringing about necessary changes. It is exceptionally important that Parliament adopt the report in such a form that it have the same thrust given to it by the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">In the debate that took place while the report was coming to fruition, many objections expressed the fear that stricter regulations would put jobs and economic development at risk. That is an anxiety which must, of course, be taken entirely seriously but, at the same time, it is necessary to raise one’s sights and look beyond jobs and the economy. Economic growth and access to jobs can never be invoked to prevent necessary requirements concerning the use of chemicals, work on achieving sustainable development and a high level of protection of public health and of employees. What is the use of jobs and a sound economy if we poison our countryside and destroy what is essential for future generations? We have only one earth and we must take care of it. We often say that we have the earth on loan from our children. If we are to be able to hand it over in good condition, it is high time that we modified our way of life.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in a number of capacities that, as human beings, we are affected by the ways in which chemicals are used. We are affected as employees and as consumers, and we are affected by persistent and bioaccumulative substances which can give rise to hypersensitivity, hormone changes, cancer etc.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulations which now have to be devised must, in the first place, be aimed at protecting individual people and not, as now, companies’ interest in making profits. A society characterised by sustainable development also provides lasting employment, a sustainable living environment and people able to have faith in the future. In that way, a better world can be created. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The one we have at present is unsatisfactory. There had been advance indications that there would be a vast array of tests, but the overall test result is unsatisfactory. The Commission's principled involvement is therefore to be welcomed even if we cannot support every aspect of its proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, though, something of which I must warn you. You, too, Commissioner, are on my mind today in particular. When you introduced yourself to us, you announced that the experience of your own country led you to want to establish a new policy on chemicals in Europe. My impression is that today, like Goethe's Faust, you have conjured up something you cannot control. What the rapporteur, Mrs Schörling, has presented is not a proposal about environmental policy. It is a classic export of pollution, as many enterprises that are already being marginalised by the European Union will move themselves very quickly even nearer to its boundary and indeed also outside the EU in order to save themselves these unimaginable impositions. This cannot be a modern environmental policy. Rather, we must take this branch of industry with us in integrating high but feasible standards.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the aspects already mentioned – temporary approval, obligatory regulation under 1000 kilos, the principle of substitution and regulation of use as well – are an attempt at multiple protection, for every owner of a medium-sized business is being enslaved, because only industry can now meet the obligations which your proposal envisages. I believe that this proposal should be sent back to the Commission, but certainly not to the rapporteur, whom I otherwise greatly respect and who, on this occasion, has thoroughly disappointed me. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is about a White Paper, and I believe we should not be trying to engage in muscle contests, which are in one way or another politically motivated, on the basis of this White Paper. At some future point we will be having the legislation, when we can do the real fine-tuning.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a pity that some of the earlier speakers are no longer here; they will not hear what I have to say. But perhaps someone will be able to tell them.</p>
<p class="contents">We have submitted amendments with the very same things in mind, which state that the duplication of work is to be avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 97 is to remove peer review in order to simplify the procedure. We have already in committee brought in submissions on behalf of medium-sized businesses to the effect that there should be pilot projects, in which medium-sized businesses could deal with registration simply and effectively. We want simple administrative regulations and have provided for the employees, who will be directly affected – the employees and the members of the European works councils – to be involved in the decision-making process. These demands have been met, and I do not know why this all has to be played up and why the fate of the chemical industry has to be dependent on it. We are dealing here with a White Paper, in which nothing is finally decided. I cannot understand it.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also included a subparagraph relating to substitution principle, which states that substitutes, too, have to be subjected to complete life cycle analysis before they can be used. So if we do not accept that and say, ‘that is the way to do it’ then I do not know what we are supposed to do next.</p>
<p class="contents">And this one tonne: I simply cannot understand the argument that substances under one tonne are intrinsically less dangerous than substances over one tonne. Even they should be registered.</p>

Mr Lange, I know we are talking about a White Paper, but this White Paper sketches a mere initial outline<span class="bold"> </span>of our views, and when we in the PPE-DE express our opinions, we like our subsequent actions to be consistent with them. It is no good saying one thing now and then doing the opposite when the time comes to legislate. Let this be clear: this is a major sector of industry, the leading sector or one of the leading sectors in Europe. This sector employs millions of people and includes tens of thousands of small businesses. However, it is also a sector that is causing concern in society because there are 100 000 unknown chemicals being used, and it is therefore right that we should respond to this concern. That is why we consider the Commission’s proposal and the White Paper to be a good starting point, in that it gives us a procedure, a goal and targets to achieve. We welcome the industry’s willingness to bear the cost of this operation of sifting the good chemicals from the bad and providing information.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what we do not support is the unnecessary expansion, the complicated procedures of expansion, the extension to too vast a range of substances, the use of scientific grounds which are too vague as the basis for forming opinions, which is what the Schörling report advocates. This, ladies and gentlemen, not only harms the chemical industry but also jeopardises the environmental objective we have set ourselves. As the Romans used to say, ‘The best is the enemy of the good’. Let us steer clear of such at times populist, at times fundamentalist attitudes, for our shared, common objective of protecting health and the environment in a sustainable economy against precisely an excess of, so to speak, overexhaustive initiatives, is in jeopardy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In reality, we are aware of the effects upon the environment and public health of only a very small proportion of the hundred thousand chemicals that exist. I think it is a serious problem for the EU’s environmental and public health policies that a combined strategy for chemicals policy was not implemented many years ago. Now, however, it has arrived as something I very much welcome. I should also like to thank Mrs Schörling for an outstanding report which tightens up the Commission’s proposal in some crucial ways, ways which, in my opinion, could well be adopted without changes. That is not, however, going to happen. The industry, and others, have also made their influence felt here in Parliament, and the result we shall adopt tomorrow will not be quite as good as it might have been.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out some of the substantial improvements contributed by Parliament. We are having a very great deal of emphasis placed upon the precautionary and substitution principles. This constitutes a reversal of the burden of proof. With what is also the Commission’s point of departure, we are now acquiring a stricter system – with, importantly in my view, some clear deadlines – for regulating, phasing out and authorising chemicals. It is also important that we should have an extended list of hazardous substances that are to be phased out. Finally, I should also like to highlight the issue of animal experiments. I think that, in this area, a very important contribution has been made, including by the Liberals, to getting the issue of restricting animal experiments onto the agenda. That is something I am very pleased to be able to support, including in the vote tomorrow. There are many substantial advances which ought to be included in the forthcoming legislation, and I shall therefore merely ask the Commissioner, finally, when the Commission’s proposal for joint legislation is to be tabled? I understood it was to have been early next year, but it would be splendid if we could have a fairly clear date made known in this House today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament is thereby making a major contribution, applying the approach of sustainable development in all its inseparable dimensions, environmental, social and economic, to the chemical industry. In this report, protecting the environment and safeguarding human health go hand in hand and it is intended to maintain the competitiveness of the chemical industry through incentives to support innovation and facilitate the gradual replacement of the most hazardous substances. Other improvements can be included tomorrow if we adopt the amendments tabled by Mr Lange and other Members, benefiting smaller business, in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a prevention strategy, then, and not just a strategy of acting in retrospect, when the damage has already been done, but it is also a strict, rigorous strategy. That is why the reference to environmental responsibility must be accorded due importance. This is a principle which must also be recognised as important in those countries in which safeguarding health and safety in the workplace and protecting the environment are not always given due consideration. I refer to the recent decision which failed to condemn the Porto Marghera petrochemical plant and let the directors of Montedison Enimont get off scot-free, even though they were responsible for the death of 157 workers and the disastrous pollution of the Venice<span class="bold"> </span>lagoon<span class="bold"> </span>and the surrounding land, a decision against which the Italian government should appeal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You only have to look around this chamber at the carpets, chairs, desks, paint, steel and glass to see how much we depend on them. However they can also be bad for you. Some insecticides, flame retardants and even hair sprays can be a danger and we need to be wary of them. Chemicals can certainly present a risk if they are mishandled and they can need regulation. Sometimes they need to be phased out or banned.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I fear this report goes too far too fast and so, in some respects, does the White Paper. I know it is only the White Paper stage, but we need to look carefully at some of the potential costs, said to be some EUR 8bn to European industry. A massive cost to animals has been referred to. The BUAV estimates 2 123 animals per high production volume chemical test. We are told that 12.8 million would be at risk if one were testing on 30 000 substances and the report goes up to 100 000. Of course not all those would need animal tests, but a substantial number would.</p>
<p class="contents">One other example of how this report overreacts: paragraph 38 sweeps up all CMR category 3 substances and designates them of very high concern. Just take one example from one industry, the raw materials for flexible foam. The finished product is in no way a hazard and provides comfort and safety for consumers in products from furniture to car dashboards. That is an industry employing 360 000 people, 96% of them in small- and medium-sized firms. They could be at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">The aims of the White Paper are right: we want to improve knowledge about chemicals and we want a safer world. We should prioritise areas for action. That means rigorous management of risk, without damaging unnecessarily the many small- and medium-sized firms that make up the chemical industry which has its risks but also brings jobs, benefits and safety for our citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why support for the White Paper is so important, but even more so, support for the improvements which are being proposed in the Schörling report.</p>
<p class="contents">Pressure from the chemical industry has been enormous, particularly in the last few days. Apparently, it does not lack the necessary financial resources to set up big campaigns and to portray a large majority of this Parliament as a bunch of eco-fundamentalists. But I believe that the outcome of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy was balanced and that it therefore deserves every backing tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention a few essential points. I am of the opinion that, in the long term, all substances will need to be registered, but that in the medium- and short-term, priorities will need to be set; the latter, however, not simply on the basis of production volumes. Smaller volumes too must also be granted sufficient attention, and the starting point should really be the intrinsic characteristics of a substance.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Bernd Lange stated a moment ago, the substitution principle is essential. If a less dangerous substance is available and tested, what logical reasons do we then have not to use it, other than perhaps financial considerations?</p>
<p class="contents">A second essential element is that we must be able to ban substances of high concern, such as persistent and bioaccumulative substances and endocrine disrupters, unless they are essential from a social point of view and no alternatives are available. We should then be able to authorise them under strict licensing.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, maximum consumer information must be provided via clear labelling, but also via publicly accessible databases and information on the substances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the other hand, I also understand how our colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy put a different emphasis on things. That, too, I consider understandable, for otherwise we would not need both committees and could do everything in one. I also take the view that it is only this tension between the various committees that makes it possible for something sensible to emerge at the end of the day.</p>
<p class="contents">I will be quite frank in saying that I have a number of difficulties with the Schörling report. The main one is perhaps that I believe substances should be evaluated not only according to the danger they may present, but also according to their characteristics. In this sense, they are not simply capable of being substituted for each other, at least not all of them. There are substances that are dangerous, but which are useful in certain chemical processes. Secondly, I believe that whether or not a substance is dangerous has to be founded on scientific statements. It must be verifiable. I am always very dubious about suspicions of danger or risk. Being very subjective, these can be understood but not verified.</p>
<p class="contents">The vast number of testers required leads me to ask where they all are. Safety does not increase in line with the amount of hyphenation or the number of regulations, but is increased by actual testing. So we will have to look into that. And one more little observation: which substances are actually necessary to society? How does one ascertain something like that? Who ascertains something like that? I still need some clarification on that point, but I am happy to listen. I would, by the way, like to remind the President that, this evening, we are discussing over EUR 800 billion in turnover, 400 billion of it in energy and 400 billion in chemistry. That is a hell of a lot for two and a half hours.</p>

I really do hope that it will be adopted tomorrow. It is incredibly important that we should take this step towards a new, better and more effective chemicals policy. I want to say a special thank-you to Mrs Schörling, who has put a great deal of work into her role as rapporteur. I also want to thank all those who have taken part in the debate, because it has been an important discussion in which important points of view have emerged.</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper presents the Commission’s proposal for a new chemicals strategy. The modes of procedure presented in the White Paper are well balanced, and I believe they involve a step forwards in the direction of sustainable development. The debate in this House has perhaps shown that we have succeeded reasonably well in finding a balance between different views, even though there is scope for improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">The background is as follows. Chemical production has increased almost explosively, from 1 million tonnes in 1930 to 400 million tonnes per year today. We wish to maintain a high level of protection for the environment and human health, but we also need to try to make use of the advantages presented by chemicals. We all know that there are chemicals in practically all the products we encounter every day. It would be unrealistic to believe that, with a wave of the hand, we could get rid of all chemicals or that there could be a chemical-free modern society. However, we must balance these requirements. Anyone who examined what is now the European Union’s 20 year-old system of supervision would see clearly that it is not effective enough by a long chalk. I would maintain that the system makes, for example, an artificial or arbitrary distinction between old and new chemicals.</p>
<p class="contents">Chemicals have many extremely important advantages for society. Thanks to medicines and pharmaceutical products, it is possible to combat illnesses and suffering. It is probably the case that a majority of the products forming part of our modern life-style today are manufactured from plastic or contain chemicals of some kind. The chemicals industry is one of Europe’s largest manufacturing industries, employing 1.7 million people. Between three and four million jobs depend upon it. Ninety-six per cent of all companies are small and medium-sized, and they account for approximately 23 per cent of chemicals production.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all of us exposed to chemicals on a daily basis. We have tried to look into whether this situation can be described in figures. Calculated, for example, in tonnes, each and every one of us probably comes into contact with several tonnes of chemicals in our daily life. That should also mean that we are exposed to several tens of thousands of chemicals. More and more reports are coming in concerning health problems, allergies and asthma assumed to be connected with chemicals. As has already been mentioned, research results show that the human body can contain at least 350 synthetic chemicals which, in the natural course of things, ought not to be there. There are persistent and bioaccumulative chemicals, and these are now to be found in placentas, foetuses and new-born children, to which they are transferred. These chemicals are the first things a child ingests. Chemicals are found in the depths of the sea and in the Arctic, where they have never once been used. Hormone-changing substances can affect our reproduction and our nervous systems. That is a fact.</p>
<p class="contents">The procedures governing the present EU legislation have been rightly criticised for being too slow and unwieldy. Even though we have made some progress within the EU when it comes to evaluating the risks and restricting and controlling the use of hazardous chemicals, there is still an incredible amount to do. At present, it is the authorities who have to demonstrate that a chemical is unsafe. That obviously has to change. As in the case of all other products, responsibility for ensuring that products released onto the market are safe must lie with producers, manufacturers and users at later stages in the manufacturing chain. That, basically, is what EU legislation will amount to. Can you think of any other product about whose content we do not even have basic information or for which responsibility is entirely assumed by the authorities? That is a basic error in the system. What we now have to do is find a suitable balance between, on the one hand, the chemicals’ advantages and, on the other hand, the unacceptable risks they involve for human health and the environment. At the same time, we naturally want to ensure that the internal market is able to function and that the European chemicals industry, which is the world’s largest, can maintain its competitiveness. In order better to be able to assess the consequences of different ways of implementing the proposals in the White Paper, we have set up an inquiry which will look more closely into the costs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposes that a ‘REACH system’ be set up to cover both existing substances, many of which have been on the market for at least 20 years but have never been properly tested, and new substances released onto the market after 1981. The industry must be given incentives to gather data and, if need be, test the substances, preferably without using animal experiments. We must help one another ensure that animal experiments are restricted. An integrated policy is needed in order to do this. None of us, I trust, would happily see full-scale experiments carried out on living human beings, animals or the countryside involving chemicals whose contents we do not know enough about. There is, in actual fact, no denying that that is what happens at present, because we do not know enough about the chemicals that are released. Pragmatic decisions are required in this area, together with a sensible application of the precautionary principle to chemicals policy. If there are reasons for suspecting that a substance has damaging effects on health or the environment and if our scientific and technical knowledge is not sufficient to provide a clear appreciation of the risks, we must take no chances and restrict or prohibit the use of the substance until such time as we know more.</p>
<p class="contents">The absolute top priority is to fill the gaps in our knowledge of the risks involved in the 30 000 ‘existing substances’ that are produced or imported in quantities greater than that of one tonne per manufacturer per year.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed new system includes a special arrangement for substances that give cause for special concern, or what are known as CMR substances. These are substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction. They must be authorised before they are allowed to be used, and companies must show that they can be used safely on condition that risk management measures are taken. It should then be possible to authorise such safe use with reference to the cost and income analyses supplied by the companies. In this way, the burden of proof will be redistributed, and the risk assessment will be focused on those areas of use for which the companies have sought authorisation. In this way, approximately 1 500 substances, that is to say 5 per cent of all substances, will be covered by this authorisation procedure. The system will promote innovation, and that will lead to the most hazardous substances being replaced.</p>
<p class="contents">I note that, in its draft report, Parliament proposes that several categories of substance be added to the authorisation procedure. I can appreciate its wanting to do that, but I believe that, as matters stand, it would be inappropriate to accord the system too much scope. We must be pragmatic to start with, so that we do not relapse into having an unmanageable system. If we overload the system, a large number of resources will be employed in managing a very small portion of all those substances that need to be investigated. We have limited resources, and we must establish priorities and decide how we are to use our resources in the most effective ways.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s draft report also says that the proposed EU system must cover chemicals produced in quantities of less than one tonne in the form of substances or preparations that occur in products. On the part of the Commission, I want most definitely to recommend a limit of one tonne so that it is possible to use the resources of the industry and of the authorities in the most effective way possible. If we want to get the proposal through, we must concentrate on what is most hazardous. There is no doubt a misunderstanding here. This limit does not apply to the most hazardous substances which, in each and every case, must go through the authorisation procedure. The very fact that the limit is set at one tonne does not mean that chemicals produced in smaller quantities escape monitoring. The industry is still obliged to carry out a risk assessment of the chemicals and to provide safety information to users in the form of marking and Safety Data Sheets. It is the responsibility of the Member States to ensure that these provisions are complied with. The industry must be able, upon request, to supply information to the authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has now set up a number of technical working parties with experts from the Member States, industry, non-governmental organisations and the Commission. The result of their deliberations is expected in February 2002, and it will constitute one of the most important contributions to the draft legislation on the part of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">It is difficult to prophesy when the Commission will be able to table its proposals. If everything goes smoothly, I believe that we can aim for April or May 2002, but the objective is, no matter what, to submit the proposals to Parliament and the Council before the summer of 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to say a few words about the debate which I know is taking place and which is perhaps being conducted most eagerly in Germany and the United Kingdom. What matters is that the European chemicals industry should remain competitive, but we are doing nothing that is not also being done in the United States, Canada and Japan within the framework of the OECD. Roughly the same measures are also being taken by our competitor countries and in the world around us, where precisely the same problems are being experienced as in Europe. If the desire is for the European chemicals industry to hold its own, sustainable development must be worked for. It must be possible to guarantee that what is produced is safe for use in terms of human health and the environment and that it corresponds to the requirements of consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tabled a balanced proposal which takes account of the needs of industry but which also states that what is most important is to bring about a high level of protection for human health and the environment. I think the best answer that can be given is to say that there is no need to be anxious. This proposal will lead to innovation in the chemicals sphere. We can defend our European chemicals industry through the safe use of chemicals in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
