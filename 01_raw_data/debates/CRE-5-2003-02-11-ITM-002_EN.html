<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Terrón i Cusí, and all those who have contributed to this very positive report which we are considering today.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of the proposed directive, we put forward a framework which, once approved, will lead Member States to be open and transparent about their immigration policies. This is very much a step forward. Nowadays, Member States do not know what each other's immigration policy really is. Many of the national immigration policies have in the past been simply conducted by stealth. What the public knows is that those who come in illegally, end up having their situation legalised by Member States in one way or another.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposal is a first step aimed at ending such a pattern. Immigrants must be able to come in legally and be given work permits and a set of rights, if there are jobs - and we are increasingly aware that there are - that cannot be filled by the domestic job market. In this respect, it must be pointed out that such rights do not cover the right to stay unemployed in the European Union. The proposal further helps to streamline cumbersome procedures and to bring about clarity and legal security.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as we clearly stated in our communication on migration policy of November 2000, <span class="italic">we do not intend</span> to decide by directive the number of immigrants that our economies and societies are prepared to absorb. The proposed directive leaves that decision to the Member States who, together with their civil societies and, above all, their local and regional authorities, know how many they are capable of integrating.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore emphasise that, as I have always said, this proposal does not allow one single entry of one single immigrant into the labour market of the European Union. The Commission is certainly not creating a subjective right to immigration. Its aim is simply to harmonise the procedure for admission and it believes such harmonisation is necessary. We simply want Member States to inform each other and the Commission of what is happening so that everybody can learn from each other's experience and find out what the added value of European responses might be. All the more so as we mostly live in a border-free area where decisions affect our neighbours. The European Union must primarily mobilise its existing human resources, including migrant workers currently residing legally in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">More must be done on training, bringing older people and women into the labour market. In this respect, the proposal gives a clear preference to the domestic labour market. There is, therefore, no incompatibility between the fight against unemployment and the proposal. Our unemployed have four weeks in which to show up and take jobs free from the competition of foreign workers. However, given that our unemployed are not always willing or capable, the effect of an ageing population and the related skills gap means that restricting legal migration risks jeopardising our economic health. As I have said before, even if Member States were to face labour market shortages, they would be free to cap the total number of migrants they are ready to admit, if they consider, for instance, that their society is already facing too much of an integration burden.</p>
<p class="contents">Immigration numbers are one of our citizens' priorities, and one of the areas where they clearly expect us to tackle the problem at European level. I hope that this debate and its impact on the Council will allow us to move forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Terrón i Cusí (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, we have said a thousand times in this House that a global European immigration policy must be based, firstly, on the establishment of legal immigration rules and then on strong instruments to ensure that these rules are complied with. We are today discussing a proposed directive which would constitute the cornerstone of this policy, a directive on which the Council, of course, has not made much progress. Parliament should also have given its opinion some time ago, but we always lag behind on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I have chosen this moment to present my report because, for the first time in a long time, the Greek Presidency has included the issue of legal immigration on the political agenda, something which I am glad about.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposed directive is intended to harmonise the conditions for entry and residence for nationals of third countries who intend to enter a Member State for employment reasons. It allows the entry of workers from a third country in the event that the post cannot be filled by a national worker or a worker from another Member State of the Union or by a resident of a third country with the right to access the labour market. The proposal lays down a contract at origin for the immigrant worker, except for those who reside legally within the European Union for other reasons. The residence permit and the work permit would be combined as one single document.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of this directive would involved the recognition of the need for legal channels for immigration and would create a more transparent framework with simpler procedures, which would provide economic actors with more facilities and also reinforce the rights of immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I welcome the Commission’s proposal. I only regret that the Commission, no doubt as a result of realism, has not been able to reflect in this proposed directive some of the ideas it put forward in previous communications, because I sincerely believe that we cannot continue to copy models of immigration control employed during the last century, when the industrial society was at its height, but that we must be able to imagine new procedures suited to our world, to a society and a labour market which operate according to principles which are very different to those of the decades following the war. Some of the measures studied by the Commission, such as mobility, moved in the right direction and reality will oblige us to return to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, this is just an opinion report. I would have preferred to have produced a resolution rather than a package of amendments – which are unlikely to be read or taken into account by those people with real decision-making powers. But for procedural reasons we have had to present a package of amendments and these must reflect two fundamental issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, a strong will and a strong signal in favour of a European immigration policy. We need clear rules which can be complied with. We have therefore rejected the amendments, above all those presented by the PPE-DE Group, which intended to convert the directive into a kind of recommendation which the States could comply with or not. Neither have we accepted the amendments which introduced requirements other than employment and which were difficult to verify. If we accept that the possibility of performing a job of work is what legitimises entry and residence in the Union, we must then ensure that this system works. By requiring that the immigrant has a contract or a firm offer while still in the country of origin, we are thereby regulating access in accordance with the labour market. Even in a situation of unemployment, this would simply become paralysed.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must establish rules which can be complied with, thereby incentivising the arrival of immigrants through regular channels and preventing illegal contracts; preventing immigrant workers from ending up in an illegal situation, for bureaucratic reasons, once in the Union; and discourage, as far as possible, the entry of immigrants without permits. We proposed three things in this regard: that people legally residing in the Union, or who are here legally for any reason or have entered with a residency permit and have lost it, can recover their legal situation and not remain permanently in an irregular situation and that the States can, if they wish, establish a six-month visa for seeking work.</p>
<p class="contents">Other elements we have introduced are the strengthening of equal conditions amongst workers, with a view to preventing all types of discrimination and the creation of a second-class labour market to which both immigrants and native workers would fall victim. We also intend for workers to be given equal rights and obligations, for workers to be allowed to move freely within the Member State – for obvious reasons I do not believe we have to go further – and, in general, to reduce the time periods and bureaucratic obstacles to establishing this immigration policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Like our citizens and their representatives, like the employers and the unions, I hope that we can create clear rules based on the criteria of efficiency and not on ideological problems, which are of little help. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I too am pleased to see that certain amendments that were put forward by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs - but not accepted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs - have been tabled by a variety of the political groups in the House. The majority position of my committee is that we need to simplify and clarify the procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard from a number of reputable companies about the length of time it could take to get work permits for their employees, which pushed some towards using tourist visas to get their employees into the country in order to fulfil contract obligations, and others to lose business. We heard from small- and medium-sized enterprises without departments devoted to human resources as to how complex it can be to find the individual that you want and deal with the paperwork, and how long it can take before that person actually starts work.</p>
<p class="contents">We heard from individuals about what a frustrating and ridiculous process it can be when an application is halted for a minor technical reason and nobody has the responsibility to inform the person concerned of what that reason is. We also heard about the issues of having to return to one's country of origin, at great expense and inconvenience, in order to apply for a new work permit attached to a new job. That was from an employee at UNICE, the employers' federation.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence we support the amendments about tightening up timetables and response times on work permits, about the requirement to inform the applicant of problems in an application and about moving away from the employer having to demonstrate the need, yet again, for a third-country national to fill a job if one becomes vacant within 12 months – although, from some of the horror stories we have heard about the length of time it can take to get permits, perhaps we should extend that even further.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tried to strip away some of the duplication between what the employer has to do and what the state has to do in trying to treat a worker as a responsible adult. We supported the ECOSOC proposal to look at the idea of a job-seeker's permit, which could be of great assistance to small- and medium-sized enterprises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner Vitorino, you are also right to say that, following this directive's entry into force, it will be left to the Member States to decide whether they want immigration, and if so, how much of it. But, by this proposal for a directive, you are putting down a marker to the effect that ‘immigration is a right.’ You, on Thursday, will not be returning to a country in which, at present, 4.6 million people are unemployed. Or, to put the question another way, are there schools in Portugal in which half the children do not understand Portuguese?</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that we need rules on legal immigration, and that we have to control it, but it is also the case that our problems with the economy and education mean that we lack appropriate jobs for our own fellow-citizens. Despite its few tentative good points, the signal you are sending out by means of this directive is the wrong one, and it is being sent at the wrong time. For example, you also intend to grant a third-country national the right to immigrate even if he reveals the existence of a job that has been vacant for four weeks, and you, Mrs Terrón i Cusí, with your three-week period, want to undercut this proposal. This reminds me of a motor race in a James Dean film, in which the contest is to see who will be the last to jump out of a car heading for a precipice. Incidentally, the film's German title translates as ‘They know not what they do’.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite high unemployment in Germany, there are still at present many positions that remain unfilled. One of the reasons for this is that the education system has been run into the ground. What you are now saying is, ‘do not worry about reforming your own country's educational system – we shall just get immigrants to do the jobs.’ – but that cannot be the solution!</p>
<p class="contents">So let me repeat: the proposal is well-intentioned, but it sends the wrong signal, and, by the way, as you know, Commissioner, I take the view that the Convention has to be even bolder. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In presenting it, he is taking a quite specifically systematic approach in generally opening up European labour markets to immigrants, whilst, by way of derogation, giving the Member States the option of taking their own absorption capacity into account and reducing the number of immigrants, right down to zero if need be. This is happening at a time when we have 15 million unemployed in Europe, and when, in my own country, the figure is nearing 5 million. Experts are unanimous in stating that this state of affairs will persist for years, so that we can say without further ado that Europe will not generally need more workers for many years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">They are needed in certain sectors, in certain lines of business, in certain regions and on a temporary basis, but, in principle and in general, there is no need for them. What this means is that, in the event of this directive becoming law, there will be increased pressure on Europe's labour markets, to the detriment of those who are already unemployed, and not least to the detriment of the third-country nationals who are in the European Union legally and who, in any case, are more likely to be unemployed than are EU citizens. You are opening up this possibility if a position cannot be filled within four weeks. Last year in Germany, the average vacancy, in terms of the period of time elapsing between the job being advertised and somebody taking it, was around seventy days. This shows that the four-week period is absurdly short and will, as I have said, put our unemployed under much more pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">The problematic thing about this system is that it involves a legal right, since, if an application is refused, the applicants are to be able to appeal to the national courts. We have already seen, to our horror, what happens when asylum-seekers make appeals of this sort, and so we do not want to repeat the experience with would-be immigrants. The report by the admirable Mrs Terrón i Cusí makes matters dramatically worse, as the majority on the committee went so far as to remove the regulatory element, the national right of control provided for by Commissioner Vitorino, so that all that is left is open access. Moreover, they have the idea that even illegal immigrants should also have the chance to apply for a work permit, which amounts to giving them a prize for getting in illegally, and one cannot sensibly support that either.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has been attempting to digest this draft since as long ago as July 2001. I am quite certain that the Terrón i Cusí report will end up in the Council's great big waste paper basket, and that Commissioner Vitorino, too, will have to make substantial changes to his draft if he wants it to stand a chance of getting the necessary majority.</p>

I very much applaud the principle of having brought this up for debate. It is a major step towards a common European immigration policy. Without legal means, many people resort to dangerous and illegal ways of circumventing frontiers. Without legal migration, we will struggle to meet our target of making Europe the most competitive economy in the world by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">I was saddened by what Mr Nassauer has said. We have to move the debate forward. There are 350 million people in the European Union at the moment and there will soon be 500 million. He has highlighted that 50 million of those may be unemployed, 5 million of them in Germany. However, as Mr Nassauer will know, and as we have heard in the previous debate, it is not as easy as we would like for someone to move from one EU country to another to work. We must do more to facilitate that, certainly, but in the meantime we must also do more to have legal migration, so as to ensure that the vacant positions we have are filled. We have also got to make sure there are safeguards, because in encouraging third country nationals into the EU we must also make certain that we are not depriving those countries of the very important key workers that they need to help them develop. We do not want to take all the doctors and nurses and teachers from developing countries simply because we need them. But then neither, on the other hand, do we want to say to third country nationals: ‘you can come to the EU but the only jobs you can do are the low-level, manual, nasty jobs that we don't want to do’. So we have got to have a properly balanced scheme, with legal migration that respects individuals and respects their position, supporting both third countries and the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The UK may not have chosen to opt into this measure at the moment, but I am contributing to this debate and participating in it as other British Members are because we want to make certain that we have sound legislation laying down sensible provisions, so that the UK will be able to opt into it in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an important and necessary report. The conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purpose of paid employment and self-employed economic activities vary greatly from one Member State to another. Only a few common rules and procedures apply in all the Member States, and this means that there is no legal and administrative tool that can contribute to better management of migration flows. What is proposed would rectify this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Adoption of the directive would lead to common rules being laid down governing the rights and duties of third-country nationals. The directive would also ensure that the existing rules were enforced equitably. What is proposed would give easier access to the labour force, and flexibility and mobility in the European labour market would in that way be increased. At the same time, the directive contains safety clauses worded strongly enough to restrict economic migration.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that adoption of this report would entail some clear benefits. For one thing, procedural clarity and much needed harmonisation of the rules governing this group of third-country nationals would be created within the EU area. Furthermore, what is proposed would increase the legal rights of this group of self-supporting third country nationals who have entered their countries of residence legally. Finally, what is proposed would give the Member States a tool ensuring their ability to respond quickly to changes in the economic and demographic conditions in the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">Contrary to a previous speaker, I hope that the proposal will be well received by the Council with a view to its being adopted quickly. The proposal has been passed around between the institutions for a long time, and it is therefore important that the Council should not place obstacles in the way of this important area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On this subject, it has to be stated that the European Union is still a very weak vessel. We can only regret the hypocrisy of European policies. While all countries see development aid as a means of combating illegal immigration, cooperation budgets are reduced and, with not one bit of responsibility accepted for training, there are no qualms about participating in the brain drain. There is no hesitation in cherry-picking the most promising immigrants, or those who serve our interests. As for the others, the re-admission clauses in the cooperation agreements are used in order all the better to expel those who have no papers but who are already settled in their social and professional lives and participating fully in the construction of Europe. Without a thought for the future of immigrants or their protection or even for the respect of their fundamental rights to health, education and accommodation, the economic and demographic needs of the Member States are satisfied by making use of controlled immigration that is liable to be ruthlessly exploited and manipulated and that mainly serves to make up for the labour shortage and to compensate for the demographic imbalance.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, Mrs Terrón i Cusí is right. The immigration issue must be part of an overall, long-term vision of the EU’s policy as a community. In this context, there is good reason for tackling the issues relating to the management of migration flows. These include essential policy on visas, policy on unifying families – particularly in relation to the rights associated with European citizenship – and the new definition of development aid, implying genuine cooperation. Although one of the Tampere conclusions is about ensuring equitable treatment for third-country nationals, this objective proves to be far from having been achieved when closer attention is given not only to the conditions of entry and residence but also to citizens’ rights, particularly freedom of movement, the right to live as part of a family and those rights that should be linked to residence rather than nationality.</p>
<p class="contents">If European legislation enables workers from third countries to be turned into cheap labour or a kind of cannon fodder on the field of insecure employment, the European Union will lose all the credibility that it has built up over many years through its programmes to combat forms of discrimination, programmes that it is duty-bound to defend on the basis of its ideals of justice and freedom. Everyone knows that a citizens’ Europe cannot be built upon forms of discrimination that give rise to injustice and exclusion and that engender racism. It is therefore our responsibility to work for a humanitarian and Community-based policy on immigration, and one that respects fundamental rights and reaffirms immigration as an opportunity for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It presents an initial huge problem: what exactly is the point of it?</p>
<p class="contents">The explanatory memorandum gives three reasons for it. First of all, current rules relating to the admission of third-country workers apparently differ from one Member State to another. Where, however, is the difficulty? Rather, it is good and in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity that each state should be able to adapt the rules for accepting foreign workers on the basis of its social needs and its labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason cited by the explanatory memorandum is that job seekers and employers apparently come up against national administrative procedures that are sometimes, we are told, very complex. Here again, however, this is a problem for the Member States and one in which the EU authorities should not interfere.</p>
<p class="contents">The third reason cited is that the regulations governing the immigration of third-country workers is apparently a cornerstone of general immigration policy. That proves nothing, for the Treaty of Amsterdam has not turned immigration in general into an EU matter. What is more, Commissioner, it is, rather, the fight against illegal immigration and not the granting of work permits that, in my opinion, is the cornerstone.</p>
<p class="contents">All things considered, such Community harmonisation of work permits is not justified. It would serve only to open immigration policy up a little more at a time when we already have too many unemployed. For example, I would cite this surprising provision in Article 29, paragraph 4 of the proposal, specifying that a refusal by a Member State to grant a work permit to a third-country national should contain – and I quote – ‘a statement of reasons based upon objective and verifiable criteria’. I believe that the granting of work permits to third-country nationals is a regalian right and that the Member States should not be hampered in this area, especially in the current economic situation in which they need to safeguard their basic interests. Moreover, this proposal for a directive would lay the foundations for still greater centralisation in the future. Our Assembly’s Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has understood this so well that it is falling over itself to propose removing other powers from the Member States, for example the right to break off issuing permits for reasons connected with there being insufficient capacity to receive immigrants. It can be seen where all that would lead us if this directive were to be adopted. So overtly, however, does it violate the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, with which we are deluded every day, that someone in the Council will, I hope, be able to stop it in its tracks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also take a favourable view of much of the detailed proposals, such as the – obvious – possibility of limitation by the Member States, which would make it possible to stipulate how many of which types of workers should be allowed to enter the European Union, or the deportation of offenders, the proof of financial resources and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a lot of good things in the proposal, but we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have two basic problems with it. In our view, the proposal exceeds, firstly, the legislative competence of the European Union. Whilst the Treaty establishing the European Communities provides specific rules on immigration, the attempt is made here to lay down a general rule of the European Union. We want the principal competence to remain where it is – with the Member States – and we want the European Union to make rules on matters within its remit, specifically on what provision – such as working visas and appropriate controls – is to be made for the entry of third-country nationals into the European Union, and on what rules should then apply to their freedom of movement within it. That is the present situation, and that is the way it should stay.</p>
<p class="contents">The approach contained in the Commission proposal is equally ill-chosen, as it is based on the assumption that immigration is generally necessary. It is, however, an established fact that the situation varies in every respect from one Member State to another, both as regards the qualifications needed by workers who want to enter the country and the extent to which immigration is needed. From that assumption you deduce that immigration is a right, and an actionable one at that. Such a thing exists nowhere on earth, and we do not want to have it in future either. And when this proposal is developed by the addition of proposals originating in the committee, the report goes so far that we cannot vote in favour of it. Where entry into the EU is concerned, we want framework principles; what we do not want, though, is a general rule that largely pushes back the competence of the Member States! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I come from a country – Spain – from which, until a few years ago, many citizens emigrated in search of work and today we are a country into which, thanks to our growth and stability, we receive many immigrants in search of work, often honourable work, who undoubtedly make a positive contribution to our companies and who often carry out work which our citizens reject.</p>
<p class="contents">The current reality, with migratory flows which are speeding up all the time, is reflected every day in the Spanish press. We see thousands of Moroccans and Sub-Saharan Africans arriving on our territory looking for work.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this reality, which is not confined to Spain, we must look for a way to control and regulate the situation, in order to prevent the growing networks trafficking in immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against illegal immigration requires the regulation of legal immigration. If there are employment opportunities but we do not allow the legal entry of immigrants, we will be promoting illegal immigration, and with it work which is often sub-human, dishonest and sometimes even verging on extortion.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the Commission’s proposal since it promotes a coordinated economic migration policy. However, as other rapporteurs from my group have said, we must maintain the Member States’ competence to regulate how many immigrants they can receive to cover the work possibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be prudent. The admission of immigrants into our labour market may become a problem in the future when the situations of each of our countries change and our labour markets have higher unemployment rates than the current ones.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot provide direct access to the labour market for illegal immigrants, particularly those who entered legally, but who are now in our territory illegally, people desperate to find work. This would undoubtedly lead to exploitation by many employers and the extortion I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">We must improve all the possible mechanisms for the employment of immigrants from their countries of origin. We must give employers the opportunity to employ these immigrants so that the relationship between the immigrants in the State of origin and the employers is as fluid as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the reason why immigration is so necessary. It is also evident that any such immigration has to be managed in the best way available in order to meet the needs of the labour market at the same time as those of the population and also of the immigrants themselves. On that we all agree. It is also self-evident that there are economic areas in which we will need workers and others in which we will not. We agree on that as well. It is equally clear that we cannot allow, and do not want, our own workers at home to have to face competition. Thus far, we are all of one mind.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may consider Mrs Terrón i Cusí's report, let me observe that we can be grateful to her for having been so bold as to endorse the Commission proposal and making a contribution to our eventual shaping of the uniform provisions as regards immigration and the European labour market. Her having done that makes it a matter of course that some will end up having problems with her proposals, just as they do with the Commission's. On the other hand, though, Mr Nassauer, I do not see why either this report or the directive from the Commission should be destined for the dustbin. Why does the Treaty on the European Communities have to be treated as if it were holy writ? And why do we, European politicians that we are, who want the competences in all other areas of European policy to be laid down in Brussels, suddenly have colossal problems because the labour market is involved and want to have everything organised at national level? I think this is where we could take a long view, a rather more generous approach, and demonstrate more willingness. Things that do not fit in today's thinking could perhaps be European policy in five years' time. It is for this reason that I can well imagine that we could adopt a much more generous approach in this area.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Coelho (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the context of an increasingly global labour market, the European Union has been the target of constant migratory pressure, which must be properly managed. I agree with the need to draw up a new common immigration policy, but this policy must always take account of the real needs of the labour market and of the economy itself in each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason we can only adopt the report that Mrs Terrón i Cusí has presented if the amendments retabled by the PPE-DE Group are accepted. I wish to highlight two points: firstly, this proposal for a directive seeks to establish a common legal framework for conditions of admission and residence of immigrants for the purpose of employment. Consequently, on the basis of this directive, immigration for the purpose of employment in the European Union will be permitted if certain conditions are met.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, however, the power of Member States’ to regulate, through their governments, whether or not to open up their labour markets cannot and must not be taken away from them. In other words, this is a decision that can only be taken by Member States themselves and not at Community level. It is the responsibility of each Member State to assess and decide whether or not it needs to increase its labour force, by how much and in what sectors, taking account of their real needs as well as – and I think we all agree on this – their ability to receive and integrate third-country nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Terrón i Cusí report criticises the fact that the Commission’s initial proposal only addresses the situation of individuals who are legally present on Union territory. It also claims that illegal workers should also have the right to request a residence permit, which should be granted to them. Regardless of the rapporteur’s generous approach, this would clearly encourage an increase in illegal immigration, basically saying to these people that once they are on Union territory, even if they have entered illegally, they will have the right to be legalised.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, as in other areas of human immigration, we must always be prudent. This is not simply a matter of protecting Member State nationals. In these areas, excessively generous solutions create more problems than they are intended to resolve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I come from a country that, tragically, has a history of mass emigration over hundreds of years. In view of our history, I am perhaps a little more liberal in my thinking about these particular issues. My colleagues from Spain and Portugal have also referred to this.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with my group that the main competence needs to remain with the individual Member States, not because I want to suggest that we keep immigrants out of the country, but so that we can begin seriously to address the chaotic situation that exists in many of our countries regarding the processing and acceptance of immigrants. It is a serious problem in a small country such as my own.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of those arriving in certain Member States - and indeed in my own - are being treated extremely badly, particularly by employers who are not themselves subject to the kind of controls that are applied to apparently legal immigrants into the country. These immigrants are under-paid; they are often housed in disgraceful conditions. In many cases, it is as if animals rather than human beings were being brought into the country.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to accept that Member States know their own situation best. We also have a situation where, with the rise of unemployment, many of those who have been brought to Ireland as legal workers are being let go simply because it is no longer convenient for employers to have them. While I agree with many of the points made by the Commissioner, we have to be realistic about these matters. The issue is not about keeping people out, but making sure that, having come in, they are treated with the dignity they deserve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that we are going to do so by means of the open coordination method in a future report.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as a personal statement, I would like say to Mr Nassauer and Mr Coelho that no part of my report promotes illegal immigration or allows a work permit in the European Union to be granted to people who enter illegally. I am talking about people whose illegal status has come about for bureaucratic reasons and who have not been expelled and who once again fulfil the admission criteria. I believe that this is far from promoting illegal immigration. My report in no way provides for the possibility of entering illegally and seeking work.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Nassauer, I regret that it pleases you that what may be a majority opinion in this House should be thrown out. I hope that the participants in the Convention take a different view and that in the future the majority opinions of this House are taken into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I recognise this is a difficult debate. To be frank, Mr Nassauer and I have been discussing these issues for a very long time, and we all know that there is no magic solution to this very complex problem of immigration. I accept the criticisms, I can even admit that I can be wrong. However, what I find difficult to accept is being criticised for things that I have never said and that are not written in my proposal. I have never said that there is a right to immigration. There is no right to immigration. I will repeat it hundreds of times: there is a right to asylum, but there is no right to immigration. Immigration is only a possibility. Our proposal states that very clearly. The decision on admission is exclusively that of the government of each Member State or even of the regional or local authorities of the Member States - Brussels does not decide on one single entry.</p>
<p class="contents">I recognise that the link between migration and unemployment is very complex. Evidence shows that migrants might affect and disrupt the internal labour market. The first victims of new waves of migrants, as far as the functioning of our Member States' labour market is concerned, are previous waves of migrants, because there is direct competition between newcomers and the earlier migrants. That is a source of concern, because the existing migrants will be a burden for the social welfare state.</p>
<p class="contents">Is there a direct link between the arrival of migrants and the re-entry into the labour market of our own European citizens? There the connection is much more complex, because in certain cases the difficulty of re-entering the labour market is more connected with the specific characteristics of the welfare state and social security systems that benefit our own citizens. It is unfair to say that migration policies are the reason why European Union citizens have difficulty re-entering the labour market. In fact, it is the lack of reform of the welfare state that is responsible for the difficulty of encouraging people to re-enter the labour market. Of course, that lack of reform varies from one Member State to another. I do not want to harmonise anything with regard to reform of the welfare state.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the report is concerned, the Commission welcomes and fully agrees with Amendments 6, 11, 8 and 12, but we cannot make any commitment today on those amendments concerning rules on intra-corporate transfers and contractual service suppliers. Those rules are very interesting and we will bear them in mind. However, they are closely linked to international trade issues and we have to wait for the ongoing World Trade Organisation negotiations to see what the impact of those negotiations will be on migration policy, above all as far as services are concerned. I would urge you to keep the reference to the EURES system before being able to recruit third-country workers, because keeping that system will guarantee the principle of preference for the European labour market. That is a fundamental principle in our proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to seeing Parliament's amendments and thank you for this very interesting and stimulating debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
