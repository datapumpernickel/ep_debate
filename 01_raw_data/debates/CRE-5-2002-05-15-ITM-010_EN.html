<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamassoure (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is a first. Never, since the Treaty of Rome, have either the governments or the European institutions thought it useful to reconsider the division of roles within the Union. The report which you are considering today is the result of a real joint effort which goes far beyond the rapporteur himself or the opinion of any political group. It is the culmination of fifteen months of work. The draft adopted by your Committee on Constitutional Affairs has taken on board the principal proposals of the Committee of the Regions and the four committees consulted, plus one hundred and seventy amendments originating from thirty different authors belonging to all groups.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not attempted to re-write the Treaties, but rather to lay down guidelines for such a re-write, which is necessary. We have done this on the basis of several important policy options.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we found that the text of the Treaties was drafted by diplomats for their own use, rather like a car being built by mechanics for mechanics only. Our first objective is therefore to bring the text within everybody’s reach, in other words to re-write the Treaties in the spirit of a clearer, shorter and more coherent constitution. Those paragraphs of the Treaties not included in the Constitution would remain applicable but would no longer form part of primary legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a general framework of competences would be constructed around three categories. First, competence is in principle devolved to the Member States. We are not proposing a list of competences exclusive to the Member States. The fact that this principle of Member States’ competence is not expressly mentioned in the Constitution seems to us to reinforce it. Second, the Union has its own competences. In those areas, it can act alone, as in the case of customs or currency, or it may have primary responsibility, as in the case of the internal market, competition or cohesion policies. Third, and finally, there are shared competences. This will be by far the longest list. The Constitution will have to specify, in each case, the objective and scope of the Union’s action, by applying the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Essentially, we propose to use the existing division between these headings, but with two important political changes. First of all, a distinction is made between political competence and technical competence. This is what is known as the hierarchy of standards. Finally, and most important, primary responsibility for foreign and defence policy on the one hand and for freedom and security aspects on the other is transferred to the Union. As far as these two essential areas are concerned, ten years of applying the Maastricht Treaty have confirmed both the absolute need for joint action and, unfortunately, the inefficacy of the intergovernmental procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it seems important to safeguard the possibility of adapting this framework without having to resort to the excessively complicated and exceptional procedure of constitutional review. In order to do this, we propose that a mechanism should be retained, such as Article 308, but that it should be made to work in both directions: transferring competence to the Union or returning it to the Member States in the case of issues for which the national dimension has become predominant once more.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, in order to arbitrate in cases of conflicting competences, we propose a solution involving the courts rather than the political bodies. The Court of Justice would be transformed into a Constitutional Court, and an emergency procedure would be introduced, allowing a qualified majority of the Council, the European Parliament or the Commission to bring matters before the Court between the time when a European law is finally adopted and the time when it comes into force.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, and finally, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs spent a long time discussing the problem of the regions and of the other territorial authorities. The compromise text finally adopted invites Member States to make proposals to the Union so as to ensure that their territorial authorities are more involved in the activities of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the timetable for Parliament’s work has been particularly well-chosen, because next week the European Convention will be considering the subject. Our resolution will therefore be the first working document of the Convention on this essential subject, and in fact, if truth be told, the only document. If Parliament gives it a large majority, representing the main political groups and all the different countries, that will give our resolution considerable political authority, and for that I should like to thank you.</p>

Draft constitutions are always politically motivated and include strategic and tactical objectives and considerations as well as aspects of power politics. The Spinelli draft back in 1984 accepted the competences of the EU and the division of labour between the EU and the Member States, just as the Lamassoure report quite rightly does today. And the question of competences is even more important now, especially in the area of the economic constitution and economic legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">If European economic policy is to be a success and the European social model is to subsist, the competence of the Union in the important areas of the internal market in the broadest sense, the four freedoms – namely financial services, competition, customs and monetary policy – must be retained and the report rightly emphasises this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs considers that the division of competences in the report is lacking in democratic legitimacy as far as policy coordination is concerned. We already know from experience with economic policy coordination that competence for coordination needs to rest with the Union if we are to avoid previous shortcomings. It is not just a question of the democratic control which needs to be exercised by the European Parliament here; no, what we are trying to do as far as policy coordination is concerned – especially economic policy coordination – is to move from negative to positive policy coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">Positive policy coordination requires both clear democratic legitimacy and unified implementation. The broad economic guidelines, for example, ought therefore to be set jointly by the Council and the European Parliament, based on a formal proposal from the Commission. This would then serve as an example for other political areas in which coordination should and must be exercised. The authority, indeed the moral obligation, to set up such a far-reaching framework in the interest of economic welfare is provided by the Principles chapter of the EC Treaty, which lists among Union activities the adoption of an economic policy based on the definition of common objectives which can and must achieve, in particular, harmonious, balanced and sustainable development of economic activities, a high level of employment and sustainable, non-inflationary growth, as well as social protection. In keeping with the Lisbon process, I am calling in the strongest possible terms for the European Parliament to come down in favour of policy coordination which deserves to be described as such and which makes it quite clear that policies in the general interest can only succeed if the common interest factor is also visible.</p>

I see that the report proposes that a special report on this matter be drawn up, and I consider this a very good thing, as these questions are not actually adequately dealt with in the report itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to clarify again the position of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, and then perhaps a place might be found for it when this special report is prepared. I consider it most important that we should not be waiting too long for it, as, if these questions are not resolved while we prepare for the new constitution, it will, I think, be very hard for those citizens who identify with the regions and local authorities to accept this constitution as being their own.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that most EU legislation does not only touch on national competences and national law, but has a direct effect on local rights. We see this in the area of public services, we see it in the economy as a whole, we see it when it comes to tendering, and so on and so forth. That is why we need to build in an early warning system. We have put forward two basic suggestions about this. One is that all laws should be developed in line with certain principles that would apply across the board, ranging from the principle of subsidiarity to that of partnership. The other aims to involve regional and local authorities as early as the preparatory stage of legislative processes, that alone being the guarantee that their standpoints will be taken into account with all the others, something which even national representatives will often not have done at the end of the legislative process. My request to the rapporteur is that, in future, we should carry on working on this issue with the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and keep this in mind when we do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is because it is very late and, secondly, because the final of the Champions League is being played and Real Madrid – I am sorry, Mrs Randzio-Plath, Mrs Schroedter – are beating Bayer Leverkusen. Oh, no! Bayer have equalised. No-one is perfect. This is bad news, because I was so happy and now the score is one all.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet this is also a good time to debate this report, because it is extremely important. I would firstly like to pay homage to Mr Lamassoure, who is not only a highly intelligent rapporteur, but also a rapporteur from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, but who, although he has not said so himself, has seen every single article from his original proposal amended. This, in itself, is great proof of his flexibility and political capacity. Look at him, he even seems cheerful. He could have been very angry at all the changes that have been made – but no – he is happy, because, at the end of the day, the Lamassoure report characterises a solid position adopted by Parliament on an enormously difficult and complicated issue, which causes a great deal of conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Mr President, that in addition to Mr Lamassoure’s valour in having drawn up this report, we have achieved something very important, which is to have a Parliament position on this issue, a position which, additionally, brings together what Parliament has been advocating for fifty years, which in my opinion, is very important. In the Lamassoure report, we are defending the competences allocated to the EU. The rapporteur states this very clearly. We have decided that the European Union must enjoy only the competences allocated to it by the Treaties and no others, which means that we are against this idea of a catalogue of competences, which would only serve to add rigidity to the Union’s competences. We are in favour of a flexible interpretation and of the idea that, at any moment, through the mechanisms he has upheld, from Article No 308 and other Articles from the Treaty, Article No 99 specifically, we can accommodate the needs of the Union and the aspirations of its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I believe that the Lamassoure report also puts forward a very solid position on one of the great issues in the Convention, the control of subsidiarity. I believe that one of the main issues in the debate on the Convention will be how to control subsidiarity, for, as the rapporteur has very clearly stated, the great majority of competences are competences shared between the Union and the Member States. Therefore, to know at which moment we have to use one and at which the other will be the key to keeping Europe running at the rhythm its citizens require.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we also have a very solid position in this regard. I am going to make a declaration, because I know that some fellow Members still have doubts, in favour of the position taken by Alain Lamassoure: I believe the control of subsidiarity should be exercised by the body within whose competence it falls to make proposals – in other words – the European Commission. I believe that the European Commission must have the right of initiative and that it must take charge of subsidiarity. However, I believe that, if there are any discrepancies, we need to find a way to resolve them, and the way to do this is not through a political body or some sort of subsidiarity chamber, but through a system similar to the one established by the French Constitution for the French Constitutional Council, in which a month is given for the issue to be resolved. It seems to me that this is a solid, principled position: control by the Commission, with a Constitutional Council, and I believe that we should defend this position.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I believe that the Lamassoure proposal is ambitious. There is a William Faulkner character who I like very much and am very fond of, who says that we have to have very ambitious dreams, so that, as we go through life chasing these dreams, we know where we stand in relation to them. I believe that the Lamassoure report allows this and that all our hopes and dreams are also permitted.</p>

<p class="contents">It means that the European Parliament will be there at the Convention with a set of proposals on the table. We will have done our work in terms of contributing ideas and proposals to the Convention and that in itself is very important. It is important especially if we look at the climate surrounding some of these discussions and debates.</p>
<p class="contents">There are those who are alleging that the European Union has become an over-centralised monstrosity; that we need to take powers back to the Member States; that we should define a catalogue of competences specifying in great detail what the EU is allowed and not allowed to do.</p>
<p class="contents">This report refutes those arguments. It demonstrates quite clearly, in a very good response, that the competences of the European Union are not over-done: they are, in fact, finely tuned according to the subject. There are some areas where the Union has what could be called an exclusive competence – though that term has been avoided in the resolution. They are quite limited but important. The bulk of the Union's responsibilities are what could be called shared competences, where the intensity of Union action varies greatly from one subject to another. In some areas we lay down detailed legislation – which the Member States have to comply with. In other areas the Union has a coordinating role and in still other areas it contributes with complementary actions. This is flexible and it is adapted to the needs of different policy areas, and should remain so.</p>
<p class="contents">The true guarantee against over-centralisation is, and should be, a political guarantee as we consider proposals in the normal procedures of the institutions: from the Commission, as Mr Méndez de Vigo has just said, when it makes its proposals to us as a Parliament, and also the Council. Let us remind ourselves who sits on the Council: national ministers, members of national governments, accountable to national parliaments – not people who are predisposed towards centralising everything in the European Union. Not at all. You have to convince a very large majority of them to get a qualified majority. These are the political guarantees, the procedural guarantees against over-centralisation, and the ministers in the Council can, and should, involve their national parliaments as well. The Treaty of Amsterdam gave a protocol giving a six-week period for ministers to discuss with their national parliaments. That is how national parliaments should be involved, not through some new chamber of subsidiarity or some new institution.</p>
<p class="contents">All this is well presented in the report. Where we in the Socialist Group have a reservation is on the legal control of subsidiarity. It exists already: the Court is a constitutional court in many ways. We do not, however, think a new extra procedure – an emergency procedure – is needed, and the wording should be tightened up to show that on shared competences detailed legislation can sometimes be laid down and ...</p>

<p class="contents">The report will serve as the first contribution to the Convention on the question of competences. I trust that the Convention will follow the wise approach in rejecting the rigid and misleading concept of exclusive competences and in focusing instead on developing a more sophisticated system of power sharing.</p>
<p class="contents">My group supports the idea of creating a new judicial procedure of constitutional complaint for breaches of competency, which implies the rapid evolution of the European Court. The procedure would be rarely deployed, but it represents a significant insurance scheme to see that the Union authorities do not abuse their reinforced powers.</p>
<p class="contents">A further area deserving of greater focus concerns the regions, which can be, and should be, useful intermediaries between the citizen on the one hand and the supranational authorities on the other. We are proposing amendments which will strengthen the report in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My own group has two particular points that we would like to ask colleagues to build into the report before it finally sees the light of day. Firstly, just an allusion to the significance of the democratic deficit and the need, finally, fully to democratise the institutions of the Union. As long as we do not call it a "permanent" democratic deficit, I am sure that the PPE-DE Group will be with us on that, and I hope that will be written in.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, we suggest – and colleagues on the left are very much in agreement with this – that a little more emphasis on the social, as well as the economic and political element – should be written in. Apart from that, we are really very happy with the way this is going forward and look forward to voting for it tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">The key point Mr Lamassoure makes – and has made throughout – is that the issue is not one of needing to rewrite a new list of competences for the institutions but a need to draw to citizens' attention to the fact that there is already a very adequate statement of the different kinds of competences – the Union's own competences and the shared ones – and the fact that the principle of residuarity governs the rest. The states are responsible for what is not given to the Union. All that is clear in principle, but it could do with being stated more clearly in practice so that citizens are better aware of it. That is a very important point.</p>
<p class="contents">In that context, we raise the issue of subsidiarity. Where competences are shared, it is important indeed that in all those areas where local knowledge ought to prevail, local knowledge does prevail. That is to say, that decisions are taken at the most appropriate level for them. Recital G makes a very important contribution to expanding and giving greater bite to the idea of subsidiarity, and that is also to be very greatly welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">We in our group believe much in extended subsidiarity. Subsidiarity does not stop at the front door of the Member States: it goes right down to the territorial entities within the Member States, to the local authorities within the Member States, and that is of critical importance to us all. We, along with the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and the Liberals, would like a little more strength to it, but we do not mind. This report as it stands now represents a huge step forward in the thinking of Europeans and of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat, it is a huge privilege to take part in this debate and in particular – and I say it in his presence – it is a privilege to have taken part in a debate led by Mr Lamassoure, who has done such an extraordinary job of setting up the architecture but being willing to adjust the sculpture, to borrow a metaphor of his own this morning. He has done a fantastic job, we are all greatly in his debt, and I hope my group will vote unanimously with him tomorrow.</p>

This was apparent not only in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, but was also shown by the first debates in the Convention, to whose work this report will surely make a contribution. For that the rapporteur deserves our gratitude.</p>
<p class="contents">I abstained in the vote on this report in the Committee and would like to adduce a number of examples of things which, to my mind, the report has not yet addressed in a convincing way. It may well be helpful to define the three types of competence that already exist, but that falls short of a clear statement that the first priority must be to resolve Europe's problem with democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">When we come to the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, things strike me as having been turned on their head. Why? The report gives the impression that Court rulings are needed in order for both principles to be adhered to and put into effect. Nowhere, though, in the text as a whole, is there any mention of the fact that the real problem is to be found elsewhere, with the European political actors who actually initiate action. There are clear provisions in the Treaties, for example the protocol on subsidiarity in the Treaty of Amsterdam, by which all the institutions are bound. The point actually at issue is rather how they carry out the duties accruing to them on that basis, how seriously they really check whether the principles are being infringed before they take action. At the end of the day, everyone has to do this sort of initial check. If they did, nobody would have to go to the ECJ before the entry into force of a legal measure which in most cases has taken years of debate and associated procedures to come into being.</p>
<p class="contents">Point 33 states that the framework of competences is to be reviewed after ten years. What this means, and what its point is, is a mystery to me. Is it meant to mean that there is to be an amendment to the Treaties every ten years? Is a rule of this sort really what is wanted, something that is rigidly fixed to a ten-year cycle and utterly divorced from potential political frameworks and requirements?</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, though, the report fails to make clear the need for a social Europe, and that its creation is one of the EU's most pressing tasks against the backdrop of economic and monetary union. We set ourselves the objective of promoting economic and social progress, with a high level of employment as well. We even want to achieve full employment by 2010. The words to date have been splendid, but they need to be backed up by actions. Employment and social security are not variables in competition, but every citizen's individual and fundamental right, and it is in that direction that the European Union must develop. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to welcome this report as one of the most significant documents in the debate in this House. It is significant in terms of timetabling and the time chosen to present it, it is significant in that its subject matter is one of the most controversial and at the same time most critical for the future of the Union, and it is significant not only as regards the quality of the final report but also as regards the work and discussions that preceded the report. It is also significant as regards the large number of amendments tabled, including many that fell by the wayside, and for its enormous theoretical richness. Lastly, it is significant because it demonstrates an understanding and organisation of the system emerging from this work on the European Union and also in the light of the parallel discussions taking place in the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">We regret not being able to support this motion in the final vote because we are even in agreement with the first two paragraphs, and we agree that the time has come to update the division of competences between the Union and its Member States on the basis of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, in order to take account of the lessons of the Community's history – particularly those lessons that unfortunately point to so many excesses and infringements of the principle of subsidiarity. And we also agree that a better division of competences is needed and will result in a strengthening of democracy in Europe, which for us includes restoring greater importance to national democracies and the role of national parliaments and a new interparliamentary process for building the Europe of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">However, when we get to the third paragraph, we face an irreversible parting of the ways. We believe that at this point the report deviates from its original objective and joins the growing trend towards a European constitution, an EU constitution, which we cannot support. Furthermore, we believe, because we are talking about competences here, that it is not within the competence of any European institution to draw up a European constitution. It is within the competence of the Member States to draw up and revise treaties, and this is a contractual mechanism totally different from the mechanisms relating to constitutions, which are based on the existence of a sovereign people, a people governed by a sovereign body, and that is totally different from our mission in the European Union. We accordingly differ on a matter of principle that we regard as being fundamental.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, when Mr Méndez de Vigo spoke just now about powers of assignment, he rather put his finger on the key point: powers of assignment, and the fact that we recognise their existence, does not just mean what Mr Méndez de Vigo was referring to. It also means that the Member States have competences under their own common law, and no one needs to assign them as long as the European Union only has such competences to the extent that the Member States delegate and assign them and may also withdraw them, as in the case of the new type of mechanism that would replace the existing Article 308 according to this report. This is a very important point with consequences for the institutional framework and for how we see the competences of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a few more observations that we would like to make. For example, the criterion of synergy is mentioned amongst the criteria identified in Recital G, but this criterion can only be considered within a very limited framework. The criterion of synergy and of effectiveness is, in itself, extremely dangerous, because that is how all the attacks on the principle of subsidiarity are made. In isolation, it is easy to maintain that any given action would lead to greater effectiveness – and effectiveness is a dangerous word in itself because it can be used for anything – and to economies of scale, which would provide a platform for constant infringements of the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, let me say that we welcome the report and would like to support it, but it is on the issue of this constitutional vision that we differ with the rapporteur, this vision of a European Union becoming ever more like a state, which we consider to be fundamentally at odds with the whole concept of Europe and with our vision of the future of the European Union – one which respects the individual nations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over the years, the Community structure has become a tangled undergrowth of texts and procedures in which even the most wary can become lost.</p>
<p class="contents">My group proposed several amendments which would help to reduce the inflated number of texts and competences. Amendment No 34, for example, proposes that it should be made possible, at the request of one or more States, and thus of their respective national parliaments, to abrogate a text if no majority can be found to confirm it.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is very concerned to find that, every time it has been claimed that this clarification exercise is being carried out, the end result is always exactly the opposite. Yet everyone recognises that it is time to respond to the resentment and lack of interest on the part of our citizens, towards a Europe which is involved in too many things at too detailed a level.</p>
<p class="contents">This report only makes things worse by proposing to give the European Union the only powers which it does not yet have. Thus it lists all the areas which should fall within the Union’s own competences, the list of shared competences, under the close control of the Commission, the guardian of the Treaties, and the Court of Justice, to which have now been added those concerned with the implementation of foreign policy. As a final precaution a review clause is proposed, modelled on Article 308, so that more competences can be added if necessary. After noting that very little is left, one can understand the prudence expressed in paragraph 17, which does not consider it necessary, unfortunately, to draw up a list of the competences exclusive to Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, in the last analysis, this report is nothing more than yet another compilation of the claims which the European Parliament was unable to impose in Nice. Europe is becoming a State above States, free to define its own priorities, while there are already too many meddlesome rules, imposed far away from the daily lives of our citizens and preventing the management of territories in accordance with local and national aspirations. We shall continue to support the call for more diversity, proximity and transparency, even if these ‘mores’ seem difficult to reconcile with the ‘More Europe’ slogan of the current Spanish Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is all there in full, because the stated aim is indeed to create a centralising European super-state with full ruling powers, while the Member States will retain only a few so-called federal competences on the pretext of a principle of subsidiarity which is actually rendered inapplicable by all sorts of exceptions. Thus the principle of subsidiarity becomes itself subsidiary, because it cannot prevent the application of Article 308, or the Community acquis, or the self-proclaimed principle of the European Union. I thought that the members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs were capable of greater skilfulness or caution, because in the final analysis, whatever the fate of the Laeken Conference, the European structure is looking more and more fragile, artificial and determined to turn itself into a free-trade zone.</p>
<p class="contents">What we should be doing is exactly the opposite, in other words we should be looking at what specific contribution each competence of Europe makes to each of our countries, and in the case of France, any Frenchman worth his salt cannot help but conclude that the consequences of that Europe are becoming increasingly negative. Common sense and hard facts tell us that we should go back to the spirit of the Treaty of Rome, in other words, the joint exercising of certain economic competences in an associative rather than a supranational manner. Yet because you are part of the system, or even on ideological grounds, you continue to chase after idle dreams. Having committed the initial historical error of not geographically limiting the European Union by accepting in principle the accession of Turkey, you are now in the process of committing a second fatal error, as the Spanish say, by not limiting the competences of that Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to suggest, however, that there is any connection. I am far more worked up about the sentiments Mr de Gaulle has just expressed, as, if he wants to make speeches expressing the desire to take the European Union back to the days before the internal market, one has to say that he was not thinking of France's economic interests. I am, therefore very grateful to Mr Lamassoure for what he said, for I believe that the model he has put forward possesses the balance called for between the clear regulation of competences and the need for us to live up to Walter Hallstein's saying that the European Union is a <span class="italic">creatio continua</span>. What this means is that we are in a position to continue the European Union's development in line with what is needed. It is of course perfectly clear that, when applying the subsidiarity principle, we must always take decisions in such a way that the decision is taken at the level at which it ideally should be. On the other hand, though, we also have to make it clear that it is only appropriately clear delimitation that will enable us, in the negotiating process in the Convention and in the ensuing Intergovernmental Conference, to get agreement to us pushing through majority voting in the remaining areas as well.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a close connection here between clear competences and the further extension of majority voting, by which alone the former will be accepted both in political circles in the national capitals and among the public, who want this very clarity on this issue. We cannot, though, create clarity in a conflict situation via the political level. If a subsidiarity committee, consisting – as it would have to – of at least 100 MEPs and members of national Parliaments, were to be set up, decisions would be reached on the very same grounds of political opportunism as they are in the Council of Ministers and in this Parliament. If, however, the regionality principle is applied, even a minority has a chance of getting its view accepted if it believes that powers have been exceeded. That is why Mr Lamassoure's approach, taking the matter to the European Court of Justice, is exactly the right one. It would make it possible, both in the normal procedure and in this accelerated procedure, by way of a range of groups and institutions possessing the right of action, to defend competences where it is believed that the legislature is exceeding its powers.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to propose to you that the national parliaments should also be added to the list of those bodies that possess the right of action in the ECJ. I see making this possible as extraordinarily important, tactically astute from Parliament's point of view and in its interests, and, in this case, as necessary and imperative. In most countries whose regions have the power to pass legislation, those regions have such a right of action through the medium of a national chamber, and this is something that could, to a substantial extent, be taken up. I do think that this is the decisive point of departure for achieving real decision-making power, getting responsibilities clearly defined, thereby gaining their acceptance, and at the same time guaranteeing legal certainty. For that reason I would like to congratulate Mr Lamassoure on his report.</p>

<p class="contents">This way of doing things does not meet the need, which we reiterate so often, to make the most of the opportunity afforded by Parliament’s plenary sessions for competent political debate.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The resolution we are debating this evening, drawn up on the basis of Mr Lamassoure’s report and the specific analyses contained in the justifications, sets forth the path which we call upon the Convention to follow as well. This is a path of balance and rigour, which takes into account both the demands for enhancement of the Union’s role – as you can see, the same watchword as that of the Spanish Presidency, ‘More Europe’, is used – and the demands for greater clarity, streamlining and decentralisation of the Union’s functions. I feel that we need to be very determined in defending the Union’s current competences and also in extending them, first and foremost, to the common foreign and security policy – as boldly suggested in paragraph 20 – not least because that is what is being demanded by citizens across Europe, who want to see Europe more united and stronger in its actions in critical situations and on major issues of peace and justice in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the time has come to put the institutional framework in order, distinguishing between the various forms of Union interventions and decisions that have been piling up over the decades with one treaty after another. We have to acknowledge that there are concerns in the areas of respect for the principle of subsidiarity and also the distinction between legislative and executive powers and responsibilities, which is not always clear, and the absence of a hierarchy of acts.</p>
<p class="contents">Well then, the Lamassoure report puts forwards solutions that will bring greater consensus in all our countries on the further development of European integration. I would mention, by way of example, the new wording of the criteria for initiatives and decisions at Union level, the three criteria of relevant scope, synergy and solidarity. I would then mention the effort made, for example, with regard to the issue of respect for subsidiarity, to strengthen the Commission’s political responsibility – paragraph 28 – but also to provide an additional channel at jurisdictional level.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, after paying Mr Lamassoure so many compliments, I trust that Parliament will not adopt amendments tomorrow which might upset the balance or detract from the innovative nature of the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They apply to parlour games, sport, constitutions and society in general. Strangely enough, these bywords have not really left their mark on successive European Treaties and legislative texts over the years. Indeed, the EU acquis is no game of dominoes, but affects 370 million people.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of haggling over the least comma, anyone wanting to understand how the EU works is hardly likely to choose the Amsterdam Treaty, let alone the Nice Treaty, as bedtime reading if he or she wants to learn more. It is not surprising that people do not trust the EU when it is so difficult to understand its decisions and division of responsibilities. We too can get confused, even though we work with these matters on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lamassoure’s report is therefore an extremely important contribution to the Convention and to the domestic debate in our Member States. The proposal provides a clear, instructive catalogue of what the EU is and should be doing. This will be very useful when discussing a hopefully timely constitution. The division of powers needs clarifying, perhaps not with a list of competences, but with a clearer outline of what the EU should do.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must be stronger in certain areas, but there must also be safeguards against the EU taking on new duties that would best be carried out by citizens themselves in municipalities, regions or national parliaments. The principle of subsidiarity must therefore be strengthened. The local and regional level is extremely important, and I endorse the amendments aimed at re-introducing the regional partnership. I hope we can get a specific proposal in that very area.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want the EU to be able to function with thirty Member States, then it must focus its power and commitment on the genuinely cross-border issues. The drive to get a little order in the EU’s duties has taken a big step forward this evening, and I would like to thank Mr Lamassoure for his excellent work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I share his ambition to give more powers to the Union so that it can cope with its responsibilities and with what is expected of it. In particular I approve his efforts regarding foreign policy, defence and security.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I do have some objections. We need to rewrite the objectives which form the basis for the Constitution of the Union, and that is what will convince our citizens that progress in competences is fully justified. What are those objectives? The market, currency, freedom of movement – these are not enough. We must go further. At world level Europe is committed to effective multilateralism. It bases its security on dialogue, the abolition of poverty, and development links. It chooses full employment and progress in human capacities. It is against exclusion and bases its cohesion on the sharing of common goods, and finally it has given itself a public space which enables multinational and transnational Community citizenship and democracy to be exercised. These choices are what gives Europe its identity. In the form of a constitution, they should be the subject of an annual and multiannual policy agenda. The balancing of rules and the division of competences are intended to achieve these objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the report lacks any ambition as regards the essential renewal of the social model and of growth, an important subject for our citizens and a subject on which we are divided. The rules of competition must be balanced by common rules and tasks concerning security, public services and industrial policy. The Union must have its own competence in matters involving economic policy, and it must have a redefined framework for the coordination of national policies, as well as fiscal harmonisation of the budgetary and revenue tools.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the exercising of these competences, the democratic challenge and the requirement for efficacy, on these points the report is too brief and a few amendments would improve it. As for the nature of the actions of the Union, I cannot accept the assumption of the rapporteur, who believes that the Union can manage things only in exceptional cases. A political Union which did not manage at all would actually be very irresponsible. Finally, the separation and division of competences should not be based only on the principle of subsidiarity. When coupled with the rule of competition, it does not legitimise a community. It should be accompanied by a second principle, the principle of solidarity. Let us try to spell it out. Players in civil society must be consulted directly, and must be able to manage resources jointly in order to carry out projects which are of Community interest. Let us therefore be brave enough to form a society in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We shall not be approving the Lamassoure report, for two main reasons. Firstly, it hardly touches the question, which to us is all-important, of the democratic control of competences. There is nothing about the control of subsidiarity by national democracies, and nothing, or almost nothing, on the exercise of European competences by national parliaments, in particular by the creation of an inter-parliamentary pillar. Secondly, this report deals with the division of competences from an abstract technical angle, without ever mentioning the sovereignty of national democracies. This abstract technical bias leads to erroneous federalist solutions which have a negative effect on democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the SOS Democracy Members have submitted a minority opinion which is attached to the report. This is also why the French MPF Members have drawn up a counter-report in the form of replies to the Convention’s questionnaire on the tasks of the Union, ‘Europe – what for?’. This counter-report will be distributed by e-mail to all Members of Parliament, to the Members of the Convention and to anyone who asks for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My position is similar to theirs. I feel that the report is a major political document and will be a point of reference for the Convention in its work.</p>
<p class="contents">For that very reason, I will focus in my speech on a desire I was nurturing. I feel that this could have been an appropriate time to introduce greater focus on the issue of the regions in the future European architecture than in the latest version, which will be put to the vote tomorrow. Indeed, there has been a great deal of discussion and a lengthy debate on the role of the regions in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. In my opinion, as the volume of the Convention’s work grows, so the range of communication processes used will expand and the regions will increasingly start to take on a leading role in Europe’s development.</p>
<p class="contents">Anything else would be a step backwards, a mere integration process. At present, we must be wary, above all, of developments which place the Union’s political vision and its relationship with its citizens in serious jeopardy, for when the citizens look at the institution of the Union, I am sure they see the regional institutions as the bodies controlling their own situations and their own wishes. We, who want to build a Union for the citizens at the level of the citizens, would certainly be doing both ourselves and the future of Europe a great service in reflecting precisely on the role of the regional institutions and on an institutional architecture in which all the legislative institutions are part of the Union’s future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People are afraid that there are some folk down there in the EU, as they put it, who are trying to seize more competences, or more power, without asking them first. Those myths are nourished on a daily basis by organised opponents, some of whom we have, of course, in Parliament. I am therefore very pleased with this report, because it helps knock many of these myths on the head. By that, I mean it states once and for all that it is the Member States who have the power, unless this is entrusted to the EU, and it states that the EU is a dynamic community in which competences are shared when it is most relevant to do so. The report also has no truck with any catalogue of competences, which would make cooperation far too rigid a matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is in actual fact very realistic, and Parliament can now no longer be accused of consisting of extremists with their heads in the clouds. That is something which I also hope that organised opponents in my own country, Denmark, will take account of. I am talking in this context to Mr Bonde, even though he is not here this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a couple of observations on individual parts of the report. On the subject of the subsidiarity principle, I am delighted it has been stated that this is not just a legal principle but also a political principle, for we must have more focus on subsidiarity as a political principle and thus force the Commission to explain itself more effectively to people. I myself have proposed that an individual Commissioner be responsible for subsidiarity, for that would give us elected representatives here in Parliament the ability to hold the Commission responsible for the subsidiarity issue and so force it both to explain itself directly to people and to justify its actions to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a basic premise of the Lamassoure report which I endorse.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly a mature decision to extend the Union’s competences to the common foreign and defence policy – only thus will Europe be able to make its voice heard in matters of<span class="bold"> </span>preserving order, peace, stability and world development – and to the management of the common area of freedom and security, because only thus will we be able to combat organised crime and drugs effectively and address the issue of extra-Community immigration in a civilised manner.</p>
<p class="contents">The Eurobarometer readings would indicate that combating poverty and exclusion should also have a place among the Union’s core competences. That said, in accepting and underlining the importance of the principle of subsidiarity and transferring all the other competences to federal sovereign bodies in accordance with this principle, it is true that, realistically, we need to acknowledge that, in the present phase of European history which is undeniably distinguished by the enlargement procedure, the Union we are building is a Union of States. That does not change the fact that the Member States themselves grew up and were defined merely in response to a need for integration in times past. They are structures dating from before the present age of globalisation. It is a fact that, in recent decades, the States have had to relinquish sovereignty upwards – as is the case with the Union itself – and, especially, downwards, towards the territorial, regional and local bodies which now represent the real identity and seat of democratic control in many parts of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, like many of the previous speakers, I believe that we need to acknowledge that we cannot just define the principle of subsidiarity in terms of its application to the Union/Member States relationship but that we need to go further and apply it to that relationship which we have undertaken to create as a further contribution to the Convention’s work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Two brief comments. The division of competences between the Member States and the Union must be judged not just on how efficient it is, but on how democratic it is. Our citizens have every right to object to the abdication of power to the European Union, even if it makes sense technically, while this democratic deficit persists. Secondly, the three levels: Union, Member States, regions. We should remember what psychologists have to say about families with three children, about the child sandwiched in the middle which has a permanent identity problem and wonders, right into old age...</p>

<p class="contents">I believe that we are in a constituent phase. At least, I hope so. I believe that the contribution of the Lamassoure report should be duly taken into consideration, above all by the Commission, and then by the Convention. The Italian radicals support most of the proposals contained in this report. They see it as an important lever to enable our reflections to progress, so that finally we shall provide ourselves with institutions and a constitutional assembly which can enable us to complete an enlargement which, without such a structure, would run the risk of really turning us into a free trade area with no soul and no interest in taking part in it. I believe, therefore, that we are showing the way, and that the other reports too, the other positions adopted by Parliament, will make it possible for Parliament’s delegation to make its voice heard. That, at any rate, is what I am hoping. We could have done more. I believe that in the spirit of the Lamassoure report we shall be able to make progress in other contexts, on even more specific proposals, heading even more in the direction of a federally based Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must emphasise that I am saying this not to gainsay the quality of the rapporteur's work or to underestimate the effort he has put in.</p>
<p class="contents">For the British, having no formal written constitution and having been a unitary country until quite recently, systematic analysis of the kind we are considering this evening is especially unfamiliar. Having said that, as part of the essential process of making Europe's political activities more clear, understandable, democratic and accountable and making Europe suitable for an enlarged Union, it is necessary that this work is done and done rigorously. The very fact that we find that we cannot support some of its conclusions does not seem to me to invalidate the underlying exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe's constitutional arrangements need improving, clarifying and tidying up. But that process must not be allowed to be the excuse for creeping Euro-centralisation. Rather, it must be used to develop a Europe built around its nation-states, taking decisions together, according to evolving systems of decision-making, which make them suitable and appropriate to a 21st-century world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me, though, make just two comments on it.</p>
<p class="contents">The first has to do with the subsidiarity issue and the relationship with the regions. I was a member of a provincial government in Austria. I know about the many advantages, and also about the problems, associated with the regions and with subsidiarity. I would simply plead for us not to forget the political cohesion that the EU needs when we are taking all these steps towards a better relationship with the regions, and for us to look carefully when taking these steps. That strikes me as being of absolute importance.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is that today's debate is not taking place in a sanitised vacuum, and what is happening in politics, especially the elections taking place today in the Netherlands, insofar as we have any information about them, shows that a certain segment of the population has a growing tendency to vote and act by reference to European policy. I nonetheless am of the opinion, with reference to item 20, that the rapporteur and, I assume, we Members of this House ourselves when we vote tomorrow, will be quite right to stipulate that external and internal security in particular are among the EU's own powers. For the Members who, when speaking here, use the fears and criticisms expressed in these elections in order to argue against the strengthening of the European Union in these areas, are not speaking in the citizens' interest. It is they, the citizens, who have an interest in greater security at home and abroad. If we were to ask them and perhaps explain this to them better, we would gain greater consent and support for the European Union having these powers. So I would like to say loud and clear that the EU's own powers, to which Mr Lamassoure clearly holds fast in his report, meet with our support, because we need more activities by the European Union, and better reasoning behind them, in the interests of our citizens' security both in terms of foreign policy and of the area of freedom and security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can only echo what the rapporteur says about the position of the new players in the European game – the applicant countries and what he calls "regions with legislative powers".</p>
<p class="contents">The report decides to entrust the main guidelines to the Convention. But as long as every Member State sticks to its own selfish interests, the established rules will not permit stateless nations such as the Basque region to take part in the building of democratic structures. We know that, under the new decentralisation process for the French Republic, many things will change – even in the Basque region. However, much more will remain the same.</p>

<p class="contents">The first has to do with the subsidiarity principle and the monitoring of how it is adhered to. I would have liked us to have granted right of action to those regions that possess the right to enact legislation<span class="italic">. </span>I do not know whether we will find a majority in support of that, but I would think it right and proper, and a step in the right direction, to at least grant that right of action to the national Parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking the review clause as my second point, I consider it of extraordinary importance that Mr Lamassoure makes it clear that this can work in both directions. I believe that future negotiations will depend on that to a very significant degree.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the report refers to improvement of the legislative process, which must, for a start, involve the legislative function being, as Mr Lamassoure proposes, more clearly demarcated from the executive – and that includes the terminology used. It involves the EU's lawmaking being relieved of the burden of technical details. I would like to add that the agreements reached between the three institutions on the basis of the proposals in the financial services area are not yet adequate to deal with democratic control, but that they can at least serve to point the right way ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, the Lamassoure report is particularly timely for this very reason. We believe that, to solve the citizens’ problems, we need a Europe that has the appropriate competences and the institutional instruments required to manage them correctly and sufficient resources to implement them.</p>
<p class="contents">This will certainly take place, because the citizens demand more Europe. I am one of those who believes that it is not true that citizens want to re-nationalise competences, nor do they think the European Union is some kind of giant whose voracity knows no bounds. I believe that the Lamassoure report is appropriate precisely for this reason, and more importantly, that its general approach is correct. We need to revise the competences of the European Union upwards, rejecting any kind of re-nationalisation, weakening or curtailment of those which already exist.</p>
<p class="contents">I also consider it vital for there to be increasing flexibility in order to develop the Community acquis and for this reason I agree that there should be no ‘competence catalogue’ in the strict sense. I also consider that if there are three areas in which the competences of the EU should be increased, these are in economic governance and social Europe, foreign policy, and legal affairs and the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, it is appropriate that there is a review clause, in the fashion of the current Article No 308, and to establish a clear hierarchy of acts in order that what today is primary law continues to be considered in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the regions, particularly those with legislative capacity, should have an increasing role in the future of the European Union, so that they can apply these very Community competences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only fringe movements, estranged from reality, believe in the ability of the individual state to resolve the challenges of modern society alone. The age of eloquent diplomacy is over for good.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community, whose basic intentions were by nature political in the views of its founding fathers, started by using economic measures. In recent years, however, we have seen that economic integration cannot be separated from political integration. For example, it is not possible to create a fully functional internal market without strengthening the political Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The notion of a list of competences has been proposed in order to improve the system of competences. Like many of my colleagues, I fear that such a catalogue of competences would prove too rigid a system in a world where change is the only permanent factor. Community decision-making must be able to retain its natural flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">In most cases the power of decision is still divided between the Union and the Member States. It is thus clear that we are also going to see conflicts of competences. For that reason we should focus on mechanisms with which we can resolve such conflicts. We have to create a process that will make sufficient flexibility possible, but, at the same time, offer democratically elected representatives a political way out of stalemate. Political control to prevent the concentration of power must not, however, be confused with judicial scrutiny on the part of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, as, ultimately, the Court still determines the legal basis with reference to the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">In the debate on competence some are looking for a way to transfer competence back to the Member States, which would be a step backwards for integration. This is the sort of sentiment, often expressed in the spirit of the principle of subsidiarity, that we must not be taken in by. In the debate on competence we have to concentrate on the citizens’ perceptions, so that they know who makes the decisions, where they are made, and, above all, why what is done is done.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to mention three points regarding the methodology: it examines the contradictions and weaknesses in the present system of competences in the light of intellectually honest criteria, presenting the history of our institutions; it then goes on to clearly define a model for sharing competences acceptable to European public opinion and eliminating doubts about the absorption of competences by the European institutions, clarifying a debate in which there is an unfortunate display of demagogy and lack of ethics with regard to the European dynamic; and lastly, whilst they are subject to discussion, certain proposals do not deviate from a viable model for the functioning of the European Union, without exaggerating the federalist orthodoxy or subterfuges in terms of European revisionism.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what really stands out is the hard core of specific competences. Nothing has been lost here of the original model, of its adaptability to new circumstances and of the courage to propose new responsibilities with regard to the definition of foreign and defence policy, as regards the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, and even regarding the financing of the budget. Furthermore, this report sets out the Union's own responsibilities with regard to solidarity between its Member States and its citizens, especially on the question of cohesion and of structural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is no wonder, Mr Lamassoure, that I am heaping such praise on you and that we are voting in favour of your report. The Convention should make good use of it and reflect carefully on it if we are to be given an opportunity to have a modern treaty in which the European Union provides added value for its citizens, its regions and its Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, seven out of ten of them assert that too little account is taken of the interests of the individual citizen. I attribute this tension to the fact that the realities of the decision-making and opinion-forming process not being sufficiently clearly and transparently communicated.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lamassoure's report is helpful precisely because it very clearly highlights the mutual involvement and interaction between citizens, communities, regions, nations and Europe. The EU is not somewhere else; rather, we all make up Europe. No decisions are reached without the agreement of the Member States, and therefore without the national parliaments, when they see themselves as monitoring what the representatives of their national governments do in the Council. Clear competences lead to clear responsibilities and clear parliamentary authority and thus to the decision-making process becoming more transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think, though, that we have to make it clear that differing competences must not be allowed to lead to the blocking or delaying of jointly-agreed objectives such as the four freedoms, the financial services action plan or the internal market. Differing competences must not be allowed to lead to the Commission's competence as guardian of the Treaties – in such matters as the Stability and Growth Pact – being nullified. Not all the problems faced by our countries' regions can be resolved through Europe. Co-decision by Parliament leads to greater transparency, more democracy, better control and hence to greater proximity to the public. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that Mr Lamassoure, who is very knowledgeable on his country’s history, knows that some of the most important events have taken place at night. I would remind him of the night of 4 August 1789, when the French Revolutionary Assembly abolished all mediaeval and feudal rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we are in the midst of a revolutionary process and that Mr Lamassoure – perhaps without knowing – is starting a revolution. We have become accustomed to a European Union that has been developing organically, and maybe this is the reason why Mr Inglewood was not very inclined to agree with the new process. Now Mr Lamassoure is presenting us with a real alternative, that of heading towards a federal Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The advantage of a federal Europe, highlighted by some of the previous speakers, such as Mr Karas, is that citizens, who at the moment are completely befuddled by all the Community jargon, will be able to understand it much more easily. For example, if there is a clear distinction between the competences which fall to European institutions and those which fall to Member States, we can dispense with this word which, in any case, no-one understands – subsidiarity. All we will need to say is that it does not fall within the competence of the European Union to deal with a particular issue because it falls within the national competence of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I believe that, on this point, I, like other members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, have to support the Lamassoure proposal, because it makes particular reference to the Council’s slogan this year, which is ‘more Europe’, a slogan behind my very election as a Socialist MEP, because, in effect, we believe that we need to construct ‘more Europe’ and we believe that the way we can build more Europe is through federal procedures such as those proposed by Mr Lamassoure.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe there are some problems. For example, I have problems with the special constitutionality appeal, which<span class="bold"> </span>includes the famous subsidiarity appeal. The Court of Justice already acts as constitutional court, including the famous subsidiarity appeal, and I am slightly concerned about this appeal that appears to be on the horizon. We had it in Spain and we had to remove it because it was a means of blocking the process of Community development.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully expect that tomorrow this Parliament will support the Lamassoure proposal en masse and I hope that this will serve as a basis for work in the Convention and later in the Intergovernmental Conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Across Europe voters feel taken for granted by their politicians; they feel that how they vote makes little difference and that they have next to no control over their own futures. Yet, our response is to offer them more of the same. This report confirms and entrenches the progressive transfer of powers from national parliaments to the European Union institutions. It sets out the areas where the Union should have full or partial control but it offers no commensurate list of matters to be reserved for the nation-states. It offers a mechanism for the extension of EU jurisdiction into new areas, but no equivalent mechanism for the repatriation of powers.</p>
<p class="contents">While I fully respect the sincerity of those who support the report, it seems to me that their case is based on two questionable assumptions. First, there is an implicit premise that the very fact of there being an international dimension to some policy area of itself justifies a common European approach. This reasoning may be superficially plausible but I find it specious. After all, the absence of a supranational policy does not mean that the Member States are unable to cooperate one with another. It may well be that multilateral collaboration can produce better results than enforced uniformity.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, there is a reluctance to recognise any matter as being exclusively national. But again, the fact that a nation has complete jurisdiction in a given field, does not preclude its working with its neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">The nation-states must be allowed to define certain areas of policy as being essentially domestic in that they have no direct impact on the internal affairs of other Member States. Further, they should have the right to guarantee this judicial supremacy in their constitutions. Just as the European Treaties define the competences of the Union, so the national constitutions should be able to ring-fence certain matters of wholly national concern. I do not have time now to elaborate a full list of these areas, although I have done so in a paper published by the SOS Democracy Intergroup.</p>
<p class="contents">The transfer of powers must be allowed to happen both ways: it is dogmatic and wrong to assume that action at Brussels level is inherently preferable to national action. It is this attitude that is widening the rift between those of us in this House and our constituents beyond it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whenever someone in the Member States wants to evade responsibility for something that is important and necessary, but unpopular, they can, with a true ring of conviction, shrug off responsibility onto the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">‘My dear fellow-citizens, I would far rather do it another way, but Brussels will not let me!’ You can tell the voters anything you like, as they do not understand the allocation of competences. In any case, the public are puzzled by the way powers are apportioned. Never in the last fifty years has it been easy to understand, and today it has become incomprehensible.</p>
<p class="contents">The system of restricted prerogatives has become an unrestricted supermarket of European policies, an unworkable situation that we want to use the Lamassoure Report to fundamentally change; it is all about making things orderly, systematic and comprehensible. Much of it, indeed most of it, appears to be well done. There is one topic that I consider especially important, and I am glad that the rapporteur has taken on board one of my suggestions. This is to do with future prohibition of what is termed the misuse of legal form. In the past, when power to enact regulations or directives was lacking, the European institutions all too frequently resorted to sleight-of-hand and invented an action plan, a measure, a pilot project and more of the same thing. The missing competence thus ceased to be a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">If we henceforth block this gate of entry into national powers, we will be closing Pandora's box, and thereby, I hope, making Europe a bit more straightforward and comprehensible, and therefore more acceptable in the eyes of its citizens.</p>

I will thank Mr Lamassoure not only for thinking deeply, but also for listening intently during our debates. Above all, I see this report as carrying two messages. As MEPs, we also want to be given definite responsibilities. Our defence against the charge of centralist interference is that it is clearly laid down what we are competent to do and what we are not competent to do.</p>
<p class="contents">The second message contained in the report is that we want more Europe in external relations, and more Europe in the worldwide representation of European interests, but that we are also ready to do without one thing or another in internal matters and leave detailed rules to the Member States. It is interesting that a success has been made of decentralisation in recent years, not only in all the EU's Member States, but also in the acceding countries. Even enterprises that work on a global scale act according to the principle of ‘small units and big networks’. Hence it is in our own interests that we should, as MEPs, concentrate on the core competences we possess and should also give that outward expression.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been remarkably bold in this respect; you, Mr President of the Commission, Mr Barnier, and your fellow-Commissioner Mr Vitorino too, have had something to say about this yourselves. This report offers our citizens – even the Euro-sceptics – a modern, effective, and transparent Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It certainly represents a step forwards that sheds some light on the sensitive issue of competences at exactly the time when this issue is at the centre of the Convention’s debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The impending constituent Treaty, which we are convinced will be the basic standard for the new Europe, must encourage the development of a Union with a single foreign and defence policy at last, a Union which is, at last, able to take action and work for peace in the Mediterranean area and elsewhere, a Union which is highly competent in the field of security, immigration control, the internal market and monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think the Lamassoure report prefigures a European superstate in the stranglehold of creeping bureaucracy; in other words, it does not provide for centralism but for a federation of nation States founded on the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity, with competences distributed between the various institutional levels: European, Member State and regional. As regards the latter, Mr Lamassoure, there is, in all probability, a need for greater clarity. It would also be appropriate to go into the competences of the other local institutions, and by that I mean the cities themselves. The objective is to create a new Europe which will be increasingly close to the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr President – and I join Mr Napolitano in his protest – how can we ask the Europeans to involve themselves and take the lead in building the new Europe if even we resign ourselves to holding almost secret debates on issues as important as those we are discussing in this House this evening? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Taking responsibility in Europe means mutual recognition of the Member States' constitutional arrangements, which are many and varied.</p>
<p class="contents">I am from a Member State with a federal constitution and see this as a great advantage, especially in terms of the greater proximity of politics to the citizen. This makes me particularly grateful to our rapporteur, Mr Lamassoure, for taking up the topic of the regions, especially of those that possess legislative powers. Some of these regions are larger, in terms of surface area and population, than the small Member States. This disparity in political arrangements will be made greater by the accession of more Member States. Item 34 and the compromise set out in item 39 are very important, as they highlight a new way of having recourse to law in disputes concerning subsidiarity and the principle of proportionality.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me draw my colleagues' attention to one thing, namely that, in its judgment dated 3 May 2002 in the Jégo Quéré case, the European Court of First Instance declared itself to be a constitutional court. The clear delimitation of competences is of the greatest significance as regards the public's consent to further internal integration and to enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">What Europe's citizens want is for the Convention, when working out its proposals for a European constitutional treaty, to be guided by transparently clarifying the tasks to be performed by the EU and by the Member States respectively. The latest Eurobarometer surveys indicate that 60% of the EU's citizens take pride in describing themselves as Europeans, and that two-thirds of the current population of the EU – as many as 80% in Italy – want a European constitution. Mr Lamassoure's fine report is an important contribution by Parliament to the arduous process of attaining that goal. So, I thank everybody and hope that we will be successful in the Convention! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is planned that a special report on the role of the regions should be introduced, but I do think that our long debate might also have the result that, tomorrow morning, we get together and reconsider whether what we have just said might yet, in rather more definite form – on which point various groups have submitted amendments – be incorporated into the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I would like to address concerns the powers reserved to the EU. Mr Lamassoure quite rightly pointed out that external economic relations certainly belong in this category, being a very important area, and one in which the state of affairs is such that the Commission can arrange things properly, with the Council of Ministers helping with the orientation, but Parliament, in utter contrast to the US Congress, has almost no opportunity to influence matters. The practical cooperation that we engage in with the Commission is excellent, but I believe that things must not remain the way they are. We need to come off better out of the dividing-up of these competences, as this is a matter of particular importance to this institution of ours. Perhaps some consideration, which is certainly necessary, could yet be given to this topic as well in the Convention. In any case, I think the regions are an important subject. Let me thank Mr Lamassoure very warmly for his excellent report. We are, though, in my opinion, a bit too timid when it comes to the regions. We might be expected to do a bit more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to my information, Real Madrid are still leading two – one, and their second goal was scored by Zidane. This information that I am giving you has not, however, prevented me from attentively following the whole of this debate, which has been of very high quality, on the issue of competences, an issue which lies at the heart of the Nice and Laeken declarations.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution that you are about to adopt will in effect constitute a central element in the debate which has started on the future of the Union. This is a central theme, because it raises fundamental political questions. At the same time, however, as your rapporteur is well aware, it also raises far-reaching technical problems. The debates at the last meeting of the Convention, like the contributions that have already been submitted for the next meeting and the numerous expert opinions, bear witness to this complex situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, first of all, to offer my thanks, first to Parliament which, at the beginning of 2001, took the initiative and launched a sort of premonitory reflection session on this difficult issue. I should then like to thank the various parliamentary committees, in particular the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the quality of its work. The resulting resolution retains a high degree of clarity in spite of the density and complexity of the subject. May I thank, in particular, Mr Lamassoure, who had no hesitation in carrying out very wide-ranging consultations in order to complete his report, even though the time limits imposed on him were extremely strict. He did this with his usual spirit of openness, and very high level of expertise. Like him, I believe that this version will be the authoritative one.</p>
<p class="contents">The result of this collective step forward is undeniably constructive, because it leads to three important ideas, and I can tell you, on behalf of the Commission, that this is how we regard them, and I shall now comment briefly on each one.</p>
<p class="contents">The first idea is the clarification of the whole of the legal framework of the European Union. This clarification is inseparable from any ambitious institutional reform. It is therefore proposed that we should adopt a true Constitution of the Union, bring the second and third pillars within the Community sphere, make a clearer distinction between legislative work and executive work, establish a hierarchy of standards and define the relevant instruments better.</p>
<p class="contents">From this vast programme of re-establishing legal equilibrium, I have naturally picked out the key aspect, the provision of a Constitution for the Union. The Commission would like the European Union, having integrated the Charter of Fundamental Rights, to have a text of a constitutional nature.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important idea in this report is the classification of competences into three categories: competences exercised as a matter of principle by the Member States, the Union’s own competences, and shared competences. Of course I understand this interesting and useful attempt to describe the current organisation of competences. It seems to me, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Lamassoure, that we now need to calculate three risks. The risk of the rigidity of watertight classifications, subject by subject, which several Members have already mentioned, could perhaps freeze the division of competences more than is required for the sake of clarity. In future, the Union will have to have the means to respond to new challenges if necessary. In this respect I would point out the attention which the resolution gives to maintaining the flexibility of the system by proposing a review clause as laid down in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">A second risk seems to me to be the risk of abolishing certain legal bases, the so-called functional bases, if we make it obligatory to link competences to subjects. For example, do we really want to abolish Article 13 of the Treaty, which makes it possible to combat all kinds of discrimination, whether on grounds of sex, race, religion, age etc.? I do not think so, and that is surely not the intention implied in this report. A third possible risk would be the risk of ignoring negative competences, those rules which directly impose restrictions on the exercise of the competences of the Member States, for example the prohibition of measures restricting the fundamental freedoms of movement. This is not merely a detail; it is something whereby citizens acquire some of their essential rights in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a balance needs to be struck between, on the one hand, the necessary rationalisation of competences, and, on the other hand, the <span class="italic">sui generis</span> nature of the system of the Union, which we do not wish to attack.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this report contains a third major idea: we must invent new ways of ensuring that the subsidiarity and proportionality requirements are respected. The question of strengthening controls to ensure that the division of competences between the Union and the Member States is respected forms a part of the most complex problems that we shall have to tackle. The lively discussions which you have had, or so I am told, at the committee stage, demonstrate that there is no ideal political or jurisdictional solution which everyone agrees is needed at present.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in addition to these comments, which I was bound to give you, I should like to express my satisfaction, as usual, with the quality of the work carried out between our two institutions, and praise the contribution made by Parliament. It comes a week before the Commission itself submits a major contribution of the European draft, in which you will find some of your ideas expressed. It also comes, as you have pointed out, on the eve of a highly sensitive meeting of the Convention, at a time when we have spent a lot of time on useful discussions in debates of a general nature about the tasks of the Union, and are on the point of getting down to the heart of the matter, and when we are perhaps approaching a moment of truth.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I believe that at this point, one week before the next meeting of the Convention, this contribution from Parliament is extremely important, and will provide crucial indications on the issue of the competences of the European Union. Once again, it is absolutely crucial, even vital, that Parliament and the Commission should sketch out together the broad outlines of a common vision, in the service of their shared interests, of the revised Community model on which we are all working, and I will even say all working together.</p>
