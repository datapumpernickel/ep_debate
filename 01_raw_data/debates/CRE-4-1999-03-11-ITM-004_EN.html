<p class="contents">Just a little over a year later, the American court‐martial at Camp Lejeune has delivered an absolutely scandalous verdict, clearing the pilot and refusing to try to identify responsibility elsewhere, even though the Italian judicial authorities have established, beyond all doubt, that there was a clear breach of the rules of aviation.</p>
<p class="contents">European Socialists are scandalised by this verdict, which makes no attempt to try to establish responsibility and prosecute and punish the guilty parties, and is offensive and hurtful to the families of the victims and all of those affected by the Cermis tragedy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are asking the US authorities to use all the procedures available to them to identify where responsibility for the tragedy lies, to punish severely those who are guilty and guarantee that relatives of the victims are fully compensated, both in terms of moral support and materially.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore support the stance taken by the Italian Government, which has put these views and requests directly to the President of the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, events in Cermis also show us that we need to reconsider and act to change the rules contained in the 1951 London Convention, so that tragedies of this kind – which would certainly be more likely were there to be a general feeling of impunity – are prevented in the future, and to guarantee that there would, in any event, be no obstacles in the way of the investigations and judicial proceedings against elements of NATO armed forces that violate the laws of the countries in which they are stationed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are asking for joint action to be put in place to ensure that any form of military exercise within the territory of the Union takes place in conditions of complete safety for the civilian population.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I join with all who have extended their condolences to those who lost their loved ones in the Cermis tragedy.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Santini </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT) </span> Madam President, the few words I wish to say on this sensitive issue can be summed up by way of two premisses and three specific proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">My first premiss is that, in the Cermis incident, in which 20 people lost their lives, there was collective responsibility on the part of the NATO command in Aviano which has always authorised training flights, even over densely populated areas, because it has been too liberal in its interpretation of the 1951 London Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">My second premiss points the finger of blame at the pilot, Captain Ashby, who broke every rule of care by interpreting even more recklessly an already dangerous flight plan. It has been said in his defence that the military maps did not show the ski‐lift cable: that is unbelievable given, after all, that it has been there for more than 25 years and was reconstructed after an earlier incident, on 9 March 1976, in which 43 people lost their lives. If the pilot was right, then in any event, the responsibility of those who failed to update such important maps ought to be established. However, you do not have to be a pilot to find it difficult to imagine that when you enter a mountain gorge at 800 kilometres per hour, at an altitude of only 80 metres, it is still feasible to consult a map. The inhabitants of the villages situated along the route of the ski‐lift know a thing or two about this, and they testified that extremely low‐flying aircraft were a common occurrence. Again, according to their evidence, it seems that the Cermis cable, extending over 80 metres, was considered a challenge for the young Aviano pilots, almost a test of courage, a baptism of fire, swooping over people's heads. Some, a very few, managed to fly under the cable, while others pulled the nose up at the last minute and cleared the cable. Unfortunately Captain Ashby stopped half‐way. He severed the cable and caused the death of 20 people.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe there are three proposals to remedy this situation: firstly, we need to review and update the London Convention, particularly with regard to overflying; secondly, we need to recognise that the ordinary courts have to take precedence over the military courts in cases of this nature; and, thirdly, we have to put pressure on the US Government to speed up the process of compensating the victims' families.</p>

It is not our intention to comment on the verdict as such, but we do have some serious questions about the system established under the London Convention. We would point out that a legal system such as Italy"s is perfectly capable of guaranteeing a proper trial, so why, in cases like this, can the airmen responsible not be tried by the regular courts in Italy rather than by special courts, such as the court‐martial here?</p>
<p class="contents">Do not misunderstand us, this is not a call for a people"s court, for emotional justice or for revenge, but for new international procedures so that responsibility for accidents or offences can be determined at the place where the events occurred.</p>
<p class="contents">The acquittal of the crewmen concerned also leaves a number of questions unanswered, which is why we expect the investigation at least to continue. Why did the pilots not have the correct maps? Why was the ski‐lift not shown on those maps? Why did the NATO authorities in charge not have information on the permitted flight altitude in the region? Something or someone in this whole unsavoury business has to be responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we want the promises and commitments given about compensation for the victims to be honoured, because here too justice must prevail.</p>

Justice was clearly not done when, despite the incontrovertible evidence, the pilot was not only acquitted of involuntary manslaughter, but even the charges of dereliction of duty and reckless conduct were apparently not admissible. When Parliament sent its condolences to the victims of this terrible accident last year, calls were already being made for a review of the London Convention, under which jurisdiction in the case of military offences lies with the country to which the military personnel in question belong. The unacceptable verdict delivered by the court‐martial shows once again just how necessary this review is.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the question of whether recourse to the separate system of courts‐martial is still justified in peacetime. Is it fair that a serviceman who commits an offence in the course of an operation which serves no military purpose and in which civilians are harmed should be tried by a separate legal structure made up almost exclusively of other servicemen, in other words colleagues? The special circumstances such as a war which justify the existence of courts‐martial did not apply in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">We all agree that actual responsibility must be determined and fair compensation must be paid without delay to the families of the victims.</p>

Moreover, I have to say that we understand the reaction of the people of the Cermis region and the response of the victims' relatives. I think that is right, and I also think it right that the victims' relatives should be compensated, even though compensation can never bring back those who lost their lives. Setting all of that aside, I think we are right to ask how it is that, almost 50 years on from the London Convention, incidents of the kind we have seen can still happen.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind the House that last year, on 19 February, when we were discussing the Cermis tragedy, I tabled a resolution in which I called for the London Convention to be reviewed. I therefore believe that not only should we call for the inquiry to be reopened to establish whether there is responsibility at a higher level, we should also consider whether it is necessary to retain the NATO bases, as if we were colonies of some kind, or to react and ask for the current rules to be amended so that the national courts are finally given jurisdiction over criminal acts of this nature.</p>

We feel that sense of bitterness first and foremost for the relatives of the victims, of course, but also for all those who have regarded the Atlantic Alliance in the same way as we have always viewed it: that is to say as an Alliance which has guaranteed our countries' security for 50 years.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is right that, after the Italian Parliament stated its view yesterday, we in the European Parliament should now be discussing the issue and taking an interest in seeing that justice is done, although much – too much – remains unclear about this incident, which is also protected by the provisions of the 1951 Convention. I do not, however, believe it either right or helpful that we Europeans should be raising for debate, on the basis of these incidents alone, matters which could have been discussed elsewhere. That seems to me, at any rate, to be a dangerous mix.</p>

However, I think that we, as politicians, should not simply confine ourselves to a few non‐committal words of moral support or criticism of the London Convention. As the European Parliament, we must have the courage to face up to our political responsibility and say that this is about much more than just the guilt or innocence of one man, of one pilot.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few weeks, we have been forced to face the facts, facts that we might sometimes prefer not to know. The facts show that the American troops stationed in Europe are actually above the law in the Member States, they can contravene laws and regulations with impunity, as we have seen, and will never be called to account before the European courts or the courts of the Member States. We must ask ourselves whether this court‐martial verdict, sadly, is not indicative of a certain American mentality today that clearly regards the American troops in Europe as a sort of army of occupation which, like all armies, is above the laws and regulations of the countries in which it is stationed.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore now not just demand compensation for the victims" families, although it goes without saying that they can never be compensated for their suffering, we must also condemn this totally unacceptable American attitude that can only be described as neo‐colonial. The countries of Europe are not America"s vassals, they are not negro villages, and they must not be treated as such.</p>

<p class="contents">The attitude taken by American pilots to Cermis hardly bears description: they were supposed to be carrying out military exercises, but in fact slaughtered defenceless people. Particularly unjustifiable, however, is the apathy of a court‐martial that is incapable of guaranteeing that justice will be done, taking refuge behind international agreements, in this case the London Convention which dates back to 1951 and now needs, as a matter of urgency, to be brought into line with changing times and international political reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally unjustified, however, is the surge of anti‐American feeling which is going so far as to challenge the basis of the international agreements with the United States, those same agreements which have protected Italy from the strategies and subversion of the Communist International.</p>
<p class="contents">The non‐attached Members therefore wish to dissociate themselves from the protests coming from those who still hanker after the Warsaw Pact, and to affirm the importance of the partnership between the United States and Europe, and between the United States and the Italian Republic. Once again we are voicing our support for the establishment of a European security and defence policy which cooperates and works with the NATO structures and, if necessary, acts independently to defend the interests of the whole of Europe.</p>

We consider the expression ‘concern", which is used in the resolution on which we are to vote, completely inappropriate. I do not know what compromise led to that word being used, but I reject it. There are two things we should be talking about here: about condemnation – condemnation of the action of those pilots who play at cowboys in the skies, risking the lives of others – and above all censure of the verdict of the American court‐martial, which is failing to give our people, our nations, justice.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Padania bloc, which I represent in this House, and certain that I am speaking for the people, I therefore ask Parliament to be very firm in the stand it takes. This Parliament is reaching the end of its mandate, but I think that we should begin to set an example for those who will come after us. This Europe of ours will either gain respect or regularly be walked over by people and states that want to be our friends, although we know that the essential basis for friendship, between both individuals and states, is mutual respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore asking for the wording of the resolution to be much more forceful than it is at present.</p>

Moreover, I note that President Clinton himself has recognized that the United States may have had some responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">An acquittal has just been pronounced by the American Court‐Martial.

<p class="contents">Any decision to amend this Treaty is the sole responsibility of the members of NATO. The issue must therefore be dealt with within and by the appropriate institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community does not have the authority to rule on issues concerning the security of military flights. There is a directive, Directive 56 of 24 November 1994, which establishes the basic principles governing enquiries into accidents and incidents in civil aviation. However, this directive does not apply to military aviation.</p>

But things have been far from quiet when it comes to human rights violations. We have seen in Armenia, Azerbaijan and the Caucasus that human rights and democracy are still not being given a chance, and the negotiations for a peaceful solution to the Nagorno‐Karabakh conflict have still not produced positive results. As I said, thank goodness there has been no real outbreak of violence yet. At the moment the so‐called Minsk group – the United States and France – is working to try to achieve something through the OSCE. Let us hope that this resolution helps to publicise the problem of Nagorno‐Karabakh once again.</p>

Fortunately, there has been a cease‐fire since 1994 which is opening the way for negotiation, and the Minsk Group is taking charge of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we have on the table a proposal from this Group, which the OSCE has entrusted with finding a solution to this long‐standing conflict. I think that we should welcome this, as it respects two principles we all support: the inhabitants" right to self determination and the respect for borders as they are currently laid out. Nevertheless, we cannot accept changes that would come about as a result of the use of arms. This is one of the reasons why, once again, we feel that this proposal by the Minsk Group is headed in the right direction, insofar as it proposes a large degree of autonomy within the existing borders, and we feel that this is a fundamental point.</p>
<p class="contents">A window of opportunity is therefore opening for us to begin a process that could bring about a solution to this conflict. We hope that all the parties will be capable of seizing this opportunity to put an end to the conflict and arrive at a situation whereby the people can live together peacefully within the existing borders.</p>

Since 1992 there have been countless refugees, and their children, who have only ever known a state of emergency, have been growing up in tents and covered wagons. It is not only the hatred that is constantly growing, and the irreconcilability of two peoples who used to live side by side and to intermarry as a matter of course; there are also the diverse interests of various European powers which keep preventing a peaceful solution, as they did again only recently. Nor has the European Union achieved anything with its partnership and cooperation agreements; it has not taken the opportunity to use them as an instrument in pursuit of a peace settlement. What we most need to do now is to break down this hatred, because otherwise there can never be peace in the region, and that is why we must not rely entirely on political instruments but must concentrate above all on supporting the key players within society and make them the starting‐point for a concerted reconciliation campaign.</p>

There are still more than a million refugees, most of them living in inhuman conditions. They have been driven from their native areas and have no prospects, while the continuing absence of a permanent peace settlement for this part of the Caucasus is disrupting the cooperation between Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia that this region so desperately needs, which is ultimately stifling the economic development of the entire region. The European Parliament supports the untiring efforts of the Minsk Group to find a political solution that will lead to a stable peace in Transcaucasia.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the OSCE to continue its efforts and to set up an observer team which would constantly monitor respect for human rights and democratic development in those countries. Such a commission of observers would operate as a political early‐warning system, so to speak. For all the progress that has been made in developing democracy and strengthening human rights, there are still some real problems here, of which last year's presidential election is but one example. The latest arrests in Azerbaijan are also a cause of great concern to us.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will continue to support the development of democracy in these young states. In this context, we call on the Council to increase the allocation of economic aid to Transcaucasia but to link it, I need hardly add, to the process of establishing democracy. There can only be economic stability, however, if the political conditions are right, in other words if Azerbaijan and Armenia make a determined effort to reach a political compromise on the future of Nagorno Karabakh.</p>

We have had several opportunities to discuss the conflict in Nagorno‐Karabakh, in terms of the human problems caused by the war and as regards our desire to help solve the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1993, the OSCE has been trying to find a solution, to negotiate and to draw up a peace plan, but we all know that these negotiations have encountered many obstacles, and that in November, the peace plan proposed by the Minsk Group was rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, we want to firmly reiterate our support for the peace process in the Caucasus and also our support for the peace plan presented by the Minsk Group. The proposals in question are a good basis for negotiation to help find a peaceful solution to this conflict, and it is essential that negotiations are resumed so that an agreement can be reached as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that, following the recent rejection by the Azerbaijani Government of the peace plan proposed by the Minsk Group, some political leaders in Azerbaijan itself warned the government against such a refusal and asked it to enter into direct negotiations with the Armenians in Nagorno‐Karabakh and to propose a political solution that would grant self‐government to the area and make it a free zone.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a new and positive element. At the same time, the European Union must continue to make its aid to the region conditional on visible progress in terms of human rights. During all information and observation missions, the OSCE must also pay special attention to the level of respect for human rights in the area in order to prevent an escalation of violence if any incidents do occur.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to say that the European Union must increase its aid and assistance to the NGOs in the area, which, through discussion and political education, are trying to promote mutual understanding of the history of the communities that live in the region.</p>

It is our duty to monitor closely what is happening in these three republics and do everything we can to bring about peace in the region, which is of a much greater significance than is represented by its population alone.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore right for the Member States of the European Union to show concern for the conflict in Nagorno‐Karabakh. It is up to us to do everything we can to put an end to this conflict, to establish peace in the region, of course, but also to promote economic development. Such economic development can only benefit from the resolution of the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">The Delegation for relations with the Transcaucasian republics has had several opportunities to visit the country and it got the impression that both the Armenians and the Azeris sincerely want to see a solution. This great expectation extends to Europe and to the European Parliament, which could help find a solution, as we have said ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The Minsk Group was given the task of drawing up a lasting peace plan. The leaders of the countries involved – Azerbaijan and Armenia – have put forward proposals. Armenia, in particular, has come up with proposals that are likely to restore peace in the region. This is precisely the aim of the resolution in support of the peace process in the Caucasus region, which I personally signed on behalf of my group. We want to make a modest contribution to solving a problem which has been going on for several years and which urgently requires a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add that, clearly, in co‐signing this resolution, which relates to both Azerbaijan and Armenia, we are not forgetting the problems that both of these countries are facing. We could not of course forget the tragedies that Armenia has experienced, nor its repeated demands, in particular, that the tragedy of the Armenian genocide be recognised. Nor are we forgetting that the human rights situation in Azerbaijan leaves a lot to be desired, and that we must make all efforts to improve it.</p>

The peace plan presented by the three co‐presidents is a good basis for negotiation to find a solution to this conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to contribute to bringing the regional players together, the Union has set up technical assistance programmes through TACIS with the aim of developing cooperation between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The presidents of these two Caucasian countries have demonstrated their support for these initiatives. They are contributing effectively to improving dialogue between the parties, which facilitates the search for common solutions to the regional problems.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Armenian Prime Minister, Mr Darbinian, took part in the presidential transport summit which was organised last year in Azerbaijan with the support of the Community. The Armenian and Azeri Prime Ministers also attended a conference in Brussels in February on the transport of oil and gas. The Azeri, Armenian and Georgian Presidents have agreed to participate in a summit organised by the German Presidency in Luxembourg on 22 June to mark the entry into force of the partnership and cooperation agreements between the European Union and the Caucasian countries. The main priority of these agreements is to support democracy and human rights, in line with Parliament"s wishes.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission notes Parliament"s desire to strengthen the work of the ‘democracy" aspect of the TACIS programme in the region. However, up until now, it has only received a very limited number of projects from non‐governmental organisations. The Commission therefore believes that the very small number of NGOs established in Armenia and Azerbaijan means that, for the moment at least, it would be premature to increase the resources allocated to this programme.</p>

It reminds me of when I was a little Catholic boy and the religious procession came through the village, all the curtains were open as the image of Christ and its two candles went by and things were absolutely still, you could have heard a pin drop. Then as soon as it had passed, the curtains were shut again and people went back to drinking and beating their wives and committing all manner of sins until the next year. Castro – and I should know, I lived there for four years – is no good. He may be all right as an image of the ‘last revolutionary", but we have had quite enough of all that.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is sad and in fact almost pathetic that we are still trying to get along with this <span class="italic">caudillo</span> , another word for dictator. All he is doing is strengthening the American line on the boycott. So Europe must not change its policy here. We must carry on providing support for democratisation and renewal, and this is what our programmes must focus on, rather than some image of Che Guevara. Now he was a real revolutionary, but unfortunately he died young and, as you know, Castro had a hand in that too.</p>
<p class="contents">Our programmes and our political dialogue with Cuba must be actively pursued, and we must make it clear to this <span class="italic">caudillo </span> that unlike the Pope we are not to be trifled with. The people of Cuba deserve democracy and the renewal of their country, even the gullible among them.</p>

Despite all the human rights violations and the lack of political freedom in Cuba, Parliament – encouraged by the left‐wing parties – has unfortunately always turned a blind eye and has thus allowed the situation to become entrenched. The dissidents who have put up opposition have never once been honoured with the Sakharov Prize in five years. It is enough to make you weep, and I think it is a very serious omission on our part. What is more, our extremely selective approach has not helped the people of Cuba one little bit.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, at long last, we have a resolution, albeit one which adopts an extremely mild tone. It talks about help for constructive dialogue instead of sanctions, which is fine. But a year or more after the Pope"s visit, when there were such great hopes of improvement, the people of Cuba have less freedom than ever. The opening‐up of the economy has not helped the Cuban workers but party officials and a single Italian and Spanish investor. It all reminds me of the way things went in the Batista era: prostitution, drinking, rich tourists – these are surely not what you would expect to find in a socialist revolutionary administration?</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, today"s investors should have to sign contracts with the workers themselves and not with the government, because what happens is that firms investing there hand over all the wages to the government, which then creams off everything it wants and gives a few pence to the workers. It is scandalous!</p>
<p class="contents">No diplomats or journalists were allowed to be present at the trial of the dissidents. The European Union said it was an oversight, but when the same thing happens in Turkey, the whole of Europe hits the roof. What I mean is that we take a very selective view. In the resolution we talk about observing human rights, but really, as Mr Bertens said, a great deal more than that needs to be done. Never again must Fidel Castro be given the red carpet treatment anywhere in the world. He should face the same fate as Öcalan or Pinochet: a trial.</p>
<p class="contents">Should not the international community be speaking out against the arrival of 300 Cuban troops in Angola and Brazzaville, as reported in the Portuguese newspaper <span class="italic">Diario de Noticias</span> ? They are there to help dictators cling to power and to bring oil and diamond revenue to Cuba. This House has waited a long time to hold its trial. The time has now finally come, but from the communication I received from the Cuban ambassador this morning, he clearly thinks it is all nonsense. I do not. I hope that our resolution brings hope to those in Cuba who support freedom.</p>

Many people criticised this at the time, saying that we needed to have confidence in the process of democratisation, and that the signs of this process were apparently demonstrated by the Pope"s visit.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that Christmas was celebrated in Cuba, and that is about all. When we see that this trial is dealing with the terrible and deplorable crime of having had contacts with the foreign press, we realise that this so‐called democratisation is very far from being achieved. From that point of view, this resolution does not go very far. We should have affirmed more strongly that while human rights are not fully respected, this dialogue – this attempt to take a few small steps – is doomed to failure.</p>

The text that we are debating today, and which I should like to see approved, is a criticism of the corrupt and incomprehensible way in which the Cuban Government interprets freedoms, such as the freedom of expression, the freedom of assembly and the freedom of association.</p>
<p class="contents">If there is no acknowledgement of the right to disagree and the right to political dissent, then there is no freedom. For this reason, we must condemn the detention, arrest and imprisonment of Cuban dissidents and political opponents simply because they think differently to the current regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Political dissent is a right, it can never be interpreted and judged as a crime of sedition or as a crime against national security. In a free regime, such detentions would not have occurred. Using the North American embargo as an excuse is too simplistic. We have condemned – and I have condemned – the attitude of the United States administration as being mistaken, amongst other things. But their attitude cannot be used as a reason for detaining, imprisoning and sentencing all those who do not comply with the dictates of the single party, which in Cuba is the Communist Party.</p>
<p class="contents">We fully and unreservedly support Vladimiro Roca, Félix Bonne, Marta Beatriz Roque and René Gómez Manzano, who were detained on 16 July 1997 after having written and distributed a text entitled ‘The homeland is for us all" which went against official government positions. We feel great solidarity with the Cuban political prisoners who have been imprisoned due to their political beliefs.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely hope that condemning the Cuban regime in this way will not destroy the fragile framework for dialogue that is still alive between the European Union and Cuba. The Cuban Government"s mistakes are not the mistakes of the people, they are the mistakes of the ruling party. Its political positions, its defensiveness and its negative attitude towards anything that involves a cultural, political, economic or social opening up cannot destroy all possible dialogue between Cuba and the European Union. These attitudes must not lead to the Cuban population being condemned, as they are the ones who will suffer the consequences if such dialogue is destroyed.</p>

Even without a cooperation agreement, this House has given its full support to Cuban society, and the European Union is the largest donor of humanitarian aid to Cuba in the world. In this way, the Union is demonstrating its awareness of the problems and shortages Cuba is suffering at this point in its history.</p>
<p class="contents">In this same spirit, and as Mr Cabezón Alonso said a moment ago, we have spoken out as often as has been necessary to condemn the extraterritorial effects of the Helms‐Burton Act. And now we also have to speak out to defend human rights and democratic freedoms in Cuba because moderation becomes a vice when it means a lack of commitment. This House has an irrevocable commitment to freedom that is, and must be, our ethical and aesthetic guiding light.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already said in this House – quoting an illustrious colleague of mine – that the future cannot be imposed on individuals or peoples without their support and that there can be no individual dignity unless every man and woman is able to play a part in determining their future as a society.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, this House must show its solidarity with those who are suffering and be firm in its inevitable demands for freedom. Therefore, my group is once again calling for the release of Vladimiro Roca, Félix Bonne, Marta Beatriz Roque, René Gómez Manzano, Jorge Luis García Pérez and all those who, having been deprived of their freedom, fight in Cuba for their freedom and dignity.</p>

Under the Cuban Penal Code, it is possible for opposition politicians to be found guilty of so‐called crimes such as lack of respect and hostile propaganda. Opposition politicians are sent into internal exile within the country, and there are many reports of police brutality.</p>
<p class="contents">Altogether, restriction of democratic rights and freedom is extensive in Cuba. This must be unequivocally condemned, which Parliament has done in its resolution. Cuba is under intense pressure from the USA, through a long‐standing economic blockade and other forms of aggression. The blockade against Cuba must be lifted if the country is to engage in positive development. However, the US aggression can never be an excuse for deficiencies in democracy and human rights in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many progressive elements in Cuban society, for example a level of social justice which for the region is advanced, and endeavours in the field of education and health care. But clearly none of these things can compensate for any restriction of the democratic rights of the Cuban people.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cuban people are fully entitled to choose a socialist model for their society. The problem is that they are not allowed to choose, because political pluralism and fundamental democratic rights are lacking.</p>

Therefore, when a nation such as Cuba has been suffering for so many years due to an embargo that is illegal in international terms and to a relentless pursuit by the United States, we begin to understand the suffocating situation of the Cuban Government. We begin to understand the defensive attitude it must adopt to be able to defend itself against these problems and shortages, particularly now with the Helms‐Burton Act, which is also illegal in international terms.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we believe it is important to help so that a process promoting human rights can resume, and so that democracy and freedom can be re‐established, values that are clearly compatible with socialism. The European Union can end this American siege and promote this alternative path, a path we believe to be satisfactory. Integrating its economy and its cultural relations could bring normality to cultural and political life in Cuba. This is largely dependent on us as the United States is not prepared to help in this respect. I therefore believe that now is the time to make a considerable effort to bring Cuba into the framework of economic, political and cultural relations.</p>

In contrast to the United States, Cuba has guaranteed schooling and free health care, as well as all the achievements that have freed it from its former dependence on the United States. So why does the Cuban Government imitate one of the most appallingly undemocratic and totalitarian systems ever invented? Why on earth do the Cubans not launch a campaign to prove themselves more democratic than the United States by respecting human rights and abolishing the death penalty? The Cuban Government has done the exact opposite. It has added to its list of capital offences. No democrat or Socialist can approve of that, because it is a gross violation of the most fundamental of all human rights, namely the right to life.</p>
<p class="contents">Societies are changing everywhere, and Cuba is no exception. We should make it unmistakably clear to the Cuban Government and the Cuban people that we are prepared to develop our economic, social and cultural relations with Cuba, and that to this end we need to establish contacts with open‐minded, creative and democratic Cubans and their organisations, whether within the ACP framework or on the basis of a bilateral agreement. In order to accomplish this, we seek dialogue.</p>

At the moment, however, it appears that paramilitary groups and as a result the guerrillas too have started carrying out attacks again. We heard yesterday evening that three Americans have been brutally killed. When will the warring factions finally realise that there is nothing to be gained from this constant destruction? I think the Union must continue to stand up for human rights, but it must do so in cooperation with President Pastrana. We cannot be indifferent to the way in which the constitutional state of Colombia is being systematically destroyed. We must try to persuade the United Nations and our own Union to convince others that peace and human rights go hand in hand.</p>

Any action taken against unarmed people cannot be considered heroic. The course of history will not be changed by resorting to using violence against the weak. The insurgent forces still have a chance of going down in Colombia"s history as a factor in creating peace. They have received political recognition – including at international level – but we must ask them to respect international humanitarian law. We must ask them to release all kidnapped civilians, some of whom are ill. Do not harm yourselves even further with such reprehensible actions. Do not demand justice whilst being unjust yourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also talk about the other form of violence: the terror caused by the paramilitaries. It is easy to shoot those who are defending human rights, to shoot trade unionists or journalists committed to freedom or to shoot women and unarmed farmers. In short, it is easy to shoot anyone who may seem slightly suspicious because they support democracy. Paramilitary action represents evil, fascism and all the worst aspects of an intolerant and exclusive sociology. It claims to protect whilst killing and eliminating the best people in society. There is no room for any form of consideration for paramilitary activity, other than its persecution, dismantling and condemnation.</p>
<p class="contents">Peace in Colombia will not be easily achieved but it must be done. The years of violence have affected several generations. President Pastrana"s offer must have our full support and must have sufficient international economic support so that it can meet the social demands that are really at the root of this violence.

Unfortunately that seems not to have happened, and so far it does not look as though the President has developed any action plan to increase respect for human rights. Both the paramilitary forces and the guerilla groups continue to commit crimes. There is systematic elimination of persons and groups campaigning for human rights in Colombia, for example social workers and trade union activists.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we demand that the archives of the state intelligence service should be searched under international supervision. These archives contain large amounts of information on persons who are actively campaigning for human rights and democracy in the country. Clearly, this must not be allowed to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights must be defended and we must do all in our power to defend and support those people in Colombia who are campaigning for these rights.

This time we have the cases of three US citizens whose bodies were discovered and a French geologist who died shortly before he was due to be released by his kidnappers.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also repeatedly condemned the crimes committed by paramilitaries in addition to these murders and kidnappings, or even in connection with them. I must say that it is sometimes difficult for us to understand how President Pastrana can continue his peace talks with the guerrilla organisations in the face of these atrocities, how he can go on negotiating with FARC in particular but also with the other main guerrilla organisation, the ELN.</p>
<p class="contents">Such an approach may appear contradictory, but I believe it represents the only way forward, and we therefore vigorously support the President in his efforts to continue the peace negotiations and ultimately to conclude an agreement. Nevertheless, we can only repeat time and again that human rights will not be respected and protected in the long term unless the rule of law is established.</p>

Evidence of complicity by the Colombian armed forces is that the military had forced him to sign a statement absolving them of responsibility for his safety.

It covers a two‐hour time zone and has 13 000 islands, many different races and many different languages. For 350 years it was governed in a very centralised, colonial way by my country, and even then there were uprisings in Aceh, the Moluccas and Irian Jaya, just as there are now. After independence, the constitution – the Pancasila – ensured that different races and religions could live freely and safely side by side. The fall of Suharto and the economic crisis have now, unfortunately, brought all the various differences to the surface, as we are seeing in the clash between Muslims and Christians in the Moluccas. I very much regret that it should be happening in the Moluccas, because we too abused and repressed the people there, some of whom are now living in the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="contents">But Indonesia is on the road to a new era and a new order. Forty‐eight political parties have registered for the elections in June, and they deserve our support. The resolution calls for a referendum under UN auspices on allowing East Timor the right to self‐determination. Let us hope that this is carried out, and that it goes smoothly. I would point out that an independent East Timor could well open Pandora"s box and encourage other Indonesian races to demand the same, which would present a major risk for the stability of the Asiatic region as a whole.

Indonesia"s complexity and the clashes and explosions – both literal and figurative – in the Moluccas and on the island of Ambon in particular have all shown how difficult things are likely to become if we allow the last pillar of strength that we have at the moment, President Habibie, to fall. The underlying cause of the unrest in the Moluccas lies in the serious political and economic crisis that the country is going through. It is extremely important that we should try to ensure that democratic elections are held as soon as possible, and we should certainly support them. This enormous, great and beautiful country – the ‘emerald belt" as it was called in our geography books – must not be allowed to become isolated, and we have to find some way to show it that we are not disowning it but embracing it. Europe, and in particular the Netherlands, still bears a great responsibility from the past here.</p>

<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Newens </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, this House has repeatedly condemned human rights abuses in many parts of Indonesia over the years and some appalling crimes have taken place in that beautiful country. This resolution deals firstly with outrages which have been committed more recently on the Moluccan Islands. Over 200 people have been killed there and their homes and those of others have been destroyed. Nine thousand troops are deployed there and the people are very badly repressed. This is taking place at the very time when we would have expected, because of the changes that have taken place in Indonesia, a movement in a different direction.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution again recalls the situation in East Timor, where appalling crimes have been committed. The forthcoming election provides the opportunity for a change, and it is very important that we should give every support to those people in Indonesia who are trying to achieve a new departure. We must also press very strongly for the referendum which is being talked about to go ahead to provide the people of East Timor with the right of self‐determination. It is quite appalling that those people have been denied that right. Over the years a third of the population has been killed.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has pressed persistently throughout those years for changes to take place, and that possibility now exists. It is therefore extremely important that we should maintain our pressure for change at this particular juncture and I hope that once again we will give unanimous support for this motion.</p>

I believe the entire House and the other EU institutions are also willing to lend material support to a peaceful democratisation process. However, Indonesia will also have to show that it wants a peaceful process and that it is actively encouraging democracy, and in this respect there are two regions that we consider to be very important. The first of these is East Timor. The referendum in East Timor must be organised as quickly as possible; in actual fact, the independence of East Timor is historically inevitable. The repression there has to be ended, and Mr Habibie knows that. I believe we should act quickly to assist in the transition to independence. Such assistance might, for example, take the form of training for East Timorese administrators in the European Union, in the Member States, with a view to the creation of an administrative infrastructure that would enable East Timor to manage its own affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The second region is the Moluccas, where we must ensure that an end is put to the conflicts which are raging at the present time and which are apparently being encouraged by the police. On Ambon, we have a situation in which 85 % of the island's population are Christians. We must prevent the outbreak of hostilities between religious groups, and in this respect a heavy burden of responsibility falls on the government in Jakarta to demilitarise the population by restraining the police and by using the police force to uphold law and order, rather than to fan the flames of conflict. If that happens, I believe our only option is to call on the Commission to provide humanitarian aid in these conflict‐torn areas and to support the campaign for democracy and the elections, and to do these things as quickly as possible in order to ensure that peace prevails throughout Indonesia.</p>

On that occasion my group, the Liberals, brought up the question of the UN Human Rights Commission. A majority in the House did not want to discuss this subject and were also against taking it as an urgency. When will we learn that we need to adopt or discuss resolutions that can genuinely be of some influence in good time? The UN Commission meeting in Geneva starts in eleven days" time – how can we still hope to influence the Council"s priorities in any way now?</p>
<p class="contents">A new ice age has started in China, as everyone knows. Dissidents are being rounded up in large numbers, Internet users arrested, and there is a crackdown on the formation of new political parties such as the Democratic Party. The Union must behave honourably here. Human rights dialogue must carry on as normal, but if it is to be effective, we must also be prepared to bring public, international pressure to bear: the carrot and stick approach.</p>
<p class="contents">If this process is to be effective, the Council must itself table a resolution on China, lobby for it actively and stop countries from supporting a ‘no action on China" motion. When we see how China is using its influence towards Macedonia and is thus undermining the Contact Group"s Balkan policy, I think we are entirely justified in using public pressure on China. The Chinese will accept this, provided that they are taken seriously. My group thinks it is a pity that we always have to fight so hard to say what we want to say about China. But then, money makes the world go round, or at least so we think.</p>

I think it is very important that we should call for a millennium amnesty for political prisoners and for a ban on the use of children in warfare. We are right this year not to have a list of countries that are failing to observe human rights, but instead to concentrate solely on China. In this morning"s <span class="italic">Herald Tribune</span> , there was a photo of the Dalai Lama in northern India, five years after the invasion of Tibet. The point has to be made that the day after the China report was adopted in Parliament, dissidents were being rounded up and missiles were being aimed at Taiwan from southern China. We have to give China a signal. Not for ourselves or just to be a thorn in its side, but to guarantee stability in the region, because peace is, and will always be, important.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Newens </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, over recent years the European Parliament has established a record on human rights throughout the world of which we can be very proud. It is, therefore, highly appropriate that we should put forward our priorities for the forthcoming 55th Session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Our motion recognises that poverty is a fundamental obstacle to the realisation of human rights. Freedom of thought, speech, religion and all other political, religious and civic liberties are absolutely vital. Economic rights and their close links to other rights must not, however, be overlooked, above all at a time when more than a thousand million people in our world are deprived of adequate food, pure water, proper clothing, reasonable shelter, education and health‐care.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion before this House calls for coordinated action to fight the scourge of racism and discrimination, which has led, even in recent years, to genocide or massacres like that in Rwanda. The motion also calls for positive action to end the appalling discrimination against, and exploitation of, women and children.</p>
<p class="contents">Everywhere we must work for the liberation of prisoners of conscience, the outlawing of torture and the ill‐treatment of prisoners and an end to the barbaric institution of capital punishment, which should be seen to be utterly unacceptable in the world and the civilisation of today. Therefore, we particularly call on the Council and the Commission to pursue issues raised by human rights resolutions in this Parliament and we hope very much that they will be reflected in the work of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. The achievement of full recognition of human rights in every country in the world is a challenge to us in our time. I believe that by passing this resolution, we shall be reaffirming our intentions of carrying on the struggle to achieve that.</p>

And we managed to concentrate – quite rightly – on rights that can be claimed by proposing three initiatives to the Council in three different areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point relates to the universal moratorium on executions. In this respect, we are calling for this session in Geneva to be the last at which a resolution is passed on the moratorium, and for this year"s General Assembly to vote for the universal abolition of the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point involves taking an initiative in favour of the ratification of the international court for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. Finally, the third point relates to China, which was mentioned by Mr Bertens and Mrs van Bladel. We do not hold out a great deal of hope. The policy on the People"s Republic of China has been a disastrous policy not only for Mr Brittan, but also for Mr Jospin, Mr Dalema, Mr Schröder and many others. It is a policy that is slowly edging towards despair. Mrs van Bladel spoke about Tibet. On this matter, I am afraid that we must recognise that as in Kosovo, there are limits to the capacity for suffering and acceptance both of the Tibetan people and of all the people of China, and that we will once again arrive too late.</p>
<p class="contents">We are obviously calling on the Council quite seriously to reverse this policy and to finally place democracy and human rights at the heart of its concerns.</p>

I believe that it is perhaps one of the best texts on human rights that we have ever held in our hands in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">But I believe that we now have to put to the Council something that is even more important than the very relevant issues in this resolution, such as the ‘Millennium Amnesty", promoting the defence of those defending human rights – please forgive the repetition – making the rights of women and children a priority, abolishing the death penalty and pressing for the International Criminal Court to finally become a reality. We must ask that our involvement as the European Union and as member countries in the 55th Session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights serves mainly to defend two principles: the universality and the indivisibility of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We have just discussed some related issues. For example, we cannot allow a government such as the Cuban Government to impose certain conditions on the respect for human rights, such as the lifting of the present embargo by the United States. We also cannot allow, for instance, the dictator in Equatorial Guinea to tell us that the human rights tradition in his country is different to the tradition here in Europe. As a result, I believe that it is vital to defend those principles. And in this era of globalisation, indivisibility also means linking political rights to social and economic rights.</p>

It is utterly impossible for me to contradict anything that has been said on this subject; what we really need to do today is to make a very forceful appeal to the Commission and the Council, not least in view of this meeting in Geneva. The fact is that, every year when this meeting comes round, it carries the hopes of people around the globe who want to hear our Member States loudly and clearly denouncing violations of human rights. We therefore call on the Commission and the Council – especially the Commission, since it also serves as a coordinator for the Member States – to put our message across in no uncertain terms.</p>
<p class="contents">A great many countries have featured in the resolutions of the European Parliament in recent months. Some of them have repeatedly been the subject of resolutions. Colombia, which featured again today, is one example. But I should also like to list a few others, such as Afghanistan, Algeria, Burma, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iran, Iraq, Kosovo, Rwanda, the Sudan and Turkey, although I am aware that Kosovo is not a country but nevertheless a major problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason why we have not included this list in the resolution is that the names of far too many other countries occurred to us, and we could not list them all. China, however, is mentioned. I cannot argue with that. I should also have liked to see China on the agenda for Geneva, because we know that this touches a raw nerve with the Chinese and elicits a crystal‐clear response. We take that response very seriously too. If the Chinese Government is serious about its dialogue with the European Union, it must not follow up these meetings with more waves of arrests, not to mention its position on the Tibetan question.</p>
<p class="contents">Other catchwords we should like to mention include repression and trafficking in women, child soldiers, religious intolerance and the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say once again to the Commission and the Council that we earnestly beg you to take firm action and to ensure that our Member States' diplomatic scruples do not cause them to dash the hopes of the watching world. We have a huge responsibility here, and we want the Commission to make it clear that it demands compliance with democracy and human rights clauses. Then the European Union would truly be setting an example.</p>

Immediately after the end of the Second World War, they were essentially a political manifesto. Now, however, they have become a legal reality, and this, of course, gives rise to an entirely new set of problems. We are discovering new aspects of human rights, the social dimension, and it has become apparent that the human dignity and human rights of women and children are particularly at risk. We see the need to abolish the death penalty worldwide, we see the legal reality of human rights in the form of the new international court, and we appeal to the Council and the Commission to do everything in their power to ensure that progress is made in ratifying the constitution of the International Court of Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is also a great danger that, precisely because human rights are now a legal reality, they will be ground down in the mills of foreign policy interests. What can be done to prevent that? Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the European Union has a very, very important role to play in the transformation of foreign and security policy in the traditional sense into a ‘peace policy", in other words a coordinated political approach that is governed by the overriding aim of establishing and preserving peace. You all know how often Members of this House have called for a mechanism through which the European Union can speak with one voice so that this transformation can be effected.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament can already speak with one voice, as today's debate has shown, and it should use that voice to ensure that respect for human rights, which is now enshrined in international law, is enforced. I therefore wish to re‐emphasise what previous speakers have said and to appeal to the Council and the Commission to assist in promoting the achievement of this aim.</p>

President Lukashenko is still a dictator and is blocking any form of normal political and economic development. The Union must support what opposition parties there are and must try to establish dialogue. This seems about as likely as snow in summer, but the recent resolution of the ‘embassy conflict" could indicate that President Lukashenko is beginning to realise that international isolation is not in his interest, and hopefully this will encourage him to make certain concessions. If this happens, the Union must be prepared to provide assistance to support the process. A dogmatic approach is not what is needed here. We need to do everything we can to solve problems and improve the lives of the people. We have had a whole series of dictators under review this afternoon, but President Lukashenko is the one nearest to us, and this may be our chance to convince him that he is a dictator and that he needs to change his ways.</p>

However, the situation there, Mr Bertens, is still marked by the absence of democracy. Perhaps that does not apply to the embassy, but it applies to the population there, and all attempts by the opposition to re‐establish fair interaction among the forces of democracy by peaceful and democratic means have been thwarted by the dictatorial rule of President Lukashenko, who simply keeps issuing decrees that criminalise opposition activities. But the opposition MPs are not criminals. That is the problem. By criminalising their activities, Mr Lukashenko is prohibiting fair play, a prohibition that even extends to the forthcoming local elections. That is why the opposition has refused to take part in these elections – not because it is against democracy, but because it insists that there should at least be a minimum catalogue of fair conditions. One of these is freedom of the press. It is truly calamitous that the Belarus people do not even have the opportunity to find out about alternatives to President Lukashenko, because he uses the press to such a great extent as an instrument of power, and I know that situation from personal experience. That is why we must make every effort to ensure that changes are made in Belarus and in particular that freedom of the press is restored, because that is one of the main prerequisites of free elections and the democratic process.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of everything, the Belarus people continue to yearn for democracy and personal freedom, which is why we are called upon to ensure that the agreement between the Council, the Commission and Parliament is upheld, and above all that it is implemented in such a way as to help that nation to satisfy its longing for democracy and does not subordinate this purpose to economic interests.</p>

Allow me to add a little to their comments. We have tabled a joint resolution, and we are reaffirming that we want to welcome Belarus into the democratic world and that it is our wish that Belarus should be part of that world. But the latest spate of arrests has naturally raised new difficulties and new problems, and as has so often been the case in Belarus, one step forward towards democracy has been followed by two steps back.</p>
<p class="contents">The President is now dreaming of a pan‐Slavic union, and I can only hope that Russia does not seize upon that dream and that the Ukraine remains aloof and does not jump on the bandwagon either, otherwise the results would be devastating for all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say, however, that the argument which is currently raging over the elections announced by the opposition for 16 May 1999 will certainly have devastating effects. As my colleague Mrs Schroedter has already indicated, the European Union would do well to follow this process very carefully and to lend all the support it possibly can. I am thinking here in particular of the assistance that the OSCE will need. This also means, Commissioner, that financial support is required. I know that Ambassador Wiek has approached the Commission to ask for funding so that the proper training can be guaranteed for those involved in the organisation of the forthcoming elections, and I ask you to look at the relevant documentation again and to do everything we in the European Union can to support this process; let us not use bureaucratic difficulties as an excuse for not delivering the necessary funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation this year is exceptionally critical. The economic situation is unstable, the political situation is extremely unstable and as future neighbours, as my colleague rightly pointed out, we are called upon to do everything we can to help Belarus to find a decent path that will lead it to democracy.</p>

First of all, it is a fact that the people of Belarus are a very likeable people and also have cultural links with us somewhere along the line. Secondly, Belarus perhaps offers the best evidence of the destructive nature of the regime which ruled that part of the world for 40 years. When we criticise President Lukashenko here, we must not forget what school he was trained in and the education he received there. Somehow we must even find it in ourselves to sympathise to a certain extent with this man, for he was led in this direction, and most of his wrath has so far been vented on foreigners.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Mrs Mann was right when she said we must do everything we can to assist the Belarus people and guide them slowly but surely to the path that leads to freedom and democracy, the path which I am certain they instinctively wish to follow. Anyone who knows these people will appreciate that they need to be helped if they are to progress gradually towards those goals. Kicking them in the shins, so to speak, will not induce them to move in that direction. On the contrary, we must make every effort to form a peaceable and fruitful relationship with Belarus, quite irrespective of the fact that Belarus will continue to be of vital importance to us in the future, since we shall be sharing a common border. We need only look at the map to realise how vitally important it will be for all of us, especially our Baltic friends, which is why we must do everything we can to guide Belarus, one step at a time, back into the fold of the civilised and democratic nations.</p>

These usually tell of economic problems, the effects of which are reverberating through Europe. Far less loudly heralded but no less intractable are certain other problems we hear about in Russia, problems that do not sit well with a country which has been campaigning very vigorously for membership of the Council of Europe, since they relate to actions which are incompatible with the Council of Europe's Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and with the provisions of the partnership agreement with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Only this week, in what might almost be termed a live commentary, a delegation from the Congress of European Jews confirmed some of the facts from this list, for example the gradual resurgence of anti‐Semitism, which has some political support, especially from the Communists. Our resolution covers various other areas under the same heading, areas which cause us grave concern. These are increased religious intolerance, the treatment of conscientious objectors and the lengthy delays in enacting legislation on this matter and the grim conditions in the armed forces, which led in 1998 to more than 1 000 suicides and unexplained deaths. It is not only courageous mothers in Russia who are providing this information.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these, I am sorry to say, are vestiges of the Soviet empire that have not been swept away. Our resolution should be understood as an expression of concern, a message of concern that we wish to send with our colleagues who are travelling to Moscow in the coming week for talks with representatives of the Duma and the authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Union are especially anxious that Russia should be a strong partner, a country where democracy and the rule of law prevail. That is absolutely imperative for this Europe of ours, because it would create solid common foundations for a peaceful and free Europe in the next century. This is precisely how we want our message to be understood. It undoubtedly expresses criticism, but it is intended to be constructive and to show the depth of our commitment to helping to improve conditions in Russia.</p>

I think that our delegation that is to visit Moscow shortly should remember this and should ensure that the people there realise that the European Parliament knows about these statements and is fully aware of their seriousness.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue is conscientious objection. The European Parliament is somewhat concerned about the delays on the part of the Duma, which is again under the control of Mr Zuganov"s party, the Communist Party, and which for four years has systematically blocked the adoption of a law on conscientious objection, a law which is nevertheless provided for in the Russian constitution. Along with colleagues in my party, the Transnational Radical Party, in Russia, we are trying to get past this deadlock by launching a campaign, which I think Parliament should support, to bring an end to military conscription and to establish a professional army in the country, which would be a significant step in the right direction.</p>

On the other hand, Mrs Lenz, I would not oversimplify matters by blaming it all on the Soviet empire. After all, the Soviet era was not exactly preceded by a Golden Age of democracy and respect for human rights. Repression, regrettably, has a long tradition in Russia and was to assume appalling and criminal dimensions during the Soviet era, especially under Stalin.</p>
<p class="contents">I can subscribe to the criticism of all political forces in Russia, including the Communist Party, which is unfortunately blocking progress on respect for human rights and bears its share of responsibility for the regrettable resurgence of anti‐Semitism. In view of the heinous crimes that have been committed by anti‐Semitic regimes, there can be no tolerance on this point. The Group of the Party of European Socialists therefore backs the delegation in its mission to convey this message in very clear terms during the forthcoming visit to Russia.</p>

That, however, was three years ago, and nothing has changed!</p>
<p class="contents">Conditions in Russian prisons do not accord with international standards, and nothing is being done to rectify that situation. No progress is being made in the provision of alternatives to military service. The maltreatment and humiliation of young people in the Russian army is driving many of them to suicide. May I therefore ask the Commission to specify where it has intervened on the basis of the agreement. Where has it applied pressure on the basis of the agreement? When did it intervene during the WTO negotiations to remind the delegates that human rights were a priority issue? I expect answers to those questions now!</p>

<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">de Silguy, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. – (FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to answer point by point, as is the custom with human rights issues. I will therefore begin with Cuba.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares Parliament"s concerns regarding the development of the human rights situation in Cuba, and it is concerned about the adoption of a reform of the criminal code which considerably reinforces the repressive nature of the legislation. The Commission is also worried about the outcome of the trial of four dissidents. In consultation with the Member States, it will very shortly consider what position should be adopted in order to respond to these attacks on human rights. Nevertheless, the Commission will continue with firm but vigilant dialogue with the Cuban authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community cooperation policy, which – I would remind you – is a European policy is governed by the principles established in the common position of 8 December, which, as far as I am aware, is revised with each new presidency. This policy is aimed at encouraging a peaceful transition to democracy, promoting human rights and supporting the economic development of the island. In this respect, the activities funded by the Community that are planned for the 1999‐2000 period mainly involve food aid, support for economic reforms and the development of civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, at the end of June 1998, the European Union granted Cuba observer status in the negotiations between the European Union and the ACP countries. That is also dialogue. Full and complete participation in those negotiations, including Cuba"s accession to the future convention, depends on it making substantial progress in terms of human rights, the rule of law, what is known as ‘good governance" in English, and political freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the second issue, Colombia, the Commission entirely shares Parliament"s concerns about the development of the situation in the country. The Commission is particularly concerned about the repeated violations of human rights committed in recent years by the guerillas and paramilitary forces. Above all, it regrets the breakdown of the peace negotiations between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the FARC. More than a thousand political murders are committed each year. Over 300 people have been kidnapped and are still being held, including around 20 foreigners.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the case of the four members of the Colombian NGO, the IPC, <span class="italic">Instituto popular de la capacitación, </span> who were abducted by a paramilitary organisation, the AUC, the European troika approached the Colombian Vice‐President and Mr Lemus, who is responsible for human rights, to demand their release, which has since taken place. The Commission fully shares Parliament"s desire to see dialogue swiftly resumed between the guerrillas and Mr Pastrana"s government.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union gave its support to the peace process in a declaration on 8 January. A meeting between the government and the opposing armed movements is planned for 24 April. Support for actions to promote human rights and help with the implementation of judicial reforms are a priority of the Commission in its work to help Colombia.</p>
<p class="contents">I must remind you, or perhaps inform you, of the figures: in 1998, the Commission set aside EUR 17 million for NGOs, along with EUR 2 million for human rights and EUR 12 million for ECHO to help displaced persons.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Indonesia, the Commission strongly condemns the violent and murderous events that are currently setting Muslims and Christians against each other in some parts of the Moluccan Islands. The Commission supports the steps that have been taken on behalf of the Union to inform the Indonesian authorities of Europe"s concerns about the development of inter‐ethnic tension. In particular, the Union has asked the Indonesian authorities to ensure that the police forces act with greater restraint in Ambon, where there were several deaths in January as a result of repression. The Commission is monitoring the development of the situation as closely as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Community Humanitarian Office, ECHO, sent a representative to the area who is working in close cooperation with the Commission representatives in Jakarta and the NGOs present in the region. Through ECHO, the Commission is preparing to provide aid of around EUR 1 million for the people of the two communities that are victims of the conflict. The implementation of this decision will be entrusted to the European NGOs present in Indonesia, in cooperation with the World Food Programme. This will involve food as well as health and medical aid. It will also provide basic necessities for the displaced people living in shelters.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that elections are being held in June is also an important factor in resolving the current tensions between the communities. The Commission will support them, while liaising with international organisations and other donors present in the area. A programme worth EUR 7 million is currently being prepared for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to East Timor, which many of you mentioned, the Commission hopes that the discussions that are taking place under the auspices of the Secretariat of the United Nations will allow the people of East Timor to be consulted on the future of the region. The Commission shares the concerns expressed by Parliament, which have just been repeated here, about the military situation and the arming of civilian militias. This could endanger a peace process which is still fragile. The Commission supports the conclusions of the Vienna European Council, which call for the disarmament and dissolution of these militias and which also ask that a United Nations mission be sent to the area in order to ease the tension.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth issue is the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. You are aware that the preparation of work for the Commission on Human Rights is carried out by the Council"s ‘Human Rights" group. This group has already met several times for this purpose since the beginning of the year. During the annual session of the Commission on Human Rights, which, I would remind you, lasts six weeks, experts from the Union meet every day in order to decide on the speeches to made by the presidency, on behalf of the Union, and the motions for resolutions to be presented by the Union. The Commission participates systematically and actively in the work of the ‘Human Rights" group, and in all the meetings of experts in Geneva. I can reassure Mrs Lenz on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I have taken careful note of comments that have been made. I am thinking, in particular, of what Mr Ullman said concerning the Commission"s attitude. I can assure you that the Commission is doing everything necessary, and will do all in its power, to convey your views to the Council. You know, as I do, that it is the Commission"s job to take a position on the wishes expressed by Parliament in its motions for resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">More specifically, regarding China, which many of you mentioned, all the Member States of the European Union decided in 1998 not to table a resolution condemning the country. On 22 March, the Foreign Affairs Council will decide what stance the Union will take in Geneva in 1999. For this purpose, your resolution will be a useful source of information in those debates.</p>
<p class="contents">The fifth issue relates to Belarus. The Commission is extremely concerned by the recent deterioration of the situation in Belarus. In economic terms, the population has become poorer, a situation of hyperinflation has developed and serious social tensions have emerged. In political terms, the disagreement over the application of the constitution has led to a deterioration in terms of fundamental liberties and has resulted in the arrests of several opponents. The presidential decree adopted in January, which means that the activities of political parties and associations must be authorised by the administration, is undoubtedly a sign that the regime is becoming tougher.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is sincerely asking the Belarus authorities to establish an open, constructive, public and democratic dialogue with the people and with the opposition with a view to resolving the economic and constitutional problems affecting the country, and to make a real effort to move towards democracy. In this respect, the Commission fully supports the work of the OSCE towards restoring the democratic operation of the institutions. The Commission is closely following the development of the situation with regard to human rights and fundamental liberties. Mr von Habsburg, I can assure you that we aim to support the Belarusian people in this process. I can also reassure Mrs Erika Mann that we are considering how the Commission can play a useful role in the electoral process.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the last issue relates to Russia. The Commission is concerned about the frequent anti‐Semitic comments made by certain political figures who are members of the Duma. On behalf of the European Union, the German Presidency has brought this issue to the attention of the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs and the leaders of the Communist Party and made them aware of its concerns. The European Union has taken measures to promote tolerance and the advent of a civil society in Russia. Notably, under the TACIS programme, it is currently involved in work to promote democracy which is aimed at creating an environment that will eradicate such demonstrations of racial hatred. The Commission will continue to monitor the situation very closely and hopes that these anti‐Semitic outbursts from another age on the part of certain members of the Russian Parliament will end.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to human rights, and the death penalty in particular, you know that the Commission shares the European Parliament"s concerns on this issue. In this respect, it has been involved in an approach made to the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs by the troika to express its concerns about the possible re‐introduction of the death penalty. The Minister assured us that Russia intended to comply with the obligations arising from its entry to the Council of Europe, which, I would remind you, includes a moratorium on the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Schroedter mentioned a problem concerning specific examples. I think that in my perhaps general answer, I have answered these more specific questions.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fassa </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT) </span> Mr President, a veto by one of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council has blocked the extension of the mandate of the UN preventive deployment force in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia because that country has entered into diplomatic relations with Taiwan. That is extremely serious, particularly bearing in mind the institutions to which this House belongs and the nature of the United Nations. In both cases, in fact, we are dealing with organisations designed to overcome the kind of nationalistic tendencies which underlie the veto by the People's Republic of China. And yet, the United Nations' force has played an important part in keeping the peace, not least by preventing the threat of the conflict in Kosovo spilling over into Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community institutions must therefore take resolute action to get the veto lifted. But at the same time, it is essential that we have, as of now, the ability to make a virtue of a vice: if the United Nations Security Council fails to take a positive decision, the European Union and its Member States would have to shoulder the responsibilities hitherto exercised by UNPREDEP, in conjunction with the other institutions, primarily NATO and the Western European Union. That could act as an important incentive, albeit in very sad circumstances, encouraging us to put into effect the foreign and security policy that everyone claims to believe in, but which is all too rarely put into practice.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Dupuis </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span><span class="italic"> – (FR)</span> Mr President, I regret the fact that this resolution limits itself to stating the obvious, as it is clear that neither the United States nor the European Union can give in to the veto, to the attempts of the People"s Republic of China to blackmail us over the presence of troops to guarantee peace and security in Macedonia. It is therefore clear that solutions will have to be found. These are already being considered with a view to replacing, if necessary, the current formula with another formula that will not be met by a Chinese veto.</p>
<p class="contents">I also regret the fact that, since everyone is talking about stability in Macedonia, we have not dealt with the real issue of stability in Macedonia, in other words, its economic development, its democratic development and, above all, its swift entry into the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the European Union is absent, which I find absolutely scandalous, and the Commission has set out an incomprehensible policy. I hope that Mr de Silguy will also be able to mention this matter to his colleague Mr van den Broek this evening. The Union"s funds to Macedonia are being reduced by ECU 3 million. Given the difficulties that Macedonia is facing, this is truly staggering. Moreover, everything has been done, and is still being done, to convince the Macedonian authorities that they will only be able to ask to join the European Union after they have ratified the cooperation agreement and the association agreement. They will therefore have to wait for decades before they can present a request for accession. This is wrong from both a legal and political point of view. Therefore, we have launched a campaign directed at Mr Georgievski asking him to present a request for accession to the European Union immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">Here is a postcard with a lovely picture of the flag of the European Union, and, in the middle of that flag, the Macedonian flag, so that, in the coming months, Macedonia may be an official candidate for membership of the European Union.</p>

In fact, I cannot recall any recent use of the veto in the Security Council by a major power, be it Russia or, as in many cases, the United States, which was actually justified, but that is another matter, and there is little to be gained by debating it here.</p>
<p class="contents">I am entirely in favour of the aim of the resolution that the mandate of UNPREDEP should be extended if at all possible and that provision should be made for military protection of the Macedonian borders, which will not only afford protection to Macedonia itself but will also protect the observers in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as our aid to Macedonia is concerned, I should like to make one thing clear: we can probably never help enough, but the crux of the matter is that our aid should be used effectively, that the country itself should have the capacity to absorb the aid, and it is up to the government, of course, to create that capacity. There have undoubtedly been some missed opportunities in the past. The new government is doing its best on issues ranging from the Albanian question – on which, I am glad to say, some progress has been made – to the economic and social situation. But, however much political continuity can be guaranteed, we should not raise any false hopes. Whether Macedonia manages to find its way to Europe will depend primarily on its own efforts, and the way to Europe in the sense of the European Union will naturally be a long one, whenever the membership application may be submitted.</p>

But this also reveals all the limitations of the Security Council in its current form and therefore the need for Europe, as a whole, to seek to change the current UN system. However, given that the problems of Macedonia are real ones – and we have only to remember what is happening next door to that region, in Kosovo, to appreciate the importance of continuing with the UNPREDEP mandate – it is clear that we Greens also believe that, were it to prove necessary, the European Union should shoulder its own responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Green Group also considers it appropriate to extend the debate on Macedonia to Bosnia‐Herzegovina, to deal with the problem of the Brcko corridor, and it has therefore tabled a number of amendments to that effect.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pack </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the only republic of the former Yugoslavia to survive the demise of that state more or less without bloodshed and to achieve statehood without warfare was Macedonia. There is absolutely no doubt that our preventive measures were instrumental in this. We were there in the territory of the former Yugoslavia to prevent trouble, and we deployed UN forces on the border between Serbia and Macedonia – and now these preventive measures have been scrapped. It is incomprehensible to me that a Chinese veto in the Security Council should jeopardise the safety of Macedonia. There is surely something wrong if it is possible to veto preventive measures when they have finally been implemented and, what is more, to take such action for quite transparent reasons which could effectively be described as revenge for poor little Macedonia having had the temerity to recognise Taiwan. We can all well imagine why it did so. It hoped that recognition would bring it a great deal of investment and financial aid, which of course it could never obtain from China.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, China and Russia have often used their veto in the Security Council to prevent us from providing military assistance to people and nations that are subject to persecution and aggression, as has been happening for a year and a half in Kosovo, and as was the case in Bosnia for a number of years. Something is rotten in this UN Charter. It ought to be designed in such a way that preventive measures, at least, cannot be vetoed, and it should naturally allow intervention to thwart the plans of a dictator and criminal, thereby protecting people and nations from such criminals, as in Bosnia and Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the crisis in the neighbouring country, in Kosovo, there is a real need to avoid any instability in Macedonia. The UN forces known as UNPREDEP have helped to do that. They have not only contributed by their presence but have also, as I discovered in my own conversations, helped to bring together the Albanian minority and the Macedonians in special discussion forums on specific subjects in order to promote harmony between the two ethnic communities.</p>
<p class="contents">Until the Security Council can finally decide to renew the UNPREDEP mandate, to which end we have included a special appeal to China in our resolution, the NATO forces deployed along the border to protect the OSCE observers in Kosovo will have to perform that function too in order to prevent insecurity from spilling over into Macedonia at the very time when the country is developing fruitful cooperation among the peoples within its territory. I should also like to endorse the view of Mr Dupuis that we in the European Union should support these extremely promising steps towards fruitful cooperation by forging additional links with Macedonia, including the provision of financial aid. The Macedonians have earned it.</p>

That has thrust us very suddenly into an extremely dangerous situation, because the situation was relatively stable until then. I myself have been in Macedonia several times, and I know what these UNPREDEP forces on the border have achieved and how they have enabled the Macedonian Government, which is indeed of high quality, to launch a process of development that would have stood up to close scrutiny. The Macedonians were criticised because they recognised Taiwan, but there is one thing we must not forget. The nation we are discussing lives in indescribably wretched conditions, for which the border conflicts, incidentally, must take much of the blame. And of course we must remember that the Greek blockade in the south and the Serbian blockade in the north have stifled economic growth, since the major trade routes all ran from north to south.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also recognise that sizeable loans have now been secured from Taiwan, because none could be expected from other sources. A government simply cannot be criticised for adopting such a course of action. That is why we must reflect on how we can guarantee Macedonian security again with forces from Europe, and in that context, I can only recommend that you look at the past. It is time we began to take our lead from the Organisation of African Unity. They more or less sort out their own affairs. We always ask the United Nations, instead of simply saying ‘Europe for the Europeans!"</p>

Like all the Members who have just spoken, the Commission therefore sincerely regrets the failure to extend the mandate of UN troops in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the recognition of Taiwan by the FYROM, China decided, as you know, to exercise its veto in the Security Council against the extension of the mandate of UNPREDEP. The presidency of the European Union tried to get the authorities in Peking and Skopje to reach a consensus, but these attempts were unsuccessful. It is unfortunate that a bilateral disagreement should be behind this Security Council decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that an international presence is more necessary than ever in this part of the Balkans, following the withdrawal of UNPREDEP. It is appealing for the participation of the WEU in a Petersberg‐type mission in the area.</p>
<p class="contents">I apologise to Mr Dupuis for being unable to answer him either with regard to the level of aid or the request for accession. I had prepared a response to the issue of the breakdown in diplomatic relations, but once again I promise to pass on his question to my colleague Commissioner van den Broek this evening.</p>

It also demands our attention because it affects a region, the Alpine region, which should be particularly prized in the process of Community integration. The Alpine area actually provides a culture that is unitary, broad, clear, specific and in harmony with itself, and which has for centuries been accustomed to being not a barrier but a link between Europe, north and south and east and west. The national frontiers, which gradually became more rigid during the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth century, then sought to some extent to break up the Alpine region; and the same is true of the national legislations which failed to take account of the special nature of the region and the special characteristics of what we might call the culture of the mountains.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the avalanches which have struck various areas of this extremely important part of Europe should serve to draw our attention to these issues, which go far beyond the natural disaster, and stir us into planning for a range of measures – not only short‐term and preventive measures, but ones that are designed to tackle this problem and this situation in a comprehensive way.</p>

We are also grateful for the special gesture by the European Parliament in granting our request for a minute's silence in honour of the Galtür victims.</p>
<p class="contents">But we do not merely wish to express our general condolences in today's resolution. There is more to it than that. We have combined our expression of sympathy with a request for concrete financial assistance for the disaster area of Paznauntal in the Tirol and for all the other areas, such as those in Italy and France, which were hit by the avalanches.</p>
<p class="contents">We have received support from all the other groups. This is a sign of solidarity that has been extended to us both inside and outside the House. The regions that have sustained long‐term economic damage are particularly grateful for this solidarity. I therefore appeal to the Commission to associate itself with this gesture and to make every effort to ensure that help can be given to the stricken areas as quickly as possible. Europe can demonstrate real solidarity here. I earnestly beg you to do that.</p>

However, the problem that we are faced with today is that of preventing such disasters from re‐occurring.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that we should not underestimate the work being done by the European Union, which, through the Interreg programme, is already funding work on mountain safety in cross‐border regions. I am thinking, in particular, of the experiments that have been carried out in the Mont Blanc massif. Nevertheless, the European Union should take account of the specific nature of mountain regions and increase its aid to the regions that are affected as well as its involvement in preventive measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is difficult to define with any certainty where the avalanches are going to strike, it is clear that the equipment used to detect avalanches has proved to be very effective, and mapping of the risk areas should therefore be refined.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to highlight other factors involved in the prevention of avalanches. Firstly, given the deterioration of the mountain ecosystem, we should call on the Member States to be more vigilant when granting building permits. In the same way, the development of mountain sports – both winter and summer sports – should lead to the organisation of genuine multilingual information campaigns in order to give a sense of responsibility to those participating in such sports.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has tabled several amendments on these two points. I hope that you will support them because this is the <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> condition to ensure that the mountains are still the area of freedom we love so much, despite the fact that the European Union is not paying enough attention to them.</p>

Otherwise, Mr Rübig, we should have to ask why, when this matter is so close to Mrs Stenzel's heart, she is not here in person. But that is not what this debate is about. We are debating what we can do to help with resources from the European Union that are available now for the various areas, and we urge the Commission and its staff to do everything in their power to cut through the red tape and ensure that these funds can be injected quickly and used efficiently. The areas concerned may not be in the poorest regions of this continent, but they are areas which need our solidarity in their present plight.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course there is every justification for asking a secondary question: could these disasters have been prevented? What is the settlement structure and what is the planning policy in these areas where there may be a risk of avalanches? I would not like to claim that building plans and settlement patterns in all our Alpine areas have been designed so as to avoid potential risks. Many things which are done in the name of tourism or economic interests are not particularly prudent and could certainly have repercussions and lead to disasters, if the worst came to the worst. Be that as it may, as far as I am aware there is no evidence at all, at least in many of the areas we are discussing today, that human error or political mistakes were at the root of these disasters. And so it really only remains for me to ask the Commission to cut through the red tape and to help quickly wherever help is needed.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">de Silguy, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. – (FR)</span> Mr President, firstly, with regard to the distressing subject of avalanches, the Commission wishes to express its distress and to offer its heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims of these events.</p>
<p class="contents">In answer to the questions that have just been raised, I would point out that the Union has various tools to help prevent disasters and to deal with their effects. Firstly, as far as prevention is concerned, the European Union can help the mountain regions, notably through afforestation programmes for agricultural land. Objective 5b of the ERDF and the Structural Funds also allows us to implement forestry measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission"s proposals on the ‘rural development" aspect of Agenda 2000 will further increase the possibilities for aid for afforestation and forestry improvement, if the Council agrees with the Commission"s proposals. In the context of these proposals, compensatory payments could be made in order to preserve and improve the ecological stability of forests in areas where they have a protective and environmental role that is in the public interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of the 5b programmes in the Tyrol and Vorarlberg areas, the European Union is cofinancing the improvement of agricultural land, land management measures, planning and advice on the agricultural use of areas that are ecologically sensitive.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to what Mrs Leperre‐Verrier just said, the Commission also supports the idea to draw up forestry maps and forestry development plans.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and still on the issue of mapping, the ERDF can support cartographical studies of the mountainous areas that are at risk within the framework of transnational cooperation programmes. Initiatives could also be cofinanced by Interreg, especially during its next programming period.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the tools do exist, and I can assure you that the Commission will do all in its power and spare no efforts to put those tools to use, especially in areas that are at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, moving on from prevention to dealing with the effects of avalanches, I would remind you that in 1997, Parliament blocked heading B4‐3400, which was precisely aimed at providing emergency aid for the victims of disasters. The budgetary line B4‐3300, which relates to civil protection and environmental emergencies, does not provide for intervention to reconstruct damaged areas through economic aid or emergency aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, it is possible to re‐focus the existing provisions on measures to re‐establish the potential for agricultural and forestry production that was harmed within the existing financial envelopes. It is also possible to transfer funds between the Länder.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in the framework of the Community action programme for civil protection, the Commission is prepared to examine – within the limits of its funding capacities – any proposals submitted by national or local authorities to improve their ability to act when disasters occur.</p>
