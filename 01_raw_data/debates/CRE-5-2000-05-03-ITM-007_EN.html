<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pomés Ruiz (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, the policy on Commission appointments is, without doubt, a key element within the framework of the reform to which President Prodi is committed. It is a key element because this House shares the determination of Mr Kinnock, the Vice-President responsible for reform, to make appointments based not on national quotas, but on merit. At the moment, therefore, while Parliament has still not taken a position on administrative reform – which we are observing with great attention and which we all hope will, this time, truly be a great success – I wish to say that it is appropriate at this stage to watch how the Commission is putting these good intentions, these projects to reform the appointments policy, into practice. Furthermore, I believe that transparency is a good thing, not only in terms of the control which this House has to carry out, but it is also good in itself. We should bear in mind that the appointments policy provides motivation in some cases and not in others. It promotes some officials at the expense of others and this policy may serve as an example, in terms of solving the principal problem faced by the Community structure – I am delighted that President Prodi and Mr Kinnock agree with this analysis – which is the lack of motivation amongst officials. It is therefore very important that we try to see that good intentions are accompanied by good practices.</p>
<p class="contents">We all agree on the need to make progress on national quotas, and that appointments should be made on the basis of merit, but this cannot justify certain regional imbalances. At the moment, according to the data available to us, which I am grateful for because the transparency process is a very good thing, most A1 or A2 senior officials are of the same nationality as the Commissioner, way above the German senior officials, for example. There are clear imbalances. To give another example, it cannot be put down to merit that there are 22 A1 or A2 Spaniards and 16 Belgian ones.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that in a procedure which needs to be transparent, merit is easily explicable and comprehensible. Merit cannot explain overall imbalances or imbalances in certain Directorates-General, in some of which there is a clear predominance of officials of a certain nationality.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that there is success in the search for equality between the sexes. Nobody would say – I certainly would not – that the fact that there are so few A1 or A2 women is due to an assessment of merit. On the contrary, we are surrounded by women who are much more valuable than us, my wife to name but one. I must tell my friends that behind every great woman there is a great man, because everybody knows that my wife is worth much more than I am. I am grateful to the Socialist spokesperson, who knows my wife, for agreeing with me. It is important that we fulfil the commitment to double the number of female appointments. We will closely monitor this appointments policy, which must be open and decisive.</p>
<p class="contents">We are happy to accept the new appointments within the Commission, in particular that of the Secretary-General. Many believed that new policies require new faces and, in that context, perhaps the changeover of the Secretary-General should be supported. At least that is what I think.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by saying that when you come in July to explain the changes you are going to make to the procedures for appointments based on merit, I am sure you will have the agreement and support of all the Groups in this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I substantially agree with the points that he very effectively made.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact I would only diverge on one point. He may be right that behind every great woman is a great man – there is a debate about that. What I am certain is true is that behind every great man is a very, very surprised mother-in-law.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member is, I know, very clear about the fact that responsibility for employment policies and patterns in the Commission, as a separate institution, lies with the Commission itself. However, in order to provide useful information to this House and to the wider public, I am glad to respond to the two questions which the honourable Member has put down.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to give full and detailed answers to his first question, whilst saving some of the time of the House, I have sent a paper to the honourable Member listing the number of appointments of senior officials made in the Commission since taking office and also giving the names, nationalities and previous functions of all concerned. To provide comprehensive detail, that paper also sets out the total number of senior officials from each nationality in the Commission and of the total numbers of all A grade staff of each nationality in the Commission. A copy of that paper has also been provided to the secretariat-general of this Parliament for information and, naturally, it will be generally available to honourable Members.</p>
<p class="contents">In this oral answer, therefore, I will summarise the situation relating to senior appointments as at last Thursday, 27 April. Since the present Commission took office, six appointments have been made involving promotions to grade A1. They related to three officials of German nationality, two of Italian nationality and one of Irish nationality. There have been fourteen other transfers at Director-General or Deputy Director-General level, which did not involve promotion in grade, although in four cases relating to Spanish, French, German and British officials, the changes meant advances in responsibility to full Director-General posts.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same period 19 appointments involving promotion to grade A2 have been made. These related to officials of the following nationalities: 5 British, 4 Italian, 3 Belgian, 2 German, 1 Dutch, 1 French, 1 Spanish, 1 Irish and 1 Austrian. Eleven transfers at Director level which did not involve promotion in grade have also been made. In addition, two external appointments have been made in this period, one of a German national at Director-General level, and one of an Austrian national at Director level.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary therefore, a total of 25 promotions to senior appointments have been made since this Commission took office. Six of the officials are Italian nationals, five are German, five are British, three Belgian, two Irish, one Dutch, one French, one Austrian and one Spanish. These figures are accurate as of 27 April 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">As the House will know, in an international and multinational institution like the Commission, it is essential, as the honourable Member said, that the allocation of jobs broadly reflects the diversity of the Union that we serve and uses abilities effectively. Those principles of balance and quality are clearly set down in the Staff Regulations and the Commission is committed to applying them fully at all levels. As in any large organisation there is continual change amongst the staff of the Commission as people move, retire, become recruited, or promoted. As a result, a still-photograph of the staff profile at any fixed time does not, and cannot, give a complete picture.</p>
<p class="contents">To be properly judged, balance must consequently be assessed and be maintained over the medium term and the Commission is also actively committed to ensuring that.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to the honourable Member’s second question relating to the rules and criteria applied to senior appointments, I draw the attention of the House to the decisions on the subject which the Commission adopted and published last September and last December. Those decisions constitute specific legal rules for the institution rather than a generalised code of conduct. Copies of those rules have been sent to the honourable Member and they are available on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background the following information may be useful to the House: the guiding principle of the system which the Commission uses is that appointments to all senior posts will be determined on evidence of the merit of candidates, including managerial capacity and other relevant abilities. In order to take necessary account of the geographical balance to which I referred earlier and to do so in compliance with the essential principle of meritocratic appointment, specific provision is being made.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has rejected the concept of quotas because of its counter-productive rigidity, and also because it would breach Staff Regulations. It has, however, adopted a decision to ensure that all Member State nationalities should be represented by at least 1 qualified person in the most senior post, Director-General or equivalent, and consistent with that, the Commission has given fresh emphasis to assess effectively proven merit as a prerequisite of highest positions. The effects will be to maintain high standards of quality amongst the officials who lead the staff in the Commission in its vital policy, treaty application and management tasks and to do so whilst ensuring the broad geographical balance which is central to the character of an institution serving the whole of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The system for making promotion to the highest posts facilitates these purposes of sustaining merit and balance and I will summarise its operation for the information of the House.</p>
<p class="contents">Candidates for A1 and A2 jobs are interviewed by a panel of senior officials which has been assisted in the lifetime of this Commission by an advisory external expert with relevant experience in executive selection. That panel makes an objective assessment of the professional and managerial qualities and capabilities that are relevant to the post and recommends a shortlist. The shortlisted candidates are then interviewed by the portfolio Commissioner who is most directly concerned with the post and, in the case of A1 officials, by the Commissioner for personnel, who at the moment is myself. The Commissioner responsible for personnel then formally proposes to the College the candidate who has been agreed upon with the portfolio Commissioner and with the President of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of appointments of Directors, the agreement of the relevant Director-General must also be obtained. At all times the panel, the Commissioners and the College are conscious of the commitment to quality and balance and therefore apply that commitment consistently in the interests of the Commission and of the Union. I can confirm that all appointments made by this Commission have been in accordance with these rules which are themselves based on Article 29 of the Staff Regulations and that will continue to be the course followed.</p>
<p class="contents">I apologise for the length of time I have taken up but, naturally, I wanted to give the House the most comprehensive information. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I very much welcome the opportunity presented by the question tabled by my colleague, Mr Pomés Ruiz, to be able to start the debate on what will be many issues in connection with Commissioner Kinnock’s reforms. I would like to thank him very much for the very comprehensive and open response that he has given to that question.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we have rightly focussed on what are the absolutely key appointments at the top of any organisation. After all, your reform, Commissioner Kinnock, is going to have to be led from the top and we very much welcome the confirmation you have given about the way in which the top appointments have been handled.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like to do in developing on Mr Pomés Ruiz’ question is to table one or two other points to you in connection with some of the more detailed aspects of the White Paper and the change in organisation that you have proposed. Clearly the very ambitious reform contained in your paper is going to be a formidable task for the managers you appoint. To achieve your objectives of moving the Commission towards a world-leading international public service, it is clear that the appointments and capabilities of your team are going to be critical.</p>
<p class="contents">You say in your White Paper that there is a real need to raise management skills and create a common management culture across the Commission. I would like to know first of all how far you feel that management culture is now being developed by your new top team and how far that is starting to be communicated through the Commission’s organisation. The important and welcome news that we have had today about the appointment of a new Secretary-General, Mr David O’Sullivan, raises the question whether he has been involved already and will that have an impact on the development that you have already set in train.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I wanted to raise has to do with what you identify in your White Paper – and I agree with this entirely – about the real challenges for any service organisation which is decentralising and delegating responsibilities to reporting managers, empowering them to take decisions and to have that all-important control of budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like your assurance that the new team that comes in has those skills and also, and this is particularly important, that it also has a commitment to developing team-work in the Commission. This is going to become more and more important as we get more information-technology driven solutions, more horizontal team-working of the type that I know is moving into areas like the information society. Can we have your assurance that your senior team is going to be open-minded and looking at these new solutions?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, your White Paper quite rightly notes that action is going to have to be taken when managers are not performing to the expected standard. It would not be surprising, given the changes, that there are some people who feel uncomfortable with this. Can you confirm that probationary periods, as set out in your White Paper, have been included in the contracts for the new appointments, how long those periods are and that systematic assessments of performance are included in those appointments? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van den Berg (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I too would like to thank the Commissioner for his reply. It is clear from the current debate that the European Parliament has asked the Commission to rotate senior posts and has already lent its support to this idea. We have also asked to “de-flag” senior posts. We want to see people appointed on merit and quality, and we as the Group of the Party of European Socialists very much welcome the action taken by the Commission so far, in response to Parliament’s requests. We have also ascertained – and I must say that a number of the questions raised a moment ago are really starting to confuse the issue again – that the Commission is responsible for its appointments and that we as Parliament do not want to take the Commission’s place, especially not as far as appointments are concerned, because we would then be throwing everything back into disarray, and I felt that some of the questions were already heading in that direction again. I would actually like to return to the very root cause of this discussion. If it were to obtain these statistics, I believe that we already had them at our disposal. If something else were going on, then we must have heard about it through the grapevine because over the past few weeks, rumour had it that some aspects were useless, that certain appointments or certain people had not been transferred and that some of them did not come up to scratch. It has all gone quiet now. All we have now is a number of very innocent, factual issues. If this is about the internal reforms as a whole, then we could say: OK, here is a White Paper and here we have procedures we agreed on. This very exciting and very extensive change is something both the Commission and Parliament want, but the ball is now back in the Commission’s court. We have precise data. The Commission has to come up with proposals on these points. Are we not up to speed, or is there something up with the Commission? As recently as, let me think, seven months ago, we supported and appointed the Commission with an overwhelming majority, and now all of a sudden these questions are being asked. Should this be seen as an attack on the Commission? Is the Commission all of a sudden incapable or is this a sudden, inverse kind of declaration of support on the part of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and that is why this Group is asking the Commission these questions? Those seemed to be the undertones for a fleeting moment. Our friends from the European People’s Party have thrown us into a bit of confusion because we are fully agreed on the key points. The rotation system is clear. The statistical data we received in this respect does not lead us to believe that anything should be amiss. Neither have I heard that anything is wrong with the performance, quite the opposite, in fact. That does not, of course, detract from the fact that, if you say you want to abandon national quotas, each one of us as we are here today would like to see some geographical balance in it all. In fact, the Commission too has admitted to this, without rushing to attach national identity to the individual figures, individual posts, because we would then be back to square one, as we would be pushing aside the merits of the case and forcing the national flags back into use, which would take each one of us some time to digest. I am speaking up today as a Dutch national. Despite this, I do not think we should operate at national level but should cover a wider level. Surely this position could not be any clearer?</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add one more point which has not been discussed here but which I would like to bring up. The question came up: should someone who has held a senior post be transferred to a job in the public sector elsewhere without any further ado? This is a question which was asked originally, which has now disappeared, of course, and which has meanwhile been milked in the press. What should we make of it? In our opinion, we really need new standards. This is what we asked the Commission for. The Commission was willing to produce these new standards. What you cannot do is judge the individuals who are not yet bound by these standards. If you ask me, you would be shooting the Commission in the foot and, in my opinion, you would be shooting yourself in the foot more so than the Commission and this is not helpful. In short, we are giving our wholehearted support to reform and we hope from the bottom of our hearts that the deadline is met. Since Commissioner Kinnock is present today, I would appreciate it if he could confirm whether he is on target with his staff and people. That is a mammoth task. It is our task to give each other very critical guidance, and to ensure that reform is brought about. We cannot see how these factual questions, which do not show up any defects, could contribute to this debate, unless there were ulterior motives towards the Commission from the start. As I understand it, the <span class="italic">salto mortale</span> of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats could be interpreted as a declaration of support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, we would then be far removed from the efficiency required by the Commission. Because when you made your proposals back in January, and we studied them carefully, it was clear that the Commission’s appointment policy – and that is how we put it then – is a matter for the Commission and we should not interfere with it, unless there is obvious cause for this. We continue to endorse the guidelines you gave at the time for this personnel and appointment policy. First and foremost, appointments must be based on the candidate’s merits. This is how it was described in your document and I think that this clause should be retained. It is clear that we continue to support this. A candidate’s aptitude for managing an office is one of the key aspects, and I heard you emphasise this in your reply a moment ago. You made it clear once again what procedures are followed when appointing top officials.</p>
<p class="contents">You have also already stated in your action plan that a geographical balance should be kept, which was, in fact, what the question was about. This too seems logical to me, yet it would not be beneficial if we were to rely on this provision too much and be too strict about it. After all, if you were to do this, in other words, if you were to weigh it up extremely carefully, then I think personnel policy would become impossible in the long-run and you would be very far-removed from the efficiency required in this type of matter. On behalf of my Group, I would say that this question was somewhat superfluous. One can enter into a large-scale discussion on the decisions taken today with regard to the nationalities of the people who have been moved, appointed or who have left. This discussion would be meaningless. The question which should be raised is whether or not this benefits the functioning of the Commission and have the procedures laid down by the Commission been followed? This is the question we need to ask ourselves. Whether the person involved is Dutch or of any other nationality is of little relevance in the great scheme of things. What I do like, Commissioner, is that you, in your information, provide evidence of a transparent policy. I also welcome the fact that, based on your information, it appears that there are no major imbalances. I feel this should be acknowledged. We have been given important information, in my opinion, and I would therefore like to say by way of conclusion: let us not stand in the way of the Commission’s reform process but support it instead. We should not complicate matters – especially with regard to personnel policy, which is one of the most difficult topics – by asking questions which are not really relevant. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must enquire as to whether the panel actually interviewed the applicants, from whom the leader of the Institute for Future Studies was selected. I somewhat doubt whether any lengthy interview process was involved in filling the post in which Mr Levi did so very well. I would also like to mention that all the institutions should in fact adopt these rules concerning the appointment of senior officials, and we are finally able to say that the European Parliament has also adopted good principles regarding the appointment of senior officials, which must therefore take place very openly.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make an observation regarding representation on a geographical basis. It is quite right that we should aim to move away from national quotas, but that should not mean we should have a hidden criterion that actually favours the notion of representatives of large Member States and major language groups in senior positions. We must realise this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me say a word about equality. Commissioner Kinnock faithfully made a list of the Commission’s senior appointments and promotions, but, Commissioner, you did not say how many women were nominated for, or promoted to, these posts. I would ask you to take a look at your list with your “gender policy spectacles” on and tell us the answer, because the Commission really has to set equality targets a lot higher than it has ever done before.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The PPE Group’s question for an oral answer was to be one of the major debates of a part-session – and a passionate plea was made for the debate to be held in April – but, today, the PPE Group is I know not where, for it is certainly conspicuous by its absence from this Chamber. It may be that the decisions you adopted this morning have in some way assuaged the Group’s thirst for knowledge, but this Chamber appears to be unusually empty for a debate on such a major issue. </p>
<p class="contents">I supported the submission of the question. I have been wondering since September, Vice-President, how it could be that such objective, such perfect, such universally acceptable criteria of competence, merit and so forth were met solely, surprise surprise, by officials living in or originally from certain island countries, while these same qualities did not appear to be present in officials from other, more misshapen countries – boot-shaped countries, for example. Let us forget the figures for a moment and focus on the functions. The A1 grade covers a wide range of concepts: an official could hold an A1 post and have important duties, such as Director-General for Development, for the Press and the Media or other Directorate-Generals, or he could be an aide. How can it be – and this is a question which I continue to ask – that these criteria of merit, surprise surprise, have only worked in favour of certain nationalities? This is what is to be inferred from a careful examination which is not merely concerned with numbers. </p>
<p class="contents">I continue to ponder this question, Vice-President, as I ponder the question of the appointment of senior Commission officials – officials or chefs de cabinet – who then unexpectedly book a flight and, via some European airport, London rather than Malpensa, desert the Commission for the private sector. I feel that this is also a question which, although it does not form part of our question for an oral answer, would merit a debate at another time in its own right. Personally, I feel very strongly that there is a need for this. </p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I feel that the Commission is making the mistake of giving Commission staff themselves too much say in the selection of new staff. It should retain its right to make such decisions and not delegate this task to its administrative staff. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Morgan (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, first of all Mr Dell’Alba is certainly right with the first part of his question. The tone of the question when it was put seems very different from the tone that we are hearing now in the Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we have to say that the White Paper reforms are progressing. They are progressing slowly but Rome was not built in a day and we must remember that.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that there is a timetable – one that we have all agreed to and must be kept. What I would like to address, before I look at the substance, is the question behind this question, – that is what we really have to look at here. It strikes me – and I will not be quite as subtle as Mr van den Berg – that the tone of this question seems to be the same tone as the Stauner report, the original Stauner report that was comprehensively rejected within the Budget Control Committee – the same tone that was set in the explanatory statement which was rejected by Parliament as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all desperate to see reform but it will take time. The new Commission has been in office for only seven months. It was approved by the European Parliament by a huge majority. The question we really have to ask here is not to the Commission but to the PPE Group as to the motivation behind the question. It strikes me as being clearly politically motivated, trying to undermine the work done on reform, trying to shoot this new bird down before it has taken flight. This is because there is an element within the PPE Group, and I do not include Mr Pomés Ruiz in this, interested in wrecking the tactics of the Commission, wrecking Commission reform and wrecking the EU. And the PPE Group is being hijacked by that element within the group.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this Commission is very open to taking on board some – I hope all – of Parliament’s concerns and criticisms, because we have criticisms too. But there is a time and place for that and this will be when we look at Mr Pomés Ruiz’ response to the White Paper. The PSE Group want to engage in a constructive debate because we are interested in the outcome of reform, not in scoring short-term political points that do nothing but damage the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning very quickly to the substance of the questions: in the Commission hearings the European Parliament asked for rotation of A1 and A2 posts and to end national flags on senior jobs. The Commission has taken positive steps since they came into power, ensuring that appointments are made on the basis of merit. Of course, in a multinational institution, we must be sensitive to national considerations but these must be seen within the medium and long term. As the Commissioner said, you cannot take a snapshot halfway through. We should be interested in checking systems and not checking individuals. The role of the European Parliament is to keep the Commission on its toes. We want to see appointments on merit but that does not mean interfering and questioning every single senior appointment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a quick point on improving the equal opportunities aspect of the Commission’s reform proposals. Mrs Hautala’s question was very well put and we also would like an answer to that. We do not currently think that the proposals go far enough in terms of gender mainstreaming and equal opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">On parts 3 and 4 of this oral question I understand that the Conference of Presidents agreed on April 6 that these two questions should be removed. That being the case, I would like to ask you, Mr President, to look into why the services had still not removed those parts today. That is a serious problem. The fact is that Commission reform is going ahead. Mr Prodi has made some announcements today as the head of the organisation. Again, most of it looks at mobility but I would like to ask the Commissioner why the role of the new post, Director of the Economic and Political Council, was not advertised. That is a post that we would like to have seen advertised.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to ask the PPE Group to refrain from such politically motivated and unconstructive questions as we have here. I am confident that Mr Pomés Ruiz will not take that attitude when he responds to the White Paper, but please do not let your group be hijacked by a minority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since the Commission delved into the details on 27 April, perhaps we can be told how many men and women there are in category A posts, not in category A posts generally, but broken down by grade, i.e. A1, A2, A3 and so on, for what is interesting is to see the figures broken down in that way. More often than not, it turns out that there are no women at all in top posts. And, in this connection, we could perhaps be informed about the composition of the panel – which should be an objective panel – in terms of gender. Perhaps in terms of country of origin, too, but in any case in terms of gender. Who, in the end, is to evaluate the shortlist that has been mentioned? More often than not, it is exclusively men who carry out the final evaluation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps I could risk some superficiality, because of the time, by trying to answer the specific questions raised.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all Mr Harbour’s questions, which typically were perceptive and constructive, related to how far we thought that the commitment to the development of managerial skills and culture was being achieved. I will just stipulate one or two points that are evidence of progress. I would not claim they were perfect and this list is not exhaustive.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as training is concerned, which, as Mr Harbour knows, is fundamental to the kind of changes that we want to achieve, the comprehensive programme of training for all managers in the Commission which should continue over two years commences this month. Secondly we are already embarked on the process of collecting mission statements from every Directorate-General. Most have submitted theirs. There is also the establishment of task assessments which we will do through a series of pilot schemes that will affect around one quarter of the Directorate-Generals in the first instance and then the compilation of job descriptions which will be undertaken over the period up to the end of July this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The process of evaluation of staff, and that of course includes managers at all levels, is being refined and will be introduced. As Mr Harbour says, the role and activity of the Secretary-General in all of these activities and indeed in many others is crucial. I believe that Mr O’Sullivan has a very strong commitment to the direction set out by the White Paper and will be a notable successor to his extremely talented and committed predecessor, Mr Trojan, who will take up a new post from the end of this month.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as empowering managers is concerned, the best instance we can give is that from May 1 we inaugurated the new internal audit service, the central financial service and we will shortly be having the first meeting of the Audit Progress Committee. These are the first crucial steps in the decentralisation of financial control, which is of course critical to the empowerment of management at all levels in a money-handling institution. Mr Harbour will be familiar with my view that as a consequence of making that central and measurable change, subject continually to examination, we will get a reverberating change of culture in the wider managerial style and operation of the House.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, he is right to stipulate that team leadership, team working and team building are all critical to the effective operation of modern managerial skills. We are nurturing that by the combination of structural change and supplementary training, evaluation and the appointment system. Obviously too, the consideration of probationary periods in contracts of appointment for managers will be a strong supplement to the direction which we want to take. But to do that comprehensively will require amendments to the Staff Regulations and I am looking forward to the cooperation of Parliament and the Council in gaining the changes in Community legislation which are necessary to facilitate that further development.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr van den Berg was correct, and indeed kind and generous, in re-asserting the fact that the Commission must be responsible for its appointments and its personnel policies. I presume that he will follow through his enquiry as to why this question was asked. I can only say that I welcome the opportunity to provide comprehensive information.</p>
<p class="contents">I am reminded that, in the hearings, correctly and forcefully, several Members of this House raised the question and indeed made assertive demands for de-flagging of senior posts, for the complete abandonment of formal or informal quotas and for the rotation of officials holding A1 and A2 posts. Those are principles that I not only agreed with at the time, together with my colleagues in the Commission, but have actively been seeking to put into effect ever since.</p>
<p class="contents">If I can come to the point relating to new standards and outside posts, a point also raised absolutely correctly by Mr Dell’Alba, who has a question down on these matters and I am looking forward to answering it, I should draw the attention of the House to the fact that in the course of giving my attention to a specific case, which related to the departure of my own Chef de Cabinet, Mr Andrew Cahn, it became very obvious to me that the current arrangements relating to authorising the movement of permanent and temporary officials to outside employment do not have adequate clarity or consistency. In practice, the course of action and rigorous scrutiny which I requested to be applied in the case of Mr Cahn meant that his case was dealt with very thoroughly and entirely properly. I do not believe, however, that the Commission, or indeed other institutions, should have to rely on individual motivation by officials or by Commissioners and on rather ad hoc means of applying principles, which are, to say the least, rather generalised.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore asked the Director-General of Administration and Personnel to produce a draft for rules that would take into account best practice in the administrations of Member States and of other international public bodies and to give precision to procedures. Having such rules would obviously be the best means of ensuring transparency, consistency and practical guidance which would be in the interests of all parties, especially when, as Members have reminded us in the course of the debate, Member States and institutions are increasingly keen to encourage more exchange between national and EU administrations and between the public and private sectors. Naturally, when I have a proposal to make for new and improved arrangements, I will put them to my colleagues in the Commission and subsequently report them to this House and the other institutions for consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Can I take the opportunity of Mr Sterckx’s contribution to underline the point that I made earlier, a point which he wisely acknowledges, that no one, in consideration of the broad geographical balance to which the Commission is committed, should try to take a still-photograph of the profile of the staff at the Commission and represent that as in any way a permanent state of affairs. A moving picture is the only one that tells the full story and the Commission is totally committed to ensuring that priority is given to merit and full and proper account is taken of geographical balance, which is essential in a multinational serving institution like the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">On Mrs Hautala’s point, I would simply say that none of the appointments that have been announced today was the subject of a panel and there is a very straightforward legal reason for that. Mr David O’Sullivan, for instance, will take up his post by rotation as provided for under the Staff Regulations and equally as provided for under the Staff Regulations, Mr Ricardo Levi is a temporary official and moves with his post to his new position. So in legal, procedural and employment policy terms, the use of the panel system for promotion and appointment purposes was not required by the existing law in the case of appointments of that kind. I think that also responds to the point raised by Mrs Morgan on that subject.</p>
<p class="contents">The question was also raised of women’s appointments. Of the 25 very senior appointments that have been made by this Commission since last September, 4 have been of women officials. That to me is modest. Mrs Hautala and others will know of my ambitions in this respect. I would only say that since that is nearly 20% of the total number of appointments, we are on target for this year’s commitment to ensure that we achieve at least a 20% advance in the number of women who are appointed. In the course of the rest of the year I can say with certainty that velocity will at least be maintained. Obviously, I would like to see it exceeded because there are a large number of highly capable women, as Mrs Dybkjær pointed out to us, in the Commission, and we want to see that quality properly recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as Mr Dell’Alba’s geographical excursion into islands and boot-shaped countries is concerned, as I say I am looking forward to answering his further question and doing so in great detail. It is significant that the island country, the larger island country, secured in the course of these months under this Commission no additional appointments at A1 level by promotion. The boot-shaped country obtained two such appointments – the boot-shaped country obtained 4 A2 promotions in this period and the big island obtained 5, of which, to the best of my knowledge, none came from Wales. I hope that is of some reassurance to Mr Dell’Alba.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Morgan, inevitably asks from the wilds of Wales ‘Why were there not any Welsh people?’ It is because, Mrs Morgan, whilst I am totally committed to geographical balance, this would mean in Wales having one North Walian and one South Walian or I would generate even more dissatisfaction in the country I love most. But Mrs Morgan did raise intriguing questions about the questions which have been put down; doubtlessly they will be pursued.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to Mrs Dybkjær that in the comprehensive pursuit of our policy for equal opportunities, there will be evidence as the coming months and years pass, of us giving attention from the point of the invitation to applications, right through to initial appointment and promotions, to show that we are making serious efforts to secure substantial advances in the number of women of all ages and all grades who are employed in the Commission. I can only ask honourable Members to wait until the physical evidence is available. But if commitment and the strong and active dedication of members of the current College is anything to go by we will achieve success in all respects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
