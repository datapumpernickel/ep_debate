<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ghilardotti (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, the information, consultation and participation of employees assumed primary importance in the European debate as far back as 1974, when the first social action programme was adopted by the Council. Since then, the issue has featured in many of our debates in this Chamber and the Commission has launched a large number of initiatives, which have met with resistance. Almost all the Member States have a legislative or contractual legal framework in place intended to guarantee the information and consultation of employees. This directive proposes the introduction of minimum information and consultation standards which would be implemented throughout Union territory: after the European Company Statute, the European Works Council Directive and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the directive before us today completes the existing Community and national frameworks, thus contributing to the ultimate purpose of the law in question which is to ensure that adequate preparations are made for the change, that restructuring takes place under acceptable conditions and that due importance is given to the employment objective in the current situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission presented its proposal – a sound proposal – in November 1998, and the European Parliament concluded its first reading in April 1999, adopting a series of amendments to improve it. Only in June 2001 did the Council adopt a common position. In general terms, the common position reflects the position adopted by the Commission following Parliament’s first reading but, if we compare the first reading of the European Parliament with the common position, we see that thirty or so of the amendments made by Parliament were not actually accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I called upon the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs not to repropose all the amendments adopted at first reading but concentrate on the most important points in order to improve the common position. My colleagues – whom I would like to thank for their cooperation – put forward 15 amendments to my proposal, almost all of which serve to reinforce it. After an in-depth debate, we came up with the text on which the House is to vote today. There are 16 amendments and they concern: the procedures for consulting employees, and these are in line with the common position but more specific in identifying problems; the definition of economic and financial information; the exact definition of ‘social partners’, in order to avoid ambiguities; the protection of employees’ representatives, which needs to be better defined in terms of protection against <span class="italic">disadvantage with regard to career, wage and training</span>; suspension of decisions which could result in substantial negative consequences for employees, so that the taking of a final decision can be deferred for a suitable period at the request of employees’ representatives in order to allow time for further negotiation and for a solution acceptable to all parties to be found.</p>
<p class="contents">Transitional periods: this is an extremely sensitive point. We do not feel that specific transitional periods are necessary. Precisely because this directive introduces minimum <span class="italic">standard </span>rights, it must be enforced for all European employees simultaneously.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of penalties is the most sensitive point. It has provoked a deluge of lobbies from all sides of the House. We have decided not to include our initial suggestion of a European penalty with legal effect in our proposal, but we have reinforced the common position, stipulating that it should be the Member States that, whilst respecting the principle of subsidiarity, introduce more stringent penalties for serious violations which impact upon employees. This is an interpretation of the common position, which states that the Member States must lay down effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my genuine hope that this House will confirm the wide majority reached in committee and will lose no time in providing the Union and the Member States with this major legislative instrument during the Belgian Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Menrad (PPE-DE)</span></span>  . – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Ghilardotti, firstly because she showed a great deal of flexibility in meetings of the Committee, including taking on board a series of proposals by the European People's Party, and secondly because this has meant that her very good report on the Common Position on the framework directive for minimum standards in national employee information and consultation points in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">As with the directive on European works councils, the issue is not codetermination, but information and consultation on important economic, financial and employment policy developments in business. Restructuring cannot and should not be hindered, but it must no longer take place in the form of a commando raid, as so often happens – witness Renault's shock at Vilvoorde – but only following prior notification of the employees concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, though, many parallels with the works councils directive in other respects. The regulations on European works councils apply only to mergers of businesses across national boundaries, but restructuring often takes place at a national level. The European People's Party favours flexibility. For example, management and labour in a business can, through agreements, arrive at a special made-to-measure arrangement on information and consultation for that business. That is subsidiarity. The Common Position says rightly that agreements should be able to be more, or even less, favourable than the minimum standard. Yet, the rights of local works councils may not be jeopardised under national law.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 1 prescribes that the procedure should be carried on in a spirit of cooperation. This means partnership. Partnership aims on the one hand at the clear representation of interests, and on the other hand at their conciliation in shared dialogue through information and consultation. There is no doubt that this is economically advantageous. Inadequate information results in insecurity, mistrust, and finally only fear, ending in blockade. Timely information means transparency that creates trust and avoids businesses making friction losses. Both workers and employers are winners, and in the same way.</p>

My group’s first priority, therefore, is to bring this issue to an end at long last and to have it published in the Official Journal. We thus hope that agreement with the Council will be reached in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also evident from the stance adopted by our group, as Mrs Ghilardotti stated. We dropped a huge number of amendments from first reading and concentrated in the committee on a number of compromise texts, on which it must be possible to reach agreement, in our view. For example, we deleted the precious point on <span class="italic">Tendenzschut</span>z, which we would have liked to have seen scrapped. Neither will we be backing the Group of the Greens and the GUE/NGL Group on this matter in the framework of reaching a compromise. However, we hope that the PPE-DE will continue to support the compromise proposals we reached in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The differences of opinion with the Council mainly revolve around two key points: the provisions on sanctions and the unnecessarily long transitional periods. I should like to note that these are not points which we have added but, rather, points which the Council has added to the Commission position. Parliament is not asking for points to be added. In this case, it is the Council which is departing from the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I will briefly comment on those two points. With regard to the sanction provisions, Mr Menrad has also already communicated their importance in order for the directive to be taken really seriously. In this connection, I would like to refer to the experience in my own country. In the Netherlands, this kind of sanction exists in legislation pertaining to works councils. Precisely those provisions have an extremely preventative effect. It is not often that legal steps are required, but the very fact that it is possible to take these steps means that very intense consultations are often held. With regard to closures and transfers which need to take place, a very broad support structure is created and sound consultations are held. That is very important for industrial relations, in my opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns transitional periods. I already stated last week, at a meeting which Mr Bushill-Matthews had organised with an English association of people who, in fact, propagate the idea of employee participation, that it strikes me as bizarre that they call for a much longer transitional period. If one considers – as they did – that information and consultation are very important, not only to employees but also to employers and to the company’s performance, then one must ensure that this measure is introduced very promptly. One should not ask for longer transitional periods, for that gives British industry entirely the wrong signal. I would therefore ask you to reconsider this and to support these conventional transitional periods, as proposed by the Commission, after all.</p>
<p class="contents">Come what may, based on the experience which we have gathered in the Netherlands with an act that has been in force for more than 50 years, it appears that industrial relations have improved as a result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also wish, in particular, to thank her for her understanding of the minority views that may be adopted by a Danish MEP in this situation, for we have a special system of consultation and cooperation in the labour market which creates problems for us from time to time. We all agree, of course, that information and consultation and a good social dialogue are important. It has become a part of modern management to attach importance to these things, to involve employees and to talk about learning organisations, so enabling companies to develop better.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is important that, when we talk about these matters, we do not only view information and consultation as part and parcel of restructuring and the reduction of the labour force, but as also being a part of day-to-day work in which it takes a long time to build up mutual confidence and that reciprocal dialogue that can be of value both to employees and companies in a crisis situation and which may also perhaps play a part in preventing crises from breaking out within companies. We have had a long period in which it was difficult getting everyone to understand the need for revising this directive, and revision has been blocked by a majority of the Council. Denmark has been a part of that blocking majority, not because we are nervous about having rules on information and consultation – we have in actual fact had stringent rules on these matters from as far back as 1960 – but because we are afraid that common rules might create problems for the system we think works well in practice. It would, of course, be an irony of fate if common rules were to be destructive in an area in which matters are operating well.</p>
<p class="contents">Flexibility is a key word when it comes to drawing up the common rules, but there must not of course be so much flexibility that the required information and consultation does not occur in those places in which these things have not been emphasised. I must say, therefore, that, on the whole, my group is able to support Mrs Ghilardotti’s proposals. We have some problems where the sanctions are concerned, and I must say that the Council’s solution is an extremely fine balance that it is very difficult not to upset. There is therefore a single point in regard to which we cannot completely endorse the strict rules indicated in Mrs Ghilardotti’s report but in regard to which we prefer to endorse the Council’s solution. On the other hand, I want to say, on the subject of interim arrangements, that it is a question of putting these in place. Let us now get these matters implemented and not just continue to talk about them. Information and consultation are not a punishment for business. On the contrary, they are things that promote good business and competitiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, we would like the Council to follow suit and thus put a definitive end to the three long years that have passed since the Commission, perceiving the breakdown in social dialogue, made very timely use of its right of initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">This is three years too many, which have been punctuated by social catastrophes, with rapid liquidation of businesses and loss of jobs due to bankruptcy and genuine distortions in Community social law on information and consultation of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">While we must not expect miracles from this directive, because it will only apply, at best, to businesses with more than 50 employees and will not single-handedly resolve the fundamental problem, namely that competition law is dominant, this directive may represent a significant step towards harmonising the rights of European Union employees, subject, of course, to it not being stripped of its content and reduced to the smallest common denominator. This is why it is so important that the Council take into consideration the recommendations proposed by Mrs Ghilardotti, particularly Amendment Nos 2 and 12 on sanctions for disregard of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Council is opposed to European sanctions, the least it can do, in my view, is to accept this compromise position. We also support amendments which clarify and widen the scope of the information that must be provided to employees’ representatives, and the amendment proposing the latter may request a decision’s application be suspended, pending the outcome of new negotiations, where this decision has serious effects on jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">If our citizens are to find this directive credible, it will have to be applied simultaneously throughout the European Union. That is why our group asks the Council to support the position submitted to us, and make it impossible for some Member States to evade having to enforce the application of the directive for several more years. Our group proposes to supplement the draft recommendation by adopting amendments that rule out the possibility of withholding information that the company considers sensitive to its business from employees’ representatives, because we are convinced that there are no grounds, that it even constitutes discrimination to introduce an element of suspicion with regard to employees who, by definition, have no less company spirit than the management or shareholders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When you see the behaviour of the directors of many companies, especially the multinationals, who decide to restructure, relocate or even partially or totally close down their businesses, making hundreds or thousands of workers unemployed simply to cut costs and/or increase profits, it is all the more intolerable that the Council should not have accepted proposals that we have adopted in this House. Examples of these are:</p>
<p class="contents">- the reference to the planning stage in the definition of consultation, its extension to cover economic and financial developments in the company and the obligation to seek agreement on all issues subject to the information and consultation of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">- extending consultation in particularly serious cases; extending the concept of a serious breach of the obligations to inform and consult; the implementation of the directive on public administration.</p>
<p class="contents">- the abolition of the employer’s right to retain particularly sensitive information and the obligation for Member States to promote social dialogue within SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">These are our reasons for supporting Mrs Ghilardotti’s proposals, which once again take up the positions adopted at first reading, with particular emphasis on the amendments that seek to step up sanctions and specific legal proceedings in cases where the directive is breached, on suspending decisions at the request of workers’ representatives when their implementation has serious consequences for workers, with a view to eliminating or minimising these harmful consequences, on eliminating the transitional periods for the directive’s implementation in Member States that do not have a system of worker consultation and on reducing the period of transposition into national law to two years as well as its implementation in the public sector. These are positive proposals which, as I said, we support.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only regret the fact, however, that the rapporteur has dropped her two proposals on eliminating the option the Council wishes to give employers to, in certain cases, neither inform nor consult their workers, although the rapporteur’s proposals envisage sanctions against employers that fail to act promptly. The Council’s position, however, opens up loopholes that could prove dangerous for workers and it is, therefore, important to eliminate this possibility. This is the basic justification for the two amendments that we have tabled in conjunction with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. We hope that a majority in Parliament votes in favour of these and that the Council takes account of the positions that have been put forward here in one of the most sensitive areas of the protection of workers’ rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I refer, in particular, to the legislation on European works councils, which has not been transposed by all the Member States and, where it has been transposed, has not been incorporated into their legislation but is regulated by means of agreements between the social partners which are often then disregarded by one of the partners, as has been shown by recent events which, moreover, have been debated in this very House. Yet Parliament, which has, in the past, been attentive to the issue of employment and openly involved in establishing and guaranteeing the dignity and even the quality of work, and which, moreover, has not hesitated to propose sanctions for the cases I have mentioned which even involved requirements governing the use of European funds for maintaining employment levels, has shown varying degrees of indecision in the debate on this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The different attitudes are certainly understandable, given the sensitive nature of some issues such as the enforcement of sanctions, for sanctions do have to be enforced if one wants a requirement to be respected, or the confidentiality<span class="bold"> </span>granting exemption from the consultation procedure to be removed, even though it is no longer observed, or a transitional period to be granted for the transposal of the directive which is, moreover, unnecessary, given the time frame for its implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that, both in terms of the continuous implementation of Community law, the continuing hope of ever-increasing cohesion and, lastly, the forthcoming practical introduction of a European Company which would provide greater protection of employees as regards participation than other forms of legal entity, the issue had to be closed, with the identification of major, related questions ranging from the contents of the information to the termination clause, from the time frame for initiating the procedure to the parties involved and to the sectors where it is to be applied, and all this in respect, on the one hand, for the fair trade requirement, which, also in this case, would be guaranteed by the different behaviour of the Member States, and, on the other hand, for the reasoning of the open coordination method, which has, at last, started to be applied practically in social policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the issue in question lends itself to being addressed within the context of the principle of subsidiarity, even though that concept still remains to be clearly defined today, despite the fact that it is one of the founding principles of the Union itself. However, it must be said that the definition and application of the principle does not and cannot serve the single purpose of calling for competence for certain subjects to be given to the Member States alone, for there is also a conflicting, appropriate need to provide the Union, in the face of great national differences and oversights, with a basic definition of these subjects wherever they have any significant implications for the Community as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has unfortunately proved that not all Member States have been in a position to draft national guidelines for informing and consulting employees. That would otherwise have been the best solution when it comes to companies in the individual countries, for it is, of course, there, that the real problems arise.</p>
<p class="contents">Political unity has now been achieved in the Council concerning the revised proposal from the Swedish Presidency and the graduated transitional arrangement, as proposed by the Commission. In Denmark, we have no direct laws about informing and consulting employees. That does not, however, mean that employees are not consulted and informed in Denmark. This is specifically regulated via cooperation agreements between the social partners in accordance with the Danish tradition of greater freedom between the social partners. Only when it is strictly necessary does the government get involved. The Danish government has therefore stated in the Council that it assumes that the current cooperation agreements in the Danish labour market comply with the directive’s requirements. The Danish government will also issue a statement in the Council to the effect that implementation of the directive will not affect existing agreements in this area in Denmark and that these will be fully respected when implementation takes place, but that it will of course be necessary to enact legislation for those companies not covered by the existing cooperation agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask the Commission whether it is of the same view as the Danish government. In other words, is the Commission able to ensure that the social partners themselves are given the freedom to enter into, and maintain, the existing agreements and procedures about informing and consulting employees, just as Denmark was given a similar assurance in connection with the compromise reached by the Council in July? I should also like to thank Mrs Ghilardotti for having agreed that sanctions must be established nationally. It is very important that the Member States themselves should devise appropriate sanctions, that this is done by means of agreements between the social partners and that we take account of the Member States’ different systems. If Parliament had maintained its hard line, the proposal could have been rejected by the Council, and that would have been a major defeat for the unions which, for years, have been campaigning for the right of employees to be informed and consulted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I am not in favour of imposing on the States, the individual Member States, solutions which involve employees in management decisions, on the basis, in some cases, of joint management models which are foreign to the legal and economic traditions of many European countries, as has just been said. I therefore feel that, in line with both the Commission’s initial proposal and the Council’s common position, the directive before us needs to leave the Member States sufficient room for manoeuvre to identify the best way of adhering to the principle of the need to keep employees informed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, many of the amendments adopted by the Commission and included in the common position which we are about to put to the vote conflict with this, particularly Amendments Nos 2 and 12, which seek to grant employees’ representatives a sort of <span class="italic">de facto</span> – and I repeat, <span class="italic">de facto</span> – right of veto on decisions taken by companies.

Fortunately, the Council’s common position is very useful and provides a sound basis for our further debate. In fact, a number of people, including a large number of socialist ministers, are of the opinion that we should not have anything other than the common position. I am not certain whether they truly believe this or whether they think that they will then be able to put the whole thing behind them. In any event, that is the state of play.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the stance adopted by our group has been expressed very eloquently by Mr Winfried Menrad, he very much takes the common position into account, as well as the amendments adopted at first reading, a number of which – I have to say – we were unable to support. We voted against a number of amendments, but as they are not included in the present package, that is not such a big issue.</p>
<p class="contents">There is now a sound compromise proposal before us by Parliament, also accommodating the Council. We make no bones about the fact that our group is struggling with a number of amendments. There are also a number of amendments which some delegations in our group find it difficult to come to terms with. But on the whole, I believe we can congratulate the rapporteur warmly on her work. I also believe that if we have voted on this matter by lunchtime today, we will have made a significant contribution to informing and consulting employees in Europe. We must not forget that an incredible number of problems have arisen. Over the years, we have discussed many resolutions dealing with the lack of consultation. If this is now rectified properly, we will have made huge progress, in my opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We hope this directive will develop into a new partnership between workers and management and strengthen dialogue. That, in turn, will improve flexibility and productivity.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a directive which is essentially a two-way street. It must make sense for workers in retail, service and manufacturing industries not to learn about their future through the media, but to work within a positive consultation mechanism making them aware of what will happen to them and their families.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is whether existing laws work well. There is plenty of evidence that they do not. Workers in my own country at Rover/BMW, Marks &amp; Spencers, in Longbridge, at Corus and Vauxhall – the list is endless – would all benefit from this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive is essentially about the future of work, not the past. When closure is inevitable for companies with more than 50 workers, we want to see information and consultation, so that workers are informed, leading to a better level of trust within companies. We need realistic thresholds to allow the directive to work well. In discussions with trade unions and business, it is clear that companies need to be made aware of their responsibilities. The responsibilities work both ways.</p>
<p class="contents">Colleagues, information and consultation has been a very difficult directive. There have been a number of compromise amendments. We are very happy with the way in which those discussions have progressed. It is clear that some Member States will continue to have problems with certain aspects of this directive. We must work together to ensure that in conciliation we reach the stage where information and consultation are embraced by both sides of business and industry.</p>

I am one of the Members who has spoken in this House previously regretting the fact that we did not have the kind of legislation that we are discussing today. I know that myself, along with several other colleagues, have been in the very unfortunate position of representing constituents who have suffered the very worst examples of the lack of consultation and the lack of information. Workers who have learned of job losses in the press and media when there has been speculation and uncertainty in the workplace. I only have to mention what happened with Corus in Wales earlier this year for you to see why I attach such importance to this particular piece of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore particularly pleased to have the opportunity to welcome this proposal which will change things. It will mean that employees will be involved in discussions when there really is still an opportunity to influence the debate and the outcome, not when the decision is more or less a <span class="italic">fait accompli</span>. Employees would have to be given all the relevant facts. While certain measures are needed to protect a company's commercial interests, my group believes that these are adequately covered.</p>
<p class="contents">The ability to impose sanctions is one of the most important aspects of this report, including the suspension of decisions which lead to job losses if the consultation guidelines have not been followed. Voluntary agreements are not enough. We often hear about good examples of voluntary agreements. I applaud those companies that follow good practice, but many do not. We have seen that time and time again especially in Wales and Britain where we have had no legislation on information and consultation to date. I am very pleased that there has at last been progress on this crucial matter. I believe, as others have said, that we cannot wait too long for this to come into effect which is why I support the shorter transition period.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal, of course, would not prevent job losses, but it would allow enough time to ensure that plans for rescaling and retraining of workforces could be well advanced before closures or redundancies take place. This is an issue of the effectiveness of companies and businesses. It should be a part of the everyday work of companies and businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also about dignity in the workplace. Employees are an integral part of the partnership with management and must be kept informed on decisions which affect not only their lives, but those of their families and whole communities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Many Member States of the European Union have, unfortunately, been faced with a wave of mergers, restructurings and numerous redundancies, such as at Danone, Marks and Spencer and Moulinex, to name but a few.</p>
<p class="contents">Until now, the directive has not enabled employees to take any effective action and to have a real bearing on their future, and that of the business. In many other cases, the directive has not been applied.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I support the proposals made in the report by Mrs Ghilardotti, because the directive strengthens provisions and provides the means to apply these provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council included Parliament’s amendments in its common position; the reference to the most favourable provisions for employees, the obligation to respect minimum requirements, and the non-regression clause. Although this is a step forward, we must go further, as proposed in Mrs Ghilardotti’s report. Some important amendments have again been proposed, which improve the report. For example, employees shall be consulted and informed at the planning stage, before decisions are taken. For example, if the decision has an adverse effect on employees, such as collective redundancies or closure, the final decision must be postponed so that consultations can continue with a view to avoiding or mitigating the consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive will enable us to begin to encourage an approach to economic and social issues, which includes improving working conditions and economic efficiency. This efficiency requires the involvement of employees, naturally. That is why we are proposing two amendments, which rule out the possibility of withholding information where there is a risk or prejudice to the business. To demand discretion is one thing. To enable the company’s management, once again, to take unilateral decisions on the nature of the information is quite another. Obviously, we must be determined to ensure this directive is observed, and I hope that, this time, the Council will heed Parliament’s will. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to Max Weber, a company is an organisation that, in controlling goods and services, aims to produce goods and services for a particular market. It is also clear that those who lend their services to a company cannot always relate to their employer directly or on a personal level, above all when the number of employees in that company exceeds a certain level. There therefore needs to be the implementation of some kind of permanent and flexible mechanism which would facilitate this relationship, functioning in a way that is simple yet effective and which can deal with the multitude of issues that arise in a company every day. The everyday life of a company, in this day and age, takes place within a global world – globalisation is the key word – a globalisation which does not exclusively affect large or very large companies, but also those of a small or medium size, because they are also having to function within this environment.</p>
<p class="contents">So, what exactly is the problem? Well, we need to regulate rights to information and consultation with true content within the specific framework in which we operate, that is to say that it is not a simple case of paying lip service to these declarations, but neither do we want to go too far, depriving the management of its powers. I think that this is what Mrs Ghilardotti set out to achieve in her arduous and efficient work: I think that she was seeking this point of equilibrium, and, yes, it is difficult – I would say practically impossible – for some delegations, such as the Spanish, to vote for the content of Amendment No 12, and for the rest, we have to underline the work she has undertaken and congratulate her on her effort. Evidently, a company’s own capacity to adapt, more necessary today than ever before, is going to be strengthened if we are able to convey its needs, concerns and prospects to all its workers. More than just an exhaustive regulation, we are talking about an advanced communication culture within the company. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can only welcome this and we must congratulate Mrs Ghilardotti, the rapporteur, who has spared no effort in ensuring that today we have reached a position that we are defending.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been almost three years since the draft directive was published, and during this time, we in this House have had to condemn many situations. There have been site closures, redundancies and relocations, without any prior information being given by the companies to the employees concerned. Of course, this directive is far from ideal – it does not provide a ban on redundancies – but it illustrates the determination to make up for these shortcomings, firstly, in national legislation, but also to correct the occasionally fragmented aspects of Community law that we have already passed, which it also supplements.</p>
<p class="contents">These three years of debate have resulted in a text that is now balanced and realistic. This report is not intransigent, nor is it extremist, and I believe that we should mention the efforts on the part of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the various groups, in negotiating with the Council, to iron out specific differences of opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament and the Council are co-legislators and we do not have to blindly support any directive, Mr Pronk. We have to support positions, namely those of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I have three points to make; the first relates to confidentiality of specific information. We have returned to the common position of the Council to acknowledge that there actually are objective situations and contradictions with stock market law, for example, which must be considered and that this confidentiality, in some well-defined cases, can be upheld. My second point relates to sanctions. There is no law without sanctions, and I believe that what is laid down – I am about to finish, Mr President – where there has been a serious breach is an absolute minimum. As for transition periods, well, fundamental social rights must simply be applied. Yet, we can no longer defer the enforcement of these rights.</p>

It is inherent in our European social model and distinguishes us from other social models.</p>
<p class="contents">I should first of all like to thank the rapporteur for the sound work and also the Council which, in any case, managed to pull the debate back on track in Nice. This was timely and also necessary. If we examine such a framework directive and compare it with the take-over directive which was discussed in this House recently, and subsequently rejected, we can see that this did not fit into a framework directive. The statute of the European company does fit in, which means that a framework directive is needed for that. That framework directive is also needed – as has been indicated by various people – if we consider what happened to Renault-Vilvoorde, Michelin, Chorus and other companies. For example, in the case of Chorus, there is a pronounced difference in the level of information and consultation provided in the Netherlands, for example, compared to England.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, this directive relies wholly on the quality of information and consultation. In my opinion, these should be assessed in the fullness of time, but this is a first step. It is absolutely vital to tackle it this way.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the things I am struggling with is the exemption from this directive when a company is said to be at risk. We have positive experiences in countries where works councils exist, and that applies to the Netherlands, Germany and Austria. Problems do not arise. There is already a duty of confidentiality, and I should like to urge you to adopt the amendment which we tabled in this connection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I support Mrs Ghilardotti's Amendment No 5, which requires them to be consulted as early as the planning phase, so that they can have some degree of influence.</p>
<p class="contents">There was long debate on Amendment No 7, which laid down what information supplied by the employer must include. This includes the economic situation – developments in the market, the structure of the organisation, the company's strategy – but also turnover and production figures to show the financial position. This is about in-house information and not in any way about investment control by stealth. More and more employees have a financial share in their business, now, and so they are well positioned to think entrepreneurially in local and global terms. They are ready and willing to share responsibility for significant strategies that make their firms more competitive. Dialogue between informed social partners is a major challenge, and so we also need training and development for qualified employees. People with in-depth knowledge add to productivity. These employees are willing to share responsibility even for crucial decisions. All this adds up to another element in the structure of a modern organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that dialogue between employer and employee is particularly important. Mr President, you are right to emphatically put the case for them as well. This dialogue is to be set in motion in the Member States, in accordance with their current national regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">The pressure of competition and the challenges posed by globalisation mean that there is no alternative to cooperation within businesses, provided that it is founded on fairness, openness and timely information.</p>

As with the Regulation on the Statute for a European Company a few weeks ago, and the annex on participation, we have been making more progress in the last few months than we had for years.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this gives us an excellent opportunity to send a clear signal to the public that, at European level, we have a concept of the company that encompasses all those that work within it, which, it must also be said, is not only a democratic right of workers, but, also, these principles of information and consultation set the right path for companies to become more efficient, more effective, non-authoritarian and participatory. In these times of globalisation, lifelong learning and the incorporation of workers into the dynamics of a company are crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope, Commissioner, representatives of the Council, that, as Mrs Ghilardotti stated very clearly in her amendments, that this is a genuine regulation. This will require two obvious and fundamental elements: firstly, that the participation of workers should take place before decisions are made, for if this is not the case, they will carry on finding things out through the papers and they will really be under the impression that the work that has been carried out here in Parliament, in Council and in the Commission is a joke. They have to be involved before decisions are made, because the press is there for everyone else. Secondly, their participation must also be a legal requirement. The exact difference between the regulation and the recommendation is that, when the regulation is violated, there can be a sanction. If there is no sanction, what we do remains purely symbolic and has no legal foundation.</p>
<p class="contents">Representatives of the Council, we are at second reading. I would like to finish by saying that I hope that on this occasion we do not experience what has taken place on so many others, that you forget that Parliament has legislative faculties on a par with your own. I hope, therefore, that you will take good notice of Mrs Ghilardotti’s report, which is not only for her own good, but for the good of millions of citizens and workers in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my previous job as managing director of a large UK food manufacturing company, I was very proud to lead the first such company in the whole of the West Midlands Region to achievement of the coveted Investors People Award. As has already been mentioned, earlier this month I hosted a lunch debate in Brussels with the Involvement and Participation Association for my fellow members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to share with them UK best practice and the benefits of flexibility, because that is the issue. The common position as it stands is fine, which is why I personally did not put forward any amendments to that, but the committee amendments propose yet another one-size fits-all straitjacket which would be highly damaging to managers' ability to manage and in particular to their ability to manage rapid change. If companies are held back from taking the key decisions necessary perhaps for the very survival of those businesses, their problems will get worse, which means that more employees could suffer. The UK government has asked all UK MEPs from all political parties to vote down all these amendments and to support the common position. Conservative MEPs will do exactly that, so I now call upon UK Labour MEPs to reverse the position they all took in committee when they supported these amendments and to vote with us in the interests of employment and in the interests of the nation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as Mrs Ghilardotti is concerned, we all know what a difficult job she had and she has. She had to strike a balance between completely different political, national, social and economic views, and I would like to congratulate her and to thank all the Members of Parliament who have participated in the debate and supported the Commission's proposal through this process.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an important proposal and, once adopted, it will add an indispensable element to workers' rights. Recent events, with mass lay-offs across Europe, have only underlined the urgent need for different kinds of instruments and this proposal – this directive – information and consultation is a very important instrument. Once adopted, the directive will ensure better anticipation of crises and will contribute to developing a positive attitude towards change by both management and workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me tell you that I fully understand all your requests. Most, if not all, of the issues they raise were the subject of intense debate within all the institutions. The text before us strikes a delicate balance between different points of view and divergent interests on the sensitive issues at stake. While I understand your desire to improve the text, it would be unwise, in my view, to depart now from that balance and jeopardise the actual adoption of the proposal. I refer in particular to Amendments Nos 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 16, 18 and 19. Therefore, the Commission is not prepared to accept those amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">However, a number of the proposed amendments are acceptable, in full or in part, to the Commission, as they will improve the text. These are Amendments Nos 3, 6, 8, 13 and 14. The Commission will, therefore, actively support these amendments and will do its utmost to facilitate consensus on them between Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, before moving to the two most important issues – sanctions and transitional periods – to respond to Mrs Sandbæk, as far as the Danish model is concerned. I would like to underline the fact that the current text strikes a balance between the necessary protection of workers and the autonomy of the social partners, as contracting partners. They can freely conclude agreements which are not fully in line with the provisions of Article 4, but they have to take into account the principles which are established in Article 1 and in national law.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, we know that the most difficult and controversial issues are the two which I have already referred to: sanctions and transitional periods. With regard to the first of these issues, Amendment No 2 and especially Amendment No 12 propose reinforced sanctions, including judicial suspension procedures in cases of serious breach of information and consultation obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">This amendment, while reinforcing the common position, offers a compromise with the Commission's original proposal. It is, therefore, undeniable that Parliament is making a step in the direction of the Council, in a serious search for a final compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank you for your support of the Commission's stance on this very important element of the directive. Nevertheless, taking into account the sensitivity of the issue in the Council, the best basis for a final compromise on this issue would be to limit the request to the first sentence of the proposed amendment. Under these circumstances, the Commission can accept Amendment No 2 and the first paragraph of Amendment No 12. We can accept Amendment No 2 with a minor change.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally Amendment No 15 which seeks to delete Article 10 – on transitional periods – is equally a major issue. In the past, the Commission has always opposed this kind of provision which tends to grant different treatment to different Member States. This time, we can see some justification in it. Some Member States will clearly have to introduce major changes to their industrial relations systems. Therefore, the Commission is of the opinion that Article 10 of the common position constitutes a fair compromise and it cannot accept this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, the Commission can accept in full or in spirit Amendments Nos 3 and 8; it can accept in part Amendments Nos 2, 6, 12, 13 and 14. It rejects Amendments Nos 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 18 and 19.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that you fully appreciate the challenges ahead of us: we need to do everything possible to find an acceptable compromise between the co-legislators. I think that our big challenge is to strike the balance between what we think is desirable and what is achievable or possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
