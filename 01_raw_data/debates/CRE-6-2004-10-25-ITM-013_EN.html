<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lipietz (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr President of the European Central Bank (ECB), ladies and gentlemen, I should like to salute the high quality and, on certain points, the innovative nature of the ECB’s report for 2003, presented under Mr Trichet’s guidance.</p>
<p class="contents">A period such as 2003 can be analysed from two perspectives: what exactly happened in 2003 and what was decided in 2003. These are two distinct notions, because, according to econometrics, monetary decisions have a delayed reaction on actual developments of something in the region of 12 to 18 months. What we are therefore discussing here today is, in some respects, the policy of 2002 and its orientations in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, 2003 saw strong price stability: a little over 2% at the beginning of the year and actually a little less at the end of the year, despite oil price rises. Unfortunately, 2003 also saw a major slowdown in the EU in relation to its major competitors – the United States, Japan and China, among others.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore with this information in mind that we must analyse the orientations given in 2003 by the ECB, which were both practical and doctrinal. Let us begin with the practical orientations: throughout 2002, in contrast with the policy pursued by our neighbours, the Bank of England itself or the US federal reserve, which cut their interest rates sharply, the ECB retained the same interest rate virtually until December. From December 2002 and throughout, let us say, the first half of 2003, there was a very sharp interest rate reduction in Europe, and we have begun to see the positive effects of this in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">This interest rate reduction was illustrated by what we call the ‘8 May Announcement’, which was dissected and explained most interestingly in the ECB’s 2003 report, and we thoroughly endorse this orientation and the way in which it was justified in the 2003 report. Firstly, we are told that, in order to offset the risk of deflation, it is important to have inflation that is below, but close to 2%, so that actual interest rates might be taken to a negative level. Secondly, we are told that the M3 money supply is important in the long term, yet not in setting monetary policy. I feel that both of these theories are perfectly justified. Our report welcomes this major orientation, and we shall table the amendments again to welcome it even more clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">For the future, the 2003 report contains a further point that is extremely important, which is a clear statement by the ECB, as a public authority, that it is accountable to the general public and that this accountability entails dialogue with Parliament. I feel that by putting itself forward as something of an executive body, in view of the fact that its relationship with the general public involves interacting with Parliament, this ECB report represents a major step forward. I feel that the next step is to develop this dialogue further, and in our report we make proposals to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, in our proposals for the future, we are naturally thinking about the new countries’ accession. We consider that these countries should be treated equally and with the same criteria for meeting the convergence criteria as those that have been thus far applied to all countries. This is not an issue of two weights and measures; the same rules apply to 2005, 2006 and 2007 as applied in 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we must start to consider the new generation of bank notes. We feel that we must keep the one and two cent coins and many of us feel that we should introduce a 1-euro note. It is essential, in our view, that bank notes and coins should bring the general public closer to its currency. It is time to put living people on our notes, as every country in the world does. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, the ECB's monetary policy operated in a rather uncertain and challenging environment in 2003. In the first half of the year, real GDP growth stagnated amid considerable uncertainty related to geopolitical tensions and turbulence in oil prices and financial markets. Following the easing of economic and geopolitical uncertainties, prospects for economic activity gradually brightened after the summer of 2003. Nevertheless, overall GDP in the euro area increased by only 0.5% in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Annual HICP inflation slowed down slightly in 2003 to 2.1% on average from 2.3% on average in both 2001 and 2002. The persistence of inflation above 2% was mainly caused by increases in a number of volatile components of the HICP, in particular oil prices, and, in the second half of 2003, food prices. Rises in indirect taxes and administrative prices also added to inflation in 2003. From a medium-term perspective, however, we expect price developments to remain in line with price stability after the progressive elimination of the influence of those volatile components of the HICP.</p>
<p class="contents">This expectation resulting from our economic analysis was in line with our monetary analysis. Much of the strength of monetary growth in early 2003 was due to the high level of economic and financial market uncertainty prevailing at that time, which prompted portfolio shifts into safer, short-term liquid assets included in M3. In view of the moderation of medium-term inflationary pressures in the first half of 2003, as was said by Mr Lipietz, the ECB's key interest rates were reduced by 25 basis points in March 2003 and by 50 basis points in June of the same year. Thus, in June 2003, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations reached 2%. Since then, this interest rate has remained unchanged at this historically very low level, whilst the preservation of inflationary expectations in line with our definition of price stability has contributed very significantly to the low level of medium and long-term nominal and real interest rates. The resulting yield curve has delivered a financial environment very significantly supportive to economic recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic recovery, which started in the second half of 2003, has continued this year. In terms of year-on-year growth rates, we reached 2% in the second quarter of this year. By and large, output growth in the last 12 months was close to present estimates of potential growth in the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect a continuation of this growth trend in the coming quarters. On the external side, the world economy is currently recording its strongest growth for 30 years. Some moderation is expected next year, but euro area exports should, nevertheless, continue to benefit from favourable global demand conditions in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">On the domestic side, investment should normally benefit from the positive global environment, the very favourable financing conditions in the euro area and the improvements in corporate efficiency. There is scope in the euro area as a whole for a strengthening of private consumption, but naturally some uncertainty as to outlook exists. One of the risks stems from developments in oil markets. If oil prices were to remain high, or even to increase further, they could dampen the strength of the recovery, both inside and outside the euro area, despite the fact that the oil intensity of the euro area is significantly lower than in the 1970s. We also need to keep in mind that part of the oil price increase is due to strong global demand, which was not the case in the first and second oil shocks, but it remains true that the oil price increase constitutes an adverse supply shock for the euro area economy as a whole. For the oil price shock to be absorbed smoothly, the policy mistakes of the past must not be repeated and, in particular, 'second-round' effects must be avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards consumer prices, oil-market developments have had a direct impact on the euro area HICP. Following an annual rate of 1.7% in the first quarter of 2004, inflation reached 2.3% in the second quarter and 2.2% in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="contents">Inflation rates over the past year have also been driven up by exceptionally strong rises in indirect taxes and administered prices all over the euro area. Nevertheless, looking ahead, the available information does not indicate -– in our eyes – that stronger underlying inflationary pressures are building up domestically as yet. Wage developments have remained moderate since the last quarter of 2003, and this trend should continue. Provided that there are no further significant shocks to prices, annual inflation rates should drop below 2% in the course of 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should stress that, over recent quarters, we have seen several upward risks to the outlook for price stability emerge, and these call for ongoing vigilance. This again relates to oil price developments and possible second-round effects stemming from wage- and price-setting behaviour. Other concerns relate to long-term inflation expectations and also monetary trends. Indeed, the downward trend in annual entry growth since mid-2003 appears to have halted over the summer of this year and the shorter-term dynamics of entry have strengthened. This reflects in part the fact that the historically low level of interest rates in the euro area continues to support monetary expansion.</p>
<p class="contents">The low level of interest rates is also fuelling the growth of credit to the private sector, and we have witnessed continued strong growth in loans for house purchase. Given the strength of M3 growth over the past few years, there is presently substantially more liquidity in the euro area than is needed to finance non-inflationary growth.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to other aspects we are looking at. A good and credible monetary policy is certainly a necessary condition for sustainable growth and job creation, but not a sufficient condition by itself. Other conditions must be met, in particular sound fiscal policies and appropriate structural reforms. In this respect, in the area of fiscal policy, last year proved disappointing. The average fiscal deficit in the euro area increased from 2.4% to 2.7%. Moreover, the fiscal situation remained of great concern in countries that had already recorded significant imbalances in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">The aggregate euro area fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio is not expected to improve in 2004 and the average debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to deteriorate further. This is certainly a source of concern. Last year fiscal policies in the EMU faced a number of serious challenges. On 25 November 2003 the EU Council decided not to act on the basis of the Commission's recommendation and agreed to hold the excessive deficit procedure for the countries concerned in abeyance. On the very same day, the Governing Council of the ECB supported the view of the Commission. The Stability and Growth Pact is the cornerstone of EMU. It is key to providing an economic <span class="italic">rationale</span> to a single currency area which has no federal government and to ensuring macro-economic stability on a sustainable basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The Governing Council of the ECB is of the opinion that substantial improvements in the Pact's implementation are needed, particularly as regards the preventive arm of the Pact. At the same time, it is not in favour of making changes to the text of the Treaty or of the regulations which form the basis of the Pact, and we insist on the importance of preserving the full integrity of the nominal anchor of 3% in the corrective arm of the Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also stress – as has Ecofin – the vital importance of a reliable and timely reporting of government finance statistics, which would not be subject, in any respect, to political interference and electoral cycles. On that particular point we are in full agreement with Ecofin.</p>
<p class="contents">On a more positive note, both 2003 and 2004 have seen some progress towards structural reforms in several euro area countries. While implementing these reforms has not always been easy, I am confident that we will be able to see their positive effects in the years ahead. I have said clearly that the ECB is backing governments, parliaments and social partners that have embarked on those necessary reforms in the euro area. We cannot be complacent. In many areas further reforms are needed. The continuing reform process is key to enhancing the euro area's production potential and ensuring future growth and employment opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">The year 2003 was also marked by the final preparations for the enlargement of the European Union by 10 new Member States, with effect from 1 May 2004. As far as the ECB is concerned, the integration of the central banks of the 10 new Member States proceeded smoothly. Important challenges remain for these countries on the road to adopting the euro. Last week, the ECB, like the Commission, published the first Convergence Report dealing with these countries, together with Sweden. The report identifies several priority areas in which individual countries will be required to make further efforts before they can adopt the euro. The picture that emerged varied significantly from country to country, but many share similar challenges with regard to price stability, fiscal sustainability, exchange rate stability and interest rate convergence. In addition, institutional convergence has not yet been achieved in all countries, in particular in the area of central bank independence. I cannot over-emphasise the latter's importance for the successful conduct of monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECB very much appreciated the favourable comments contained in the European Parliament's draft resolution on the ECB's monetary policy strategy in 2003. We have always strived to demonstrate a strong commitment to achieving our primary objective of price stability. Inflation has remained subdued, despite a sequence of adverse disturbances. I do not want to dwell further on that, but I will stress the challenge of solidly anchoring medium and long-term inflation expectations – of key importance for delivering price stability and for consolidating an exceptionally favourable yield curve, because, on a medium to long-term basis, these inflationary expectations are incorporated in the market rates.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noted that on the most important issues the views expressed in the draft resolution are very similar to those held by the ECB. Nevertheless, there are a number of issues where we have slight differences of views. In particular, the draft resolution asks for the publication of the minutes of the Governing Council meetings, whilst it seems to accept implicitly that individual votes of Members would not be made public. We would very much appreciate it if Parliament could accept the argument that the publication of the votes of individual members of the Governing Council could trigger national public debates on whether national central bank governors have taken due account of national interests, whereas the Treaty calls for all of us to focus on the euro area as a whole. Such public discussions would have adverse consequences for the credibility and the effectiveness of the ECB's monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the minutes, I stress that the ECB presents and explains its monetary policy decisions by means of comprehensive public statements at its press conferences which take place immediately after Governing Council meetings. By adopting this procedure during 1999, the ECB contributed to improving the global state-of-the-art in central bank transparency and became the first central bank to release a comprehensive diagnosis explaining monetary policy decisions immediately after they are taken. The information conveyed by the ECB this way is, in essence, similar to what other central banks publish in summary minutes, as it reflects properly the overall discussion in the Governing Council. The ECB is the only major central bank which makes possible immediate interaction with the media. These features make the ECB, in our view, one of the most transparent central banks in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These standards represent a highly significant contribution towards a securities infrastructure that is safe and integrated. We are placing the highest importance on this aim, given that the current fragmentation of this infrastructure has led to transaction costs that are too high and this is, furthermore, a source of financial instability.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I must say at this point that whilst the standards that we agreed with the Committee of European Securities Regulators were decided in total compliance with the current legislation and regulations in force, we do not wish, under any circumstances, to prejudge any decisions that may be taken in future. Consequently, if a new directive on clearing and settlement were adopted following the appropriate procedure, we would, of course, look again at our joint rules and standards, so as to ensure that they remained in line with the provisions of the directive if, once again, such a decision were taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report thus makes the ECB’s policies more accessible to the readers, that is, the public, so we see the ECB as having done a good job of work with the whole thing.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lipietz’s original report contains some criticisms of the ECB, and with these we do not agree. Let me begin with interest rate policy, one general criticism of which we regard as misplaced. We know that interest rate policy is a balancing act, but, as whole, 2003 saw the ECB continuing to do a good job of keeping things on an even keel; the economy is growing, the euro is stable, and interest rates are low in real terms.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a second criticism that we do not endorse, in that we take the view that the ECB’s responsibilities are clearly and well set out, these being, primarily, price stability and moderate rates of inflation. When those are in place, the important conditions for economic growth and employment are created, and, although that is of course not enough, we should not make the ECB responsible for full employment or economic growth; to do so would be to lay far too great a burden on it. These matters are for the national governments to deal with. Mr Trichet pointed out that this is where Budget policy is important, and the national governments have failed to discharge their responsibilities in this respect. We cannot correct that by overburdening the ECB.</p>
<p class="contents">We also share the view, expressed by Mr Trichet, that the votes of individual members of the Governing Council should not be published. To do so would politicise the ECB, and would do Europe’s present economic development no good. When we have made a success of putting the Lisbon agenda into practice, then the position will be a different one, and we will be able to discuss the subject again.</p>
<p class="contents">While we are in favour of the ECB doing as the Federal Reserve does and publishing a Grey Book every year, we also would like to see the publication, at the due time, of summary minutes without individual votes; the matter should then be left there.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, we should allow the ECB the freedom to act in the manner laid down in the Maastricht Treaty on European Union. The Lipietz report was successfully rewritten by the adoption, in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, of the amendments tabled on these points, and so we still wonder why the rapporteur has not dissociated himself from it. We regard the report, as it stands, as balanced and good, and in this form we endorse it. We do not believe that it needs to be amended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At times, I find it amusing that, in this House, we seem to make the mistake of thinking that the entire debate is exclusively for us economists or bankers. At times, we end up talking in such a complicated way that I honestly believe that there are people in this House, let alone those who voted for us and to whom we are responsible, who do not even know what we are talking about. As I said, the matters that we are discussing today and that are the subject of the Central Bank report affect the daily life of millions of people. Mr President, I come from a very small village, with a total of 800 inhabitants, in the smallest Member State of the European Union, namely Malta.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, what we are debating with such pompous words sometimes affects the lives of families as much as it affects multinationals, which have very powerful lobbyists here and in Brussels. These normal families, or ordinary people as they are referred to in English, pay taxes and abide by the law. It is to them that we owe our first allegiance in all the decisions we take. I believe that, in the future, the main task of new Member States of the European Union must be to put their economies on strong foundations. They must do this whilst being careful not to rip the social fabric which in many countries, including mine, has taken many years to weave. </p>
<p class="contents">It is in these terms that the issue of when to adopt the euro must be considered. In my opinion, it would be a mistake if any country, simply to satisfy its desire to introduce the single currency as soon as possible, were to introduce superficial but harsh measures affecting its middle and lower classes, measures that might perhaps result in satisfying the convergence criteria, whatever these might be, but at the expense of sacrificing the social achievements of recent years. Things should not be done in a hurry, but planned wisely. Our first priority should be our need to be more competitive both as individual countries and as a continent. The new Member States of the European Union and the European Union as a whole have a great deal to learn from the experience of those Member States that have already adopted the single currency. This was a positive experience for many countries. </p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, there were complaints about unwarranted price increases implemented as soon as the system changed over to the euro. These complaints, especially from those who, in our society, can least afford price increases, were justified in many cases. Last year, this Parliament asked the Central Bank to investigate those incorrect workings of the system that resulted in price increases. I believe that, to be consistent, we must request another such investigation, and I believe this is why, as the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, we are presenting an amendment to this effect. I urge my fellow MEPs from the other groups again to vote in favour of an investigation, thereby enabling us to be consistent. Finally, this is a very difficult time, but it is not a time for losing heart. It is a time when we need leadership and vision.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Trichet, your performance in office to date has helped to ensure, and indeed further enhance, the European Central Bank’s credibility and independence. Through the annual report for 2003 and the monetary dialogue involving you and the members of your Executive Board, the ECB has fully discharged its duty of accountability to the European Parliament. What makes the report convincing is its format, its clarity and the wealth of useful information it contains.</p>
<p class="contents">We are glad to see that the ECB’s annual report stresses the maintenance of price stability as the Bank’s primary objective and principal task. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European Parliament not only accepts this as a core task for the ECB, but, moreover, emphasises that it has priority. This is where we are as one with the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. We are also aware that the ECB is independent. The European Central Bank needs no lectures on what its interest rate policy should have been like in the past or what it must be like in the future. The euro zone’s economic weakness is attributable neither to any lack of confidence in the euro nor simply to a lack of demand that might have been avoided by aggressive cutting of interest rates. The determining factor is, instead, a general lack of confidence on the part of the public and the business community in their own countries’ economic policies, and the sluggishness of reforms, particularly in the large euro zone countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In saying this, I am thinking of the necessary reforms to the tax system, to the labour market, to the social security systems and to the health sector, which have, for far too long, been put off or tackled merely half-heartedly. To these things, Mr Trichet, you have already referred in your speech.</p>
<p class="contents">Being the only institution in the European Union to be directly elected and democratically legitimate, this year again the European Parliament will not fail to play its part as the champion of transparency. While I know that you, Mr Trichet, take a different line on this, it is with this in mind that we propose that the ECB should publish comprehensive minutes of the meetings of its Governing Council, including the voting results in full, albeit without attribution of individual votes. We also think it would make sense to produce a yearbook on economic development similar to the ‘Beige Book’ of the Federal Reserve in the USA, something that the Group of the European People’s Party has also called for. This would enable the public to have first-hand and readily-accessible information on the economic positions of their own country and of all the countries in the euro zone. Such a volume would make for greater transparency and could also build up the public’s identification with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, let me call upon the European Central Bank, as a matter of urgency, to continue to watch, with a critical and attentive eye, over adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact and, together with Eurostat, to compel the countries of the euro zone to produce reliable figures. What has happened with Greece must not be allowed to happen again. We look forward to your feedback, Mr Trichet, and to continued close cooperation with you in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of them is the presupposition that a central bank that endeavours to keep prices stable must, <span class="italic">a priori</span>, also be making the best possible contribution to full employment and growth. That prices in the euro zone have been stable for years is not a matter of contention; if we disregard the effect of rising oil prices and indirect taxation, inflation in the euro zone currently stands at just above 1%, which is verging on deflation. Has this brought us less unemployment and more growth? The crisis is, of course, attributable not only to misguided monetary policy. It is due, above all, to a policy, described as one of reform, which is in thrall to profit, wrecks workers’ rights, encourages wage dumping, and privatises social security benefits, thereby helping to strangle mass purchasing power and to increase poverty in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Monetary policy does, however, bear its share of responsibility as a result of cuts in interest rates that have been too late and not enough. It is cynical to describe the European Central Bank as having pursued the goal of full employment when millions of women and men have lost their jobs in recent years – not a few of them because the high cost of borrowing has bled small businesses dry. The fact is that a central bank also has the task of sounding the alarm when ever-increasing concentration of ownership gives the private banking sector more power over the market and when cuts in key interest rates serve primarily to increase the finance houses’ profit margins, instead of being felt by smaller enterprises and consumers. In this respect, too, the ECB has failed. Those who mendaciously depict the history of the single European currency as a success story are merely showing once again which vested interests colour their view of political events in Europe: monetary union has no equal as a model of success in the eyes of the European financial elite, whose attention is fixed on conglomerates’ gilt-edged balance sheets and increasing profits. To the ECB, those who look at the world from this angle ...</p>

The EU countries are characterised by limited ability to adjust to various structural changes and are therefore afflicted by permanently high unemployment figures.</p>
<p class="contents">The risks involved in the euro are already clearly seen, above all in Germany which has been subjected to an unduly restrictive monetary policy in recent years, with hundreds of thousands of German workers forced needlessly into unemployment. These problems will increase when industrial activity shifts to Eastern Europe and Asia, badly affecting each of the eurozone countries to varying degrees during the next five years.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the policy of the European Central Bank has exacerbated these unemployment problems in quite a few Member States. In common with most modern central banks, the European Central Bank operates mainly with an inflation target. This is completely in accordance with economic theory, but too low a target has been chosen. The central banks in Great Britain, Sweden, New Zealand and the United States have higher inflation targets. Modern research indicates that the inflation target should be set at an average of 2.5% or perhaps 3% over an economic cycle so as not to drive people unnecessarily into unemployment. The ECB and its top people should therefore increase their inflation target to an average of at least 2.5%. They deserve to be sharply criticised for their inability to adjust their policy to the way in which the European mixed economy operates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How, Mr Trichet, did you feel this morning when you read in the <span class="italic">Financial Times </span>the damning assessment of the Lisbon strategy by Mr Prodi, who is still President of the Commission and may perhaps continue to be such for a little longer? Did the question present itself to you, too, as to what we in Europe have done wrong? Might it not have something to do with the lamentable fact that we in Europe, represented by spokesmen, some of whom we have already been able to hear here today, have got ourselves stuck in an ideological fight to the death about what the European Central Bank’s primary purpose is meant to be, rather than taking a more pragmatic approach?</p>
<p class="contents">I would just ask my conservative friend Mr Lauk to re-read to himself the speech he has just delivered, this time with reference to American conditions; it would then, probably, become clear – even to him – that price stability and economic growth are always something of which a central bank must not lose sight if its actions are to be effective.</p>
<p class="contents">The same is of course true of the other crucial question about inflation that you, the new President, must ask yourself. It was apparent from your speech that there are certain areas in which we appear already to be moving back from deflation towards inflation. What the Greek Government has pulled off, with the more or less active collaboration, or in any case, negligence, of Eurostat, could perhaps become a problem in other countries. So I really do ask you, in the interests of all those in the euro zone who believe in the euro – and, being an Austrian, I include myself – to be much more critical, and much more vigilant, than your predecessor. If I may mention a third area that I am keen to bring to your attention, I think we have, both in your own field and in the collection of data, really serious problems with transparency. I share the view that more transparency would be a good thing. The President allocated me two minutes and thirty seconds, and I would like to make full use of them.</p>

Mr Hans-Peter Martin has as yet been on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for only a short time, and this is the probable reason why he has not yet realised that there is a link between stable prices, low inflation, growth and employment. I would also like to congratulate you on having helped to give a fixed place in the Constitution to price stability as a European goal and not just something for which the European Central Bank aims, and on the success of your policy of making the ECB more independent and a stronger and communicative player.</p>
<p class="contents">We do, of course, also have a few things for which to ask; one of them has to do with independence, that being that you should resist all the attempts by Finance ministers – and, it obviously has to be said, by the Hungarian Government – to extend their political influence over the ECB’s monetary policy and their personal influence over the national issuing banks. I would also ask you to make yourself, to a greater extent, the prime communicator of the significance of monetary policy in terms of a strong euro, of low rates of inflation, of stable prices, of growth and employment and of the benefits to the economy. We do know that the euro is worth more than the public think it is.</p>
<p class="contents">We urge you to champion the abolition of one- and two-cent coins and the introduction of one- and two-euro notes, and to ensure that transparency is not at odds with independence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Is the euro zone economy, for all that, in good health? Obviously not. Results are mediocre, growth is weak, domestic demand is running out of steam and unemployment is severe, whilst inequality and poverty are on the rise. Hamstrung by the ECB’s independence – which is absurd, yet is enshrined and is soon to be set in stone in the constitution – rendered impotent by the absence of economic governance, weakened by a Stability and Growth Pact that is both rigid and stupid, the EU has subordinated itself to the ECB’s decisions and is paying for price stability in Europe with weak growth and high unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">The out-going Commission proposed a reform to the Stability and Growth Pact that was based on common sense, and yet the ECB – through the voice of its Chairman – completely devoted to its monetarist dogma, was worried that the reform might go beyond the merely cosmetic, in particular by introducing the golden rule that support would be available for the investment needed to meet the Lisbon objectives or by laying the groundwork for a counter-cyclical budgetary policy capable of restarting the machine during periods of slowdown.</p>
<p class="contents">I am personally convinced that the dogmatic leadership of the ECB is the natural consequence of a deadly choice for the EU and its citizens, which consists of removing all forms of economic governance from any political control. I would add that the upshot of this choice is that the most damaging strategies are encouraged. This report, despite its author’s opinion, is thus symptomatic of this phenomenon. In demanding structural reforms, it stigmatises social systems and pension schemes. It also calls for an increase in the working hours of European workers. At this stage, therefore, this report fails to convince us, not least because it has been contaminated by the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. Accordingly, we shall submit several amendments in the course of this debate, and if those amendments are not adopted we will vote against. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have read this report with more than the average level of interest. As rapporteur on the annual report for 2002, I was, above all, interested to see how the aspirations expressed by Parliament in a resolution of July 2003 had been taken on board. This brief and pithy resolution contained not only political but also practical wishes. In the first paragraph of last year’s resolution about the annual report 2003, Parliament asked the ECB to set up a working party to investigate the need for introducing the EUR 1 note. Personally, I cannot see the need for such a note, but I would like the Bank to investigate this in view of confidence in the currency. On page 101 of your annual report, you indicate that the Executive Council will revisit this issue in the autumn of 2004. My first question to you, Mr Trichet, is why you did not, in accordance with Parliament’s resolution, set up a working party. Also, now that the autumn of 2004 is upon us, I would very much like to hear from you what position the Executive Council has adopted with regard to the EUR 1 note. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That has, in particular, become apparent in the events of recent months, in which the euro’s problem has been with the Finance ministers, and in which some of us in the European Parliament have seen with great sorrow the Commission’s failure to take a stand in the way, and with the clarity, that you have done today in this House with regard to how the Stability Pact is to be handled. It is in fact you who guarantee the Stability Pact in the euro zone!</p>
<p class="contents">Here, I am referring in particular to the example of Greece, where we need Europe to exert tighter control, something that I hear said, alas, all too infrequently, even today. I could, for example, imagine a future reversal of the burden of proof, so that the Commission and Eurostat would have to critically examine whether the figures are plausible, and, if they were not, new ones could be called for. Otherwise they would not be regarded as having been reported.</p>
<p class="contents">That would be a first step, and we expect to have to debate and decide, within the life of this Parliament, whether more currencies are to be added. Let me put this question, not only to Eurostat and the Commission, but also to the ECB: do you work on the basis that the figures presented to you are correct? I find it intolerable that it has to date been impossible to give an answer as to whether or not the figures as submitted are accurate.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just briefly turn to what you had to say about the CESR. What is wrong with this process is that the authorities at nation state level are already presenting us with <span class="italic">faits accomplis</span>,<span class="italic"> </span>and that it is becoming ever more difficult for the legal system to circumvent this and arrive at redefinitions.

<p class="contents">I entirely agree with the aspects of Mr Lipietz’s report providing a favourable assessment of the European Central Bank’s reaction during 2003: low interest rates, clarification of the concept of stability and enlargement of the eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">The concern stems from the slow economic activity during 2003, particularly in the eurozone, and the continuing risks to growth. The Union has been designed to bring about both stability and growth; either one of them alone is not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Almunia’s initiative is, therefore, very appropriate, and is going to require support. Hence, given the undeniable role of monetary policy in terms of promoting investment and productivity on the inside and competitiveness on the outside, the report’s resolution must place more emphasis on a close association between the European Central Bank and investment and growth policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the need for structural reforms must not become distorted through erroneous signals; the link between weak economic activity and low working time must therefore be excluded from the resolution. It is not compatible with the criteria of flexibility rather than rigidity, or the productivity criteria. The essential thing is to create more value per unit of time rather than more units of time. In short, a downward model will have a dissolving effect, and we need integrated, intelligent and ambitious economic governance in the economic, social and environmental fields. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, it has been pointed out that the history of the Economic and Monetary Union has been one of success and that this is due to the work of the Bank. I agree with this statement by the rapporteur and I would urge the Governor of the Bank of Spain to continue focusing on price stability as the main objective and not to listen to the sirens’ songs from the left trying to lure him towards other objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to ask the President to tell the Commissioner, who is beside him, that his proposal to make the pact more flexible, the creation of an <span class="italic">à la carte</span> pact, represents a real time-bomb for prices, neutralising the efforts of the Central Bank, for interest rates and, therefore, for investment and employment, for pensions in the future and for the Lisbon reforms. Because if the pact is broken or made more flexible, we will need tomorrow's taxes to pay for today's obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">Why are we not growing? Not because the governments have been disciplined in observing the pact, but because they have done quite the opposite and, furthermore, because they have not fulfilled the obligations we set for them in the Lisbon Pact and which appear in the broad economic guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge the two of you, the President of the Central Bank and the Commissioner, just as we achieved an integrated financial market through a financial services action plan, to produce a financial action plan establishing the reforms and objectives we must achieve, the barriers which are hindering growth and which hence need to be eliminated, the actions we must take and the timetable we must respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, do not take any notice of the governments when they urge you to look the other way when fiscal decisions are not complied with. Rather than that, I would suggest that, like Ulysses, when you hear those sirens’ songs, you tie yourself to the mast and continue on the course which brings us so much success, and convince the Commissioner that that is the course to follow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There has been much agreement during the debate, and this is reflected in the report and has been expressed by the majority of Members who have spoken. Firstly, the success of Economic and Monetary Union; 2003 was the fifth year of Economic and Monetary Union, and over these five years price stability has improved significantly; interest rates have fallen and the economy’s financing conditions are much more stable and satisfactory than they would have been if we had not decided to take the extraordinarily important step of creating an Economic and Monetary Union and creating a single currency with a system enshrining the independent status of the European Central Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with those who have stated that macroeconomic stability, healthy macroeconomic policies, price stability and low interest rates are a necessary condition, but do not by themselves explain the state of growth in the European Union, particularly in 2003, referred to in the report we are debating today, but also during 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Macroeconomic stability, healthy macroeconomic policies, the independence of the European Central Bank, are necessary conditions, but they are not sufficient. And we will of course have the opportunity to debate it from next week. The revitalisation of the Lisbon strategy; new impetus for structural reforms, in accordance with the objectives and guidelines agreed in March 2000, are essential to achieving sustained and stable growth in a European Union which must not only grow, but which, furthermore, must do so in stable conditions, promoting social cohesion and the sustainability of our growth and of our model of growth.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased and this has been demonstrated in the report and in some of your speeches – with the dialogue amongst the institutions, the debate we are holding today being a good example of that. Independence is not incompatible with dialogue. And respect for the roles of each of the Institutions, which form part of the Economic and Monetary Union, helps to make this dialogue fruitful and ensures that it takes place under the best possible conditions, today being an example of that.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make some specific comments, Mr President. Firstly, the Stability and Growth Pact remains fully in force and there are certain phrases in the report’s explanatory statement which could give the impression that the serious political conflict in the Council in November 2003 had mortally wounded that Pact. But as we discussed here last month, the Pact is in force; the European Constitution has just ratified the broad stability objectives in terms of deficit and debt, the framework for economic governance is still the one decided upon at the beginning of Economic and Monetary Union. What we need to do is improve its application, as Mr Trichet has said and, in any event, discuss whether on the basis of our experience and application of the Stability and Growth Pact over recent years, there are possibilities for improving its implementation, not in order to change the objectives of stability and growth, but in order to turn it into reality in a more effective and consistent manner than we have managed so far.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to make a comment, <span class="italic">en</span> <span class="italic">passant</span>, as Mr Trichet would say, on the one and two cent coins. The notes fall within the competence of the European Central Bank, and Mr Trichet will say what he needs to say on behalf of the Bank. Euro coins and their denominations fall within the competence of the Council – which established what those coins are in a Regulation – and of the Commission – which must ensure regulations are complied with. And regardless of the decisions taken, or to be taken in the future, in certain Member States of the eurozone, the one and two cent coins remain legal tender and that is laid down in the regulations and it is the Commission’s duty to ensure that remains the case in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a comment on the economic situation mentioned by Mr Trichet. Tomorrow, following the meeting of the College of Commissioners here in Strasbourg, I will have the opportunity to communicate the Commission's autumn economic forecasts to Parliament and to the public via the media, taking account of something we are going to debate shortly, which is the clearly not positive, in fact negative, impact of the rise in oil prices we have been experiencing over recent months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I simply wished to confirm that the nature of the dialogue between Parliament and the European Central Bank is such that we have recently decided to publish our quarterly forecasts. This was one of Parliament’s suggestions, and we are therefore taking a very important step in a direction referred to by several speakers.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of amendments to the Hungarian law was also raised, and I must say that our ongoing analysis has revealed at least one aspect of the proposals pending before the Hungarian Parliament which we do not believe is acceptable, and which may well need to be the subject of a debate in the near future. This is why I think that it was important for me to be able to reply to you straight away. The dismissal of two vice-presidents of the Monetary Policy Council, the body which sets interest rates, does not appear to us to be at all in keeping with the independence guaranteed under the Treaty of Maastricht. This was all that I wished to say, Mr President, and I have abided by your request. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This issue has raised concerns in most of the Member States. Irish consumer organisations are concerned about the possible inflationary implications of following other Member States in reducing the usage of these small coins or indeed withdrawing them.</p>
<p class="contents">Listening to discussions in the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, it is not clear if these concerns are grounded or not. The debate has centred on statements of personal preference proposing/opposing the argument, using the Netherlands and Finland as case examples. But facts from impact assessment analysis, consumer surveys and so on remain hard to find.</p>
<p class="contents">The Central Bank of Ireland, as in other Member States, is aware that the cost of minting and distributing both coins is substantially greater than their face value. This does alleviate concerns. Mr Trichet, can you give us the facts on the inflationary effects or otherwise of abolishing the 1 and 2 cent coins? Finally, is the ECB in favour of abolishing these coins as a positive move for the future? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
