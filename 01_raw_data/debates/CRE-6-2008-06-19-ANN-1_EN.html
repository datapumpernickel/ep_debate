<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the June 2008 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>In the second half of 2008 three important international meetings will be held: the Third High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness (Accra, 2-4 September), a high-level event on the millennium development goals (New York, 25 September) and an international conference on monitoring financing for development to review implementation of the Monterrey Consensus (Doha, 29 November-2 December).</p>
<p>On 27 May 2008 as part of the preparations for the participation of the EU at these meetings, the Council adopted decisions on the EU as a global partner for development: speeding up progress towards the millennium development goals, in which the ‘The EU strongly reaffirms its long-term financial commitment with developing countries to achieve a collective ODA target of 0.56% GNI by 2010 and 0.7% GNI by 2015, as set out in the May 2005 Council Conclusions, the June 2005 European Council Conclusions and the European Consensus on Development’.</p>
<p>In 2002 and 2005 the European Union adopted commitments of historic importance, in order to contribute to the progress and success of international development financing, but is seriously concerned about the reduction in the amount of common official development assistance (ODA) from EUR 47.7 billion in 2006 to EUR 46 billion in 2007. Despite this, Europe remains the biggest donor in the world, especially in Africa, and judging from the Commission report the reduction in assistance is only temporary. If the forecasts from Member States for 2008 are accurate, the level of assistance this year should again reach a record level.</p>
<p>In order for the EU’s commitments to be more credible in the eyes of the international community, the Council has strongly urged Member States, taking into account the monitoring conference in Doha, to formulate as soon as possible a continuous orientational multi-year time frame, which will show how they intend in national budget procedures and in the context of current competences to achieve the ODA targets.</p>
<p>As for the millennium development goals, the EU will – if possible by the June 2008 meeting of the European Council – draw up an action plan that will define the specific landmarks and measures, along with time frames, in key areas such as education, health, gender equality, water, agriculture, growth and infrastructure, which will contribute to fulfilling the millennium development goals by 2015.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0370"></a>

<p>The Council of the European Union is aware of the position of the Islamic movement Ahmadiyah (Jamaah Ahmadiyah) in Indonesia. The Council is concerned at reports of violence and intolerance towards this movement, and also because it would appear that the Indonesian Government is considering a ban or restrictions on its activities.</p>
<p>We know Indonesia primarily for its democratic, pluralist and tolerant society, and these developments could stain its reputation, which of course it has earned.</p>
<p>On 9 June the Indonesian Government decided that Ahmadiyah could continue to function in the future as a religious community. It had to be enabled to profess its faith and hold religious rites. It was necessary, however, to prohibit all activities of this movement aimed at spreading different interpretations of the ‘basic teachings of Islam’.</p>
<p>The EU Council’s Working Party on Human Rights (COHOM) raised the issue of attacks on the Ahmadiyah community in its May meeting. On 28 May 2008 the EU troika delivered to the Indonesian Director of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs at the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs a coordinated demarche in which it called upon the Indonesian Government to do its utmost to provide for the safety of members of the Ahmadiyah community and to protect their mosques, as well as to conduct a proper investigation into a fire at one mosque. The Director responded to the concern of the EU regarding the attacks and possible ban on the movement with her own expression of concern, and gave an assurance that the Indonesian Government would address this issue seriously and at a high level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0372"></a>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the June 2008 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is aware of the burning issues to which the Member has drawn attention. However, the debates on both directives are still at a very early stage. For the moment the three institutions have not yet agreed on appropriate levels for both targets. One of the Council’s objectives in further negotiation will be to ensure the harmony and proportionality of the agreed targets.</p>
<p>It is very hard to make a direct link between the two targets. The target of the proposed directive on renewable energy sources relates to all types of renewable fuels for transport, involving not just biofuels, but for instance also hydrogen and electricity obtained from renewable sources. It also relates to all forms of transport, including air and maritime transport. However, the aim of the fuel quality directive is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fuels used to power road vehicles and off-road mobile machinery. The use of biofuels is one of many possibilities that the relevant industries could use to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Other possibilities include reducing flaring off at wells and increasing the efficiency of refineries. The scope for using biofuels therefore depends on their availability, relative costs and the saving from greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The three institutions have also agreed in principle that biofuels must adhere to sustainable criteria for reducing possible negative direct effects that might arise through production. The substance of these criteria, which are still a subject of debate, would also influence the spread of biofuels in the market.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the June 2008 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>In the weeks following Cyclone Nargis the EU focused on providing emergency assistance. In close cooperation with the European Commission, on 14 May 2008 the Presidency called an extraordinary session of the GAERC Council (development), at which the humanitarian conditions in Burma/Myanmar were addressed. In its conclusions the Council called upon the authorities of that country to enable unimpeded access to areas in Burma/Myanmar that had been affected by the cyclone.</p>
<p>At the May meeting of the GAERC Council, development ministers again appealed to the authorities in Burma/Myanmar to fulfil the promises they gave to ASEAN and the UN at the donors’ conference in Rangoon (25 May 2008) concerning access for humanitarian workers and humanitarian assistance to the affected areas. The Council took the view that it would be more appropriate if special attention was focused on humanitarian issues, since this could help more victims of the disaster.</p>
<p>The Council publicly regrets that the house arrest of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi was extended on 27 May, and again calls for the immediate release of all political prisoners and detainees. Furthermore, the EU regrets that the authorities of Burma/Myanmar conducted the constitutional referendum on 10 and 24 May in an overall climate of intimidation; for this reason the results lack credibility.</p>
<p>The EU trusts that multiparty elections, which the authorities have announced for 2010, will be prepared and carried out in a way that ensures a credible transition to democracy. Only real dialogue with all politically interested parties will help Burma/Myanmar achieve stability and prosperity. The EU will continue to strive in this direction in the future (including in UN forums), specifically through expression of support for the further activities of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon and Special Adviser Ibrahim Gambari, and through the actions of the EU’s special envoy Mr Fassin, who has just returned from Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>In any event we may hope that based on positive experiences with international assistance the country will recognise that a more open policy would be beneficial.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0375"></a>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the June 2008 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is greatly concerned at the continuously deteriorating situation in the north of Mali and Niger. This situation actually signifies a continuation of the major crisis resulting in part from drought, desertification, insufficient development and the infiltration of political Islam, which has affected the entire Sahel, from Somalia across to Mauritania.</p>
<p>The Council is therefore striving to be able to contribute to resolving this crisis. The deployment of European forces (EUFOR) in Chad (and in the Central African Republic) is contributing in a certain way to stabilising the entire Sahel. If the Chad containment collapses, however, the entire Sahel would be threatened by anarchy and violence.</p>
<p>This issue, which especially affects Mali and Niger, is regularly addressed within the Council. The issue is also being closely followed by the SG/HR: both the Malian president and the prime minister of Niger have been received in Brussels. The SG/HR was also represented at the investiture of President Touré. His envoy discussed the Sahel issue for a long time with responsible persons in leading positions in Mali. In talks with the highest authorities of Algeria and Libya, which are playing a key role in the current efforts to calm the crisis, the SG/HR regularly addresses this matter. In this connection it should be pointed out that all efforts are based on the agreements concluded in Algiers in May 2006. The SG/HR also addressed this issue with the executive secretary of ECOWAS, Dr Mohamed Ibn Chambas, specifically at the recent meeting of the troika with that body, and on 23 May 2008 the SG/HR published a statement on the recent attack in Abeibara.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0378"></a>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the June 2008 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is well aware of the consequences of rising energy prices for European citizens, as well as their negative impact on the European economy; this issue was also addressed at recent meetings.</p>
<p>For some time the Council has supported the active policy in the area of energy efficiency and diversification of energy supply, which can contribute to a slowing down in the growth of energy prices, while the different routes of energy supply concern countries and regions, transport routes and types of fuel.</p>
<p>In 2003 the Council, together with Parliament, adopted Directive 2003/30/EC on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport; this directive expressly provides framework targets for a minimum proportion of renewable fuels that Member States would have to place in their markets within specific deadlines. The Council advises that at the spring session of the European Council in March 2007, the action plan ‘Energy Policy for Europe’ was adopted. This sets the binding target of a 20 per cent share of energy from renewable sources in the entire consumption of energy in the EU by 2020. In line with these targets it is currently studying the Commission’s proposal for a directive on promoting the use of energy from renewable sources, which will, when it is adopted, be an additional contribution to reducing the use of fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Another important area of action is energy efficiency, which in its appeal for greater energy efficiency was also confirmed by the spring European Council of March 2007 – specifically that 20 per cent savings in energy consumption be achieved by 2020. The valid legislation is contributing to the fulfilment of this target, for instance the directive on energy end-use efficiency and energy services, which was adopted in 2006 by Parliament and the Council. Moreover with the aim of promoting energy efficiency on a global level the Council actively supports the establishing of an international platform for cooperation in the area of energy efficiency.</p>
<p>The Council emphasises that there is a need to improve the transparency of oil markets, promote competition in energy markets and strengthen dialogue with oil-producing countries. The Council would also draw attention to the agreement reached in 2005 in Manchester, under which we should avoid any tax-related and other political intervention that would distort competition, since this would prevent economic subjects from adapting appropriately. The measures intended to mitigate the consequences of higher oil prices for the poorer sections of society should be short-term and goal-orientated, and should not distort competition.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0405"></a>

<p>Because of obstructionism on the part of the US authorities, and their systematic refusal over the past two years to grant them to the relatives, visas now take longer to obtain: the waiting time required has risen on average to about a year and can run to as much as two years, as in the case of Elizabeth Palmeiro, the wife of Ramón Labañino, who has not been visited by family members since June 2006. Antonio Guerrero has been denied a visit from his relatives for more than 17 months, and Fernando González has not received any visit for over a year. As a result of the actions of the US authorities, Adriana Pérez has been prevented from visiting Gerardo Hernández, her husband, since 12 September 1998, and Olga Salaneuva has been unable, for the same reason, to visit her husband, René González, since August 2000.</p>

<p>The Council is aware of the fact that the US authorities are not permitting family members and other persons to have contact with five Cuban citizens convicted by those authorities. In its answer to written question <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2007-6094_EN.html">E-6094/07</a> the Council has already regretted the fact that not even Members of the European Parliament were able to obtain permission to visit them.</p>

<p>In its decisions adopted on Monday, 16 June 2008, the Council condemned the violent incidents and other serious shortcomings associated with the elections of 1 June and identified by the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of the OSCE. It called upon the authorities the authorities to investigate all reported incidents and take appropriate action in line with the recommendations from theODIHR/OSCE. In this context it welcomed the commitment of the authorities to address these issues without delay and hold new ballots in all areas where there were irregularities.</p>
<p>The Presidency draws attention to the comments from the previous assessment of the ODIHR/OSCE, where it is clear that in repeated ballots, significant security improvements were ensured, which enabled the majority of voters to cast their votes freely, while at the same time. despite the efforts of state institutions to ensure successful repeated ballots, during the preparations and on the election day of 15 June it was possible to observe continued tension and cases of intimidation.</p>
<p>The Council expects the new Parliament and Government to be established soon and to achieve <br />sustainable progress in reforms. The Council also called on all political parties to promote and participate in a constructive and inclusive dialogue, and to participate in such dialogue and to implement the priorities identified in the Accession Partnership.</p>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the June 2008 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>In accordance with the directives adopted by the Council in June 2002, the Commission is responsible for negotiations regarding economic partnership agreements on the part of the EU. The Commission conducts negotiations upon consultation with a special committee appointed by the Council within the context of these directives, which the Council may amend at any time. Negotiations continuously progress at regional level, while their objective is the earliest possible conclusion of EPAs in the agreed timeframes and with the inclusion of different sectors.</p>
<p>The negotiation process for an EPA is one of the most important matters in the work of the Council. In its session of 27 May 2008 the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) adopted a new package of decisions on economic partnership agreements (EPA). The Council emphasised once again the development-orientated nature of such agreements. The Council welcomes the initialled comprehensive EPA with the CARIFORUM region, which will be signed on 23 July 2008 in Barbados and which it believes to have a promoting role in the processes of regional integration in that region. As regards other regions, the Council has found that the initialling of temporary agreements has prevented the danger of disturbance to market flows, which was of great importance. Now the temporary agreements need to be signed and the WTO informed of this. However, the temporary agreements can be considered merely to be a first step, since only comprehensive regional economic partnership agreements will be able to fulfil the full development potential of the relevant regions.</p>
<p>In its decisions the Council has found with satisfaction that at the start of continued negotiations in 2008 the parties emphasised the common desire to continue negotiations aimed at concluding comprehensive regional economic partnership agreements. The Council strongly supports these joint efforts and is aware of the reservations expressed by ACP partners, and requests that flexibility be incorporated into the deliberation of unresolved issues, both in terms of substance and the actual process of adopting temporary or complete EPA agreements, along with asymmetries compatible on the level of the entire WTO.</p>
<p>The Council believes that economic partnership agreements can play a key and positive role in the regional integration of ACP countries, and that they should be built on existing processes of regional cooperation. The Council is also prepared to support regional integration and economic partnership agreements with trade assistance funds, but points out that trade assistance does not depend on the signing of an EPA or a temporary agreement. The Council emphasises the importance of the current political dialogue with ACP regions regarding EPAs, in order to strengthen the spirit of partnership under the Cotonou Agreement, and will continue to monitor the process on the side of the EU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0417"></a>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the June 2008 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>You are most probably aware that in recent years, promoting the development of a framework for research and innovation on the regional level has been one of the main priority tasks of the EU policy in the field of research and innovation. As for research policy, the Seventh European Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (2007–2013) includes a range of very effective instruments and special programmes (especially the ‘Cooperation’, ‘Capacities’ and ‘People’ programmes).</p>
<p>The new ‘Regions of knowledge’ initiative should also strengthen the research potential in European regions, especially by promoting and supporting the development of regional, research-orientated clusters, bringing together universities, research centres, companies and regional authorities throughout Europe.</p>
<p>We should also mention five common technological initiatives, the initiatives under Article 169 and the initiatives associated with the ERANET system.</p>
<p>Furthermore, effective support for innovations and the introduction of technology at regional level is ensured by the Framework Programme for Competitiveness and Innovation (2007–2013). This is aimed primarily at small and medium-sized enterprises, so it is actually regional innovation and development that has the greatest direct benefit from the programme.</p>
<p>The Slovenian Presidency of the Council also supported the Stockholm Conference on Regional Innovative Clusters in Europe in January 2008. In direct partnership with the Committee of the Regions, the Council committed itself to the creation of a handbook aimed at those involved in research and innovation, and this would contain information on how to exploit the possibility of financing from all existing Community sources, including the Structural Funds; the European Commission is expected to publish the handbook this summer. In this regard attention should also be drawn to the exceptionally important reorientation of Structural Fund operations, which promises much; they should be harmonised with the goals of the Lisbon Strategy regarding competitiveness, innovation, growth and new jobs.</p>
<p>Regional development and prosperity should also be promoted by the Commission initiative for the leading market. The principles of this initiative were confirmed by the Competition Council at the meeting of 29 and 30 May 2008.</p>
<p>Implementation of the aforementioned Lisbon objectives at regional level should also be accelerated by the future mid-term review of the financial framework for the period 2007–2013.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0422"></a>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the June 2008 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is very aware of the possible difficulties described by the Member in her question stemming from the commitment of Lithuania, under the Act of Accession of 2003, to close by 31 December 2009 at the latest Unit 2 (the last unit in operation) of the Ignalina nuclear power station and then dismantle that unit.</p>
<p>In relation to the assumed obligations under the relevant Protocol 4 to the Act of Accession concerning the Ignalina nuclear power station in Lithuania, the Council advises that all Member States have taken on obligations; any kind of change in such obligations, such as the multiannual extension on the operation of the Ignalina nuclear power station mentioned by the Member, would require an amendment in accordance with the procedure under the Act of Accession, especially Article 7 therein.</p>
<p>The Council wishes to draw the Member’s attention to Article 4 of Protocol 4, which states that up until 31 December 2012, in a special case where ‘if energy supply is disrupted in Lithuania’, Lithuania may invoke the general protection clause referred to in Article 37 of the Act of Accession. It should be emphasised that the aforementioned Article 4 would be applied ‘without any prejudice to the provisions of Article 1’, which sets the date of closure.</p>
<p>The Council is aware that many different measures will be needed to limit and eliminate the possible consequences of shutting down the Ignalina nuclear power station. Measures include, but are not limited to, developing new production capacities, a large number of long-distance electricity transmission lines between Lithuania and other Member States, improving energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources. If the Commission decides to submit proposals for such measures, the Council will give them due attention.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0354"></a>

<p>The Commission is following closely the expansion of Heathrow airport and its environmental impact. The competent UK authorities have now finalised the environmental impact assessment of the project, with the public consultation closing in February 2008. The Commission has also received up to date air quality data which confirm exceedance of limit values in the London region.</p>
<p>According to European Union (EU) legislation, it is the responsibility of the United Kingdom (UK) authorities to assess the impact of particular infrastructure projects and ensure that all relevant environmental standards are respected before, during and after the implementation of the project.</p>
<p>The Commission follows UK implementation of provisions in the relevant Community legislation. The 'Project for the sustainable development of Heathrow'<a href="#defann_18_1" name="refann_18_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> includes the UK government's commitment to consider adding a third runway only after public consultation and whilst “complying with strict conditions on air quality and noise”.</p>
<p>On the basis of available information the assessment of environmental impacts has complied with the provisions of the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive 85/337/EEC<a href="#defann_18_2" name="refann_18_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, and the public consultation has taken place as required. The Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive 2001/42/EC<a href="#defann_18_3" name="refann_18_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> has not been applied as the process was launched before it was applicable.</p>
<p>The model results of the impact assessment include explicit projections of the exceedance of the annual nitrogen dioxide limit value, even after 2015. This is five years after its attainment date, and beyond maximum possible postponement conditionally allowed under the new Air Quality Directive<a href="#defann_18_4" name="refann_18_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. This is a cause of concern. The UK may however introduce further abatement measures to compensate for the increased environmental pressure.</p>
<p>The air pollution originating from the potential expansion of Heathrow airport should be included in the update of the air quality plan for greater London. Projected compliance with all the limit values by their respective attainment dates must be demonstrated in the plan by identifying the abatement measures chosen.</p>
<p>In summary, the Commission is aware of the significant environmental pressures, in particular in noise and air pollution, caused by the increase in air traffic throughout Europe. It therefore follows with interest the developments at the EU's largest airport, and monitors implementation of relevant provisions under Community legislation. After the limit value attainment dates, the Commission will enforce compliance with these standards where necessary. Specific decisions related to airport development, such as building the third runway, are under national competence.</p>
<p>The Commission confirms its willingness to discuss these issues further with MEPs and stakeholder groups.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is not aware of any cases where a Rapporteur Member State declared a dossier complete without checking, where applicable, that data-sharing efforts were made. However, the Commission is aware of a case where a company submitted several incomplete dossiers (vertebrate animal studies missing) within the same deadlines as the notified participants for the active substances in question, and requested additional time to negotiate an agreement with the notified participants to refer to their animal studies.

<p>Following the closure of its one nuclear power station, Lithuania, like several other EU Member States, is going to have to rely on other forms of more environmentally-hostile electricity production, such as solid fuels (like coal and oil), or natural gas, market prices for which have risen considerably. Certain forecasts suggest that in 2010, Lithuania's greenhouse gas emission will for this reason alone have increased from five to seven million tonnes per annum, while electricity prices will have doubled against 2008 prices. Furthermore, a 20 to 30% price increase needs to be taken into account as a result of the emission quota trading system. Lithuania, unfortunately remains isolated in energy terms within the EU and is entirely dependent on its domestic production or on electricity imported from Russia. In view of this exceptional situation as regards its energy supplies, and its socio-economic impact, Lithuania is asking the Commission for a compensation mechanism - i.e. a temporary derogation - in the shape of free and gratis greenhouse gas emission quotas for its power stations, which are going to have to produce the electricity currently produced by nuclear energy (4.5 million tonnes of CO2 per annum) until a new nuclear power station is built.</p>
<p>How does the Commission intend to resolve the problems encountered by Lithuania and other Member States as a result of this exceptional situation as regards energy?

<p>Electricity prices freely determined in a well functioning and competitive electricity market are essential in terms of both fighting climate change and security of electricity supply. In this context, the European Union (EU) emission trading scheme integrates the cost of carbon dioxide (CO<span class="sup">2</span>) emissions in electricity prices. However, EU emission trading is not linked to the liberalisation of the Lithuanian energy market, which would be the main driver for higher electricity prices.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the fact that rising electricity prices may entail cases of social hardship.</p>
<p>For this reason, its proposal to amend the EU Emissions Trading System provides the possibility for revenues from auctioning allowances to be used to address social aspects in lower and middle income households. Through the distribution of auctioning rights, Lithuania would be able to raise substantial revenues that can be used for this purpose.</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that, in overall economic terms, Lithuania is expected to benefit from the implementation of the climate and energy package as proposed by the Commission, notably through the redistribution of auctioning rights. This will provide sufficient scope for Lithuania to address potential social impacts.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to highlight that the closure of the Ignalina nuclear power plant is a separate issue.</p>
<p>Detailed provisions on the closure are laid down in Protocol No 4 attached to the Accession Treaty of the ten new Member States including Lithuania. The Council and the Commission have acknowledged the need to help Lithuania in decommissioning Ignalina and in providing alternative energy sources making up for the generation capacity lost through the shut-down. In 2006, the relevant legal framework has been extended up to 2013, providing another € 837 million from the Community budget to this end, which adds to the € 285 million granted for the period 2004 to 2006.</p>
<p>The shut-down of Ignalina has also been fully taken into account in the decision on the Lithuanian National Allocation Plan for the 2<span class="sup">nd</span> trading period of the EU ETS from 2008 to 2012: Lithuania has received one third more allowances than its 2005 verified emissions to cater for the closure of Ignalina.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0391"></a>

<p>On 23 May 2008, the Italian Government issued a decree law under which, in the name of the waste emergency in Campania, derogations are granted to many national laws transposing Community directives, such as Directive 1999/31/EC<a href="#defann_21_1" name="refann_21_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on waste and Directive 85/337/EEC<a href="#defann_21_2" name="refann_21_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on environmental impact assessment. In particular, the decree in question does away with the distinction between waste which can be accepted at non-dangerous waste tips and that which cannot, which in practice means that waste, including toxic waste, can be delivered to sites to which it should not. It classifies sites at which waste awaiting treatment is stored for over a year (and even over 3 years) as ‘waste facilities’, when these are quite simply tips. It permits the construction of waste tips without geological barriers, or with geological barriers that fail to meet the relevant standards, and allows the practice of the mixing and dilution of waste.</p>

<p>The waste crisis in Campania has now existed for more than a decade.</p>
<p>To date, whereas over 7000 tonnes of waste are produced daily in Campania, the waste management capacity of the Region is close to zero.</p>
<p>On 6 May 2008 the College therefore decided to refer Italy to the Court of Justice for failure to establish a sufficient network of waste treatment facilities compliant with standards set by Community law accompanied by a coherent long-term waste management strategy with a view to boosting recycling and separate waste collection.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that Italy is making serious attempts in solving the waste crisis in Naples. Italy is aware that now a point of no return has been reached.</p>
<p>The new law decree of 23 May 2008 no.90 which was presented to the Commission in a technical meeting on 30 May 2008 appears to be a rigorous step in the right direction, making separate waste collection plans and targets obligatory as well as providing for new waste infrastructure such as additional landfills and incinerators.</p>
<p>However, the Commission has already expressed on a technical level its deep concern about provisions in this new decree allowing for a wide derogation of Community law, notably key provisions of the Landfill Directive 1999/31/EC<a href="#defann_21_3" name="refann_21_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and other Directives.</p>
<p>Even where the situation appears difficult, Italian authorities must comply with Community environmental legislation.</p>
<p>Compliance with the acquis is not a bureaucratic exercise. Community environmental law establishes a framework for the protection of human health and of the environment. It would be paradoxical if, in order to face sanitary risks in the short term, human health and the environment were again put at risk, for example by not applying key provisions of the Landfill Directive providing for long term sanitary requirements which depend on the nature – hazardous or non-hazardous – of the waste to be landfilled.</p>
<p>The Commission is ready to assist Italy in identifying certain flexibility mechanisms as provided for by other acts of Community legislation, including the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive<a href="#defann_21_4" name="refann_21_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, to help Italy to tackle the current crisis without breaching EC law.</p>
<p>However, the Commission, as the guardian of the Treaty, will stay firm in its position that no derogation of any binding acquis will be permissible.</p>
<p>The Decree-Law of 23 May 2008 is now before the Italian Parliament for conversion into Law, and the Commission will closely scrutinise the legal text which will be finally enacted. Should Italy put legislation in force allowing undue derogations from the acquis, taking legal action under Article 226 of the Treaty would be the only option available to the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is not aware of a relocation process of waste treatment facilities from "old" EU Member States to Lithuania.</p>
<p>Installations for the treatment of more than 10 tonnes of hazardous waste per day have to be reported to the European Pollutant Emission Register which was established in 2000<a href="#defann_22_1" name="refann_22_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> .

<p>The Commission does not regard EU legislation as encouraging the relocation of waste treatment facilities to new Member States as this legislation applies in all Member States.</p>
<p>Installations for the treatment of hazardous waste are covered by the Waste Framework Directive<a href="#defann_22_2" name="refann_22_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the Directive on hazardous waste<a href="#defann_22_3" name="refann_22_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and – for installations with a capacity exceeding 10 tonnes a day – by the Directive on integrated pollution prevention and control<a href="#defann_22_4" name="refann_22_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. These Directives ensure a high level of environmental and health protection, and the implementing them should prevent adverse effects from waste treatment in all European countries.</p>
<p>Furthermore European legislation on shipments of waste has to be taken into account.

The European Regulation on shipments of waste<a href="#defann_22_5" name="refann_22_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> allows the Member States to raise objections against waste shipments in case the waste treatment in the country of destination would not comply with environmental standards or would lead to treatment under lower standards as in the country of the waste origin.</p>

<p>The Commission shares the grave concern about the poaching and illegal trade of tigers.</p>
<p>Under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) commercial international trade in tigers and tiger products has been prohibited since 1975.</p>
<p>However, in several countries poaching is ongoing and poses a big threat to wild populations of the species.</p>
<p>The Community is fully committed to CITES and plays a key role within the Convention, in particular in order to ensure that its provisions are effectively implemented and enforced.</p>
<p>The Commission has urged China on numerous occasions to step up its efforts to tackle illegal wildlife trade. It understands that China has made progress in improving enforcement of CITES, but intends to raise the matter with them again at relevant opportunities in order to ensure that CITES is being enforced effectively.</p>
<p>The Commission has been critical of the slow progress by India on taking enforcement measures and setting up a specialised wildlife crime organisation, but has noted that this country has now recently taken new measures.</p>
<p>The Commission has expressed on many occasions its willingness to provide funding and technical assistance to India in order to support conservation programmes for the species and to address poaching. It is the Commission's intention to raise this further with India in appropriate bilateral meetings.</p>
<p>Although such funding and assistance has not yet been requested by India, the Commission has provided funding through its multilateral programme for an Asian CITES implementation and enforcement workshop in China in 2005. This workshop addressed enforcement issues and regional cooperation in combating illegal trade in tiger products.</p>
<p>The Commission also intends to provide funding for a CITES enforcement meeting due to take place next year, which will focus on illegal tiger trade as well.</p>
<p>The European Community fully supported the decisions to strengthen existing measures under CITES at the 14th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention in June 2007. These decisions include in particular a requirement that the countries concerned improve international cooperation in conservation and trade controls for tigers. It also calls for the set up of regional enforcement networks.</p>
<p>The Range States, including India, China and Nepal, are due to report about progress made to the next CITES Standing Committee meeting in July 2008. The Standing Committee will review the progress and consider any further actions needed. The Commission is studying the documents presented by the Range States and will call on the Standing Committee to ensure that the agreed measures are indeed taken by the countries involved.</p>
<p>The Commission is fully convinced that urgent steps are needed in order to ensure the protection of the species, and will use appropriate opportunities in its regular contacts with the countries concerned to express this view.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0402"></a>

<p>– as regards waste, the Waste Framework Directive<a href="#defann_24_2" name="refann_24_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and the Landfill Directive<a href="#defann_24_3" name="refann_24_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In particular, the Water Framework Directive provides</p>
<p>– for an obligation to achieve or maintain good water quality ('good status') for all waters (rivers, lakes, groundwaters, coastal waters) as a rule by 2015;</p>
<p>– for an obligation to develop for each river basin district the necessary plans and programmes by 22.12.2009, taking into account all human activities;</p>
<p>– for an obligation, in the case of river basins shared between Member States (such as the Nestos/Mesta basin) for coordination and cooperation between the Member States concerned.</p>
<p>Complementary to this, the EU waste legislation provides for a set of key obligations such as:</p>
<p>– ensuring that waste is recovered or disposed of without endangering human health and the environment, and that waste management plans are drawn up;</p>
<p>– prohibiting abandonment, dumping or uncontrolled disposal of waste;</p>
<p>– taking appropriate measures to establish networks of disposal installations;</p>
<p>– or ensuring that only waste that has been subject to treatment is landfilled.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that the quality of Europe's waters is – despite efforts taken in past years and improvement achieved – not yet fully satisfactory. This is notably the case of the waters of the Nestos / Mesta river basin shared between Bulgaria and Greece.</p>
<p>Both countries will be obliged to jointly develop the necessary plans and programmes by December 2009, and to implement the necessary measures, based on the Water Framework Directive.</p>
<p>The Commission is closely following the implementation measures being prepared and taken by Member States based on this key piece of legislation. The Commission's first Implementation Report was presented to the European Parliament and the Council in 2007<a href="#defann_24_4" name="refann_24_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. The Commission can assure the Parliament that it will continue to monitor this closely in all Member States and where necessary take legal enforcement action.</p>
<p>As regards waste management in Bulgaria, the Commission has received information about possible problems with a number of landfills, and has accordingly written to the Bulgarian authorities.</p>
<p>As regards funding possibilities, EU funding instruments are in place to support achievement of environmental objectives.</p>
<p>Measures relating to water management and waste management, from data collection and planning to operational implementation, are eligible under both the Cohesion Fund and the European Fund for Regional Development.</p>
<p>It is however ultimately for Member States to select – within these eligible measures– their priorities and projects.</p>
<p>It is also worth recalling that, whilst funding under the European Fund for Regional Development is available for all Member States, funding under the Cohesion Fund is targeted at certain Member States, inter alia Bulgaria and Greece.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Deforestation is responsible for approximately 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

<p>Deforestation has been a prominent topic of discussion at recent international negotiations on climate change and on biodiversity. To further develop the policy at European level the Commission is working on a Communication that will explore the options of combating deforestation in developing countries, where the rate of forests loss is on a steady rise.</p>
<p>The total European Union (EU) forest area has been increasing steadily over recent decades. The expansion of forest area in the EU far outweighs the loss of forest land to infrastructure and urban planning.</p>

<p>In addition, the Commission has been funding actions to fight deforestation under the environment and tropical forests budget line (B7-6200), and will continue to do so through the Thematic Programme for Environment and Sustainable Management of Natural Resources including Energy<a href="#defann_25_1" name="refann_25_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> (ENRTP).</p>
<p>The question of a new global financial mechanism to cover activities to fight deforestation in developing countries –is a question that is still being debated although a possible source of funding could be earmarking a percentage of the proceeds from the EU-Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) auctioning after 2012.</p>
<p>The timing is important as the period before Copenhagen is key for shaping the future climate change regime, including actions to reduce emissions from deforestation.</p>
<p>The Commission is preparing a stakeholder consultation and is working on an impact assessment study. Based on the results, the Commission will work towards an adoption of the Communication by the end of 2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Due to the nature of the Nordstream project (a pipeline of 1200 km running across the territory of more than one Member State and with consequent environmental impacts in one Member State potentially affecting another one) an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is currently being carried out in the framework of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on EIA in a Transboundary Context (the Espoo Convention 1991), which also satisfies the requirements of the EIA Directive 85/337/EC as amended<a href="#defann_27_2" name="refann_27_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. This process includes EIA documentation, usually called an "environmental report", prepared under the responsibility of the developer, which in this case is a private company "Nordstream AG", and consultations of the competent national authorities and the public in general. All "parties concerned" must be consulted, that is both "parties of origin" (the contracting parties to the Espoo Convention under whose jurisdiction a proposed activity is envisaged to take place) and "affected parties" (the contracting parties to the Convention likely to be affected by the transboundary impact of the proposed activity).</p>
<p>Although the notification of the project, with preliminary information on its possible impacts took place in late 2006, the EIA is still ongoing with additional studies, reports and specific information still being produced and used for consultations. The final environmental report is expected later this year. The competent national authorities, as well as the general public, will have an opportunity to express their views and submit their comments during the consultation procedure. These views will be taken into account in the development consent to be granted by the national authorities. It is clear that all relevant information, including the environmental report, will be available also to the Commission and Parliament.</p>
<p>However, it must be noted that the responsibility for assessing the environmental impact and eventually granting development consent lies with the competent authorities of the Member States. The Commission can intervene and take appropriate legal action only in the case of a breach of Community legislation is identified.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, Council Decision 2006/688/EC<a href="#defann_28_1" name="refann_28_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> of 5 October 2006 set up a mutual information mechanism between the Commission and the Member States on planned national asylum and immigration measures.</p>

<p>The ‘security package’ has not yet been notified to the Commission. According to the information available to the Commission, Decree Law No 92 of 23 May 2008 on urgent measures concerning public safety came into force on 27 May 2008 and is already applicable; however, it will have to be confirmed by the Italian Parliament within 60 days. The Commission’s position will depend on the final text of the Decree Law. The Commission is also aware of the adoption by the Council of Ministers on 21 May 2008 of a draft legislative decree concerning the free movement of Community citizens; however, it does not have at its disposal the final text of the decree.</p>
<p>With regard to the introduction of automatic expulsions to which the Honourable Member refers, according to Directive 2004/38/EC, measures taken on grounds of public policy or public security must be based exclusively on the personal conduct of the individual concerned which must represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society. This involves an individual assessment of each case. The Directive also stipulates that previous criminal convictions could not in themselves constitute grounds for taking such measures. Accordingly, the existence of a criminal conviction can be successfully argued only in so far as the circumstances which gave rise to that conviction are evidence of personal conduct constituting a present threat to the requirements of public policy. As confirmed by the Court of Justice, Community law also precludes provisions of national law based on a presumption that nationals of other Member States who have received a particular sentence for specific offences must be expelled.</p>
<p>All Directives adopted in the field of asylum and immigration already contain ‘public order’ clauses which allow Member States to withdraw residence permits and to expel third-country nationals who constitute a threat to public policy or public security. It should be noted that the European Convention on Human Rights and the general principles of Community law still require an individual approach with regard to expulsion on grounds of public policy or public security. Each case must always be considered on an individual basis taking into account the severity and type of offence, the danger that emanates from the person concerned, the duration of residence in the territory of the Member State, the consequences for the person concerned and family members and links with the country of residence. National legislation which provides for the automatic expulsion of third-country nationals in cases where the person concerned is sentenced to more than two years’ imprisonment leaving no room for individualised consideration to take into account the above-mentioned aspects could be considered to be contrary to Community law.</p>
<p>With regard to the introduction of a new aggravating circumstance to which the Honourable Member refers, the right of EU citizens to reside in a Member State derives from the Treaty and is not dependent upon their having completed administrative procedures such as obtaining a registration certificate, which may under no circumstances constitute a reason for expulsion on grounds of public policy or public security. Moreover, the application of such an aggravating circumstance to offences committed by non-national Union citizens would be contrary to the principle of proportionality and to the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality.</p>
<p>As for the amendment introduced in Legislative Decree No 286 of 25 July 1998 on immigration which provides that owners who rent apartments to foreigners staying illegally are punished with imprisonment of six months to one year referred to by the Honourable Member, this Decree does not appear to apply to EU citizens.</p>
<p>According to Article 1(1)(b) of Council Directive 2002/90/EC of 28 November 2002 defining the facilitation of unauthorised entry, transit and residence<a href="#defann_30_3" name="refann_30_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, each Member State shall adopt appropriate sanctions on ‘any person who, for financial gain, intentionally assists a person who is not a national of a Member State to reside within the territory of a Member State in breach of the laws of the State concerned on the residence of aliens.’ Article 1 of the Council framework Decision of 28 November 2002 on the strengthening of the penal framework to prevent the facilitation of unauthorised entry, transit and residence<a href="#defann_30_4" name="refann_30_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> provides that ‘each Member State shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the infringements defined in Articles 1 and 2 of Directive 2002/90/EC are punishable by effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties which may entail extradition.’</p>
<p>Accordingly, some owners of property rented to illegal immigrants could be covered by these provisions if they, for financial gain, intentionally assist them to reside illegally within the territory of a Member State. National legislation which introduces penalties applicable, in a general way, to all landlords who, for financial gain, intentionally assist illegal immigrants to reside within the territory of a Member State constitutes implementation of Directive 2002/90/EC. Legislation that goes beyond implementation of this Directive is a matter for national law. The Commission notes that the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in accordance with its Article 51(1), applies to the Member States only when they are implementing Union law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission contributes to the fight against cross-border organised crime by devising measures and actions which find their tangible expression in legislation, the establishment of networks for the exchange of best practice and disseminating knowledge and information (statistics, threat assessment, etc.) and the funding of cooperation projects.</p>
<p>As part of the fight against cyber crime, the Commission has established a comprehensive policy in its Communication of May 2007 entitled ‘Towards a general policy on the fight against cyber crime’<a href="#defann_31_1" name="refann_31_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The Commission has established an ad hoc public-private group to assist it in the preparation of proposals for specific recommendations that will affect, in particular, the exchange of operational and strategic information, the setting up of permanent public-private contact points and the establishment of a public-private structure for the training of experts.</p>
<p>Trafficking in human beings is also a priority for the European Commission. At the initiative of the Commission, the Council adopted a framework decision that criminalises trafficking and an action plan with specific measures to combat trafficking<a href="#defann_31_2" name="refann_31_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. The Commission has developed a set of indicators to assess the quality of national policies against trafficking and has established active dialogue with non-governmental organisations (NGOs). For 2007, the Commission has already funded projects to the tune of more than EUR 7 million. The Commission has also set up an Expert Group to provide a basis for its discussion, and a study is under way to consider the feasibility of a European ‘hotline’. On 18 October 2007, the Commission organised the first EU Anti-Trafficking Day, putting the rights of the victim at the heart of the European anti-trafficking strategy, and issued a set of recommendations, endorsed by the Council, relating to assistance to and protection of victims of trafficking.</p>
<p>With regard to the protection of minors against sexual exploitation, the Commission has started discussions on the need to update the Framework Decision concerning this issue<a href="#defann_31_3" name="refann_31_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, including the introduction of the crime of soliciting children for sexual purposes using information technology (‘grooming’). The Commission will promote operations conducted by specialised law enforcement units that are aimed at identifying child pornography sites and networks and prosecuting those responsible or at identifying the child victims appearing in the images. It will also encourage the formation of an alliance between the various parties involved (financial institutions, Internet service providers, etc.) with a view to assisting in the search for criminals and in the termination of contracts used to purchase images of child pornography on the Internet. The Commission is also committed to establishing a system for exchanging information on criminal records that will enable the judicial authorities of the Member States to take into account convictions handed down in another Member State.</p>
<p>As part of the fight against corruption, in February 2008, the Commission adopted a staff working document which examines the link between corruption and organised crime<a href="#defann_31_4" name="refann_31_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. This document identifies the specific vulnerabilities to corruption within private sector organisations and considers the countermeasures to be taken. Based on the conclusions of this document, the Commission is shortly to launch a study whose results will also complement the work of the Commission’s Expert Group on the policy needs of data on crime and criminal justice, specifically in relation to its promoting the development of harmonised operational definitions and statistical indicators on corruption. In March 2008, the Commission received the results of a Eurobarometer survey on the subject of corruption. According to this survey, 75% of EU citizens believe that corruption is a major problem in their country.</p>
<p>The confiscation of the proceeds of crime helps to step up and strengthen the fight against organised crime and terrorism by depriving criminals of their illicit gains and preventing them from reinvesting them in all kinds of illicit trafficking. Various legislative instruments have been established at European level to assist, in all stages of criminal proceedings, in the identification, freezing, confiscation and recovery of criminal assets through the harmonisation of national law and the mutual recognition of judgments. Given the delay in the implementation of these instruments, the Commission is drafting, for late 2008, a communication aimed at improving the effectiveness of EU action in this area.</p>
<p>As for the fight against the financing of terrorism, the EU’s policy is based on the comprehensive EU strategy presented in 2004<a href="#defann_31_5" name="refann_31_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> which sets out the Commission’s objectives: the effective use of financial intelligence and cooperation between financial intelligence units (FIUs). A report on the implementation of Council Decision 2000/642/JHA was adopted in December 2007<a href="#defann_31_6" name="refann_31_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> and a follow-up evaluation is under way.</p>
<p>The Commission is also channelling funds into the establishment of a network of national financial intelligence units, particularly through a project of almost EUR 2 million for the development of such a network.</p>
<p>The statistics currently available on crime at EU level are lacking, particularly in terms of comparability of data between Member States. The Commission services, including the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat), have launched a large-scale exercise and are now putting into practice, in coordination with the Member States and relevant organisations, an action plan for the period 2006-2010<a href="#defann_31_7" name="refann_31_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a>. The aim is to improve the quality and comparability of the criminal and judicial statistics of Member States, coordinate the collection of data across Member States and publish statistics and analyses on the Commission’s websites.</p>
<p>In December 2006, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Decision<a href="#defann_31_8" name="refann_31_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a>; firstly, to replace the current Europol Convention with a Council Decision, so that Europol’s legal framework can be adapted more rapidly in response to trends in crime; and, secondly, to replace intergovernmental financing with Community funding. On 18 April 2008, the Council reached political agreement on the text of the Decision, which is expected to be adopted in the autumn.</p>
<p>The financial programme for 2007-2013, ‘Prevention of and fight against crime’, is an important tool for the Member States. Under this programme, Member States may receive cofinancing for cross-border projects in priority areas identified by the Commission. The annual work programme, drawn up and adopted by the Commission, is modulated so that it may respond more effectively to ever changing needs and focus Member States’ efforts so as to create genuine synergies. In 2008, more than EUR 50 million have been made available.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The impact of climate change on migration movements is a topic of growing political interest worldwide.</p>
<p>As the recent paper on Climate Change and International Security prepared by the High Representative and the European Commission<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> pointed out, climate change may act as a 'threat-multiplier', exacerbating trends, tensions and instabilities which would already have an influence on migration patterns.</p>
<p>Although there is strong anecdotal evidence pointing to the interconnection between climate change and migration, establishing a direct and exclusive linkage between the two phenomena is difficult due to lack of reliable research data and conclusions. Individual decisions to migrate are usually the results of complex considerations: personal, social, economic and also environmental factors that cannot typically be transformed into one single relationship of causality. Presently available studies also highlight that environmentally-induced migration takes place in most cases in an intra-state context.</p>
<p>"Environmental refugee" does not exist as a legal term in the international human rights regime and is not used by Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). However, the European Union's cooperation programmes with the countries in question do aim at improving living conditions and stimulating economic growth which has an indirect effect on migration patterns. Beyond this, the European Union (EU) endorsed in November 2007 a proposal by the European Commission on establishing a Global Climate Change Alliance<a href="#defann_32_2" name="refann_32_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, aimed at raising significant resources for adaptation action in the most vulnerable developing countries, to ease the negative effects of climate change.</p>
<p>Overall, the Commission is convinced of the need for a comprehensive strategy on climate change addressing both its causes and consequences. However, in order to be able to formulate informed policy decisions on some of the interlinking issues such as migration, emphasis should be placed first on filling the knowledge gaps. An ongoing two-year EC research project on Environmental Change and Forced Migration Scenarios (EACH-FOR)<a href="#defann_32_3" name="refann_32_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>focuses on the trends of multiple environmental problems and the associated socio-political and demographical aspects in a large number of regions and countries, including those of Northern Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>As regards the multilateral scene, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Social and Human Sciences programme has recently begun working to develop knowledge, research and capacity on urban policy, giving consideration to the environmental impact of uncontrolled urbanization of rural and coastal territories due to climate change-related migration and consumption. The UNHCR is also planning to look into the issue of environmentally induced displacement from a human rights/protection perspective<a href="#defann_32_4" name="refann_32_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>These processes may also contribute to a more advanced multilateral thinking on conceptual questions like the definition of environmental migrants or the development of more inclusive international human rights protection regimes. The Commission is following closely this international work so to ensure that any future EU policy response designed to address the nexus of climate change and migration can take full account of these developments.</p>
<p>The Commission is committed to promoting better coherence among our policies. The comprehensive European migration policy under development seeks to explore and strengthen the coherence between migration and environment. Moreover, the ongoing work on the Commission White Paper on Adaptation will involve aligning external policies in the broadest sense in accordance with the emerging global challenges that climate change poses.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>One of the main objectives of the recently adopted Directive 2007/64/EC on payment services in the internal market<a href="#defann_33_1" name="refann_33_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which has to be implemented by 1 November 2009, is to provide a single set of rules with regard to the information requirements and the rights and obligations linked to the provision and use of payment services, including, among others, strict rules on execution time of electronic credit transfers. Under these rules, banks and other payment service providers will need to guarantee the maximum time it takes to make a payment and that this will be standardised for all credit transfers within the EU, no matter which Member State the payment is coming from or going to.</p>
<p>In accordance with Article 69(1) of the Directive, from 1 January 2012 all credit transfers without any currency conversion must mandatorily be carried out at the latest by the end of the next business day (i.e. the so-called "D+1" basis). This "D+1" rule will apply to: a) euro currency payment transactions, both national and cross-border within the EU; b) national payment transactions in the currency of the Member State concerned; c) certain payment transactions involving currency conversion between the euro and the currency of a non-euro Member State. However, the Directive recognises that banks need time to upgrade existing products and systems. Therefore, up to 1 January 2012, this provision allows parties to agree on a maximum execution time of "D+3" for credit transfers. Furthermore, the Directive allows the parties to agree on an extra business day for paper-initiated payment transactions.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to underline that the "D+1" execution time under Article 69(1) of the Payment Services Directive is only a maximum period. Hence, where payments are currently carried out within one day, this practice should be maintained. To guard against the risk of payment services providers actually increasing the execution time, Article 72 of the Directive allows Member States to opt for a shorter payment time for purely national payment transactions. In addition, the Directive always allows payment service providers to give customers more favourable terms.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In the spirit of the Common Market, transparency and economic efficiency, the European Commission has a working method whereby the financial decisions of other Commission directorates are put under the scrutiny of the Competition Directorate.</p>
<p>A few policy-making sectors were, however, excepted from this scrutiny for strategic reasons. The decisions to do so were taken long ago, and both the EU and the world around it have changed dramatically since then.</p>
<p>Rather than being simply a strategic aspect of society, transport and mobility in wider terms are nowadays a key factor in people’s and businesses’ everyday lives; they are the source of our well-being and economic prosperity, and constitute one of our basic freedoms and a key element in our quality of life.</p>
<p>The current system whereby one and the same body ‘decides and executes’ clearly leads to biased transport policy decisions and abuse of public funds.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission would point out that with respect to the funding of EU transport policy, it is important to distinguish on the one hand between funding from the Community budget, and on the other hand funding from Member State budgets.</p>
<p>1. Decisions on funding from the Community budget are prepared by the responsible Commission Directorate General (i.e. Directorate General (DG) for Energy and Transport, DG for Research, DG for Regional Policy and DG for Information Society and Media), and following consultation of all concerned Directorates General approved by the Commission as a college.</p>
<p>2. Decisions on funding from Member State budgets are (if they amount to State aid falling within Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty) subject to State aid control by the Commission. State aid decisions are prepared by the responsible Directorate General (i.e. DG for Energy and Transport for transport and coal, DG for Agriculture and Rural Development for agriculture, DG for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries for fisheries and DG for Competition for all other industry and service sectors), and then following consultation of all concerned Directorates General approved by the Commission as a College.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the principle of collegiality ensures that there is therefore adequate control of funding decisions in the area of transport.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0348"></a>

Following that Communication, the Commission has worked, during six months, with national authorities and industry to obtain the following results:</p>
<p>– agreement among the National Enforcement Bodies on a clear division of labour and responsibilities in complaint handling and exchanging information;</p>
<p>– making progress towards a common interpretation of some parts of the relevant legislation.</p>
<p>These new procedural agreements among the National Enforcement Bodies need to be applied and the application will be closely monitored by the Commission; if appropriate, infringement procedures will be initiated against those Member States which do not fully comply with Article 16 of Regulation 261/2004. Furthermore, National Enforcement Bodies together with the airlines have confirmed that the burden of proof as regards the existence of extraordinary circumstances is with the airline and not with the passenger. If an airline would not present substantial and detailed evidence to the designated national authority, the National Enforcement Body concerned will decide on the basis of the facts presented by the passenger.</p>
<p>In the light of the progress realised between April and November 2007, it would be untimely to propose new amendments to Regulation 261/2004. At the same time, the Commission keeps up its intensified activities related to the monitoring of application and enforcement by the Member States through their National Enforcement Bodies but the Commission has no competence whatsoever to directly impose sanctions on airlines neither Member States for the Regulation concerned.</p>
<p>The Commission will organise a new roundtable with the National Enforcement Bodies and airline industry in September 2008 where the European Consumer Centres will be invited as well.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission shares the concern of the Honourable Member that proper levels of safety are provided for children transported in motor vehicles.</p>
<p>Since May 2006, all children have to be transported in suitable seats which comply with technical criteria as specified under Regulation 44 of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe in Geneva.</p>
<p>With regards to the safety provisions for child restraints, the Commission is of the view that the requirements of Regulation 44 can and need to be improved. For this reason the Commission has ensured priority is given to updating these requirements in the Geneva working goup responsible for these issues. The need for such improvements has been widely recognised by members of the working group and, consequently, the group has accepted side impact protection as a high priority.</p>
<p>The review of requirements for child restraints is now underway and it is now agreed that a proposal for amendments, to strengthen the security provided by them, will be developed under the current forum in Geneva. Three meetings have been held for that purpose during the first semester of 2008.</p>
<p>It is intended that this topic will be maintained on the agenda of the main working party under the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) in forth-coming sessions in Geneva.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to be closely involved in the work of this group and ensure that the necessary changes will be adopted by the Geneva parties in an aceptable timeframe taking account of the safety aspects of this topic for children. The time needed for this process of adaptation of new requirements is due to the necesssity to ensure that the foreseen requirements will be properly tested and thus effective in the proctection of the child.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0353"></a>

For this reason, the German authorities have not submitted a request for funding under the 2007-2013 multiannual programme.

<p>As regards priority project No 17, the Paris-Strasbourg-Stuttgart-Vienna-Bratislava railway axis, the Commission decided to grant substantial subsidies to the tune of EUR 438 million, in particular for the three cross-border sections and the Stuttgart-Ulm bottleneck.</p>
<p>No funding has been provided for the Munich-Mühldorf-Freilassing section because of the absence of a comprehensive approach to this section, although such an approach would allow international trains to run via Mühldorf rather than via Rosenheim. The European Coordinator appointed by the Commission in July 2005, Péter Balázs, included a detailed analysis of this section in his second annual report. He emphasised the need for an integrated approach, including electrification. Given the absence of such an approach, the Commission has decided not to award a grant for this section.</p>
<p>As you are aware, the Commission consulted the European Parliament on its proposed multiannual programme on 19 November 2007.

<p>The response to the Honourable Member will consider ocean energy in a wider context, which includes energy converters for the exploitation of wave, tidal and current energy, as well as salinity and thermal gradients.</p>
<p>Ocean energy is part of the Commission's current overall strategy for research in the field of new and renewable energy sources aimed at raising substantially the share of renewable electricity production in the EU, while taking into account the different regional conditions where sufficient economic and technical potential can be identified.</p>
<p>The existing Directive 2001/77/EC on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market<a href="#defann_39_1" name="refann_39_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> sets a 21% indicative share of electricity to be produced from renewable energy sources in total Community electricity consumption by 2010. On 23 January 2008 the Commission adopted a new energy and climate package<a href="#defann_39_2" name="refann_39_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> including a proposal for a new Directive on the promotion of the use of renewable energy, setting national binding targets for the share of renewable energy consumption, aimed at together achieving the overall 20% EU target. Once adopted, this Directive will take over and strengthen many of the provisions currently included in Directive 2001/77/EC.</p>
<p>At present, most efforts in research, development and demonstration activities are concentrated on tidal currents and wave power. In 2007, there were worldwide 53 ocean wave energy converter technologies at different development stages. Since it is not yet clear which schemes will be the most cost-effective in the harsh marine environment, more research, development and demonstration (RD&amp;D) efforts are needed in this field, notably to select and optimise the most promising design solutions.</p>
<p>Research should increase overall conversion efficiency, cost efficiency, significantly drive down the cost of electricity production, enhance process reliability and further reduce the environmental impact and eliminate existing obstacles such as electrical grid connection challenges, absence of assessment guidelines and standards, administrative barriers linked to licensing and permitting processes.</p>
<p>Under the 6<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for Research and Development (FP6) (2002-2006) the European Commission supported 14 ocean energy projects with a total EC contribution of €21 million. This effort is already being continued under the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme (FP7) (2007-2013) with 2 EU-funded projects for a total EC contribution of about €7.5 million in the first call in 2007.</p>
<p>The current cost of electricity generation from the first-generation prototype plants varies from € 0.08/kilowatt hour (kWh) to € 0.20/kWh. It is expected that a continued effort in research and development (R&amp;D) should lead to an electricity cost of around 0.05 €/kWh in the coming 10-20 years.</p>
<p>A global comparison of EU Member States' performance in research and development in this area shows UK, Ireland, Portugal and Denmark as having the largest number of projects and the biggest budget spent in this field. This is essentially due to the fact that along the western coast of Europe the wave climate is highly energetic and thus particularly favourable to this kind of application.</p>
<p>Other EU Member States (notably Belgium, Finland, France, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden) are also developing ocean energy technologies, mainly in the field of wave energy.</p>
<p>The European Commission, together with 11 other member countries, also participates in the International Energy Agency Implementing Agreement on Ocean Energy Systems (OES), and the membership is expected to increase to 18 members in 2008</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Islands and in particular small remote islands have since long occupied a special place in Cohesion policy. Article 29(3) of Council Regulation (EC) n° 1260/1999 on the Structural Funds<a href="#defann_40_1" name="refann_40_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> for the 2000-2006 period foresaw the possibility of a Community co-financing rate up to 85% (as opposed to the normal ceiling of 75%) for the outermost regions and the outlying Greek islands.</p>
<p>In a similar spirit, Article 52(f) of Council Regulation (EC) n° 1083/2006 on the Structural and Cohesion Funds<a href="#defann_40_2" name="refann_40_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> for the 2007-2013 period provides for the possibility of modulating co-financing rates under the Regional competitiveness and employment objective specifically in the case of islands. Moreover, Article 10 of the Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006<a href="#defann_40_3" name="refann_40_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> provides that programmes co-financed by this Fund, covering areas facing geographical and natural handicaps as referred to in point (f) of Article 52 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 shall pay particular attention to addressing the specific difficulties of those areas. To this purpose the ERDF may, in the cases of islands, contribute towards the financing of investments aimed at improving accessibility, promoting and developing economic activities related to cultural and natural heritage, promoting the sustainable use of natural resources, and encouraging sustainable tourism.</p>
<p>Concerning the programming period 2007-2013 in Greece, most islands are covered by the regional operational programme "North and South Aegean islands and Crete". The Ionian islands and the Sporades are covered by, respectively, the regional operational programmes "Western Greece, Peloponnesus and Ionian islands" and "Thessaly, Continental Greece and Epirus". For each of the regions covered by these programmes, a specific priority axis addresses needs in terms of accessibility infrastructures and services. Because the South Aegean region has become part of the Regional competitiveness and employment objective, the relevant priority axes have been reinforced by additional national resources allocated specifically to the South Aegean islands, in order to compensate for the relative decrease of available Community funds for this region.</p>
<p>Apart from these regional programmes, all islands are eligible to receive support under the thematic operational programmes "Improvement of accessibility" and "Environment and Sustainable development", of which the former covers accessibility infrastructures and services.</p>
<p>As concerns small island communities, in 2005 the Greek authorities and the Commission agreed to create under the Third Community Support Framework a special package in support of such islands. This same idea has inspired the inclusion, in the 2007-2013 regional operational programme "North and South Aegean islands and Crete" already mentioned, of a specific priority axis to address the needs of small islands in the South Aegean region.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission would like to thank the Honourable Member for her oral question regarding resolution of the conflicts in Mali and Niger.</p>
<p>In general, and in the particular case of the violent acts perpetrated in northern Mali and the clashes between the Tuareg Niger Movement for Justice (MNJ) and the army of Niger, the Commission is strongly in favour of a negotiated settlement and does not approve the use of armed force. The Commission particularly disapproves the use of anti-personnel mines which have already resulted in deaths among civilians in both Niger and Mali.</p>
<p>The aim is certainly to strengthen the dialogue on the challenges to be faced regarding peace and security as outlined by the proposed document for an Africa-EU Strategic Partnership. The Commission is in favour of seeking a solution at regional level and is prepared to back any action taken towards that end, whether in the form of conferences to be proposed at this time by officials in Niger and Mali or support for regional organisations, such as the Economic Community of the States of West Africa (ECOWAS) and the Community of Sahel-Saharan States (CEN-SAD).</p>
<p>In the case of Mali, the EC has always been supportive of the approach based on dialogue and peace adopted by the Malian Government and the Democratic Alliance of 23 May for Change which led to the Algiers Agreement in July 2006.</p>
<p>According to the latest official statements made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Mali, this Agreement and the resolutions adopted by the March 2007 Kidal Forum continue to apply for the purpose of resolving the conflict. The Commission welcomes this.</p>
<p>Dealing more particularly with Niger, the Commission is closely monitoring the situation. It is particularly concerned about the deterioration of the security situation in northern Niger, a situation which affects the civilian population already afflicted by the difficult living conditions in this region. A sense of instability also permeates every aspect of the ongoing cooperation in the north of the country.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission supports the initiatives announced by the Presidents of Mali and Niger to hold, in the near future, a Sahel-Saharan regional conference on security, peace and development.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission seeks to make every effort to contribute to the development of northern Mali and Niger, the region most affected by the conflict. Against this background, the Commission would point out that the Country Strategy Papers and the Indicative Programmes for both Mali and Niger have recently been approved for the period 2008-2013. Under the 2008-2013 programme, a very substantial amount has been allocated to support the development of these two countries, particularly in the area of governance.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0377"></a>

<p>The Bettembourg-Perpignan Rail Highway (BPRH) was inaugurated in 2007. This event constituted a first step towards a future network of rail highways in a transport-oriented EU which is environmentally aware and wishes to break with the 'lorry or nothing' mentality. However, seven months after its entry into service the BPRH is operating at only 30-40% of its capacity. The reason for this under-usage is that EU Directives 96/53/EC<a href="#defann_43_1" name="refann_43_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and 97/27/EC<a href="#defann_43_2" name="refann_43_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> (which restrict the maximum height of lorries to 4 metres, with a 1% tolerance) are not being observed. Most semi-trailers operating on EU roads are of a height which exceeds the 4-metre limit by over 30%, which means that they cannot be transported by rail on account of the limited clearance within tunnels and under catenaries. This state of affairs compromises the development and even the existence of rail highways within the EU.</p>

<p>The issue raised by the Honourable Member concerns the difficulty that l’Autoroute ferroviaire Bettembourg Perpignan (AFBP) has in ensuring its freight trains are full due to the fact that tractor/semi-trailers are turning up with heights above the 4 metres limit set by the rail infrastructure operators.</p>
<p>Directive 96/53/EC, which lays down for certain road vehicles circulating within the Community the maximum authorized dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum authorized weights in international traffic, and Directive 97/27/EC which concerns the vehicles construction standard, stipulate the maximum height of 4 metres, 96/53/EC regarding free circulation within the Community and 97/27/EC regarding the vehicle's construction, albeit with a minor permitted tolerance.</p>
<p>However, these Directives do not prohibit the normal circulation within Member States’ territories of vehicles or vehicle combinations for the national transport of goods which are not in conformity with the maximum height limit.</p>
<p>Consequently, Member States may authorise for use in national transport, vehicles that are higher than 4 metres and they may also either be non specific about the size of the load carried or set limits that are outside the vehicle maxima specified within Directive 96/53/EC. France does not stipulate a maximum height limit.</p>
<p>Therefore the stipulation of a maximum height of 4 metres by the infrastructure managers because of potential tunnel clearance problems exists outside the Community regulatory framework.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the difficulties that arise as a result of the lack of harmonisation of certain vehicle and load dimensions. It has launched a study that looks at the effect of adapting the rules on weights and dimensions of heavy commercial vehicles as established within Directive 96/53/EC and that will include the potential for stipulating loading limits. The results of this study are due in the Summer of 2008 and the Commission intends to draw the appropriate conclusion from that analysis.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Accordingly, the Commission has sought continually to find a solution to this issue and the matter has been raised on several occasions with the Russian authorities, including at the highest political levels. This is an issue which the Commission considers has to be resolved before agreement can be reached on Russia’s World Trade Organization (WTO) accession.</p>
<p>As regards the statements attributed to the Vice-President of the Commission responsible for Enterprise and Industry by certain Russian media, he has already made clear that he was quoted out of context: the quotes purporting to present his own personal position were rather his description of the explanation given by the Russian authorities as to why they have chosen to impose export duties on Russian timber.</p>

<p>According to substantiated information from the public authorities, thousands of tonnes of sunflower oil contaminated with mineral oil have been transported into Greece and have been distributed on the market with inestimable and extremely dangerous consequences for public health. On 26 May 2008, a Gibraltar-flagged tanker, the 'Leoni Teresa', carrying 1500 tonnes of sunflower oil into Greece, was 'blocked' by the port authorities of Elefsina. Directives 2004/4/EC<a href="#defann_45_1" name="refann_45_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and 96/3/EC<a href="#defann_45_2" name="refann_45_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> allow liquid oils and fats to be transported in tankers which have been used for transporting mineral oil and other toxic liquid waste, boosting the food companies' profits to the detriment of public health. The vague references in the directives to cleaning the tanks and to subsidiarity do not guarantee the protection of public health, as evidenced by the transportation into Greece and other Member States of sunflower oil contaminated with mineral oil.</p>

<p>Analytical data for the sunflower oil contaminated by mineral oil originating from Ukraine indicated that the mineral oil is of high viscosity. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded that exposure estimates indicate that the sunflower oil contaminated with high viscosity mineral oil, although undesirable for human consumption, would not be of public health concern. It is therefore not correct to talk about extremely dangerous consequences for public health.</p>
<p>Investigations as regards the source of contamination are still ongoing but there are for the time being no indications that the contamination is linked to transport in tankers which have been used for the transport of products other than foodstuffs.</p>
<p>The availability of sea-going vessels reserved for the transport of foodstuffs is insufficient to ensure the supply of oils and fats intended for or likely to be used for human consumption. The derogation foreseen by Commission Directive 96/3/EC of 26 January 1996 granting a derogation from certain provisions on the hygiene of foodstuffs as regards the transport of bulk liquid oil and fats by sea<a href="#defann_45_3" name="refann_45_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, as amended by Directive 2004/4/EC<a href="#defann_45_4" name="refann_45_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, is to ensure sufficient availability of sea-going vessels for transport of oils and fats. However this derogation is subject to strict conditions ensuring equivalent protection of public health and safety of the foodstuffs concerned.</p>
<p>The list of acceptable previous cargoes has been established following scientific evaluations demonstrating that, on the condition that the hygiene provisions and cleaning requirements are fulfilled, the protection of public health and safety of the foodstuffs concerned is guaranteed equivalent to that assured by transport in sea-going vessels exclusively dedicated to foodstuffs.</p>
<p>Therefore the above mentioned legislation, which provides the derogation for the transport of foodstuffs in sea-going vessels not exclusively dedicated to foodstuffs, does not put public health at risk, as the strict legal conditions for this derogation ensure an equivalent level of food safety as that assured by transport in sea-going vessels dedicated for transport of foodstuffs.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>At the meeting of Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in Strasbourg on 20 May 2008, Commissioner Fischer Boel stated that it would be necessary for modulation (the transfer of funds from direct payments to rural development measures) also to be applied with regard to the new Member States from 2012. Without questioning the thinking behind this arrangement, I would, however, point out that modulation should take place only when the level of support per hectare of farm land is identical in the old and new Member States.</p>
<p>According to Csaba Sándor Tabajdi’s report of 20 March 2007 on the integration of the new Member States into the CAP (<a href="/doceo/document/A-6-2007-0037_EN.html">A6-0037/2007</a>), which was adopted by Parliament with a large majority, the average level of support per hectare in the new Member States is only 62-64% of that of the old Member States.</p>
<p>Why, when there is still a long way to go before equal levels of support are reached, is the Commission proposing that modulation should be applied with regard to both the old and new Member States?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Honourable Member has raised a question concerning the principles of applying modulation, which has been proposed as part of the Health Check of the 2003 reform. The Commission proposal has been designed such that all farmers in the European Union Member States are treated equitably with respect to the levels of payments received.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member will note that the basis of calculation are the levels of direct payments expressed as a percentage of the then applicable level of such payments in the Community as constituted on the 30 April 2004 (EU-15). On the other hand, the report cited in the question refers to the average level of all agricultural support in the current Financial Perspective.</p>
<p>In the Health Check proposal, modulation shall only apply to farmers in new Member States when their level of direct payment is equal or higher than the level in EU-15, which will not take place until 2012. In this case, the applicable modulation rate is the difference between the two levels of payments.</p>
<p>In the calendar year 2012, the level of payments in EU-15 will be reduced by a total of 13% (that is the current 5% plus an 8% increase in basic additional modulation). This means that an EU-15 farmer will receive 87% of the full payment.</p>
<p>In 2012, the level of payment in EU-10 as indicated in the schedule of phasing in of direct payments will reach 90%. Therefore, to ensure equal treatment, a basic rate of 3% modulation will be applied to EU-10 farmers receiving above € 5 000. In other words, farmers in EU-10 will also be receiving 87% of the full payment in this year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0388"></a>

<p>Diyanet is the Turkish Religious Affairs Presidency. One of the main tasks of Diyanet is to inform people about religion.</p>

<p>This book was published in Turkey in 2002 and on the Diyanet's site in 2005.</p>
<p>According to Diyanet, the religious guidance book provides information on the way the teachings of prophet Mohammed have been understood and implemented historically by the Islamic communities.</p>
<p>For instance, information is provided on polygamy. However, as Diyanet claims in its press release of 29 April 2008, this does not mean that Diyanet allows or encourages polygamy.</p>
<p>In addition, as again Diyanet claims in the same press release, they make an effort to also outline the current legal framework applicable on the issues. This includes the Civil Code that regulates marriage and divorce and defines the details of the Family Law.</p>

<p>The Commission follows closely developments on the ground. Progress was made as regards the use of Kurdish in daily life. In 2006 broadcasting in languages other than Turkish was allowed. The national public channel currently broadcasts in several languages nationwide, while four local radio and TV stations broadcast in Kurdish in the Southeast. However, time restrictions apply, with the exception of films and music programmes.</p>
<p>Most recently, the Turkish government has announced that the national state-owned television company will fully dedicate a national channel to broadcasting in Kurdish and other languages. Legislative adaptations are ongoing in this respect.</p>

<p>Belgium's 5.2% inflation figure is the highest of all euro group countries. That prompts questions concerning inflation in Belgium. In April, Belgium's 4.1% figure was markedly higher than the average for the 15-country euro zone (3.3%). Last month, the difference increased still further. At 5.2%, Belgium is well above the euro zone average (3.6%). According to economists, there are various reasons why inflation is somewhat higher in Belgium than in the rest of the euro zone. The increase in energy sector prices is cited. The rise in oil prices is also having a sizeable impact on inflation.</p>
<p>Does the Commission consider that there are a number of reasons for Belgium's very high inflation? Does the Commission recommend that the Belgian Government make inflation a policy priority?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>The rise in inflation in Belgium is largely due to the considerable increase in world commodity prices in recent months. This rise has had a larger impact on inflation in Belgium than in the euro area for a number of reasons. First, the energy component has a higher weight in the consumption basket in Belgium than in the euro area (10.3% versus 9.6%). Second, the lower taxes – in particular excise duties – on fuel and heating oil in Belgium than in the euro area on average causes rising oil prices to have a larger impact on consumer prices which is a purely mechanical effect. On top of this, energy prices rose more in Belgium as the main providers decided on an important increase of the transport (electricity) and distribution (electricity and gas) fees, after a court order annulled the tariffs imposed by the regulator. Although the higher inflation rate in Belgium also relates to the sharper increase in processed food prices than in the euro area (8.3% versus 6.9%), this difference exists since mid-2006 and should thus not be seen as one of the main factors contributing to the widening inflation differential since the beginning of the year. Price increases for non-energy industrial goods, unprocessed food and services were in line or even below these observed in the euro area until April (no data for the euro area available yet for May).</p>
<p>As the differential can be largely explained by the particular developments in the energy component, core inflation – i.e. inflation excluding the energy and unprocessed food component – remained below the euro area average in April (2.2% versus 2.4%).</p>
<p>However, in the future, it should be avoided that the automatic (but incomplete) indexation of wages in Belgium further drives up inflation, leading to price-wage spiral with a negative impact on the competitive position.</p>
<p>Since inflation erodes the purchasing power of households, especially at the lower-end of the income spectrum, it is indeed important for governments to make containing inflation a priority and, together with the other euro area governments, support the European Central Bank in maintaining price stability.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0408"></a>

<p>The issue of terrorism associated with the Khalistan movement, seeking independence for a Sikh nation (Khalistan), needs first to be seen in the larger context of Punjab’s recent political history. The Indian state of Punjab, marred by violence for over 15 years due to Sikh separatists in the 1980s, returned to normalcy after the movement was successfully handled in the mid-1990s. After years of direct rule from New Delhi, the democratic process was successfully revived with a democratically elected government in 1997. The latest State election in 2007 resulted in putting back the Akali Dal party (representing exclusively the interests of the Sikhs) at the helm.</p>
<p>There have been articles in the Indian press indicating that a surviving network of terrorism continues to exist, in particular outside India, which can partly explain how Sikh militants managed to trigger a bomb blast inside a cinema hall in Ludhiana (seven dead, including a 10-year old child, and 40 injured) on October 14, 2007. The Commission’s analysis, however, is that the ideology that inspired a decade and a half of terrorism in Punjab has been rejected by the population.</p>
<p>In reply to the Honourable Member’s first question, the Commission believes that it is mainly for India, whose authorities have declared having evidence of Khalistan movement leaders’ presence in Pakistan, to request their extradition.</p>

<p>New versions of the Agriculture and non-agricultural market access (NAMA) (Industrial Goods) negotiating texts were issued by the World Trade Organization (WTO) Chairs of those respective negotiating groups in mid May and discussions are underway on this basis. If negotiations progress sufficiently, there are prospects that a Ministerial meeting may be convened by the Director General of the WTO shortly.</p>
<p>In the area of agriculture, the Commission has sought on behalf of the EU to engage with third countries, in a manner which responds to their ambitions but which remains within the framework of the 2003 reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. It is the view of the Commission that these dual objectives can be met on the basis of current proposals, even if further issues remain to be clarified and agreed. This approach was however undertaken solely on the basis that this negotiation is a single undertaking and that concessions in one area should be balanced by gains in other areas.</p>
<p>The Chair's new NAMA text still provides for a wide range of possible negotiating outcomes. It is therefore difficult to assess at this stage whether the final result is likely to be acceptable to the EU. The EU is pushing for an agreement to fulfil the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) mandate, i.e. to create real new trade opportunities in industrial goods in developed and emerging economies. The principal means for achieving this is via a so-called "Swiss formula" for tariff reductions, as well as by introducing stronger disciplines to address non-tariff barriers. For this to be effective, it will be important to ensure that flexibilities granted to emerging economies are carefully circumscribed, and that the parameters for liberalisation for industrialised and emerging economies are such that real and new market access is created not just in North/North and North/South trade, but also in South/South trade. Whilst the EU fully accepts the principle that the poorest developing countries (Least Developed Countries and Small and Vulnerable Economies including all Sub-Saharan African countries except South Africa) should not cut their applied customs tariffs, it cannot accept that major emerging economies do not take their responsibility towards the rest of the world. This position has been made clear to other WTO Members. There may also be scope for progressing on sectoral tariff reduction agreements. In this context, the EU has tabled a proposal to negotiate a sectoral agreement on textiles, and continues to push hard to target tariff peaks in developed and emerging countries in this area, as well as in other sectors of important export interests to the EU.</p>
<p>In the area of fisheries subsidies, discussions have also been underway for some time in the framework of the so called "Rules" negotiation. There is as yet no agreed position on this issue. The EU is promoting disciplines which ban all harmful capacity enhancing subsidies while allowing those that positively contribute to the sustainable exploitation of available fishery resources and mitigate the negative impacts of adjustment measures on fishing communities. The EU also advocates strong and effective enforcement and transparency mechanisms which would ensure that the disciplines on fisheries subsidies are respected by all.</p>
<p>Negotiations are also moving ahead in services, geographical indications, non-tariff barriers, trade facilitation, and trade and environment, with differing levels of progress. The EU remains committed to securing useful results across all these areas.</p>
<p>In services, it will be essential that any WTO Ministerial set out common conclusions on the need for an ambitious outcome in this area. A plurilateral signalling conference, aimed at gauging with key partners areas of common interest, will be held in the margins of any WTO Ministerial. The results of this Conference will therefore feed into the EU's overall assessment of the balance likely to be achieved across the negotiations as a whole.</p>
<p>Finally, it is vital for the Commission that common conclusions agreed in any Ministerial Conference should also make significant progress on the issue of Geographical Indications.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0411"></a>

<p>Given the fact that world food prices are rising, that this has repercussions for EU citizens and developing countries and that we need to continue to produce more food, shouldn't the Commission be looking at a more scientific risk-based approach instead of a hazard-based approach regarding pesticide (plant production products) authorisation which would ensure continuous output of potato and cereal production?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>One of the main aims of the proposal for a Regulation concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market<a href="#defann_57_1" name="refann_57_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> is to maintain a high level of protection for humans, animals and the environment.</p>
<p>The proposed criteria for approval of active substances are essential to achieve these objectives: substances which are persistent in the environment, accumulating in living organisms or very toxic should not be approved for the use in plant protection products.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is not acceptable that farmers or consumers are exposed to substances which are proven to be carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction.</p>
<p>It must be avoided that either humans or animals are exposed to substances which can affect fertility or reproductive behaviour.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the severe overall competition with which European farmers are faced and it is its duty to ensure that they are not disadvantaged by the measures. This is why, for example, the Commission has proposed an authorisation system (the zonal system) which will increase the availability of pesticides to farmers between Member States and give incentives to industry to develop products for small cultures. It will reduce the administrative burden for producers of plant protection products and the competent authorities.</p>
<p>The Commission is convinced that its proposal, which might lead to the withdrawal of a limited number of active substances, will not have severe effects for European agriculture. On the contrary, the Commission believes that it is an incentive for the development of new safer products.</p>
<p>This responds to the wish of many stakeholders, in particular farmers' unions and the industry. It also streamlines the authorisation procedure to give quicker access to the market to new pesticides, thus improving opportunities for innovation with new solutions ensuring sustainable plant protection and food safety at the same time.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As an eligible proposal, EURRECA (Harmonising nutrient recommendations across Europe with special focus on vulnerable groups and consumer understanding) was evaluated by the Commission, assisted by independent experts, against the criteria<a href="#defann_59_2" name="refann_59_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> for the relevant call for proposals.</p>
<p>EURRECA is a Network of Excellence with the overall objective to create a sustainable collaborative network which advances knowledge on scientific evidence underpinning existing nutrient recommendations. Consequently, it is not in the remit of this Community funded project to formulate dietary guidelines to be applied across the European Union (EU).</p>
<p>The EURRECA consortium is composed of 34 partners, including 19 universities and public research institutes, small and medium size enterprises, national and international public health organisations, including the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe, as well as consumer associations.</p>
<p>The project is reviewed yearly, against the objectives and expected results defined in the technical annex to the Commission contract<a href="#defann_59_3" name="refann_59_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, by independent experts.</p>
<p>The Directorate-General for Health and Consumers (DG SANCO) as well as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) are members of the External Advisory Groups.</p>
<p>DG SANCO requested EFSA to provide scientific advice on population reference intakes (on macro and micro nutrients) as well as guidance for developing food-based dietary guidelines for the EU population. This scientific advice on nutrient intakes is the basis for Community action in the field of nutrition. This work is currently ongoing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, DG SANCO always engages its stakeholders via the Advisory Group on the Food chain, and Animal and Plant Health, created in 2004<a href="#defann_59_4" name="refann_59_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> to consult citizens in an open and transparent way at the European level during the preparation, revision and evaluation of EU food legislation, as required by Regulation 178/2002/EC<a href="#defann_59_5" name="refann_59_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>.
