<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Moscovici,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, you expressed the wish that we should devote our efforts today to the forthcoming European Council meeting in Biarritz, and this will indeed be an important milestone in this half-year Presidency of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">You will all be aware that the European Council is now in the habit of meeting, or rather of almost always meeting, twice every six months, and this arrangement would seem to meet a real need, even if – or perhaps I should say especially if – this additional meeting is an informal one, as will be the case in Biarritz.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the informal nature of these summits, far from limiting their scope, actually enables delicate issues to be openly discussed at the very highest level. The agenda at Biarritz will, as such, comprise two major questions which I know are of concern to the European Parliament: the Intergovernmental Conference on Institutional Reform and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the date, this too has been chosen with a view to guaranteeing that this Summit is as productive as possible. The Biarritz Council of 13 and 14 October will come roughly halfway through our presidency; so work will already be well underway, without any compromises having been reached, and the time will have come to take stock and put down a marker with a view to the Nice European Council. As you can see, the aim will therefore not be to discuss every issue, which would not have made a great deal of sense.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the French Presidency seems to have attained cruising speed, and would appear to have made completely satisfactory progress on the matters in hand; I am aware that certain observers have been critical, but they doubtless expected too much from us – and this is flattering, but at the same time does not suit us, since a presidency is always too short – only totalling four productive months, I would remind you – and have forgotten that this presidency, just like any other, is subject to many serious constraints.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain events which have received ample coverage in the press have thus overshadowed the work done in recent weeks. I refer in particular to the surge in oil prices – and would point out that the members of the European Council will also be discussing this issue – and to the fluctuations in the value of the euro and the referendum in Denmark.</p>
<p class="contents">I can nevertheless assure you that we will continue in our efforts on the basis of the timetable set and I feel that the required results have been achieved. I take, by way of example, the latest General Affairs Council, with an initial agreement on MEDA II, the continuing debate on increasing the effectiveness of the Union’s external aid, the message to the Serbian people, which can be seen to have carried weight in the current situation, and the first progress report ever on the enlargement process, which we will be discussing again this afternoon, in this Chamber. Progress has also been made at the latest Justice and Home Affairs Council, which saw the adoption of the Regulation on the European Refugee Fund, the extension of Europol’s powers in the field of money laundering and, lastly, a policy agreement with a view to setting up Eurojust, following a decision taken at the Tampere Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Likewise, the informal Council of Defence Ministers held on 22 September gave reason to hope that completely satisfactory results will be obtained by the end of the presidency as concerns the commitment of capabilities. Not to mention the priorities which we have described as citizens’ priorities, since they lie at the heart of the concerns of all the citizens of Europe: growth and employment, their children’s education – this question was discussed at the Education Council held this weekend – the future of social protection and transport safety amid new circumstances marked by the surge in oil prices. Here too, the wheels have been set in motion, and the Presidency, in concert with the Commission and Parliament, is getting down to work.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn to the actual agenda of the Biarritz European Council, which is to say straight to the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">As I pointed out during the debate held on 11 July at the invitation of Mr Napolitano, our concern, right from the outset, has been to restart discussions on a more open basis in order to give ourselves every chance of reaching a satisfactory agreement in Nice. We have therefore been keen, on the one hand, to emphasise the link between the three issues that were left unresolved in Amsterdam, which in our mind form a whole, a package, and, on the other hand, to take a long look at the major issue of closer cooperation, within the context of an enlarged Europe. These are very thorny questions, and this is why we initially felt, I have to admit, that we were not able to move forward as quickly as we would have liked.</p>
<p class="contents">You must surely have noticed this too, inside this Chamber, and your President has not failed to point it out whenever she has had the opportunity to do so at the opening of the monthly ministerial sessions of the IGC. Your participation is always very important. You have not failed to point out how vital it was to mobilise efforts in order for these negotiations to progress and a successful conclusion to be reached within the deadlines set.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency, just like the Commission, also firmly emphasised, back at the Evian ‘Gymnich’, the informal meeting of the Foreign Affairs Ministers, in early September, that there was a real risk of failure at Nice, and that France, as the country holding the presidency, would prefer to take responsibility for a failure such as this than for a flawed agreement. I must stress that no one should interpret this as tactical manoeuvring on our part. We would prefer there to be no treaty at Nice rather than a flawed Treaty of Nice. This message seems to have got through, but I seemed to detect, at the General Affairs Council of 18 September and at the mini-meeting I chaired that evening in Brussels, real signs of realisation setting in.</p>
<p class="contents">What stage has actually been reached in these negotiations?</p>
<p class="contents">As concerns the Commission, we strongly feel that the difficulty arises from the fact that the majority of the Member States are reluctant both to put a ceiling limit on the number of Commissioners and to undertake genuine long-term restructuring of the Commission, despite the fact that we all agree on the need for a strong and effective Commission. This would seem to be a paradox that we must escape. It is fundamental to the future of the Union, since the Commission truly is, and I cannot stress this too strongly, the lynchpin of the Community system.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone has been able to put forward their arguments with precision, but at some point we will have to find a way around certain contradictions. In any case, it would seem impossible for a Union with twenty, twenty-five or thirty Member States to carry on with the current system without it being reformed.</p>
<p class="contents">As concerns the question of the reweighting of votes, a potential solution would seem to be emerging, and many Member States can see the advantage of this formula, of the stringent reweighting of votes, over that of the double majority, regardless of the form that it takes. However, the issue of reweighting is closely linked with the previous issue I talked about, and it is clear that it can only be resolved once negotiations are complete. You may rest assured that we will not wait until Biarritz, and still less until Nice, to address that issue. The essential preparatory work is under way. I nevertheless believe – and this is my personal feeling – that substantial progress will take a little longer. But it is important for the Heads of State and Government meeting at the Biarritz European Council to talk about it.</p>
<p class="contents">As concerns qualified majority voting, on the other hand, the considerable work carried out is beginning to bear fruit. The Commission has put forward highly constructive proposals that will enable us to move forward in a manner which addresses the problems raised by each delegation, and I am very grateful to it. The list of items to which qualified majority voting could be applied is growing significantly. I believe that the results will live up to expectations as this is an issue of capital importance, as we all know, and even, perhaps, the main issue for this IGC, just as the question of the concomitant extension of our codecision procedures is for Parliament. In this case too, I feel that discussions are progressing well within the IGC and that the principle of concordance between codecision and the legislative act is beginning to gain ground, if not widespread acceptance.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as concerns closer cooperation, you will be aware that the problem was, and still is to some extent, that many Member States saw in this, <span class="italic">a priori</span>, a risk of creating a two-speed Europe, or even of it being used as a substitute for real progress involving all 15 Member States in the field of qualified majority voting. I must stress that closer cooperation is neither a means of moving towards a stable and definitive hard core, nor a substitute for progress on qualified majority voting.</p>
<p class="contents">We have held several in-depth exchanges of views on this issue at ministerial level, and I believe that these have enabled us to clarify the concept of closer cooperation and to dispel the misgivings of those most sceptical. The parallel debate on the future of an enlarged Europe has in its own way made a both positive, and perhaps occasionally negative, contribution to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, since a majority of Member States would not seem to be contemplating a radical switch towards any other type of, let us say, much more federal institutional model, one cannot but acknowledge that closer cooperation is a fine tool which provides a response to the realistic observation that, in an enlarged Europe, not all the Member States will always be able, or want, to move forward at the same rate. A degree of flexibility, of latitude, is thus essential so that those who want to press ahead more quickly can do so, while still allowing others the chance to catch up with those who have moved ahead, since it is clear that closer cooperation makes no sense unless it always remains an option.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, of course, still work to be done, particularly as concerns defining the conditions in which principles could be simplified and the conditions for triggering this mechanism made more flexible, while still preserving a number of guarantees. It will also be necessary to examine the specific measures that must be taken in the field of the CFSP.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Presidency will examine, in agreement with the Member States, the possibility of supplementing Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, notably on the basis of the proposals already put forward by the Member States and by the Commission. Indeed, it is clear that in order to provide a more effective guarantee for the values of the Union and fundamental rights, a prevention, vigilance and warning system will be required.</p>
<p class="contents">And, on that subject, let me turn to the second fundamental issue on the Biarritz agenda, namely the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will be aware, the draft Charter was formally adopted by the Convention yesterday, on 2 October, with the invaluable and highly effective support of Parliament’s representatives. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs, represented by its chairman, Giorgio Napolitano, has nevertheless voiced concern over the future of this draft Charter and the possibility of incorporating it into the Treaties at the Nice European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore deduce from this question that Parliament, or at least its Committee on Constitutional Affairs, endorses the text produced by the Convention, with certain reservations of course, at which I can only express pleasure. We will doubtless have the chance to discuss that text again in greater depth in the debate on its proclamation by the three institutions scheduled to be take place in this Chamber in November.</p>
<p class="contents">But, before giving a precise answer to the question from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I would like to explain why it is that the work done by the Convention would seem to constitute a twofold success.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it is a success that we should consider in terms of the procedure selected, involving a body, the Convention, made up of Members of the European Parliament, national parliaments, the European Commission, and the personal representatives of the Heads of State and Government. This has seen us breaking with the traditional method of diplomatic conferences or intergovernmental conferences, which is now proving somewhat complex, it has to be said.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would add that the quality and diversity of the members appointed has, due to their training, their background and their political beliefs, indisputably provided a rich resource.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, it is quite remarkable that the Convention has worked both in a manner that is completely transparent, and completely interactively with the citizens via the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">With the intention of opening out the debate, it therefore consulted, in the course of its work, the major non-governmental organisations, the social partners and candidate countries. This transparency, this openness, played an active part in the gradual improvement of the various versions of the draft Charter, some 48 or 49 of them, as you will be aware. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am convinced, for my part, that the Convention experiment clearly shows us, if not the way, then at least one of the paths that Europe can now follow with a view to being more transparent and more receptive to the opinions of its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The second major success, without which the first success would, it must be said, have had little meaning, is of course the result achieved by the Convention. From this point of view, the Charter is firstly, and this is a sufficiently rare thing in our texts for it to warrant a mention, a clear and well-structured document. It contains around fifty articles – which is not a vast amount – spread over six chapters with forceful headings – dignity, liberty, equality, solidarity, citizenship and justice – and undeniably meets our requirements for conciseness and clarity and thus, at the same time, I feel, lives up to the expectations of our fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter is also cogent. The people responsible for drafting it have managed to respond to the twin requirement of not creating a text automatically and <span class="italic">ex nihilo</span>, but of taking a precise and yet fluid snapshot of the gamut of fundamental rights that are in force or evolving within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is primarily as a result of the potency of its content that I believe the Charter will become a milestone. First and foremost, it unambiguously reaffirms the fundamental civil rights set out in the European Convention on Human Rights and, on this account, those who drafted the Charter took great care to avoid any possibility of a regrettable divergence in judicial practice between the European Court of Human Rights, which is responsible for ensuring compliance with the Convention, and the Court of Justice of the European Communities, particularly by incorporating the wording of the Council of Europe’s Convention every time that this appeared to be the most well-rounded and pertinent option.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, of course, the Charter does not stop at reaffirming existing rights. It enshrines many new rights that correspond to the necessary development in our societies, be they the development of technologies, the appearance of new dependencies, or the complexity of our administrative systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I am sure you will understand my delight at the importance that this text accorded to economic and social rights. Putting on my second, my national, hat, I would say that France has argued strongly for this section to be a substantial one, but I have seen that many other Member States desired the same thing, which this Presidency can only welcome. The same applies to the innovative and driving force of the Charter and the consolidation of the European Social Model, which everyone here, I am sure, values highly. The Charter guarantees the right to a free education, the right of workers to be informed and consulted, and the right to collective bargaining and action, including the right to strike, the right of protection against any form of unjustified dismissal, the right to social protection, and the ban on child employment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my overall conviction that the Charter constitutes the greatest collective advance in affirming social rights since European integration began and, as a result, is worthy of praise.</p>
<p class="contents">You will therefore ask me, and I fully expect to be questioned on this, why such success should not be crowned by incorporating the Charter into the Treaties. First of all, and in direct response to the question raised by Mr Napolitano, I must remind you of the actual text of the conclusions of the Cologne European Council, which launched the process, “The European Council will propose to the European Parliament and the Commission that, together with the Council, they should solemnly proclaim a European Charter of Fundamental Rights.” The Council itself must also come to a political agreement on the draft Charter, as I hope and believe it will do, informally, at the Biarritz European Council, and then allow the other institutions, the Commission, Parliament and, why not, certain national parliaments, time to reach a conclusion on the substance, which is to say on the contents of this document. It is therefore clear, as concerns timescales, that it will not be possible to make the proclamation, which will be the first step towards something bigger, until the Nice European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the conclusions of the Cologne Council consistently specified that the issue of incorporation into the Treaties could only be examined after the Charter had been proclaimed, which is to say at Nice. Moreover, the Council is yet to address this matter. I must nevertheless confirm – at least this is my feeling – that a large majority, if not a very large majority, of Member States would still seem to oppose its prompt incorporation, which is, of course, a factor that this Presidency has to take into account.</p>
<p class="contents">I am thus tempted to answer your question with one of my own: should one take the risk of this text – which as I have said is set to become a milestone – being rejected at Biarritz, or should one trust in the potency of this Charter, which I am sure will establish itself as a reference for values in the European Union and a source of inspiration to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg?</p>
<p class="contents">One must give these things time. Discussions on the future of the Charter are, to my mind, closely akin to discussions on the future of Europe. In the same way, there are those who have outlined the need to equip the European Union with a European Constitution. Personally speaking, that would seem like a good, if not an excellent idea, provided that prior agreement is reached on its content, which is to say on a possible clarification of competencies, on the role of each institution within the Union, and on the balance between them. One could then imagine, and I at any rate would support this entirely, the Charter taking its place in a type of ‘Constitutional Treaty’, in the form of a preamble. However, there is still a lot of work to be done before embarking on this new phase. It would seem to be premature to want to outline a timetable for this at the present juncture, and this could also have adverse effects on the negotiations of the IGC. We must wait until Nice, when we have the results of the IGC, before spelling out what we can reasonably look forward to seeing at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents">Any discussions on the ‘post-Nice’ scenario will therefore cover a range of themes, some of which are presented in a simplified manner. First of all there is the question of improving institutional administration in a Union which has 30 Member States. We are already addressing this issue in the context of the current Intergovernmental Conference, but we are also clearly aware that we will have to go further, a good deal further, in adapting the Community method if we are to preserve its essential features. I touched on this in connection with closer cooperation. This would appear to constitute the prime tool for promoting the pragmatic development of a Community Europe which will in the future – and I stress this – extend much further and be far more diverse. I need say no more.</p>
<p class="contents">Next there is the question of translating the Treaties into a constitution, to respond to the twin requirement of clarifying the texts, which we must render more cogent and more accessible to our fellow citizens, and of interlinking competencies more smoothly. These are not new issues and, above all, we are well aware of how difficult they are.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is a third focus for discussion which we should not lose sight of, and which concerns improving the administration of the European Union. By this I am alluding to reform of the operation of the institutions, independently even of the reform of the Treaties, in response to a need, which public opinion senses quite strongly, for Europe to have a clearer direction, for measures to be handled more expertly, in brief for there to be a firmer hand on the rudder. This presupposes our being able to raise the profile of each of the institutions, in political terms, and consequently enhance the balance between them.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect the proposals that Mr Prodi is preparing for next year will be of great practical value, and I feel, for that matter, that it is time for me to give him the floor. I am sure he, as the president of that pivotal institution, will share the Commission’s initial thoughts on the matter with us. However, I repeat, and I will end on this note for now, and allow the President-in-Office to speak, let us concentrate on the tasks allocated to us, let us strive to see them through together and if, at Biarritz, headway is being made both on the Intergovernmental Conference and on the Charter, then we will be able to prepare a successful Nice European Council and, of course, a better situation ‘post-Nice’.</p>

However, while we are attempting to resolve our own problems we must spare a thought for our friends and neighbours who are facing decisive challenges. In Serbia, thanks to the determination of the Serbian people, democracy is on the point of asserting itself. Therefore, let us support Serbia in its endeavour to, at last, turn the page and to take its place in the international community once again. The Middle East, on the other hand, seems to be moving ever further away from peace due to irresponsible actions which reopen old wounds and which we condemn.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will work alongside Parliament and the Council to ensure that the European Union produces political action which will enable us to remain protagonists in humanitarian and financial matters.</p>
<p class="contents">We have embarked on an enlargement process with the inspiring goal of restoring unity to Europe. The Commission intends to pursue this goal right through to its conclusion in full adherence to its mandate, conducting the negotiations objectively and rigorously, country by country.</p>
<p class="contents">Rigour and objectivity are essential if we are to secure the public support which is vital both in the candidate countries and in those countries which are already Members of the Union. The time has therefore come for some extra impetus over and above the efforts of the negotiators: we need to explain and persuade. There is an urgent need in the Member States of the Union for a debate which will allow the citizens to grasp the full significance of the remarkable episode of history which is unfolding with the rebuilding of a united Europe and, at the same time, to become fully aware of the potential benefits to be gained from creating a market of 500 million consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">For their part, the new democracies are currently making huge, unprecedented efforts across the board to adapt their political and economic systems to Community requirements. However, there are equally clear signs in the candidate countries of growing concern over the lack of a clear, binding timetable for accession. We must respond to their efforts and their concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Before enlargement can go ahead, we must make the necessary reforms to the Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Without the requisite institutional changes, the prospect of almost doubling the number of Member States would pose insurmountable problems in terms of decision-making capacity. Failure to introduce these changes would throw the Union into an interminable crisis. This is the task facing the Biarritz and Nice Summits.</p>
<p class="contents">If a Treaty of Nice implementing all the above projects were to be adopted in December, allowing due time for national ratification procedures, the Union could be ready for enlargement at the beginning of 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no secret about what is at stake – you have heard Mr Moscovici – and the Commission's position is clear.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to simplify the mechanism for closer cooperation, leaving the door constantly open to those Member States that wish to participate. The consistency of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> and the uniformity of the judicial framework must be preserved. Closer cooperation must be an inclusive, not exclusive instrument, but no-one must be allowed to prevent a group of States from achieving that close union which is expressly provided for in the Treaties and which must be properly regulated within the framework of the Union's institutions. We need to cushion the institutions against the impact of enlarging the Union, to ensure that we have a Commission which is able to continue to operate as a genuine College, and a Council which is able to adopt decisions by a vote which represents the will both of the majority of the States and the majority of their combined populations.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We need to reform the legal structure of the Union and, lastly – and this, in my opinion, is crucial if Nice is to be a success – to limit the scope for using the veto and restrict the decisions requiring unanimity to the absolute minimum.</p>
<p class="contents">These reforms are the minimum changes necessary – and I repeat, the very minimum necessary – before enlargement takes place, to ensure that enlargement does not irreversibly impair the Union's ability to act.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally important for the future of Europe – at Biarritz and later at Nice – will be the debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights. According to Mr Moscovici, this represents a great political step forward. The Charter will, in fact, become the reference point both for those countries which are already Members of the Union and those which are preparing for accession. The quality of the proposed draft and the balance it achieves are truly exemplary and I would therefore like to congratulate the Members of the Convention and President Herzog on their work.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the lesson for us all today, the tenth anniversary of German unification, is that Europe is capable of rising to the great challenges that history throws in its path.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking immediately ahead, beyond Biarritz and Nice, we have a duty to consider our future. My aim today is not to present a complete blueprint for tomorrow's Europe. I simply want to set down some markers for the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The future of a newly reunited Europe is not carved in stone. The outcome of the current political debate will depend upon our determination: either we maintain the status quo, which would, in effect, mean a step backwards for Europe, or we allow a partial but deceptive increase in intergovernmental cooperation, or, alternatively, we continue to build on the institutional architecture of the Union in a way that is consistent with the principles of democracy, the balance of powers and subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I am heartened by the fact that there now seems to be more of a consensus on the need to address these issues than there was when I first raised them in this very Chamber this time last year.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to make constructive plans for the future, we will have to take as our starting point our current situation, our past history and the recent debate inspired by many authoritative contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">All the lasting achievements of the Union, from the single market to the euro including four successive enlargements, have been the product of our completely unique system, based on the fine balance between the Union's institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Revolving around the institutional triangle of Council, Parliament and Commission, this system has proved remarkably successful.</p>
<p class="contents">Its originality lies without doubt in the Commission and its right of initiative. The Commission is the melting pot into which the various national interests and tensions are poured, and from which emerge proposals that seek to reconcile these often conflicting interests. In this way, it provides not only an analysis and synthesis of the issues under consideration but also a starting point for negotiations in which, once national differences have been expressed, the common European interest can be identified.</p>
<p class="contents">This executive body, which combines independence with a sensitivity to the balance of powers and interests of all the Member States, both large and small, is crucial for the pooling of sovereignty in the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the role of the Commission is necessary for the integration of Europe but is not sufficient on its own. The value of Europe derives from an institutional system in which Parliament, Council and the Court of Justice play a role which is equally decisive. It is from this system, the combination of all these institutions, that the synthesis emerges.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, those who would regard any confrontation between the Council and the Commission as positive, as if this might somehow be to Parliament's advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">Nothing could be further from the truth: a strong Council strengthens the action of the Commission, and this is equally true with regard to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The European system is a system of balances in which the smooth running of each institution serves the common interest. Any weakening of one of these institutions weakens the whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, I do detect a worrying tendency to think that further European integration can be achieved through the use of methods which are based primarily on direct cooperation between governments.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This is extremely disturbing because adopting the intergovernmental model can only have two possible outcomes, both of them undesirable: either it will turn the Community into a mere international debating forum which is incapable of producing genuine pooling of sovereignty around the common interest, or – what it worse – it will deceive the citizens by constantly creating new bodies which are exempt from any democratic scrutiny. Then we will have a real government of bureaucrats!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Giving new powers to a committee of ministers served by an unaccountable secretariat would not represent any sort of progress either for democracy or for effective decision-making.</p>
<p class="contents">To claim, as some do, that the individual legitimacy of the participating governments somehow constitutes, on its own, sufficient guarantee of democratic accountability for the intergovernmental model, is misguided.</p>
<p class="contents">The European process can only derive its democratic validity from a dual legitimation: the direct legitimation of the European people, as represented by you, the Members of the European Parliament, and the legitimation of the Member States which, in turn, is based on national democratic elections.</p>
<p class="contents">It is you, the European Parliament, as the direct expression of Europe-wide universal suffrage, who are the institution specifically dedicated to representing the union of the peoples of Europe. And it is from your endorsement that the Commission derives its democratic legitimacy. This then complements the other source of legitimacy, namely the Member States represented in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Enhancing the intergovernmental model at the expense not only of the Commission, but also, ultimately, of the Council, would therefore undermine the democratic nature of the whole European structure and represent a considerable step backwards.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We will run serious risks if we call into question the principle of a Community based on the rule of law, respect for which is guaranteed by the Court of Justice, to which any European citizen has the right to appeal.</p>
<p class="contents">We must put an end, once and for all, to the current paradoxical situation in which even the deliberations of the fifteen Justice Ministers on such sensitive areas as criminal law and police cooperation escape the scrutiny of Parliament and the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In the recent controversy surrounding the events in Austria, the compulsion to resist any racist or authoritarian tendencies – a reaction with which I fully sympathise – ended up creating an artificial distinction between the bilateral action of the Member States and the action of the Union as a whole. Democracy was therefore made to look as if it were reserved for the individual States alone. However, I firmly believe that democracy cannot be a matter for subsidiarity: it must thrive at all levels.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I cannot help thinking that, when a serious problem arises at Union level, it should first be debated before this House, which is the centre and expression of our democracy. It is, moreover, indisputably right that, when it comes to tangible government, there should be a debate on what should and should not be done at European and national levels. Clearly, it is then up to each individual States to decide what needs to be done at regional and at local levels. I therefore agree that the time has come to open the debate on the distribution of powers between the Union and the Member States. The Commission will launch this debate with a White Paper on forms of government, which we are already preparing. We will be trying to define a form of interaction between the existing levels of decision-making that is transparent and democratic and, at the same time, capable of ensuring cohesive and effective action.</p>
<p class="contents">Any trend towards an intergovernmental approach, by contrast, would create conflicting power structures within the European structure, resulting in fragmentation where what is needed is unity.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no need for me to remind this House of our tragic inability to act in the Balkan war, precisely because of the fragmentation of our decision-making processes. It is not because of our actions that we have lost credibility but because of our inability to act.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to give two further examples of this fragmentation: firstly, the creation of the High Representatives. In the area of foreign and security policy, the Treaty of Amsterdam only provided a temporary response to a lasting need.</p>
<p class="contents">While I can assure Javier Solana of the wholehearted support of the Commission – and I admire the extraordinary personal commitment which has enabled him to achieve major, unhoped-for results – I have to stress that the present organisational model is not sustainable in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This model confuses the roles of the Council and the Commission in a way that could jeopardise both struts of the institutional system and exclude Parliament from any effective power.</p>
<p class="contents">The current situation should be seen as a transitional phase, useful for launching European action in a new area but destined to be reabsorbed into the conventional institutional structure, as happened in similar cases such as Schengen. That is why I firmly believe that the function of High Representative should be integrated into the Commission, with a special status tailored to security and defence needs.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We should draw the same conclusions when considering the solutions to be adopted for other sectors, such as economic policy and the euro. The current management of economic policy projects an image of Europe as indecisive and muddled. The Central Bank is independent, but, unlike every other protagonist on the world economic stage, it is not flanked by a stable economic policy body representing an overall view of the economic strategies of the Union and its Members and capable of taking decisions with the necessary speed.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The search for such an essential point of reference for any monetary policy must not lead to the creation of another High Representative, this time for economic policy. The simple, natural, effective solution is there, under our noses: the Commission, acting on a mandate from the Council, should be the voice of the Union's economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, you only have to read the Treaty to realise that, while the Central Bank is the lynchpin of monetary policy, the body responsible for the overall assessment of the European Union's economic policy can only be the Commission. Thus, the Commission has to be the interlocutor for the Central Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">My second example of the risk of fragmentation is the desire expressed by some Member States in the Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaty to facilitate the creation of agencies upon which the Commission can then confer executive powers. Let us be clear on this point: there is a real danger that this will result in conflicting centres of power.</p>
<p class="contents">Agencies may indeed be needed to give the Union bodies and authorities of the kind that exist in all systems today, and to allow the Commission to perform its role as an executive body more effectively, without excessive bureaucratic burdens. But this must be done by maintaining the logic of the Community system. Those agencies must therefore operate under the authority of the Commission, which is answerable to you for its actions.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot, on the one hand, deplore the lack of effective and united European action and, on the other, be content with the weakness of the instruments available to the Community for carrying out such action. The recent petrol crisis is, from this point of view, a perfect illustration: the need for a unified response was clear – as was our inability to deliver one.</p>
<p class="contents">In the history of European integration, the President of the Commission has often stood before this House and said that we find ourselves at a crossroads. If I say it once again, it is because I genuinely believe that it has never been more true.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate about the future of Europe in the perspective of enlargement is a healthy and vital one. This was true of the recent referendum in Denmark, although I regret the outcome. However, it goes to show, once again, that not everyone in the Union feels equally strongly that they are a part of the European project.</p>
<p class="contents">We have achieved a great deal over the past 50 years, but we must not be so complacent as to believe that these achievements are irreversible. If we are not careful to preserve the key elements of the constitutional architecture designed and executed by the founding fathers, we will reverse some of the achievements that we take for granted today such as democratic accountability, legitimacy and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">We have built a unique system in which the guarantees of the democratic state governed by the rule of law on which our societies are founded also form the basis for the Community. They must continue to guide any further advances in common action at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people in the world look, full of hope, to our European model and its successes for inspiration. Many look to our original 'union of minorities', as I like to call our Union, as the only instrument capable of reconciling the demands of globalisation with the reassertion of the rights of the citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not so naïve as to believe that the Community system is perfect. This is precisely why we have set in motion, and will carry through, an in-depth reform of the Commission. A reform not only of the way it operates but also of its administrative procedures. It is now legitimate to expect a similar effort from all the other institutions. However, I still passionately believe that the Community system, with its checks and balances, offers the best possible guarantee for the future of the fundamental values we cherish.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, if we attempt to develop the Union while weakening the political role of the Commission, if our capacity for executive action is eroded, if the extension of the intergovernmental model corrupts the judicial and institutional mechanisms of the Community, if the democratic legitimacy of the system, guaranteed by this House, is undermined, if all this is allowed to happen, then the achievements of the single market, the common policies, the solidarity mechanisms, and the weight Europe carries by speaking with a single voice in international negotiations, will certainly be at risk, and, similarly, any attempt to equip Europe to act more effectively by continuing to develop a Union based on shared values, democratic principles and the rule of law will be in vain.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Community system has been an unprecedented success, and we have only just begun to explore its potential. Our peoples pin their hopes on the European Union and look to it to ensure that the future is one of peace. The achievements of the past equip us well to meet the challenges of the future. What we need now is wisdom and foresight to preserve what we have inherited so that we can bequeath something even better and greater to future generations.</p>

Mr Prodi dealt thoroughly with issues which are very important to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, of which I have the honour of being the Chairman. I would also like to thank Mr Moscovici for his careful, thorough response to the oral question which I tabled on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. Therefore, since Mr Moscovici has already provided an excellent description of the question, I will not go back over the same ground now but focus on his response and on the questions which he, in his turn, has posed to Parliament's Committee on Constitutional Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot conceal my satisfaction, which, I feel, is shared by the great majority of Parliament, at the results achieved by the Convention entrusted with drawing up the Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights, and I would like to express my wholehearted appreciation of the work put in by all the members of the Convention, especially the European Parliament delegation and its outstanding Chairman, Mr Méndez de Vigo.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Moscovici's detailed, well-substantiated evaluation of what he defined a twofold success, <span class="italic">une</span> <span class="italic">double réussite</span>, referring to both procedure and text. The European Parliament will express its opinion regarding the proclamation of the Charter at the appropriate time, but I have reason to believe that its opinion will be completely favourable.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Mr Moscovici's questions: firstly, Mr President-in-Office, we are certainly not advocating running the risk of the Charter being rejected in Biarritz just because we are calling for it to be incorporated into the Treaties; however, in all honesty, I cannot imagine that responsible heads of government will reject the Charter, given the high quality of its content.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, due consideration must certainly be given to the argument of timing – I am familiar with it, Minister, and it is a very strong argument – namely the fact that there has not yet been enough time for the issue to be fully explored and that the majority of the Member States are currently opposed to the idea. It is also true that we must have faith – and many of us do – in the power of the Charter as such and in its capacity to inspire the decisions of the Luxembourg Court, but what we are trying to say, Mr Moscovici, is that the issue of whether and how to incorporate the Charter into the Treaties cannot be avoided. It must be discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference and a solution will have to be found in Nice, for it is important both to guarantee the full legal effectiveness of the Charter and to ensure that it is the first stone laid in a process of constitutionalisation.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I am mentioning this because I was particularly struck by what you had to say on the matter, Minister. Rather than waiting for a Constitutional Charter to be established – to which the Charter of Fundamental Rights could become the preamble – to incorporate this Charter into the Treaties, it could serve as the basis for drawing up, over a longer period of time of course, a European Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, what we want is to open a discussion on the matter in Biarritz and to continue until Nice, so that, at Nice and even after Nice, we will then be able to outline the practical steps to be taken once the Intergovernmental Conference is over.</p>

<p class="contents">However, we also look – particularly at this time – towards Belgrade and Serbia. We marvel at the desire of the people there for freedom, we encourage them to continue along the path towards the European Community of values. We declare our solidarity with the elected President Vojislav Koštunica and all democrats in Serbia. We shout to Slobodan Miloševic: "Do your people a service. Step down so that your compatriots can live in peace and freedom."</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Ten years ago today on 3 October German unity in freedom became a reality. It was the work of millions of people who in a peaceful revolution brought the wall down, cleared the minefields and swept away communism with its contempt of humankind. German unity was only possible because of Solidarnosc in Poland, because of the desire for freedom of the Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians and other peoples in central Europe. And they have the right to join the Community of values of the European Union. On the initiative of our colleague, Alain Lamassoure, our group will be tabling a motion declaring that we will proceed with enlargement in such a way as to enable the first peoples from central Europe to take part in the next European elections in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">A few days ago in Budapest, the freeman of Europe, the former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, spoke passionately in favour of the central European States becoming Members of the European Union. Today we say thank you to Helmut Kohl and salute him for understanding German unity as a duty to bring about the unification of our European continent with courage and determination.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Now we look towards Biarritz – and I see that the President-in-Office is leafing through and reading a book. Mr President-in-Office, I would ask you to follow this debate now as Mr Prodi is doing, to put your book to one side and take this Parliament seriously!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We are looking towards Biarritz and I can agree with nearly all of your comments. I should like to thank you very much, Mr President of the Commission, Mr Romano Prodi, for the great speech which you have given here today. Parliament – in any case my group – will stand resolutely at your side if you continue to defend these principles in the future.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">And now we look towards Biarritz. We support what you said about majority voting, Mr President-in-Office. Of course we need to apply the principle of democracy in practice. This means that the majority of the population must be reflected in a majority vote. I would also ask, however, that we respect the rights of small countries in the European Union and avoid any arrogance on the part of large countries in the European Union. The small countries have their dignity too, and perhaps the outcome of the vote in Denmark would have been different if we had behaved differently in connection with one quite specific issue in recent weeks and months.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We say yes to closer cooperation. But this closer cooperation must not exclude anyone. We can support what you said. But I would also ask you to take us beyond Nice in Biarritz, and to ensure that there is also a decision in Nice to set in train the next steps in the reform process, and then – as you rightly said – we will have to consider the issue of a procedure for forming a constitution. The Institute in Florence has said that we need to split the Treaties into a basic treaty and a second treaty. We need to give this further consideration. As we do to the point which the President of the Commission rightly raised, that of mandating the next Conference in Nice to settle who does what in Europe: what the European Union does and what the nation states do. And it is then for the nation states to determine what should be decided at regional or district level. We wholeheartedly support what you said in this regard, Mr President of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We have now had the Convention on Fundamental Rights. Our group should like to thank Roman Herzog and for our Parliament Iñigo Méndez de Vigo, as well as all colleagues from all the groups who have participated in this. A magnificent job has been done and of course we have to ensure that, little by little, this also becomes part of Community law. Mr President-in-Office, you are right. We must not jeopardise the project; that is why we need a little patience. But I expect and hope that you will also find the right way gradually to make these fundamental rights European Union law.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the really decisive point and the reason why we are so grateful to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, for his speech today. A great speech, Mr President of the Commission, in which you declared that we are acting within the framework of the Community of the European Union, that we are not working within bilateral or multilateral structures under secretariats which are outside the Community framework, but secretariats within the Community framework. We will resolutely oppose intergovernmentalism or secretariats, should any of our leaders have these in mind. We wish to act within the framework of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The greatest achievement of the European Union is our shared law, and we must obey this law. Anyone who starts to bend the rules for opportunistic reasons challenges the foundations of the European Community. This law is the foundation stone for peace in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, in conclusion I would make a request of you. Like the majority of the Council, you belong to the political family of François Mitterrand. I wish you the courage and strength to remain true to the European ideals of François Mitterrand in the coming weeks, months and years. And if you do then our family of parties – which was founded on the legacy of Konrad Adenauer, Alcide de Gasperi and Robert Schuman – will also be at your side when it comes to building a common Europe. That is the common task which now lies before us.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, ten years after German reunification, which marked the end of the cold war and to which our institution actively contributed, we find ourselves at a new crossroads. This phrase is no platitude: we now have to find a solution which definitively unifies Europe and confronts globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">We have listened attentively to the report of the President-in-Office of the Council and also the excellent speech of the President of the Commission, who is today returning from his summer break, and I believe that this should, to a certain extent, set the pace for our institutions, because a year ago the investiture of the Commission took place and now we have to hold a debate on the crossroads we are facing and the future of Europe. I would say that the issue can be summed up as having to reform in order to enlarge, and also so that our institutions might function properly. Nor must we forget that we also have to govern jointly in order to deal with the problems and aspirations of the European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The Biarritz Summit is about to take place and I must say, on behalf of my Group and of my political family, the Party of European Socialists, that we consider the work carried out by the Convention on the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be a success in terms of what it has achieved and also in terms of the method it has used. I wish publicly to express my gratitude for the work carried out not only by our fellow Members in the Convention, presided over by Mr Méndez de Vigo, but also by all those who have participated, even during the summer, in this work, which has had a good gestation period, since it has lasted nine months.</p>
<p class="contents">On the eve of the Biarritz Summit, it is important that the Charter is approved by the Council. Why? Because we must give substance to European citizenship. We need to ensure that the demands we made in the Treaty on European Union ten years ago are translated into clear and concrete action. Furthermore – and this has been the important work in the final stage of the Charter – to ensure that its content is progressive and that it extends not only to personal freedoms but also to economic and social rights. This content has been achieved at the end of the work on the Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I believe that the Charter currently sends an important message to our citizens and also to the candidate countries. In relation to the debate on enlargement to follow, my Group believes that it is important for us to send a positive message to these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">When producing a resolution of 120 sections, the first thing we have to say is that we want the whole of the enlargement process to be carried out in a clear and transparent way, dealing with its needs, but at a sustained pace. It is important that this Parliament sends the message that it is essential to set the timetable at the European Council in Nice, which needs to be successful.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Charter is also important given the dangerous tendencies which are emerging in the Union, leading to populism, a lack of solidarity and xenophobia. I really do not understand – I am now addressing the President-in-Office of the Council – why, when for once we have done something really good and which we are all pleased with, we are going to put the Charter on the back burner after Nice.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I am not asking for it to be included directly in the Treaties but, while we are discussing Articles 6 and 7, we must affirm our community of values. It is very difficult to explain to our voters that we have done a good job, which we are all very pleased about, but that we are going to put it off until a later date. I believe that the Council and the governments must give serious consideration to what must be the frontispiece to our Union. And that is the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the method, we have not discovered the philosopher’s stone, but we have realised that this method is democratic, because it is public, transparent, and is allowing the citizens and civil society to follow what we are doing in real time. The truth is that, after listening to the report of the President-in-Office of the Council on the development of the Intergovernmental Conference – he has said it with the discretion and elegance worthy of the Presidency, especially if it is French, but he has said that we are in a situation of total stalemate, and has used the term ‘paradox’ – I ask myself: could we not apply the Convention method to the Intergovernmental Conferences?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That is a very fundamental question which would resolve many of our problems. Because in the Intergovernmental Conferences – and we all know this from what they tell us and we have two representatives who are showing great patience – the representatives are limited to following instructions so that the leaders, at the end, simply negotiate during the last five minutes, which produces the type of Treaties which we have, which are completely incomprehensible, even to the initiated.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that there is a second message which we must direct at our governments when they meet in Biarritz and in Nice, and that is that the next Intergovernmental Conference, even this one, could be replaced with the Convention method.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, in relation to the President of the Commission’s comments on the future, I agree on one basic idea: at a time when, unfortunately, there is a debate in which there is talk of a constitution, of federalism, in which we have our Heads of State – tomorrow we will have President Ciampi – making grandiose claims for the future of Europe, I must say that the Heads of State and Government say many things in favour of Europe in public which they appear to resolve in private. Well, at least they say them, I suppose.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, it is true that we have to construct for the future on the basis of the present. And at present we have an interinstitutional triangle. We completely agree on this and also on the fact that we have to try to take advantage of that triangle. I believe that President Prodi has understood this, because, if I am not mistaken, he was at the Amsterdam Summit where the High Representative for external policy was created. We learn from our mistakes. Now I see that he is arguing for a progressive integration of something which Parliament, at that time, argued for before Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the second example he has given – economic policy – he said something very important. In the Treaties there is a very clear definition of the competence of the Commission in this field. I tell you this, on behalf of my Group: President Prodi, you must act, because it is essential that, as well as the European Central Bank, there is economic leadership in the Union and that does not mean that the Treaties need to be amended.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I must end. We are surely heading for a creative crisis in the Union. I believe that, if there is a clear will to resolve the problems, while thinking of our citizens, transparently and publicly, according to Community methods, we will finally end up doing something which was asked of us in this very House by a leader with enormous moral authority: President Havel told us that we needed a clear constitution which we could explain to our children.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that that can finally help us to guide the future of Europe.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cox (ELDR).</span></span>   – Madam President, Mr Prodi, this morning has been your finest hour since you took over the leadership of the European Commission. I believe that you have chosen an appropriate moment, that you have spelled out a coherent and significant vision and that you have formulated a challenge with great personal conviction. I say to you as a parliamentarian that I note with great respect that it was on the floor of this Chamber that you chose to deliver this important, strategic vision.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In listening to the debates of recent months – the creeping intergovernmentalism in the wider European debate and the debate in Denmark about almost everything but the euro – I was reminded of the words of a very famous Nobel laureate and Irish poet, William Butler Yeats, when he talked in the context of another political struggle in the following terms: "The best lack all conviction, while the worst/Are full of passionate intensity"</p>
<p class="contents">Today, President Prodi, you have shown conviction and passionate intensity. I say to you, stay on this path. Mobilise this House with you. As you know, we will go with you. Mobilise your Commission to deliver this message; bring this message to Ecofin; bring this message to the General Affairs Council; bring this message to the capital cities; bring your message to the media; bring your message to the people of Europe. We are now having a debate about the heart and soul of the kind of Union we want to build. What you have spelled out today in respecting what I call the "traditional Community method" – which has been getting a rough ride in recent debates – is an approach which cares about balance and balancing out the differences and the interests of the large and small; which cares about bringing to the European project a capacity to get things done. Even in the past when we have chosen the path of intergovernmentalism, in the Schengen agreement for instance, we have discovered that the very lack of instruments which surrounded it has obliged it to start moving back to the Community method.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to your remarks on Mr Solana there is a very important vision there. You saw from the way the House responded that you will have great support in the long term. But in the short term, my group deplores the technocrats' coup this summer who in adopting a code of secrecy rather than a code of transparency shut down our right to know, let alone our right to be consulted. We will do battle on that. We ask you to join us in the name of transparency.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, on behalf of my group, Mr Prodi has today spelled out what we believe in. In another battle in another place Winston Churchill once said that his nation would never surrender and talked about fighting on the beaches, fighting on the landing grounds and fighting in the fields and the streets. We have to become street fighters for Europe. You have to keep that passionate intensity and get that message across because we are fighting for the heart and soul of what we believe in. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would particularly like to thank Mr Moscovici for the clarity and precision of his words and, in more political terms, for taking up a position in favour of a constitutional process. As concerns Mr Prodi, I believe that we must be grateful to him for having courageously pointed out a number of instances of poor administration in our institutions and, above all, for having very clearly called the intergovernmental method into question.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, we must not let ourselves be overcome by euphoria. Other speakers have already made the point that we must be mindful of the fact that throughout the European Union there is a crisis of confidence in the European Institutions. This crisis of confidence has made itself felt itself in Denmark in particular and, even if the result of the vote there can be interpreted in different ways, there can be no doubt that a section of the Danish electorate wanted to indicate a certain lack of confidence in the European Union, not least in its ineffectiveness and lack of political will in terms of social matters, environmental protection and democratic transparency.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We now find ourselves three months away from the deadline of the Nice Summit, and I believe that the issue at stake is that of restoring this confidence. We have to provide a response that is visionary – there would now seem to be room for hope in this regard – and potent. We have to jettison something that, sadly, has dominated discussions for too long, a kind of overcautious realism that commonly resembles an inability to act.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">A few words on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, a subject on which I must beg to differ with the previous speakers. This is clearly an exhilarating project. The setting up of the Convention represented a major step towards a more democratic Europe, insofar as the process breaks with the intergovernmental approach. On this point I agree. I would, however, be more critical as concerns the results. Indeed, a detailed analysis of the final text reveals a certain imbalance between economic rights and property rights on the one hand, and social rights and environmental rights on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">We find ourselves faced with a paradox with, on one side, a Charter which is relatively weak in political terms and, on the other, a desire not to grant this Charter the essential binding status that would make it a citizens’ tool that enabled any European citizen to bring a case before the Court of Justice to uphold their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the IGC, I now see a glimmer of hope following the sluggish rate of progress in recent months, but it is certain that if, as Mr Moscovici quite clearly stated, the IGC does not relieve the deadlock by next December, particularly regarding the extension of qualified majority voting, which entails abandoning the right of veto and applying codecision in a more widespread way, this would constitute a setback and we would have to carry on. I believe that deferring the issue would be the worst possible option, both for the citizens of Europe and for the citizens of the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards enlargement, I do not have time to go into detail but I would like to conclude, Madam President, by stressing the importance of another aspect of enlargement. We expect candidate countries to adapt their institutions, economies and legislative systems, but we must also adapt our own policies. The main challenge before us is that of preventing the European Union from becoming nothing more than one large market place with 500 million consumers and with major structural imbalances. I believe that if we are to meet this challenge, we must launch, at Nice, a constitutional process that will enable this radical reform of the institutions, this restructuring of the hierarchy of values, and which will finally place free trade somewhere other than at the top of the agenda.</p>

It is, in many ways, a timeworn, if not fossilised system that we must leave behind. But the way forward certainly does not lie in the centralisation of powers in the hands of the Commission. In my view, it is the institutional system as a whole, including the Commission, that should be transformed, and the new factor that must lie at the heart of these changes are the operators that form part of the social movement, the citizens, those people who were notably absent from your speech.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge you to listen very closely to what I say next. “Ordinary people have realised that a certain model of public administration ... has reached its limits.” “This crisis of governance has hit the Union head-on.” “The Union was founded and is still being constructed behind closed doors rather than in the open.” But “Europeans are less and less willing to be presented with a <span class="italic">fait accompli</span>.” “What has to become democratic is the whole process, from pinpointing the basic problem to implementing and assessing the solution.” “A case of ... letting the key players and interests play a greater part.” This is “the political challenge confronting Europe today”.</p>
<p class="contents">These are not my own words. They are taken from a document that was commissioned by your predecessor, President Santer, almost two years ago from the Commission’s own Forward Studies Unit, before being shelved. I nevertheless find it extremely clear-sighted. Our ambition should be to convince the people of Europe to join together in their diversity and thus become masters of their common destiny.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my belief that if we are to succeed we need a participatory democracy, social advances, bonds of solidarity, designs for civilisation and ethical inspiration. I have heard no mention of these this morning. In short, we need politics in the true sense of the word, since it is on this that the future of Europe hinges. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Madam President, the decision of the Danish people on 28 September on participation in the European currency regime will undoubtedly figure at the Biarritz European Council meeting. EU Member State governments must now seriously reflect on what has happened in Denmark. The Danish decision comes two months before EU leaders are to meet in Nice to reform existing EU treaties and policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the enlargement of the European Union. It will help consolidate democratic and civil structures in eastern and central Europe, expand market economies and help build a European continent at peace with itself. However, EU Member State governments face difficult choices. We cannot deny that the Danish people used the recent referendum as a test of confidence in the structures of the European Union. The referendum in Denmark had more to do with the direction of the European Union and future political integration than actually participating in the Euro currency itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Serious concern was expressed among Danish voters that the elimination of tax vetoes within the European Union would dissipate future social security benefits. I do not necessarily support this. However, the point remains the same: namely that the European Member State governments, the European Commission and the European Parliament have a serious battle on their hands to persuade the 370 million citizens of the European Union that greater political and economic integration is the way forward for the European Union. This is the core issue.</p>
<p class="contents">If Member State governments push the issue of political integration too far in Nice, we will have real difficulties in securing approval in the referendums which will have to be held in various European Union countries. Any reform of European Union treaties must be fair and balanced. It must protect the interests of the smaller Member States, and we must not help build a two-tier Europe where larger Member States run the European Union at the expense of the smaller Member States. We must also protect national cultural and linguistic diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Granted, this text may seem commonplace at first sight, but it takes on great meaning in the light of topical events.</p>
<p class="contents">The protection of human dignity and liberty, cited in the preamble, would resonate loudly in Palestine, for example. And in Article 21, it may seem like verbiage, especially in our 15 Member States, to worry about discrimination on the grounds of religion or ethnic origin, when elsewhere twelve-year-old boys are being shot like so much vermin precisely because of their religion. It could even be seen as insulting to these adolescents, who actually face discrimination and death.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a sense of perspective, a sense of the proportionality set out in Article 48 of the Charter, before voicing off from our own standpoint as relatively well off in human rights terms.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, moreover, this sense of perspective that will provide the solutions at Nice, since it will at last be possible to enlarge the Union to include, for example, the Poland of Copernicus and Pope John Paul II or, at a later date, orthodox Russia, the eastern sentinel of the Christian world, and it will be possible to do so without disrupting operating procedures. All we need do is apply the philosophical principles set out in the Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in the name of the respect for national identities set out in the preamble, there must be a Council of Ministers which unanimously agrees with the fundamental freedom of nations. In the name of respect for the equality of all men, living together as a State, there must be at least one Commissioner per Member State and, lastly, in the name of prohibiting the types of discrimination set out in Article 21 of the Charter, there must be no two- or three-speed Union, because all the members of the same family living in the house called Europe must move into the future together without leaving anyone behind.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what the Charter stipulates. Let us not violate it before it is even applied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It nevertheless seems to me that Denmark has just given us a lesson in democracy. The Danish people seized this opportunity to send us an unequivocal message, and we should be thankful for it.</p>
<p class="contents">In saying no, the Danes have shown that Europe cannot be built without, or against the wishes of, those for whom it is a day-to-day reality. They have shown that Europe is currently on the wrong track. Indeed, rather than being an inclusive Europe, it seems to be becoming a Europe for the few. Let us not, for all this, slip into caricature. Rejecting one type of European model does not make one anti-European. It would be a crass mistake to think that it did. It is essential, on the eve of the Biarritz Summit, for the European Heads of State and Government to fully grasp the message addressed to them. Beyond the Danish ‘no’ vote, it is a call for a genuine Europe of differences, based on respect for peoples and for their diversity. This is what constitutes the real wealth of Europe. This right to difference and to respect is what must underpin any debate on institutional affairs, particularly at Biarritz. This is vital if we are to stop Europe drifting off course as it is now, seeking an identity somewhere between harmonisation and standardisation, which Europeans, quite justifiably, find so difficult to accept.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, this would seem to be the path that the Intergovernmental Conference wants to follow, by focusing on the extension of qualified majority voting. The environment, for example, will not be protected more efficiently as a result of our wanting to impose a policy that ignores economic realities and peoples’ needs. Let us therefore take advantage of the current discussions within the IGC to redefine, at last, a system that has reached its limits. The current desire to extend qualified majority voting will not bring Europe closer to the citizens. On the contrary, it will leave those who do not accept the single mindset by the wayside. These internal tensions will not strengthen Europe’s hand in international negotiations. Just how many different speeds will there be in the Europe towards which you want to lead us? Here are just a few of the many avenues which could be explored.</p>
<p class="contents">We need, for example, to agree to and facilitate subsidiarity. Europe must limit its responsibilities to those that the States cannot effectively assume alone. The principle of the free movement of goods and persons should promote trade and exposure to other cultures and other ways of life, rather than standardising everything. We need to hand the initiative back to the political arena and restore the initiative to the people.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, in conclusion, listen to the people more closely, respect their opinions, and seek to understand why it is they are turning their backs on Europe as it is now. Then we will all be able to move forward together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The applause that rounded it off clearly demonstrates that when there is a specific political objective, this Parliament can be relied upon to support it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate Mr Moscovici. Mr Moscovici brilliantly presented the issue which I am going to focus on, and nobody will be surprised that I am going to focus on the question of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. His intervention was wonderful up until the final minute when I did not understand what he was saying.</p>
<p class="contents">Why do I say that he gave an extraordinary speech? Because he acknowledged something which we are all satisfied with. The Convention method has worked and the truth is that it has been something of a miracle. I am not so surprised, but some of you will say that a Christian Democrat who does not believe in miracles is not a good Christian Democrat. Therefore, I do believe in miracles and the convention has been a miracle. Personal representatives of the governments, MEPs and national MPs, together with the Commission, reaching an agreement on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in ten months, seemed an impossible objective. We have done so, however, and I believe this is wonderful news for the European Union. It is wonderful that today we are celebrating the tenth anniversary of German unification and it is wonderful that we are today just a few years away from a great enlargement of the Union. The method has therefore worked, and so has the content of the Charter. Mr Moscovici has said so very expressively. The content of the Charter is good.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Feira European Council, President Guterres told us: "Do not worry about the legal value. Concentrate on the content of the Charter. Create a good Charter ". We have done so. I have not read any criticisms of the content of the Charter. Previous speakers have spoken well of the Charter because it is a good Charter which brings together the classic rights of the nineteenth Century and the modern rights of the twenty-first century. It is a Charter for the citizens, who have participated actively in its creation. It has been said here that this has been a virtual reality Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have a situation where, having created a Charter with good content and by means of an original method – and here I am reaching the last part of Mr Moscovici’s speech – we are now told that we are going to announce it and then wait and see what happens in the future. The argument of the President-in-Office of the Council is that there is a risk that the Charter will not be accepted by all the Member States as legally binding. That is a risk, it is true. But I believe things are changing, Mr Moscovici. I believe that at the beginning many governments had serious doubts, but now they have changed their minds. There are some – the Spanish Government has said this very clearly recently – who are in favour of incorporating the Charter into the Treaties. However, even if what you say is true, and there are some governments who do not want it incorporated into the Treaties, I must say very clearly that the citizens of Europe and the Members of this Parliament have the right to know who those governments are. We have the right to know. We must be told who does not want the Charter in the Treaties. Mr President of the Council, I therefore encourage you to continue the aims of a predecessor of yours in another convention and the French Presidency should have <span class="italic">de l'audace, encore de l'audace et toujours de l'audace </span>[boldness, again boldness and ever boldness]. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berès (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the President of the Commission has just told us that in matters of democracy there is no room for subsidiarity. Well I would like to say that there is no room for subsidiarity in matters of human rights either. Until yesterday, the Union was somewhat deprived in this respect. For, before the value of human rights, which is a European Union value, could be ours, we needed a text, a Charter, to establish its characteristics.</p>
<p class="contents">This Charter is primarily a charter for the inhabitants of the European Union, and I believe that it is also a charter for all those who want to join that Union. It is an extremely powerful political message, the importance of which must be emphasised, for when we talk about the Copenhagen criteria, these can sometimes prove a little limited when it comes to the rights of the individual. I believe that a solution has now been found to this problem. This Charter should form part of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been told that things are not going well in Europe. Yet how can we answer the question of what we wish to achieve together if we do not have, as the very least, a Charter of this quality? I believe that we are at an important juncture. The fact that 62 people, from different and sometimes conflicting backgrounds, have managed to reach a consensus and draw up a single document in the space of nine months, under the unrelenting gaze of civil society, would in fact seem to be a sign of the political health of our Union, and something that we cannot but welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The mandate given at Cologne was, as has been said, a limited mandate. The Heads of State and Government did not make our task any easier. It was a mandate under which we were unable to create new rights or develop any of the Union's responsibilities, and which some parties sought to interpret as a straightforward licence to transcribe certain articles from the European Convention on Human Rights. I believe that, as faithful servants of this Parliament, we used the mandate, all the mandate but not just the mandate, and I cannot but welcome this. The Charter is now accessible to everyone, it is easy to interpret and it is clear. I also feel, however, that it includes some major advances, and that also means in relation to current texts. We cannot but welcome this text, and take pride in speaking in favour of it today.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the content, and while I am aware that we will have a chance to return to this matter during our debate in November, I would immediately like to highlight certain points. This is the first international-level document to recognise the indivisibility of rights. We now have proof that this is possible, and this is taking place at European level. I believe, once again, that we can be proud of this. Moreover, for the first time, we have a gender-neutral text. This gives me, as a French speaking woman, great cause for satisfaction, although I am sure that this satisfaction will not solely be felt by French speakers.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have just said, this Charter recognises new rights. From this point of view it is a modern text, which acknowledges rights in the fields of biotechnology, data protection, the environment and good administration. Furthermore, I believe that the very structure of our text, as you yourself have stressed, Mr Moscovici, is an original one. The rights of the individual will never again be discussed in the same light, because now the prime right, the founding right, is the right to dignity. Then comes a flowing sequence of other rights of which I am also proud: dignity, liberty, equality, solidarity, citizenship, justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic and social rights take up their rightful place, but not only in the chapter on solidarity. They are also to be found throughout the text. They appear in the chapter on liberty, and in the chapter on equality, and quite rightly so, because this is a good way of promoting these economic and social rights. Then there is the right to proper administration. I believe, Mr President of the Commission, that you ought to be particularly alive to this right, which is one that we included in the chapter on citizenship. It is not aimed only at the citizen, it is aimed at all people. We have in a way extended and developed the notion of citizenship that was laid down in the Treaties, and which until now had no tangible form. It seems to me that drafting this Charter constitutes a major step forward which we must support and capitalise upon.</p>
<p class="contents">A word on the method. As many people have already said, it is one that presupposes that the draft Charter currently on the table will remain intact, or that the Convention will be asked to rework it. It nevertheless seems to me that only the Convention should be able to amend certain points in the Charter, if by any chance this should be deemed essential, before the Charter is proclaimed. Let me remind you that we have not attempted to launch such an original process since the Assizes in Rome. But the difference is that this time around, in my opinion, the method has worked perfectly. It has not prevented the Heads of States and Government from giving their own instructions, and from having their representatives work together, but they have been doing so in a transparent manner, under the watchful eye of all the partners who, beginning with Parliament, have shown the extent to which they are able, in a process of this type, to perform their duties with a will to working towards and bringing about a result that is of value to everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, a word on incorporating the Charter. Much has already been said about this and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have just described the extent to which the Intergovernmental Conference has been involved in amending Article 7. There would seem to be no alternative but to open up this debate and address the status of the Charter. It would be paradoxical to turn it into an entity unclassified in legal terms, at a time when, on a daily basis, we perceive the need to validate a founding process based on our values. It would be paradoxical if you were, at Nice, to convene a new Intergovernmental Conference with a view to simplifying the Treaties, to possibly developing a constitutive process and to incorporating this Charter into the Treaties at some point in the future, but for us to remain where we are now, with the Treaty, pending the outcome of this hypothetical IGC.</p>
<p class="contents">What does this Treaty, as it stands, actually say? Article 6 lays down the principles on which the Union is established. It refers back to our constitutional traditions and to the European Convention on Human Rights. Can we accept, pending the incorporation of the Charter into the Treaty, a Treaty which only refers to the European Convention on Human Rights, when all the European Union institutions agreed to work together to draw up this Charter, which is a fine Charter which no legal expert could afford not to be aware of?</p>

All I can say to your speech is: finally! Like many here, I have waited a long time for this clear statement.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Moscovici, from the outset the European Parliament has called for the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated in the Treaties, for it to be made legally binding and – when it is infringed – for people to be given recourse to the European Court of Justice. This demand is not a political position of any kind. It results necessarily from the nature of the matter, from the essence of fundamental rights, and it corresponds to the expectations and requirements of the people. Can you even proclaim rights in earnest without enshrining them in law? Can you proclaim rights in earnest, but at the same time refuse to declare them part of your own law? Can you recognise fundamental rights but deny people the instruments and means to defend them?</p>
<p class="contents">Each article of this Charter is already enshrined in international conventions, in the constitutions of the Member States, in international law or in EU treaties and protocols. None of them contain anything new. They represent the sum total of a 200-year tradition of fundamental rights in Europe. The only question which needs to be resolved is whether the European Union and its institutions are – like the Member States – going to submit to this European tradition of fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Can it, Mr Moscovici, be true that governments are afraid of making long attested rights into internal European law which is actually in force and can be upheld by the courts? If so, would the European Council and the governments of the Member States not be admitting to the whole world that all these international conventions have for decades been regarded as political confessional literature without any legal weight? Would that not then arouse the suspicion amongst the people that the European Council and the governments of the Member States were trying to omit the section on governmental cooperation from the Charter on Fundamental Rights and protect their own power and their own absolute power from principles of the rule of law, judicial supervision and rules on fundamental rights? That is the suspicion which persists!</p>
<p class="contents">Minister Moscovici, surely it is a little comical for the Heads of State and Government to wish to proclaim rights of defence against the State. It is a matter for parliaments to proclaim fundamental rights and to enshrine them in law. But I believe that in this situation the governments and the European Council would be well advised to regard Parliament's vote in favour of legal validity and incorporation into the Treaties as an extremely weighty argument and to accede to this demand.</p>

As a member of the Convention, I have to admit that from time to time over the last ten months I had grave doubts as to whether this project would succeed. But the job has been done and I should like at this stage – with your permission – to thank very much the head of our delegation, Mr Méndez de Vigo, for his personal commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter of Fundamental Rights is indeed an important political project for the future of the European Union. It makes the rights of the public in respect of the bodies and institutions of the European Union transparent, and it closes a loophole in the protection of people's fundamental rights. The text now on the table is undoubtedly a delicate political compromise between the different interests of all 15 Member States and between the views of the various political parties and forces in the Union with their different socio-political ideas and moral concepts, and the text of the Charter has both strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the social fundamental rights are misconceived. We are seeking in vain to establish a right to a fair remuneration, despite the fact that this has been established by all States in the 1961 Social Charter. On environmental and consumer protection there are no individual rights for the public, and it is also regrettable that the right to asylum is not established as an individual right for third country nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I do also recognise the strengths of the Charter. The level of protection of the public's fundamental rights will match that in the European Convention on Human Rights and will even guarantee a greater level of protection. There is the right to strike, there is the right to conscientious objection, and I am particularly glad that the absolute equality between men and women has found its way into the Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">I would endorse what previous speakers have said. In my view, the Cologne Decision needs to be rewritten. In Biarritz we need to send out a twofold political signal: firstly, there needs to be a wide-ranging public debate on the Charter in the Union. The people must be included in this debate. Secondly, we need a decision to make the Charter an integral part of the Treaties. But in my view this question should also be decided by the people. For example, I could imagine a referendum being held in all our countries in 2004 alongside the European elections to ask the people whether the Charter should become an integral part of the Treaties.</p>

<p class="contents">The Biarritz Council and, three months hence, the Nice Council, which are to discuss the European institutions, must draw a significant conclusion from this. The response to enlargement is not increased supra-nationality, or an increase in powers, seated in Brussels, that are binding on all the Member States of the Union or even just on certain states that have joined together to form a hard core.</p>
<p class="contents">The second lesson is one for the people of France, and, without doubt, one for other nations too. My compatriots voted for the single currency in 1992 because they had been told that this could work without a super-state. Well, that is not true. This is now quite evident with the slump in the euro. In 1992, the French came to a decision on the basis of spurious information. They must now, in the light of experience, come to another decision, but this time on the basis of frank and comprehensive criteria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not know whether we would have done so, Mr Prodi, had you given then the speech which you have delivered today before the European Parliament. You have highlighted – and I applaud you for this – all the shortcomings of the process of European integration which have hitherto come to light and the implications for Nice if the method and spirit which, sadly, have pervaded recent Intergovernmental Conferences continue to prevail. Mr Barón Crespo was right to remind us that you were one of the signatories of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which established the position of Mr CFSP, and I would add to this that your government was one of the staunchest advocates of creating the new position held by Mr Solana which, despite his personal qualities, is highly irregular in legal terms.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why your condemnation today of the intergovernmental method, which Parliament has never ceased to view as one of the principle causes of Europe’s impotence at both internal and international level, is even more welcome. If we continue with this method, President Moscovici, enlargement will not come about and, in Nice, you will at best be able to start all over again – you could even try holding another Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">President Prodi, as other speakers have already said, the Commission needs to firmly reassert its role as the driving force behind European integration, and today, you have set down the broad guidelines for this. Continue in this vein, speak out loud and clear at Biarritz and at Nice, draw on the wise, sensible positions adopted by the European Parliament on this matter, and this House will certainly not fail to lend you its full support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is quite unnecessary for this Charter to be established when it comes to stepping up the protection of fundamental rights in Europe. This is also the view of experts in the field of European constitutional law. If the Charter were to form part of the Treaties, this would be at the expense of the authority of the Council of Europe and of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. In the long term, this is almost bound to lead to a competitive battle and conflict of interests between the European Union and the Council of Europe. A legally binding Charter is not only unnecessary, it even threatens to harm the enforcement of the fundamental rights. In order to ensure that these fundamental rights in Europe are protected effectively, all that needs to happen, now and in future, is for the European Union to join the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. In this way, we will ensure that the EU institutions are actually monitored externally at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">We would therefore be in favour of the Member States discussing the European Union’s accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms as one of the subjects within the framework of the IGC. Negotiations regarding the Charter could, as far as we are concerned, be scrapped. We are all the more convinced of this when we take a closer look at the text of the Charter, which stipulates that the Charter is only suited to function within one European state. As a Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, we hope, however, that such a federal state will never see the light of day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can therefore attend to the subject of the Charter of Fundamental Rights with a glad heart. People's opinions may well differ on the text which has been drafted. They might judge it to be satisfactory or less satisfactory; they might also consider it – compared with the huge effort involved – to be rather wanting. But they can make one objective statement: the actual aim will not be achieved for as long as this Charter is not accorded legally binding status. Until then it will in fact do nothing more than pay lip service to these ideals.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether, incidentally, another Convention would be a suitable way of addressing the considerably more complex issue of a European constitution remains to be seen. The involvement of the national parliaments is obviously to be welcomed. Personally, however, I think it is doubtful whether a reasonable result can be achieved on this difficult issue working from such a broad basis.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Biarritz is concerned, I should like to point out that it is not far from there to Nice, but neither – more importantly – is it very long now. The question of whether the Member States will be able to agree on a new treaty in Nice is still completely open. The attitude of the French Presidency – that they would rather have no treaty at all than a bad one – is sensible in my opinion. However, people's views on what makes a good or bad treaty are still miles apart. In addition, the French Presidency is not escaping criticism from leading European diplomats because of the way in which it is conducting the negotiations. But it is precisely the conduct of this French Presidency which will determine whether especially the smaller Member States take the impression with them from the negotiations on the Intergovernmental Conference that less value is attached to their reservations and positions than to those of the large Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cornillet (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the Charter has been a successful venture for all concerned and primarily, I believe, for Parliament. I see three benefits in it. The first has been the method selected, that of the Convention, which took the form of a judicious blend involving the competent representatives at national and European level, even if there was an extra guest at the table, as Commissioner Vitorino underlined. The three musketeers were in fact four, but they have indeed enabled a method to be set in place that we should turn to in the future to move matters forward within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The second benefit has been the work carried on by the committee. Tribute should be paid to Mr Méndez de Vigo for the work that he has done. In particular, we have seen the significant weight that the EP Delegation has in any case been able to carry with regard to the amendments approved.</p>
<p class="contents">The third benefit has been that of the good work done by Parliament, something that any parliament would welcome. The quality of those who have spoken before me makes it unnecessary to linger on this point, but it is true that there is a real added value. The scope of the Charter respects the principle of subsidiarity and it was no easy task to draw up a text that was balanced in legal terms, but still attractive and accessible to the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The counterpart of this threefold benefit is a threefold responsibility. The first responsibility concerns our comments. I believe that we must look beyond the frustrations inherent in any consensus in order to praise this Charter, rather than dwelling on what we would have liked to have seen and still envisage.</p>
<p class="contents">The second responsibility is that of adopting the Charter. I would like to think that Parliament could, in November, adopt the Charter of Fundamental Rights with all due formality, because it is traditional for parliaments to act as the custodians of public freedoms, and the European Parliament must seize the opportunity to demonstrate this.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the third responsibility is to follow up on this Charter, and we must show tenacity in this regard. We have voted, by a very large majority, for a resolution that calls for this Charter to be incorporated into the Treaties. I am aware that we already have a lot on our plate at Nice, and I am not convinced that it would be wise to ask for actual incorporation as early as Nice. What we can at least call for at Nice is a very precise timetable for the eventual incorporation of this Charter, even if, as legal experts have confirmed, it will have legal effect as soon as it is adopted by this House and by the Heads of Government, as there is nothing to stop the Court of Justice referring to it.</p>
<p class="contents">The end result is therefore a text that will be of great value within Europe, as many people have stressed. It is an asset for the people of Europe. I personally take pleasure in imagining that it could one day act as the preamble to a Constitution yet to be written. Lastly, with regard to the world outside Europe, I believe that human rights are the true message to come out of Europe. We now have a European handbook to send to our partners in their concentric circles – first to those who wish to join us and then to those with whom negotiations are being held. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It reflected a great vision shared by many of us. I also support what he said regarding the innovative value of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which enshrines the indivisibility of fundamental rights, overcoming the traditional distinctions between civil rights, economic and social rights and rights in new areas, and affirms the equality of men and women in all fields of human activity.</p>
<p class="contents">However, today, the Charter is essentially a symbol, the symbol of the passage from the Europe of the single market to the political Europe, from the Europe of States to the Europe of the citizens. Made up of different peoples and nations which wish to retain their different traditions, languages and religions, the European Union’s identity is based not on belonging to the same ethnic group, the same land or the same race, but on shared principles and shared fundamental human rights. This is the model of European civilisation which, after centuries of bloody conflict, has guaranteed us lasting peace between our peoples, and it is this peace and this social model which is our gift to the candidate countries, whom we do not ask to share our traditions or beliefs but to accept the same rules as we do in order to safeguard the freedom and dignity of every human being.</p>
<p class="contents">The unprecedented method – as it has rightly been described – followed in drawing up the Charter produced rapid results, thanks to the participation of the representatives of the peoples and their governments, the involvement and achievement of consensus among all the elements of civil society which wished to express their opinions, the transparency and collegial nature of the proceedings, the willingness to listen to different positions and the acceptance of sound compromises. The debilitating semi-secret or confidential negotiations which characterise the intergovernmental method do not produce the same results.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, this symbolic document is a milestone in the process of constitutionalising the European Union – for, in my opinion, the Union’s Constitution will not come into being in a single document all in one go, but will be the result of the gradual consolidation of the common institutions and the definition of shared fundamental rules – and it must become practically enforceable law.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to the Treaties, the Union has become an area of freedom, security and justice. This cannot continue to exist without an obligation to respect clearly proclaimed fundamental rights. It is the responsibility of the States, who are guardians of the Treaties, to establish this constraint by conferring legal status upon the Charter in the most appropriate way.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter is the soul of the Union and it cannot remain suspended in limbo indefinitely: it must be incorporated into current legislation. The governments must take human rights seriously and enforce them firmly and effectively to the tangible benefit of the European citizens. Only then will the citizens begin to look upon Europe as their common home.</p>

Unfortunately, the match has so far been goalless and not very exciting. The people of Europe are waiting impatiently for results.</p>
<p class="contents">The candidate countries are waiting for positive signals showing that the way to membership of the Union is, despite everything, becoming shorter. In the Member States, we are all waiting for the Council of Ministers to show the political courage and will really to reform current cooperation. It is difficult at present to see whether that will is to be found. The negotiations concerning the new Treaty take place too often behind closed doors.</p>
<p class="contents">The French Presidency therefore has a big responsibility for ensuring that genuine and tangible results are achieved in Nice, and the new Treaty must really create a European Union for new Member States. The institutional issues need to be solved and a clear mandate provided for continued work on a European constitution which is citizen-friendly and comprehensible. The Charter must be incorporated into this constitution, and I hope that a signal to this effect will be given in Biarritz.</p>
<p class="contents">For us Liberals, it is an obvious fact, and one that needs to be crystal-clear, that the present intergovernmental conference must be the last before new Member States are admitted. Unsolved issues about the future of the European project may not be used as justification for further postponing our historic task to unite Europe. The EU will never be ready, but the candidate countries must participate actively in future discussions. The Convention method is perhaps more suitable than these intergovernmental conferences we have had in the past.</p>

<p class="contents">I am sure that this is not the case, and I hope that those countries which have welcomed President Prodi’s speech with relief and enthusiasm will be able to take steps in the run up to Nice to ensure that it is a genuine success.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to focus briefly on the appraisal of the Convention method. It is quite true that it is an improvement on an Intergovernmental Conference, but – take note, ladies and gentlemen – even the Convention was forced to achieve consensus on every single word and, in the end, particularly during the concluding phase, it turned into a sort of Intergovernmental Conference II: our Praesidium had to negotiate with the Member States instead of, or as well as, Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel that, once again, the obligation to achieve unanimity on every single part of the Charter as well as on the final result will prove extremely hampering when we come to evaluate the content of the Charter itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many European citizens are questioning the point reached by the Union, its objectives and even the logic of integration. We say that there is a crisis of confidence with regard to the institutions, and I feel that this crisis is due in particular to the disparity between the expectations of society and the ability to live up to them. While growth continues apace, inequalities have become increasingly intolerable. The call for equitable distribution has become even louder. There are also great expectations as concerns cooperation, transparency and public debate. We must learn to listen more closely.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the method adopted, which I welcome, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which should be the social foundation stone of the European Union would not seem to match up either to the expectations or to the objectives set. Despite the constructive changes made in the final draft produced by the Convention, there is still great disparity between the contributions made by citizens' associations, their hopes and the results actually achieved. I would even go so far as to say that this Charter contains many ambiguities. There is still time to enhance it and, in doing so, to be far more receptive to the proposals made by many associations, trade unions and the progressive movement. The same applies to the priorities of employment, social integration and lifelong learning – highly important objectives that have been set, but whose realisation has foundered on the cold logic of the stability pact, on the dogma of liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Following on from what my fellow Member, Mr Wurtz, has said, I would like to stress the extent to which the vital reform of the institutions should address the issue of making the Union more democratic. There has been one gaping omission in all the remarks made on the subject of how it would be possible to create institutions enabling citizen participation. This is the prerequisite for a Europe of the peoples that is built to last. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that things are not going well and it is better to admit it openly. The negotiating side of things has hitherto proved disappointing and yielded negative results: to our knowledge, on not one point in the total 75 cases of unanimous voting has total agreement been reached, and in Italy, for the first time, a recent survey has shown that, in one of the largest regions, the North East, Europe is falling out of favour.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that Europe resembles an aeroplane taking off: either it accelerates and keeps rising upwards or it falls to the ground. And so, President, you who bear the greater responsibility, forge ahead right to the very end. You are committed, as are we, to absolute coherence, but there are two things which have to be done: firstly, you must make it clear immediately that, if Nice is a failure, there will be an internal crisis which may well involve resignations from the Commission, if necessary, and secondly, you must make it just as clear that enlargement is impossible without prior thorough reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is in danger of being defeated by compromises, not crises. When such crises are triggered by opposing views they are healthy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is what he has done this morning in this speech which has given us all fresh hope.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to focus on two facts which produce opposing reactions: satisfaction at the Convention and bitterness at the outcome of the referendum in Denmark. These are two different results which, however, I feel are closely related and herald new times. Almost 90% of the population took part in the Danish referendum, a level which bears unequivocal witness to the citizens’ interest in contributing to European decision-making. On the other hand, the result, which we fully respect, may be an indication that the citizens do not yet feel in tune with the European ideal.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem may well be a general one. It must be admitted that, after 55 years of Community life, there may well be a lack of feeling of belonging to anything other than a merely geographical Europe. The internal borders of today and the single currency of tomorrow are certainly useful, necessary symbols which will affect citizens’ everyday lives in a practical way and contribute to reinforcing the European ideal, but they will not fulfil the citizens’ call for greater heed to be paid to their views and for greater representation of their interests and, above all, of their hopes for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, the objectives set at the current Intergovernmental Conference do not meet this demand fully, although the reform of the weighting of votes and the extension of qualified majority voting are steps in this direction. For a long time now, we have been talking about a post-Nice period during which institutions and operating procedures need to be reformed more effectively, also and especially with a view to enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">I and many others feel that the experiment of the Convention should be repeated, and that the formula adopted should be refined as we go along, so that the hope recently expressed by President Chirac that the reform processes will increasingly serve the purpose of bringing our institutions closer to the citizens will be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention was a Europe-wide success in terms of the formula adopted, the significant results achieved within the time allowed and the sense of accountability shown by all the participants. Let us endeavour to promote this model to ensure a future in which our hopes for Europe are realised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van den Burg (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I too am proud of the text of the Charter which is being submitted to the Biarritz Council. It is the first time that the indivisibility of fundamental rights has actually found expression; something for which a case has been made in the international arena, since the human rights conference in Vienna in 1993. I have argued strongly in favour of including social, economic and cultural rights alongside the traditional fundamental rights. This came to fruition. I do have two minor criticisms I would like to make.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency has failed to carry out the wishes of the vast majority of the Convention, who wanted an unambiguous reference to the revised social Charter of the Council of Europe to be included. I think this is unwise, but I assume that the European Court will make up for this in its interpretation of social rights. Last-minute changes have been made to the text of the article on collective action and the right to strike. I will not go into detail. Commissioner Vitorino knows exactly what I am referring to. I expect that he will include corrections and clarifications in the memorandum.</p>
<p class="contents">As an ex-trade union negotiator, I am used to defending the outcome of negotiations. Do not, therefore, expect me to come up with a whole list of points which are lacking or which have not been formulated as well as they could have been. I believe that we have a sound Charter before us. Its aim is to marry the entire breadth of European policy with the standards and principles of the constitutional state and of the social welfare state. This was the Cologne mandate and this is also what the Charter can do, whether it becomes binding or not.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, the Charter must be incorporated into the Treaty and it should form the basis of a European constitution in future. But some Member States need slightly more time to get used to the idea. Those at the back of the queue threaten to dictate the pace, but this is no reason to relegate the Charter to the bin if it cannot be made binding right away. On the contrary, I believe we need to throw our entire weight behind the next step. So, I would suggest to Mr Moscovici not to ease off. The Charter should become a live instrument, both legally and politically.</p>
<p class="contents">On a legal plane, I can think of forms of enforcement other than direct enforcement by the European Court on an individual basis. For example, in the Council of Europe and the ILO, there is a wealth of experience in terms of reporting procedures, expert committees and the collective right of complaint of trade unions and NGOs, and it is through these means that the Charter can be monitored from a legal perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as important is the fact that the Charter can establish itself as a political project as a means of involving people in Europe. The discussion which Mr Verheugen sparked with his statement on a referendum was a painful demonstration of how bad communication is between Brussels and the citizens. Similarly, the Danish referendum can be taken as a motion of no-confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to promote the Charter as a Charter for setting a wide social debate in motion about what kind of a Europe we want. Mrs Pintassilgo and her Committee of Wise Men suggested this back in 1996. NGOs and trade unions are ready for this, as has become evident from the enormous commitment they have shown to the process so far. Let us hold on to this commitment and build on it.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, the Benelux governments proposed in an IGC memorandum that next year, under the Belgian Presidency, a plan for giving direction to Europe’s will have to be laid down which addresses these points, such as the anchoring of the Charter, but also the discussion on reforming institutions and authorities, which Mr Prodi was referring to.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is a realistic timetable to propose a project for the future of Europe under that Presidency, and the Charter will have a role to play in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The drawing-up and approval of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, together with an Intergovernmental Conference which may lead to decisive changes and enlargement are historic events which may leave their mark on the start of this new century. There is, however, the possibility that the full potential of this decisive episode will not be realised if the Charter is not made legally effective, if the Intergovernmental Conference does not carry out the reforms and if, as a consequence, enlargement becomes liable to hold back political integration.</p>
<p class="contents">The dilemma in the hearts of a great many citizens who want a political Europe, not just a great trading entity, is this: if the Intergovernmental Conference fails to produce the desired reforms, should we still proceed with enlargement? Indeed, if we were to continue along the road to enlargement whatever happens, as is to be desired, closer cooperation would be our only hope. Therefore, this last prospect should certainly not be restricted by pre-set limits but rather, while remaining within the bounds of an accepted legal and institutional framework, enable the Member States who are ready to do so to set off along the path of deeper political integration, leaving the way open for the others to join them when they consider the time is right.</p>
<p class="contents">We must allow everyone to follow his own political project in the Union, in a harmony of differences which, after all, has already proved to be a winning solution in the history of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am one of those who believe that adopting the Charter, even in a declaratory mode, will be a welcome step forward because it will certainly lead in due course to a charter that is fully legally binding.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to draw the attention of the House and the Commission to the question which will arise this Friday when we are discussing the rights of the lettori, the foreign language lecturers in Italian universities. Here we have a situation where rights possessed by citizens of the Union have been denied for twelve years and more. It is no good agreeing a Charter of Rights at the highest level if individual citizens who are wronged by a state have no effective remedy. We insist, therefore, that as well as the commitment to the Charter we have heard from the Commission today, it also commits itself to protecting the rights of individual citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It adds nothing over and above what is at present implied in the EU’s, the Member States’ and the Council of Europe’s policy in this area. This is also clear from Article 50 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Seen from a Left perspective, there is a lot missing from the text of the Charter. The Charter can therefore only be seen as an attempt to transfer responsibility for citizens’ rights from the institutions in which they at present reside to the European Union. It is a development which we reject. It is aimed only at driving the EU towards a federal constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe there are better alternatives, namely for the EU to sign and, in that way, be subject to the Council of Europe’s convention in this area. This would also reinforce pan-European cooperation in this sphere instead of weakening it, as there is a danger of the EU Charter doing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Danish ‘no’ vote is not isolationist or nationalistic in character. It is not a sign that a majority of Danes are saying ‘no’ to European cooperation or that the Danes are not carefully informed about the ins and outs and development plans of the European Union. A majority of Danes have said ‘no’, as they did in 1992 and 1993, to more European integration, ‘no’ to surrendering more sovereignty and ‘no’ to the tools which serve these purposes, that is to say the euro, majority decision-making and a European constitution. Allow me to stress that the ‘no’ votes were delivered by voters right across the political spectrum. Even half of the ruling Social Democratic Party’s voters said ‘no’. It should not be imagined that the European project, of which we have heard the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi give such a clear description, could have convinced the Danes and persuaded them to vote ‘yes’. The Danish Government and the parties in favour of the euro have done everything in their power to explain away the integration and surrender of sovereignty that are under way. In order to pacify a people who have been independent for a thousand years, it was declared that ‘the Union is as dead as a doornail’. If the Danish Government had spoken as clearly as Mr Prodi and Mr Poettering did in this Chamber today, there would have been many more people who voted ‘no’. Allow me, therefore, to say to you all: those who want more in the way of union must go further down that road alone. Denmark, and all free Europeans who are allowed to hold referenda, will say no thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are counting on Nice to fulfil this requirement. However, what the summit <span class="italic">can</span> do is to prepare the groundwork for Nice, and this is why this debate is certainly useful to get across our parliamentary message.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Biarritz, I desperately hope that the Amsterdam leftovers can be resolved very quickly. Concerning the number of Commissioners, we believe that one Commissioner for each Member State is enough, and Parliament needs no more than 700 MEPs. Furthermore, and this brings me to the most important point, all EU legislation must be subject to qualified majority decision-making combined with – and this is a compelling point – Parliament’s right of codecision, because I have heard rumours here and there that these two do not automatically coincide.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would also call for, however, is to look beyond immediate concerns in Biarritz. We know all too well that the present Treaties are inadequate and that the Union will need a better and different structure in future, a more constitutional structure which clearly distinguishes the powers of the Member States and those of the Union. In this respect, President Prodi set the right tone in my opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a brief comment on the Charter. I had the honour of being involved in the preparatory work for the Charter. I would first of all like to thank Mr Roman Herzog and Mr Inigo Méndez de Vigo for their sterling work and for the way compromises were struck time and again. I would also like to commend the role of Commissioner Vitorino. The outcome was sound. The Charter provides for the dignity of the citizens, the ban on capital punishment, the citizens’ liberties, education, labour and enterprise in all Member States, the very exhaustive anti-discrimination article, which is even more exhaustive than the one in the Treaty of Amsterdam, and the equal treatment of men and women; not only in traditional areas of work, remuneration and social security, but also in all areas of the Union. All this represents a step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope with all my heart, and I must say this quite emphatically, that an opportunity will arise when this document can be incorporated into the Treaties at some point in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to end by making a final remark on Professor Prodi’s cry from the heart. I have to say that his warning, a well-meaning one at that, to stop confirming and developing intergovernmental trends, has really struck a chord with me. These only exacerbate the EU’s anti-democratic disposition. Mr Prodi has put an emphatic stop to this kind of action, which has hopefully resonated with Mr Moscovici, and I truly hope that this trend can be broken and reversed at the Councils in Nice and Biarritz. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our declaration of rights is the first of this millennium. It is the most modern in the world, and it has been drawn up in the world’s largest continuous legal area. It offers an important message to our citizens and to surrounding countries about the constitutional principles upon which our countries are founded.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time, citizens’ representatives have actively participated in shaping the details of the European Union’s development. A democratic and effective model has replaced an old-fashioned, sluggish and one-sided model. Our European identity and community of values will be strengthened. However, the Charter will also have liberalising effects on the European economy. Individuals will have more opportunities to start up businesses and to stand on their own two feet. Increased support will be given to private ownership and to ownership under intellectual property law. This individual protection is an important basis for enlargement of the Union – the EU’s priority for the next few years. Citizens of the candidate countries will also be able to share in the EU’s freedoms and rights. European citizenship is taking shape here and now. In particular, it will give citizens of small countries the benefits enjoyed by the citizens of a large country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During this French Presidency of the Union, we expect a firm unified response from the 15 Member States to these issues, which are of prime concern to our fellow citizens, one that will enable a rapid reversal of these trends. Should this fail to materialise, we should not be surprised if public opinion proves sceptical about Europe, or even rejects it.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are messages of encouragement concerning the IGC negotiations in preparation for the enlargement of the Union. These are, as we know, very tricky negotiations and raise fears of a setback or a watered-down agreement in Nice which, as you have already acknowledged, Mr Moscovici, would be even more serious.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament, and the peoples of Europe it represents, expect the extraordinary European Council Meeting in Biarritz to mark a leap forward, a political wake-up call for the Heads of State and Government. The policy of one step at a time no longer suits the scale of the challenges that confront us, but your determination on both counts is evident in your statements. Let us restore a human dimension to Europe. Incorporating the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaties would be a major step in this direction. Let us, as a Europe of 15 Member States, organise ourselves in order to be able to welcome those countries who are knocking at the door into the fold under respectable conditions. Let us at last find the clarity of vision to define the borders of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I started by mentioning the events in Yugoslavia. If only we could draw from the courage and perseverance in adversity shown by our friends in Serbia, Europe would be able to make better headway and be more readily understood and supported by its citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The completion of this work is an important milestone in the history of the European Union, particularly for the people who live there. The work of the Convention under the leadership of the former German President, Roman Herzog, is to be welcomed. At this stage I should also like to thank Dr Ingo Friedrich who played a leading role in our group's contribution to the work of the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">But I should like once again to ask a very clear question here: do we want to create a charter of all immutable and inalienable human rights? Or do we want a wish list containing everything that would be nice? Are free education and free access to a job centre fundamental rights on the same footing as the right to life or human dignity? In Germany an extensive list of fundamental rights already existed in the Weimar constitution which, however, because it was so extensive, degenerated into a simple set of targets which could not be legally enforced. That must not happen here. We want to ensure that the fundamental rights of the European public are genuinely protected.</p>
<p class="contents">With an eye to recent events, the issue of petrol prices also seems to me to be particularly noteworthy. The current situation, which is intolerable, particularly for many independent haulage firms and for agriculture, does in any case need to be improved. It is not enough for the finance ministers to swear in Versailles that they will not lower taxes, only for the countries where the protests are loudest to give in afterwards.</p>
<p class="contents">The Intergovernmental Conference – to address a third subject – on the reform of the European institutions is also of decisive significance for us in Parliament. Majority voting can only be extended in the Council if at the same time the European Parliament's powers of codecision are widened. Any other procedure would mean a huge democratic deficit. Responsibilities must be clearly delimited. Provision for social, cultural and charitable causes must be included in Article 87 so that the future of these important institutions can also be permanently safeguarded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Representatives from both our own parliament and national parliaments and governments worked on it. This cooperation produced an excellent result, in spite of some misgivings. We might ask whether this model of successful cooperation should be continued in the future?</p>
<p class="contents">Many of our citizens feel the European Union is distant and bureaucratic. Their distrust of the Union must be taken seriously. We have to pay particular attention to relations between the people and the Union’s institutions. For that reason, I am very glad that the Charter on Fundamental Rights emphasises the principle of transparency, although it could still be put in stronger terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the demands made here today in this House, it would appear that the Charter is not going to be made legally binding, but is merely to be a political declaration. I use the word ‘merely’, although I believe that, despite its declaratory nature, the EC Court will have to apply the Articles of the Charter in their judicial practices as self-binding principles, with which the interpretation of the court must naturally be in harmony. In this way they will gradually become <span class="italic">de facto </span>legally binding legal norms.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter is an indication that the Union bears a responsibility for and cares about human rights. For the implementation of human rights to be monitored in practice also, however, the Union must have clear rules regarding possible sanction mechanisms to be used against Member States. At present, the Council is talking about incorporating such mechanisms in Article 7. An agreement on procedures in itself is a good thing, but we must make sure that the system cannot be used as a political weapon. According to ancient Finnish wisdom, you should examine a person first before hitting him. At present I feel there is a danger that if the proposal by the Belgian Government on these sanction mechanisms were to be implemented, we would be hitting first and examining only afterwards. I hope that the sanction mechanisms will be discussed further before the summits at Biarritz and Nice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The drafting of a European Charter of Fundamental Rights is an important and necessary step towards a Europe which is close to the people.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people think that it is possible to create an internal market in Europe without agreeing on fundamental values and principles. The majority of the European Parliament has never supported this view. For example, with the directive on patenting biotechnological inventions – which was, of course, supposed to be primarily an internal market directive – we did not allow this directive to be adopted without fundamental ethical principles being enshrined in it, and without particular techniques which offend against human dignity being prohibited from patenting. Where modern genetic engineering is concerned, in particular, this was an important step towards establishing common values in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter is a further – certainly much more important – step. Many parts of the draft which we have before us are excellent. But the draft is worth improving precisely in respect of the protection of human dignity and the protection against its abuse by modern technologies. The wording is imprecise in some places, and I am particularly concerned that Article 3 of the draft Charter only prohibits the reproductive cloning of human beings. This can be interpreted as a step backwards compared with previous European legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the directive on patenting biotechnological inventions, the cloning of human beings is prohibited as a whole, Commissioner Prodi, because it offends common decency and law and order – so it is not only the patent that is prohibited; the technique is too. Commissioner Busquin very kindly assured me of this once again in a letter this week, and that is why it is dangerous for us now to be weaker in the Charter than in existing European Union legislation. This is not our delegation's fault; it is not Roman Herzog's fault: it is the fault of the governments of the Member States. That is why pressure needs to be exerted on them once again to introduce an improvement at this point in the text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Where does the added value of this Charter lie? Firstly, it lies in the fact that a basic set of fundamental rights has been distilled from more than 30 legal sources which are currently in force.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it lies in its transparency for the public, who now know what rights they have in respect of those who create and apply European law, and in its transparency for those who do precisely that, draft or apply European law. They too now have a clear idea of the rights which they have to respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Convention has not confined itself to restating old rights – even the Council of Europe has recognised this – but has identified new dangers in connection with old rights and included them in the text: in the areas of crime, biotechnology, data protection and administration.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter therefore guarantees a greater level of protection than the European Convention on Human Rights – this needs to be said to all those who are asserting the opposite here in the plenary – and it formulates political and social rights in a balanced way.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the first declaration of human rights of the new millennium and the most modern charter of human rights available anywhere in the world. It makes it clear to people that the European Union has always been a Community of values. Even so, the EU will have to do a great deal to keep it that way. Mr President-in-Office, I would ask you in all seriousness just to consider the following: if you now wish simply to go back to the Cologne Decision and reflect at your leisure on whether this should be incorporated into the Treaties, what encouragement will those who disregard human rights draw from the fact that we are hesitating to do this? What Mr Baron Crespo said is right: why waste time? All this is about, after all, is making law which is already in force more visible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I too would like to welcome Mr Prodi’s forceful and meaningful intervention. I have of course noted – and this is cause for great satisfaction – that the European Parliament is almost unanimously content with the Charter. This is not surprising because it has itself contributed to it, and because it is consonant with some of its values. That lends great weight to this text, and to the European Council as concerns furthering the Charter. I have noted your appeals and invitations to press ahead, to take advantage of the momentum generated and carry it to Nice and beyond. It is in this light that I will attempt to briefly reply to your interventions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi has spoken in favour of preserving the Community model, which met with great approval throughout this Chamber, and I would like, in my turn, to welcome this speech which will doubtless continue to be viewed as a major one. I agree with him on the need to maintain the institutional balance and enhance the role, in political terms, of both the Commission and the Council. I agree with him that the Commission must continue to play a pivotal role as guardian of the common interests of the Community. I agree with him on the need to guard against a return to intergovernmental methods, which some find appealing. However, without wanting to enter into a dialogue with him on a matter that will warrant further debate, I would also like to share with him some of the Council’s reactions.</p>
<p class="contents">We must bear in mind the Community as a whole. The originality of the institutional system resides precisely in the sharing of responsibilities, relying on procedures that are sometimes subtle, but which are, I feel, tried and tested ones. Would it not be worth defining the responsibilities at each level in the decision-making process more clearly, rather than seeking to proceed with a legal allocation of powers on the basis of a traditional federal model? Would we not then be closer to the model than the founding fathers intended?</p>
<p class="contents">A second observation. There are certain areas in which the sovereignty of the Member States could not be called into question without this conflicting with the spirit of European integration. On this issue I would like to indicate, if not my disagreement, then at least some slight differences in opinion on two points. The first concerns the common foreign and security policy, and the suggestion to integrate the High Representative for CFSP into the Commission. You will be aware that this was a deliberate decision taken in Amsterdam to clearly distinguish the two roles, with the High Representative, as opposed to the Commission, not speaking from a completely independent viewpoint, but under a remit to coordinate the common foreign and security policies that lie within the competence of the Member States, and there we should leave perhaps ample scope for an intergovernmental approach. CFSP, for reasons as much to do with history as with the nature of this area, will doubtless be the subject of coordination between Member States for some time to come. Perhaps one day we will have to abolish this function, but that day has not yet come. It is time, instead, to intensify this function.</p>
<p class="contents">The second slight difference concerns the euro. The recent fluctuations in this currency have revealed the need for a more political style of governance, of management. For all that, we should not, I feel, steer clear of strong intergovernmental cooperation, cooperation in respect of economic policies, when seeking solutions. As I see it, reasoning in terms of governance, there is a need for both the Council and the Commission to have a firm hand on the tiller and, in this case too, to ensure that the Community as a whole is catered for. That is why I believe it is very important for the Chairman of the Eurogroup – which we chose to set up – to continue to play a full role in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many of us who want a federation of nation states, which means that each state must find the position that best suits it. A variety of opinions only serves to improve the quality of the debate, and I believe that we have just heard a very important speech. I was pleased to hear, Mr Napolitano, that we agree on the fact that we must not go too quickly, or risk jeopardising the Charter. You suggest that the Charter could provide the springboard for a future constitution, and why not. But we must reach agreement on what to put in this constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">I am anxious to reassure Mr Poettering of my ability to chew gum while still listening carefully to what he has to say. He was quite right to emphasise the distance we have travelled since the fall of the wall and the reunification of Germany ten years ago. I hope now that democracy has gained a foothold in Serbia. He wanted the Presidency to outline the way forward at Nice. The presidency is, of course, aware that things will not come to a halt at Nice, that we must look to the future and handing over the baton. Once again, let us not take future debates as a pretext for not reaching – and this is not your suggestion – decisions that should be taken today within the IGC. It is clearly the aim of the Biarritz Council to contribute to these decisions, to prepare them.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barón Crespo emphasised that the Charter was a fine document and one to be proud of. Why then does he want to put it under glass? I believe that we must not forget, quite simply, that some Member States – it is not my job to name them – have already had to overcome considerable resistance and reluctance in getting this text accepted, which is why I am being, if not prudent, then at least patient, as I believe is necessary. As concerns the IGC, I do not fully share his point of view. I do not feel that we have reached a standstill, but rather that signs of a renewal are apparent. I moreover hope that these signs will be even more pronounced at Biarritz. As for the future, perhaps the method will indeed have to be reviewed, to comprise, perhaps, a convention rather than an IGC, even if it should perhaps not become a system.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lannoye welcomed the view that I expressed with regard to a European constitution. I do not know whether, as one of the speakers said, I am representative of my institution, and must say that this is my own personal opinion. To my mind, the majority of Member States do not wish to start work on a constitution for the time being. On the contrary, Evian showed that there was considerable resistance to doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wurtz regretted that the citizens were not taken into account more fully, that there has been no attempt to find a way of consulting them more extensively. I for my part believe that it is precisely for this reason that the Convention method is a good one and that ample use should again be made of it in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteurs have already stressed the quality of the debate and the need to progress further, and I can only agree with them.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now reply to Mr Méndez de Vigo. I am not a Christian Democrat, so I do not believe in miracles, but I do want to salute the European Parliament as such, because it has made a major contribution to this project. It has been no miracle, but the fruit of labour. Should one proclaim the Charter and see what happens, at the risk of it not being accepted throughout the Union as legally binding? Mr Méndez de Vigo has asked me which countries would oppose it. I repeat that I am not here to name names. It is not the task of the President-in-Office of the Council to look for scapegoats, but rather to seek consensus and compromise. I would thus like to tell him that we should perhaps wait until the Council has discussed this Charter, and then we will be able to see whether we can proceed further, and more quickly, with it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would respond in the same vein to Mrs Berès. She has said that the text of the Charter should not be altered one jot and that the Convention should have the final say on it. I would take a slightly different view, because the Convention should not be placed before any of the institutions. But I would indeed like to see the package remaining intact at Biarritz, because I genuinely fear that not doing so would spark damaging debates. She also made an extremely worthwhile suggestion concerning the link between the Charter and discussions over a future Article 7. I approve her suggestion, which I feel to be one that will enable us to progress, without going as far as incorporation, and to make a clear reference to the Charter. I will propose that we look into the idea of inserting such a reference, for example in Article 6. However, we still need, and I say this to the EP members of the Convention, to persuade the members of the European Council to do this, which will by no means be easy.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to reply in detail to the speakers, and moreover have no time to do so. I would simply like to emphasise that we do intend to be more receptive to associations’ expectations. One could indeed wish for more and for improvement, but I honestly believe that we have made a good start. The satisfaction that this Chamber has shown in the Draft Charter is a powerful indication that there has been transparency, an opening out, that the method is a promising one, and that we have also gone some way to meeting the aspirations of the citizens, which are reflected in the method.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Sudre voiced the concerns of our fellow citizens over the economic and social problems that have given rise to Euro-scepticism. That was not the subject under discussion today, but I must take the opportunity to remind her that, while it is true that the French Presidency has a major assignment to fulfil on the institutional front, it also has strong priorities in respect of the citizens. I would not want these priorities to be overshadowed by the institutional priorities. I could mention, for example, the social agenda which is a priority for us, or the setting in place of something that I would not call an economic government, but economic governance, to address these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by saying let there be no doubt but that the French Presidency intends to give the European Parliament all the attention it deserves, and that I will be in this Chamber on 24 October to report on Biarritz. I would add that we want to work in the complete transparency you desire, and to carry on with the regular exchanges that we have held with you since July. This would seem to me essential if we want Biarritz to be a successful European Council, which is to say one that paves the way, under respectable conditions, for success in Nice, for it is the Nice Council that will determine the shape and the success of what follows. That is why I invite you, in spite of everything, not to throw yourselves headlong into the future, as this is a future that should be built step by step, and stone by stone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In reply, I would say that, before making a speech, one must identify all the major factors at work, familiarise oneself with them and weigh them up, for political discourse must always be realistic, respond to the real weight of the forces at work and relate to the aims we all set ourselves. I delivered this speech today because I can see that the hazards which have combined in recent months to threaten Europe have aroused in us a common determination with the potential to produce tangible results in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In today’s debate, I associate myself with the words of all those who have spoken – Mr Moscovici, Mr Napolitano and the heads of Groups – on the importance of the Charter of Fundamental Rights: this is something innovative and, moreover, unhoped-for. However, we cannot stop here: in addition to making the solemn political proclamation of the Charter, we need to assume a clear position regarding its incorporation into the Treaty of the Union. But we must also ask ourselves: into which Treaty?</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, the Commission has proposed to start work on a clearer fundamental treaty, placing greater emphasis on citizens’ rights and defining the respective responsibilities of the Union and the Member States or, in the many cases where the responsibilities remain unchanged, to specify them more clearly. This is a feasible undertaking, and the University of Florence’s study would serve as an excellent basis from which to start work. I would stress that this undertaking is not only legally possible but also a political necessity.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that the Nice European Council will associate itself with this project and decide to launch it as a practical project rather than an accomplished fact once, of course, the reforms of which we are currently in need have been adopted. I do not want to go into the details of the reforms today for I want to talk principally about the method: the Community method, the institutional triangle, mutual boundaries of responsibility. I would also like to make it quite clear that I have not given up on the matter: I have provided a careful analysis of the powers at work. Only where proposals have been made have I mentioned them, and I have presented them simply as proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I have therefore defined not only the major role of the Commission but the roles of all the institutions and I have also stressed – and I reiterate this once again because it is even more important – the need to mobilise the people and their consciences. The document on the forms of government which we have prepared and will present to you provides for this need, for it is a way of mobilising both institutions and consciences and it is an extremely important task.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we will have to go to Nice and implement the programme which we have prepared. I repeat: we cannot be content with minimalist solutions. We fully support Mr Moscovici’s words: a minimalist Nice is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">After Nice, however, we are under an obligation to move resolutely on towards enlargement, establishing the timetable, defining benchmarking methods and setting goals, and in all this we must follow the Community method, which allows the peaceful coexistence of the different countries and different ways of thinking but also enables them to belong to our single European entity. We must work on closer cooperation and make it simpler and more effective in order to bring this about: closer cooperation is the immediate, simplest way forward if we are to take that additional step towards integration, the need for which has been confirmed by the many powerful speeches which I have heard today.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like us to use closer cooperation to generate fresh potential for Europe.<span class="bold"> </span>If this is what we all want, we must be ruthless in combating any trend towards the fragmentation of responsibilities or decision making. This does not mean that everything has to happen at once. I have been coherent and firm in my intentions but also realistic, outlining the stages of what can be achieved today and what must wait until tomorrow. In saying this, Mr Moscovici, I have no intention of giving the Community total control. I have a very strong sense of subsidiarity which is deeply rooted in my own life, and I shall respect it unfailingly. Even when I outlined the changes which are necessary, for the future of course, including the CFSP issue which you have mentioned this morning, I specified that change must take place within the framework of a specific Statute and described a way in which we might in time achieve this goal. I was certainly not for a moment advocating that we violate existing legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I also specified clearly that, as things stand at the moment, we can achieve extremely important objectives through the Community method as it is today, for example, to improve our action in the Balkans. I feel that it is a matter for our consciences to consider how great and yet how fragmented our undertaking is in the Balkans, and the sparsity of the results of the first stage of this undertaking at least, due to our fragmentation. Another example, as I have said, is the energy policy: how great is our desire and how great is the need for a common energy policy, especially now that, in place of the national oil companies, we have a genuine market which must be managed within the context of coordination of the market as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I have given you some realistic, genuine examples and outlined a way forward, avoiding utopian aspirations. Everything I have said has been relevant and realistic.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent months, the view that neither Parliament nor the Commission has democratic legitimacy has been voiced all too often. I say to you now that, from now on, I will not permit such talk ever, ever again.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Parliament and the Commission have been far too patient in this regard: Parliament in that you are legitimately elected by the European people and the Commission in that we have dual legitimation, legitimation by the people through Parliament and the trust you place in us and legitimation by the Member States through the Council. These are the bases of our power and legitimacy.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for your kind attention. I would just like to end, if I may, on a lighter note. I have been reading the sports pages recently, conscious that subsidiarity applies in full to sport. I certainly do not want to go overboard on this point, but I was pleased to note that in the Sydney Olympics, the first dope-free Olympics – I am informed – and therefore Olympics which we can define in the spirit of De Coubertin, the 15 countries of the Union won 239 medals and the United States of America only 97. If we were then to make a similar comparison between the 12 countries of the euro and the dollar area, the result would be an overwhelming victory. I would like to thank the athletes for their performance, which would appear to be a good omen for the future of us all.</p>
