<p class="contents">With today’s decision on the shape of the new financial perspective now behind us, we must now look ahead and formulate the broad strategy for implementation in the coming years, whatever its imperfections in terms of balance or level of expenditure allocated. From the outset it is noticeable that the annual policy strategy treats the budget year of 2007 as one of a continuing series in the life of the Commission to implement the well-established priorities of prosperity, solidarity, security and Europe as a global partner. We take a different view. We do not believe that it is business as usual. On the contrary, we see the 2007 budget as being a real opportunity to set a new strategic tone to the way in which the European Union delivers its policy agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">When reading the document, there is a strong sense of complacency, Madam Commissioner, a real lack of urgency about how to tackle the global economic political challenges facing the European Union. Not least, there is no specific mention of the rapid rise of China and India in the global economy. This will undoubtedly affect substantially both internal as well as external policies in the year ahead. If, after all, strategies formulated at regional and local level, such as in the Thames Valley, include this factor as an urgent priority, why does the Commission choose to leave it out?</p>
<p class="contents">In sum, it reads rather like a routine bureaucratic document without serious political leadership or guidance. Running through the report are three interlinked strands.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the combined impact of reduced resources under the new financial perspective, and the emergence of new challenges leaves us no option but to set clear priorities in the next budget. These priorities must be focused to reflect the new challenges lying ahead. This is more a process during the life of the financial perspectives than simply in the 2007 budget. In setting policy priorities for external relations, the 2007 budget must lay the groundwork for an increasingly outward-looking European Union. Our citizens’ security and prosperity will depend on how effectively the Union can respond to global challenges in a world very different from that only a decade ago. We should aim in fact to lead, rather than harness, the globalisation process. In these circumstances it is essential for the Union to develop a coherent, over-arching strategy which will better define its strategic priorities in the 21st century for the world outside, and that must begin with this budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, interlinked with the first priority, is that of ensuring security for European citizens in areas such as freedom and security and justice, as well as the specific sector of energy supply that we have just been discussing.</p>
<p class="contents">No less important for us is the third priority, dealing with internal policies. Here we must focus on those areas that are key to Europe’s competitiveness and our future prosperity. These include research and innovation, innovative measures for SMEs, support for lifelong learning for renewing skills and key infrastructure projects.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of limitations on the Union’s financial resources, we must examine more closely the quality of European Union expenditure. The beginning of a new financial perspective offers a significant opportunity for starting a rolling programme for assessing the performance of EU activities. Through cost-benefit analyses we will take steps to assess whether specific actions achieve their objectives, what their impact was compared to the quantity of expenditure allocated, and what European added value they contributed.</p>
<p class="contents">We are convinced that such a focus on quality is essential in order to compensate for a lack of quantity in budgetary means. This would mean deleting programmes if they no longer produce value for money and creating programmes that are more relevant to a changing global environment. It should also mean avoiding the use of public funds, for example in information policy, where EU-financed actions could replace viable, ongoing private initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that Parliament must take the initiative to begin preparations for the mid-term review of the next multiannual financial framework planned for 2008. This will allow us to drive forward the comprehensive reassessment of the EU’s revenue and expenditure and shake up the system in order to create momentum for adapting our political priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the 2007 budget procedure, as the first budget of the new financial perspective, represents a real opportunity for a broad mobilisation to adjust to the new policy challenges of a fast-changing world. This fits in, Madam Commissioner, with the Commission’s focus on policy by results, but a broader global vision is needed. Let us be open to new ideas and provide a strong focus on policy priorities, while improving the EU’s accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I will warmly welcome contributions from the outset from all parliamentary committees to establish the sectoral priorities for this budget. I believe we have a great opportunity to shape our future policies together and respond effectively to the demands of European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today we are starting a process in which we will be engaged seriously in preparation for the first year of this financial perspective, a symbolically important year.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report on the APS, policy priorities have been set and we think that the core goals and priorities of the Commission’s five-year strategic objectives are reflected in the 2007 budget proposal. On prosperity, growth and employment, about 43% of our preliminary draft budget is to be devoted to the Lisbon Strategy through Headings 1a and 1b.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also committed towards close cooperation with the EIB on new financial instruments to increase the leverage effect of the EU budget for Lisbon-related priorities, including trans-European networks and support to SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">On solidarity, security and freedom, which are important priorities mentioned in the APS, we have already included EUR 291 million for solidarity and management of migration, including the External Borders Fund and the Fund for Integration of Third Country Nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposes a 17% increase for environmental policies, including the extension of the Emissions Trading Scheme to the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">On external relations, we agree that Europe, as a world partner, needs to support this area financially. The key action for 2007 is the start-up of new programmes, such as the Instrument for Pre-Accession and the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument. We must also continue to strengthen relations with our partners in the developed world.</p>
<p class="contents">On EU governance and human and financial resources for 2007, I should like to point out that we have already requested 610 new posts in relation to the last enlargement, and 230 to prepare for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria. The Commission proposes the redeployment of about 600 staff between its DGs to serve priorities other than enlargement-related needs.</p>
<p class="contents">On value for money, I am fully in favour of a wider, more macroeconomic approach towards the assessment of how European financial resources are used. I am satisfied that the new part III of the IIA on sound financial management is, and will be, effectively and fully implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">I have proposed the introduction of an early warning system to ensure more accurate forecasts and close monitoring of budget implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">We will listen very carefully and take into account all your opinions expressed today and in the future. We are always ready to cooperate with you and the Council in an open-minded manner, and we hope to have a very good result: a favourable budget by the end of this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, the Commission is seeking to amalgamate various budget lines. If it succeeds, it will no longer be possible for this Parliament to take decisions on how much is allocated to important sectors such as combating HIV/AIDS. Parliament should not allow its powers to be curtailed in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission’s APS document does not refer at all to the Millennium Development Goals or sectors important for poverty reduction, particularly education and poverty diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, I have to insist that the ‘simplification’ of the legislative context for external action for the period from 2007 to 2013 must not result in a loss of transparency in the use of development policy resources and that the breakdown between budget lines for geographical regions and thematic sectors for the 2007 budget must allow for at least the same level of visibility as the 2006 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, let me mention the importance of the Commission monitoring the Member States and their official development assistance levels, because of the problem of some Member States overstating ODA levels by taking into account funds that are not actually part of ODA. Linked to the ODA level is aid effectiveness and quality. The Commission must continue to implement the Paris Agenda on aid effectiveness and show the public that EU development aid makes a difference.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to underline the need always to put the fight against poverty at the top of the EU agenda and, therefore, the need to strive for a substantial share of aid to go to the LDCs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore vital, as the Commission rightly says, that these resources are clearly targeted at our priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on International Trade fully supports the Commission’s efforts to improve policy coherence between the Community’s external and internal policies. In our opinion, all new policy initiatives regarding the internal market should be carefully assessed in the light of their external impact.</p>
<p class="contents">The International Trade Committee supports the rapporteur in calling for the Commission to target resources at the new global challenges we face, particularly the rise of India and China. It wishes to emphasise the contribution that a successful Doha Round could make to freeing up resources. Firstly, the elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidy by 2013 would bring significant budgetary savings. Secondly, a successful round would lead to growth of the European Union economy as a whole and therefore help the EU budget grow.</p>
<p class="contents">A key component in making a success of the Doha Round is to persuade the developing countries to sign up for Doha. In this respect, the EU has recognised that for them to get something out of Doha, they need to be linked into the world trading system. At the G8 Summit last July, President Barroso promised EUR 1 billion a year in trade-related assistance. If this is not delivered, the cynicism displayed by the developing countries at WTO talks will simply grow.</p>
<p class="contents">The International Trade Committee believes that this cannot just be a cosmetic re-labelling of existing aid. It has to be genuinely new money. We would like to suggest both to the rapporteur, in terms of the conclusions the committee draws from this report, and to the Commission, that the latter should report to us annually on how it is spending the EUR 1 billion that Mr Barroso promised on trade-related assistance, so that we can see that being delivered on a transparent basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the experience of this parliamentary term tells us that while procedures may be repeated, there is no such thing as a budget that may be repeated in its entirety, so there is no budgetary routine, as each of the budgets we have had up until now has had its specific characteristics. 2005 was the first year in an enlarged Europe, the 2006 budget was a bridge between the old and the new financial perspective, while 2007 and the 2007 budget will be the launch of a new generation of multiannual programmes, and that is the real characteristic of the 2007 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Our rapporteur, Mr Elles, presented the priorities and gained the support of the majority of the Committee on Budgets for these priorities. Knowing his powers of persuasion, he will obtain a parliamentary majority. However, the real context for the debate on budget strategy for 2007 is no longer the Commission guidelines on strategy, but the figures presented for 2007 by the Commission, as they are clearly influenced by this new generation of programmes – as can very easily be seen in chapter 1a, in chapter 3a and in the chapter on foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that an effective launch for the new generation of multiannual programmes is one of the basic ways of measuring the success of the 2007 budget, while respecting the priorities presented to us by Mr Elles. If we can launch the programmes well, we can return to the annual routine, which will once again turn out to be not so routine after all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since this morning, we have, then, been aware of Parliament’s need to remain modest, and even humble, with regard to the proposals it may allow itself to put forward. Even if this framework is in itself new, there will also, I hope, be another new feature, namely that this will be a budget for 27 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As coordinator for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I am keen to champion respect for the commitments we have made to Europeans. With regard to our priorities, these will remain, in the first place, the internal policies that are to support the Lisbon Objectives, not forgetting the environment and rural development. Only in this way will a balanced approach to territorial planning be guaranteed. The promotion of sustainable growth and job creation in the EU implies not only that the Member States will properly implement legislation, both that in force and that proposed, but also that we will propose more ambitious objectives in these areas. 2007 will also have to be the year in which our policy for communicating with our citizens is overhauled.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, I would urge a balanced approach to administering the EU’s external borders, as we cannot be content with a unilateral, security-based approach. Policies linked to immigration must be counterbalanced by the integration of third-country nationals and by solidarity in administering borders. Let us not forget that security is also about protecting individual freedoms. We therefore need to develop policies in favour of refugees. Where external policy is concerned, our watchwords are not only development, democratisation and human rights but also respect for the Millennium Goals, which constitute an absolute priority. The EU must provide itself with the appropriate tools to enable it to make its presence felt on the international stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would take the liberty of coming out in favour of co-funding by the European Investment Bank of programmes crucial to giving practical expression to the Lisbon and Gothenburg Strategies. These would be constructive arrangements. I wish, however, to point out the need to guarantee public funding on a scale large enough to create the leverage conditions expected by the EIB. Loan guarantees and other such measures are in no position to replace the new money that only the EU can guarantee.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to tell you, Commissioner, that I read with great interest that the Commission was banking on an acceleration of European growth in 2006. This means high growth, since a 2.6% increase is anticipated. Your communiqués state that Europe would be in a position to create 3.6 million jobs. Apart from the fact that these forecasts remain less than completely reliable, particularly in view of the fluctuation that is a predominant feature of the oil markets, do you think that this growth is sufficient to provide Europe with the financial resources necessary to its development?</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I wish Mr Elles good luck. He must, in turn, try to inject some ambition into this budget. I think, however, that, with such a rigid and narrow budgetary framework, it will be difficult for him to find the resources for the ambitious policy expected by Europeans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It clearly sets out those priorities that Parliament has identified and advocated in the negotiations on the financial framework. My group wishes to stress in particular the importance of unhindered traffic in the workings of the internal market, and for that reason it has tabled two amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s greatest challenge is reducing unemployment. That is why programmes which promote growth and employment are very important. These are, in particular, the Seventh Framework Programme, which concerns research and development, and the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme for small and medium-sized enterprises. They should be quickly brought to completion.</p>
<p class="contents">Structural and cohesion policy will be among the major challenges facing the EU in the forthcoming programming period. Considerable sums have been set aside for these in the financial framework, especially for the new Member States. It is important that these funds are used. That is why the programmes must be made ready quickly and efficiently. Ideally, they should be adopted some time this year, but in any case no later than next year, otherwise the funds that have been granted will remain unspent, as they were in the first few years of the Agenda 2000 programming period. That delayed the implementation of projects and at the same time caused a considerable backlog of outstanding commitments, which has still not been cleared.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament needs to prepare for the mid-term review of the multiannual financial framework and the agricultural reform in good time. In this connection, the subject of compulsory cofinancing of direct agricultural aid must be clearly raised. That would reduce the EU’s budgetary expenditure, even out the differences in the Member States’ net contributions, increase Member States’ responsibility for spending funds and do more to safeguard the livelihood of farmers within the context of the current ceiling for expenditure. Our group supports this. With these observations we are prepared to give the report our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is no criticism of him to say that the value of the exercise to which we are devoting ourselves this evening is, however, fairly limited, indeed very limited, particularly by the outcome of the vote taken by our Parliament this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">Since Parliament had stated that the amount of the financial perspective had to be increased considerably and since its idea was to obtain a three-figure extension, I, for my part, was hoping for at least a two-figure extension. Instead, we voted this morning in favour of a small, one-figure, extension: EUR 2 billion plus EUR 2 billion. All future policy initiatives will therefore see their margins for manoeuvre severely limited, to the point of being almost non-existent. Thus, our rapporteur states, in his first paragraph, that the 2007-2013 financial perspective is backward-looking and therefore poorly placed to respond effectively to the challenges concerned. He also points out, in paragraph 2, that the Annual Policy Strategy does not reflect the urgency with which such challenges should be addressed. I rest my case.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, my group is obviously trying to define a few priorities. The first, which is along the lines of the rapporteur’s own thinking, is about achieving maximum impact. When you do not have much money, you have to make good use of such money as you do have. Some serious studies therefore need to be carried out on the cost-efficiency ratio, particularly in relation to the Lisbon and Gothenburg Strategies. There is a tendency to forget that these strategies are not only about competitiveness but also about the social and employment dimensions. In the view of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, it is a good thing to invest in sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">The second priority concerns the rendezvous clause. Mrs Grybauskaitė, we believe - or, rather, we still try to believe - in the rendezvous clause, which we also voted in favour of this morning. Thanks to this clause, we shall be able perhaps finally to show new margins, particularly where agriculture is concerned. All the same, I am sorry that our friends from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have decided to delete the passage on aid that might be given to agriculture, possibly at national level. This morning, we left a few doors open with the help of the rendezvous clause. This evening, we see that these doors are very narrow, in spite of the high-quality work done by our fellow Member. Please, let us leave them as they are. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The main reason was that the low level of appropriations did not reflect the needs that our group saw as vital to developing positive European programmes. The new financial frameworks are thought to be backward-looking in Mr Elles’ report too. We want to see more cohesion, more science and research, more concern for the environment, and more social welfare.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group, however, does not feel any need to militarise the EU’s Foreign and Security Policy. Militarisation was one of the Council’s main areas of focus in the new financial frameworks and the Council also secured financing for it in the new Interinstitutional Agreement with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the EU Constitutional Treaty was rejected, the Commission and the Council may start to develop a common foreign affairs administration for the Union. That would mean an increase in the powers of the Union at the expense of the Member States. Sovereignty in foreign policy is one of the main hallmarks of an independent state.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the Lisbon Objectives, our group has condemned their limited scope regarding social welfare. They only address the needs of companies, and not the needs of their employees. The Commission’s proposal for a special Globalisation Fund is a disappointment, in that a condition of Community aid is mass lay-offs, where at least 1 000 workers lose their jobs. Neither does our group support the Commission’s approach known as the information policy. The Union’s institutions are using money for the dissemination of information for propaganda, instead of looking in the mirror and trying to find out what the problem is when the public criticises the Union. There will be nothing wrong with the mirror, either.</p>
<p class="contents">We must set about preparing to draft and implement the multiannual programmes fast; otherwise the year 2007 will see a dramatic underutilisation of many appropriations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Is anyone against any of this? No. Yet the problem with the report is this – it fails to take a view on the question of at what level these important questions ought to be dealt with. Should this be at EU level or at national level? It fails to take a view on how the regulatory system should be changed in order to push forward this improved economy and it fails to take a view on what it is that is to be done away with or cut back in order to make it possible to prioritise other things.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me put forward some suggestions. A very large part of what is proposed for the stimulation of growth in order to meet the requirements of globalisation in terms of adaptation and the like consists of matters that are best tackled by the Member States themselves, in worthy competition with each other to find solutions that work. This applies to almost the entire Lisbon Agenda, the small businesses policy and research activity. It is difficult to come up with any reasons to regulate these matters at EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">Things that do constitute important tasks to be performed at EU level are, for example, regulating the trading of emissions rights for carbon dioxide. The EU leads the world in this area, and it would be a disaster if this system, into which Russia and Japan are due to enter in a couple of years’ time, were to collapse over time. The trading of emissions rights must now be restructured. One important step could be for the governments of the Member States to be able to sell emissions right to companies at auction. What is more, emissions rights must be extended to cover greater areas of the economy and more and more countries. This is an essential task for the European Union, and one of a global character.</p>
<p class="contents">We speak all the time of the principle of subsidiarity, but when things get serious this principle is nowhere to be seen. According to the report, nearly every problem is something for the EU to get to grips with. Regulatory systems in need of amendment are, amongst others, those relating to agricultural policy. In this area we need to steer development in the direction of renationalising the costs of gradually creating political opportunities to carry out a liberalisation of the whole system.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must discuss in detail what needs to be done away with or cut back so that other things may be prioritised. We must earnestly begin to analyse and discuss which of the EU institutions should be abolished. We should, for example, put an end to the European Economic and Social Committee and to the Committee of the Regions. These two institutions have outlived their purpose. We must at last reach the point where we make Brussels the seat of the European Parliament and allow the building in which we now find ourselves to become the seat of an EU University, for example. This would be extremely advantageous not only for Parliament but also for the city of Strasbourg. It would mean that the city’s service providers – hotels, restaurants, taxis and the like – could be steadily busy over time and through the year rather than being overloaded for a few days a month and facing underoccupancy the rest of the time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It appears that many principled approaches were taken in the approval process for the 2007 budget proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">On 3 May the European Commission adopted a provisional Budget for 2007. In doing so it took the first step towards establishing a budget for the first year of a seven-year period, but I hope that it will not be as painful each time over the years 2007 to 2013. If the Commissioner regards the proposed budget as a minimalist budget, I will have to agree with her. On the other hand, it is hard to see that this budget will make a fundamental contribution to supporting European competitiveness. It is rather a conventional budget.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true, however, that the compromise we have achieved on the budgetary ceiling for the 2007-2013 financial framework will not leave the Commission much room for manoeuvre. This can be seen by the data on the overall increase in payments compared with 2006. The overall 3.9% growth in payments actually seems quite moderate. If we take into account anticipated inflation of 2% in 2007, this leaves a mere 1.9% more in the real funding for the needs of European policy in that year. And this at a time when 30 million Bulgarians and Romanians will be joining the European Union in January 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been changes in the structure of the budget that I regard as positive. Expenditure on natural resources and agriculture will only increase by 1.2%, while funds earmarked for competitiveness and the cohesion policy for growth and employment will grow by more than 12%. However, the effective use of this funding will be a key issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Knowledge transfer within the economy should be supported with further cash earmarked for programmes on competitiveness and innovation, the development of trans-European networks and lifelong learning. A new element is the globalisation fund of EUR 500 million to help workers made redundant as a result of industrial restructuring. However, the effective use of this funding will again be an issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We can continue to debate questions to do with adding a little bit here and taking away a little bit there. With its proposal the Commission has set a fairly strict, but not unrealistic level. It will be difficult for the European Council to lower this budgetary hurdle, and for the European Parliament to raise it. The budgetary compromise for 2007 should therefore remain very close to these levels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, once again we have the preliminary draft budget a few days before Mr Jensen presents his report on the annual strategic priorities in plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, we are getting quicker and possibly, before this term in office comes to an end, we will manage to hold this debate on the annual strategic priorities at the same time that the Commission is drawing up its preliminary draft budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would like to say that we fully support the rapporteur, Mr Elles, both now and during the complicated times ahead when we really have to squeeze the financial perspective that we have approved as far as possible – this very backward looking financial perspective, as the rapporteur himself has said, and I agree with him – because much remains to be seen.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council must demonstrate that it believes in its own commitments: firstly, it should be attending this debate – though I see that it has not had time to remain; secondly, the Commission must be capable of convincing a very wary Parliament that it is going to be able to maintain an acceptable level of spending in order to maintain and fund the Community’s programmes; and thirdly, it is also going to be necessary for Parliament to be very vigilant in terms of the quality of spending and the Council’s attitude to the size of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope that this budget, in relation to which the rapporteur proposes some very interesting things and which is the first of the seven budgets of this financial perspective, is modified and that some progress can be made on issues of budgetary procedure, for example, at the first conciliation and, in particular, Mr President, on the prioritisation of Community programmes by parliamentary committees. There are fewer resources and each committee is therefore going to have to face its own responsibilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to highlight three areas. Speaking as rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, firstly, I would like to say that I support the rapporteur in urging the Commission and Member States to focus on areas that are the bases of healthy and thriving modern economies: research and development, innovation, knowledge, skills, telecommunications and energy. Effective investment in those areas pays excellent dividends in the long run. The EU cannot be short-sighted and still compete globally and reverse the brain-drain leading to slower economic growth than might otherwise be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I also back the rapporteur when he calls for Member States to implement existing and proposed legislation to help complete the single market. The Lisbon Strategy has not been sufficiently prioritised, despite the fact that it seeks improvement in areas where citizens want progress, like creating growth in jobs. As President Barroso told this House in his first address in July 2004, we must show our citizens that Europe can deliver what it promises.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, speaking as a member of the Committee on Budgets, I have to say that I disagree with the emphasis the rapporteur has placed on our strategic partnership with the United States. I believe the EU must build solid and constructive relations with all global players to an equal extent, especially since a very disappointing cut in funding in Heading 4 has been proposed by the Commissioner in the PDB. That means that our traditional priorities and commitments are being reduced. As well as that, there will be no extra money for new agreements that we have entered into, including an increasingly important strategic partnership with India.</p>
<p class="contents">Since resources are scarce, I ask the Commission to make sure that no money is wasted. So can the Commission guarantee that the appropriate measures and mechanisms are being put in place, as Mr Virrankoski highlighted, to ensure effective implementation and full take-up? We do not want to return millions of euros to the Member States at the end of the year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Jensen (ALDE). – </span></span>  <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Elles, for his visionary proposal regarding the work on the 2007 budget. It is visionary because he thinks several years ahead, because importance is attached to complying with the new framework for external policy and because focus is placed on that part of the budget designed to secure economic growth and strengthen the EU’s global competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly draw attention to the new cost-benefit thinking in the budget whereby, year by year, we are to assess the value of the individual programmes in relation to their costs. The information we gather in that way will, of course, form part of an evaluation and mid-term review of the multi-annual budgetary framework for 2008-2009. Now is the time for us to prepare the ground for reconfiguring the budgetary framework so that its focus is on new needs and no longer on things that do not work properly. Efficiency and a certain ‘quid pro quo’ must be the watchwords for the EU budget. All of this work must take place in close cooperation with the specialist committees. We shall thus be further developing the ever closer cooperation of recent years with the specialist committees in developing the annual budget.</p>
<p class="contents">In the foreign policy area we must now comply with the new sets of rules whereby Parliament is involved in developing strategic frameworks and thus obtains a basis for monitoring the policy conducted. We shall thus be able to see whether we are achieving the goals laid down by means of the budget. The method of working to be used in this connection must, of course, be developed, and it is important that the work get off to a good start. The new budgetary framework means that there will be respectable growth in that part of the budget that goes on research, innovation, education and transport. I should like, however, to emphasise that the appropriations for investment in transport are not at all in keeping with the Member States’ own ambitions for the trans-European networks. The Commission has pulled out all the stops to ensure far better implementation of the projects, and now the Council must show that it intends to comply with its own decisions. It is the Member States that are responsible for coming up with the funding if they do not wish to pay via the budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The new programmes have a potential that can only be properly harnessed by improving procedures. It is important to everyone concerned, particularly programme users, that the legislative process relating to the Financial Regulation, its implementing regulation and the multi-annual programmes now be concluded as quickly as possible, to enable prompt handling by the Commissioner’s staff. We are eagerly awaiting the transmission of the revised Commission proposal on the reform of the Financial Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">When our draft was adopted, the Commission promised to incorporate a large number of our amendments. At that time, in a roll-call vote resulting in a majority hardly ever achieved in this House, Parliament placed particular emphasis on important points. Faster, leaner, more efficient – those were the points we made with regard to the procedures, to enable profitable, value-added investment of European funds. It is also particularly important to us that Parliament’s rights be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall examine the revised Commission draft, which is on our agenda for tomorrow, accordingly; but in order to carry out a thorough analysis we need to see the full picture – not just the outline, but also the shading. Parliament needs to know what points the Commission and the Council want to see incorporated into the implementing regulations if we are to see the extent to which our opinion has been implemented – in both documents, that is.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to assure the Commissioner that the best efforts from all our quarters will go into ensuring that the proposal is adopted promptly in this House. I would ask the Commission to now present the complete works, comprising Financial Regulation and implementing regulation, as quickly as possible, to enable us to start the new programmes with the new procedures in time for the new programming period.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also appeal to the Council to maintain its constructive cooperation, so that Europe, and its citizens, Member States and institutions, are able to achieve better and, above all, cheaper administration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Congratulations! </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, as a member of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for the 2007 budget, I should like, at the very outset, to say how delighted I am to see that the dimension of security, both internal and external, for the European Union features prominently among the limited number of political priorities retained by our general rapporteur, Mr Elles, for the 2007 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, no one can deny that the prevention of, and fight against, terrorism, together with improvements to the way in which external borders are administered and the closing of illegal immigration channels are real and serious issues of critical importance, requiring appropriate policies and adequate resources. Nor can anyone deny that these are areas in which integrated action at European level indisputably adds value to the efforts of Member States otherwise acting in isolation. Nor, finally, can anyone deny that these are problems that, quite legitimately, are of very great concern to EU citizens, as shown by all the polls and surveys. Moreover, Europeans find it not only natural but also necessary for these problems to be dealt with at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, in order to bring Europe closer to its citizens, there is probably a need for far fewer woolly discussions and brochures containing propaganda and a need, instead, for many more policies and measures that respond effectively to the problems actually experienced by people and felt by them to be important and matters of priority. Internal security is one of these areas. The 2007 budget will give us the opportunity to make a start on no longer disappointing people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission could not solve the impossible, and within this framework, the European Union will not be able to achieve a breakthrough in the areas of competitiveness, research or innovation, which had actually been marked as priorities by the Council and the Commission themselves. The annual political strategy of the Commission does not promote an economic reform able to meet challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems that the competition imposed on the world and Europe by the emerging Asian economies is ignored. Acting together, Member States may be able to meet these global challenges, but if they are on their own, it is certain that they will lose out in the expected processes.</p>

The enlargement of the Union by another two countries, the ongoing process of ratifying the Constitutional Treaty and, most of all, the start of implementation of the new financial perspective must be supported by effective implementation of European Union policies in such a way as to meet global challenges and the expectations of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Setting out priorities for the coming year is, in view of all this, strategically important for each of the seven years covered by the new financial perspective. That is why it is surprising and worrying that there are already visible discrepancies between the global challenges which the Community faces and the measures that are supposed to ensure an increase in the competitiveness of its economy. Furthermore, when identifying the challenges, the European Commission seems to have failed to notice the dynamic changes occurring in the global economy, especially in the fastest developing markets such as the Chinese or Indian markets. In terms of internal policy, and according to the Lisbon Strategy, the Commission should, at a Community level as well as at a national level, unequivocally support elements of a modern economy such as scientific research, innovation and information society technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of increasingly fierce global competition it is also vital to formulate a strategy that enables employers and workers to adapt to the changes taking place. In this respect the Globalisation Fund being discussed today may be a first step in the right direction, and the EU budget revision scheduled for 2008 will be a real instrument for adapting multiannual financial plans to a rapidly developing world.

The Annual Policy Strategy for the 2007 budget will be decisive in shaping the further positive development of Europe. The support for the two internal policies – the Lisbon objectives and rural policy – seems to me to be particularly worth mentioning in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of demographic developments and globalisation, it makes perfect sense to pay greater attention to our reformed agricultural policy and our rural policy. In this case, in particular, the Lisbon objectives can and must be used to solve current problems such as unemployment and economic stagnation. The common agricultural policy, the EU’s only communitarised policy, has been constantly subjected to reform in recent decades compared with other policy fields. Agricultural policy-makers and farmers have repeatedly proved their willingness to make sacrifices and accept change for the sake of a European community.</p>
<p class="contents">Players in European agriculture have demonstrated that they are amenable to reform. It is now time to honour this. Sustainable agriculture, our European model, needs planning security, and establishing the budget until 2013 – that is to say, for the next seven years – has given it just that. It must also be beyond doubt, however, that, as decided in the course of CAP reform, the budgetary resources will apply until 2013 without cutbacks.</p>
<p class="contents">We have carried through the reforms, and now we farmers have reached our pain threshold. This is as far as we will go. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the indications are that, in 2007, the budgetary estimates should enable us to continue with our current policies, while at the same time launching the new generation of European programmes, relating in particular to regional policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that, alongside the new financial perspective, new programmes aimed at regional development will be implemented, and we are gradually going to have to familiarise ourselves with these.</p>
<p class="contents">We go on repeating that cohesion policy is essential to Europe’s overall dynamism. It must enable the regions, diverse as they are, to complete their transformation and to prepare for the future in the best conditions and, in that way, to achieve an optimum level of development. What is more, Europe’s regions occupy a central place in the Lisbon Strategy, and the new structural policy will always have to be in a position to strengthen economic and social cohesion and to reduce the gap between the levels of development of, on the one hand, the new Member States and, on the other, the old ones.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in order to achieve these objectives that it must be provided with the appropriate financial resources. It is therefore important, as emphasised by Mr Elles in his report, to make sure throughout the budgetary procedure that the funds appropriated to this policy are commensurate with the challenges to be met.</p>
<p class="contents">In preparing the draft budget for 2007, we shall therefore make sure that these priorities are respected and that adequate resources are allocated to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the amount of the preliminary draft budget, with payment appropriations which do not exceed 0.99%, unfortunately reflects the glaring inconsistency between the challenges in the sector of research, innovation and competitiveness and the narrow margins allowed by the budget. Nonetheless, development and employment must be our main objective, the main contribution to the achievement of which must be the Lisbon Strategy, with policies which need to act complementarily and be adapted to the new dynamic environment which is the consequence of globalisation and interdependent economies.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the Elles proposals on ensuring the qualitative value of every last euro, especially in view of the new nature of the challenges, which we have met so far calmly and without vision. I refer to the challenge of emerging economic behemoths, especially China and India. However, the relaxed and 'flabby' stand being adopted by the Commission in the preliminary draft exacerbates our concerns about the reduction in the level of interventions. The restrictive framework illustrates our inability to combine objectives and financing possibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, Commissioner, 0.99% in payments for 2007 raises once again the tragedy of narrow margins for the realisation of our European vision. I wonder if the next Presidency will, at long last, have the power to surmount and join us in our efforts to overcome this perpetual European financial Calvary. I hope so, but I also doubt it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report, because it is a hard-hitting document that gets its priorities right. What is more important, though – and I am, this evening, primarily speaking as shadow rapporteur for the agricultural budget on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – is that this report is like a warm bath for European farmers and horticulturalists compared to what the British Labour Government gave them during its presidency. I should like to congratulate Mr Elles on this.</p>
<p class="contents">As for agriculture and horticulture, it is all hands on deck, for the Council’s easy way-out, allowing countries to transfer, on a voluntary basis, 20% of the premiums to rural development, could well prove to be a stab in the back for hard-working farmers and horticulturalists. Not that I am opposed to rural policy, but given the voluntary nature of this proposal, there is the real risk that farmers from the different Member States will be faced with a playing field that is anything but level, which will have an effect on the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the possible voluntary transfer of 20% of the premiums will probably, due to the financial emergency brake applied during the interim review, represent yet another attack. After all, pledges to candidate countries Romania and Bulgaria may eventually result in yet another 15% in reductions for agriculture and horticulture in the old Member States. In that way, Europe is at risk of losing control over the common agricultural policy, for a 35% reduction in the level of premiums will consign the common market firmly to the history books. As guardians of the common market, Parliament and the Commission will need to pull out all the stops in order to avoid this.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I am also shocked at former Commissioner Bolkestein’s remarks, because as Commissioner for the Internal Market, he recently rejected once again the Prodi Commission’s agricultural reforms and their funding, which he had originally approved, adding that agricultural policy should be abolished. I urge the present Commissioner for the Budget to be wary of the common market and to prevent European agricultural funds and European agricultural policy from being eroded still further, for let us be honest: Europe’s export refunds have been pared down by 80%, 60% of agricultural export to developing countries is already being channelled to the EU, and we have an agreement with the world’s 48 poorest countries. I do not know another continent that has done more for liberalisation of agricultural policy than Europe, and we have done quite enough. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
