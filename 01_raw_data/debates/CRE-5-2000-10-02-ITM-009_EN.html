<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hatzidakis (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, this is a highly technical subject, aspects of which affect the daily life of European citizens, not to mention the single market itself.</p>
<p class="contents">In the current situation, the legal limits for the maximum authorised length of passenger vehicles are very different in the EU Member States. In 7 countries, the limit is 12 metres, in one country it is 13.7 metres, in two other countries it is 14.5 metres and in 5 others, it is 15 metres. This legal limit has not explicitly been harmonised at a European level since it was not included in Directive 96/53. Up to now, only 12-metre buses can circulate freely in the whole EU territory. On a request from the Council of Ministers, the Commission has worked on a proposal to include passenger vehicles in Directive 96/53, not only in order to harmonise the length of rigid buses but also to create a clearer situation regarding removable attachments on buses and trailers. This work resulted in the present proposal. I should point out that, even in countries in which 15-metre buses are officially allowed, in practice they are refused entry or are sent back at the border. In this sense, we can say that this proposal is an attempt to resolve the problem by introducing single market rules for the whole of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, the length of buses is dictated by commercial considerations. A 15-metre bus can take about 67 passengers, i.e. 16 more than a 12-metre bus. Obviously, competitive considerations push some operators in the direction of longer buses. In cases where full-loaded buses can circulate, it is preferable, for environmental reasons, to use longer buses. Finally, this proposal creates a clearer situation as to the removable attachments on buses, mostly ski boxes, which have to be included in the total authorised length.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally agree with the compulsory three axles on buses longer than 12 metres, which are likely to exceed the maximum permissible weight per axle. Three axles give better circulating conditions and cause less wear on roads. Other proposed measures, like considering the maximum length of a bus and trailer as the same as a truck and trailer, are also satisfactory. The total of all of these is a maximum of 18.75 metres. It should be noted that, from 1 January 2000, the maximum width of buses was increased from 2.50m to 2.55m. Adaptations of the maximum length of rigid buses will very probably bring about a demand for a similar change in legislation for rigid trucks designed to transport goods, although there may be not an overwhelming demand for such vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">Key criteria to ensure manoeuvrability of buses are the turning circle and the outswing. These criteria are set out in Directive 97/27/EC relating to the masses and dimensions of certain categories of motor vehicles and their trailers. Although this directive allows derogation by the Member States, it is important to stick, at the European level, to these criteria, which should apply also to the longer rigid buses as proposed in this directive. The reason is that buses – both inner-city buses and coaches – often have to operate in narrow streets in city centres during the rush hours, when many other vehicles, motorbikes, bikes, and pedestrians are on the road. If there are problems for 15-metre buses to circulate in some places, such as historic town centres, narrow streets etc., local or national authorities should indicate the restrictions, which have to be observed; I think this is a satisfactory arrangement.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to refer to three amendments adopted in committee. The first makes provision for a transitional period during which the use within national territory of buses which are currently permitted but do not comply with the new requirements of the directive will be allowed. If this period were to end on 31 December 2009, it would be very short, given that it would severely limit the service life of buses longer than 12 metres which are already licensed. The effect would be to impose unacceptable financial burdens on businesses which had registered or introduced vehicles in good faith before the entry into force of the new directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The second amendment states that it ought to be made clear that these provisions apply to rigid buses, not articulated buses. Increasing the maximum authorised length of buses with two axles is intended to make it possible to use removable attachments such as ski boxes on 12-metre buses. This increase will also challenge bus manufacturers to use alternative materials and designs to reduce the weight of the vehicle, so that buses which are longer than 12 metres but well under 15 metres can also be manufactured and registered as two-axle vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">The third amendment concerns removable attachments, such as ski boxes, and cornering. It sets different requirements from the directive because it considers that application of the proposal submitted by the working group for transport to amend the Directive 96/53 with regard to the measuring method and the limit values for outswing would result in the maximum length of buses being limited to 14.6 metres. This is contrary to the length of buses with at least three axles set in Article 1 of the directive. Buses would be 40 centimetres shorter.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the proposed amendments are concerned, I cannot agree with Amendment No 4 by the Liberals because, as I said to the Commission, it is not in keeping with the spirit of the directive. As far as Amendment No 6 proposed by the Socialists is concerned, I can consent to this straight away. As regards the other two amendments proposed by the Socialists, Amendments Nos 5 and 7, calling for derogations of up to two years, I consider the transitional period to be excessive. I would appreciate clarification from the Socialists and from the Commission before taking a stance, but a two-year transitional period seems excessive to me. I might perhaps be able to discuss a shorter period of time if, of course, the Commission agrees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When it comes to road safety and environmental sustainability, they are first-rate. Two and a half years ago the European Commission published a report on the use of 15-metre buses and coaches, in which it referred not only to distortions in competition between transport companies in various EU Member States, but also, I am pleased to say, offered prospects of greater safety and improved comfort. Today, we finally have before us a directive to this effect, one that I have been calling for on an almost monthly basis since then.</p>
<p class="contents">Particularly in view of the present heightening of distortions in competition because of unilateral decisions by many Member States on energy pricing, as a result of which Europe has lost credibility in the eyes of a large section of the public, we urgently need to point the way here. Let us give some positive signals: first by harmonising permissible maximum lengths for rigid buses and rigid bus-trailer combinations, secondly, by clarifying the situation as regards removable attachments such as luggage trailers and skiboxes, and thirdly, by bringing the cornering test in line with scientific and technical progress and also with the current version of the ECE Regulation, which has been tried and tested since 1996.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is totally in the spirit of subsidiarity that Member States are to be granted a long transitional period, up to 2015 to be precise, during which the use within national territory of buses which are currently permitted but do not yet comply with the new requirements of the directive will be allowed. And of course local and regional authorities remain at liberty to impose restrictions on 15-metre buses in places where there are traffic management problems, such as narrow streets in historical town centres. However, national protectionist measures going beyond this are not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur and to congratulate him, and I ask you to vote for Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 6. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But we are concerned because we would prefer to be making progress on more environmentally-friendly forms of transport, such as railways, rather than continuing to increase road capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the amendments are concerned, we support the transitional periods for buses still running, that is, Amendment No 1, and also for industry, to enable industry to comply with the new conditions. I would say to Mr Hatzidakis that the 24 months for industry is less than was allowed in the original 1996 directive when the transitional period was four years. This time, industry is happy with two years. They do not have to take it up, it is there in case they require that amount of time.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we are in favour of the proposal to keep buses of more than 12, but less than 15, metres with two axles, still serving public transport in some Member States, since this does not, as far as we are concerned, jeopardise safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we strongly support the Commission's position on Article 1.3b which corresponds to Annex 1.1, 1.4 and 1.5 of the 1996 directive. We believe this is the best guarantee for safety. The PSE Group does not support Amendment No 3, as the proposed new test does not ensure proper manoeuvrability and does not therefore fully meet acceptable safety requirements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ELDR Group also welcomes the principle that longer buses which have a maximum length of 15 metres and which also have to meet the same safety and weight standards should now be allowed in all Member States. For the free movement of goods and services, it is necessary for matters of this kind to be harmonised in the transport sector too and for industry to be able to rely on there being a level playing field. In our eyes, the opportunity created by this directive of introducing longer buses on international routes is efficient. It is also profitable. More capacity makes transport more efficient in the operational sphere, and this means that both transport company and consumer stand to gain from this. Longer buses also make a more efficient use of roads possible and this means that the environment benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, my group also has reservations about the proposal, namely with regard to Article 1(3a). There is also the risk of over-regulation, which is the case, in our view, with the obligation for all buses longer than 12 metres to be fitted with three axles, irrespective of the use made of those buses. In our opinion, this constitutes an infringement of the freedom of the manufacturer who must be able to decide, in consultation with the customer, how many axles are required to meet the safety standards and demands in terms of weight, because by no means do all buses and coaches carry the same load; think of VIP coaches, for example. This means, in practice, that the running costs must not be compromised unnecessarily by fitting a third axle, which is not necessary, strictly speaking.</p>

Apart from anything else, it is useful to harmonise this area as far as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous speaker mentioned a few beneficial effects this may have in terms of efficiency, safety and the environment. This is exactly where there is room for improvement. Environmental standards are of course being applied to certain modes of transport, in this case road transport. The European standards for trucks spring to mind, which can bring about a shift in the relationship between road and, for example, rail in terms of environmental benefits. It is not always the case, however, not by a long chalk, that these standards are applied.</p>
<p class="contents">If we consider for a moment the subject of longer buses and the environment, then a situation can arise, as depicted by Mrs Sanders-Ten Holte, of cheaper and more efficient transport where small businesses may have greater earnings in this field and make more profit. However, prices drop which inevitably means that buses are used as an extremely cheap mode of transport, as is very much in evidence at the moment. In other words, I can condone the lengthening of buses based on environmental and other considerations, but there are also a number of side-effects which are being overlooked, in fact, by this directive and which cannot be dealt with here either, but to which we would like draw attention.</p>
<p class="contents">Giving industry some space to catch up seems justified in my opinion. Three axles, as Mrs Sanders-Ten Holte indicated, are not always necessary, but what is necessary is to draft a sound directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

European bus measurements may seem a trivial matter, but it is no such thing. Our objective of a dynamic single market can only come about if all players comply with the same regulations. Competition, which is a prime mover in the arena of real development, will begin when transport companies can offer cross-border services. There are no Greek bus companies in our country, Finland, but the Scots have already got a firm foothold. Stinginess pays off.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to continue the positive spread of competition we must harmonise bus standards. Uniform measurements will also mean cost saving for manufacturers, which will be reflected in fares and the pockets of EU citizens. The present directive is inadequate because it leads to too much diversity with regard to buses in the various Member States, which will make the drafting of safety standards difficult. The tragic news from Greece recently unquestionably obliges us to address the matter of creating and complying with safety regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is right in its proposal to allow 15-metre buses. The more people there are on the bus, the cheaper it will be to travel, to say nothing of the atmosphere that increases exponentially as the number of passengers grows. The use of long buses is furthermore recommended for environmental reasons. If we support group travel it will reduce congestion in built-up areas. A few half-empty cars take up the space of one bus carrying sixty people.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, Mr Hatzidakis, is right that it would be unfair to call for the transition period with regard to buses already in operation in domestic traffic to end by 2009. People will not feel favourably disposed towards the EU if we start scrapping buses that are still in perfectly good condition, before their time. At the same time we would easily destroy the belief the entrepreneur and the man in the street have in the common sense of EU decision-makers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission is pleased that the report points out the need to seek a balance between the commercial aspects and those linked to competition and, at the same time, guarantees technical progress on the one hand and safety on the other. We share these objectives, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the text is clear and has already been mentioned here: to establish a uniform regulation for the dimension of rigid buses in transport services. The current legislation is very varied, very disparate, and there seems to be a clear need for harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to fully understand what I am going to say with regard to the Commission’s reaction to the various amendments, it should be made clear that the proposal, in our view, aims to authorise a maximum length of 15 metres throughout the European Union, provided that two requirements are complied with: firstly, that buses of between 12 and 15 metres have three axles – an important issue which I will discuss later and which has led to some debate – and, secondly, that buses are manoeuvrable, that is to say, that their manoeuvrability is in accordance with Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us start with the first requirement: the three axles. The problem of the three axles, in the Commission’s view, is fundamental if we wish to guarantee that, despite the size of these buses, the weight is distributed evenly and does not create problems for the road infrastructures. This is the fundamental point. We can understand that there may be a debate on whether all buses are the same or not, but we believe that excess detail in relation to specific solutions would, at the end of the day, be the worst formula. We believe that the three axles for buses of over 12 metres represent the simplest formula, which will best resolve the problems. That is the reason why Amendments Nos 2 and 4, which seek to reduce that requirement by establishing that the third axle is only obligatory in the case of buses of more than thirteen and a half or even 15 metres, are not acceptable to the Commission. We believe that that would have negative effects – as we have said previously – on the infrastructures.</p>
<p class="contents">The second requirement of our proposal is that the buses pass a specific manoeuvrability test. What manoeuvrability test? Well, the same conditions that are currently laid down in Directive 97/27, which also link this test to manufacturing standards. We believe that this is a key point and it is also the reason why the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 3, since it seeks to establish different standards of manoeuvrability, which are less rigorous that those that currently exist. They would clearly be easier to comply with, but they would introduce risks from the point of view of the safety of this type of vehicle.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 5 and 7 are not acceptable to the Commission either. In both cases, they seek to have the directive enter into force at a later date. This clearly presents practical problems in the sense that, if we want to accelerate the construction of the internal market, anything which speeds up the process is positive, while delays, on the other hand, would create serious difficulties. Accepting Amendment No 6 would also cause certain problems, since we do not consider that it has sufficient technical justification. Nevertheless, it does seem reasonable that buses of 15 metres, which are already authorised and which do not conform to the above-mentioned requirements, that is to say, the three axles and manoeuvrability, nevertheless should benefit from a transitional period and that that transitional period should be longer than the one initially laid down. The original proposal was a period lasting until 2009. The Commission considers that that exemption is perhaps excessively restrictive and we could accept the idea that the directive would allow them to stay in use until 2015. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
