<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on 4 September, I presented to this House the White Paper on Reform of European Governance. Some Members gave me their immediate reactions then, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market have started to analyse our proposals. Today’s debate is therefore taking place within the context of a wider discussion that is already well under way. I would like to make a few preliminary remarks in order to clear up some misunderstandings that have emerged during this debate – and I will, of course, be happy to reply to any further comments you may wish to make during this morning’s discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the overriding aim of the White Paper on Reform of European Governance is to renew and reinvigorate the institutional triangle, which operates according to the Community method under the present Treaty. This complements and reinforces the Commission’s and my own ongoing commitment to institutional changes that will strengthen the role of the European Parliament. Indeed, the Commission has always maintained that this House, which directly represents the people of Europe, should play a central role in the institutional triangle, on an equal footing with the Council, representing the Member States, and the Commission, which represents the European public interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also supports the work of the Court of Justice to ensure that the European Union is based on the rule of law and respect for human rights. We have been pursuing this commitment constantly and consistently. It remains our objective to strengthen the legitimacy of this House and thus to consolidate representative democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">It was this same desire to consolidate representative democracy and to ensure that it functions correctly and efficiently that inspired our White Paper on Reform of European Governance.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past few weeks, a number of people have criticised that part of our proposals that seeks to clarify the distinction between the legislative and executive functions. These criticisms are, it seems to me, the result of a misunderstanding. I have, for example, heard it said that the Commission is asking for a ‘blank cheque’ so that it can perform its executive tasks without the legitimate scrutiny of Parliament. This is simply not true, as is clear from the White Paper itself. What the Commission is suggesting, in fact, is that Parliament, the Council and the Commission should all take a step backwards and start concentrating once again on their institutional tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, for its part, should table fewer proposals and target them better, concentrating on its executive function. The Council should play its legislative role and not become an executive. Parliament has primary responsibilities in monitoring the way policies are implemented and with regard to the Community budget. It is thus much more than simply the co-legislator.</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper’s proposals are, therefore, ambitious. Their aim is to ensure that the existing rules are fully applied at last, and to give Parliament an equal role with the Council. This goes far beyond the power to ‘call back’ responsibility for executive decisions, on which some Members of this House have focused much attention.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘call-back’ option is too limited, in that it merely allows Parliament to partially change the current system – which, we all know, is seriously deficient – but without making good the deficiencies.</p>
<p class="contents">As the White Paper shows, what we really need is a structural change that clarifies who is responsible for putting policy into practice. This is vital if we are to know who is to be held answerable for policy implementation. After all, the principle of accountability is an essential part of the way democratic institutions operate.</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper contends that the Commission should be responsible for implementing policy. It questions the need for the current system of regulatory and management committees. The prospect of enlargement makes it all the more urgent to review our commitology.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the paper also states very clearly that the terms and limits of the Commission’s executive role must be laid down in the new legislation that you will discuss on the basis of the Commission’s final proposal. It also states that we need a simple legal mechanism to allow Council and Parliament, on an equal footing, to monitor and control the actions of the Executive. We are already giving thought to how this mechanism might work, but at this stage, before proposing anything, we want to listen.</p>
<p class="contents">We are expecting a major contribution from the Member States’ advisory committees as well as from this House.</p>
<p class="contents">In the White Paper, the Commission has also committed itself to improving its consulting procedures when drawing up policy proposals. Some have suggested that this would undermine the role of Parliament. I sincerely believe this is not the case, and it is certainly not our intention.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite clearly, we have never proposed – and we never will propose – that Parliament or other democratically elected institutions be replaced by the voluntary civil associations we call ‘non-governmental organisations’.</p>
<p class="contents">These associations play an important role in raising public awareness and integrating our society, and we therefore wish to enjoy a useful relationship with them. This relationship, which, I repeat, has absolutely no connection with the role of democratically elected institutions, is, at the moment, unclear and lacking in transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to bring some order to current practice. In particular, we need guidelines that make it transparent and more structured than now. We also need guidelines on how to use expert advice in formulating public policies. All this will improve the way in which the Commission exercises its right of initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">What we want, then, is a more structured and comprehensible system for interacting both with democratically elected local authorities and – in a quite distinct way – with civil society. This will ensure our consultation practices are more open and efficient than at present.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, the Treaty will remain unchanged, all the decisions will continue to be taken by the appropriate institutions in accordance with the current democratic rules. The White Paper thus opens the way for an inter-institutional dialogue on how all the institutions can improve their consultation. We do not consider our proposals to be final and we are open to alternative suggestions, provided they are intended to achieve the same results.</p>
<p class="contents">I also understand there is some anxiety about the new forms of regulation proposed in the White Paper. Some people fear they might weaken the role of Parliament. A closer look at the White Paper should, however, convince you that, like you, the Commission is determined not to diminish but to increase Parliament’s role. That is precisely why the White Paper proposes new forms of regulation such as self-regulation, among principles and practices that ensure democratic control.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of regulatory agencies – which can only take technical decisions on a case-by-case basis – will, of course, need a legislative act. Parliament will thus be fully involved in drawing up the rules and the necessary guarantees for adopting such an act.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have to find the right balance between the need to lay down essential elements and objectives in European legislation and the need to remain flexible and able to react to rapid social and economic change.</p>
<p class="contents">So the White Paper proposes, for the first time, to involve Parliament in the complex process of introducing the open method of coordination. These forms of inter-governmental cooperation on matters that lie on the fringes of Community law must, of necessity, follow a logic that is compatible with the way the institutional triangle works.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the main challenge facing the Union today is political.</p>
<p class="contents">The Laeken Summit is approaching, and it should give us a roadmap towards the next IGC. Governance is already a part of that debate. Changing the way the institutions work (which is the subject of the White Paper) and changing the institutions themselves (which is the subject of the future proposals to amend the Treaty) are obviously two different issues which are, however, closely related.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I have said that the debate on the options set out in the White Paper on Reform of European Governance is the first phase in the debate on the future of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This phase – which will take place within the current legal framework and thus within the restraints this entails – must not be reduced to a mere academic discussion. It must lead to specific proposals for action. This is the way to give the citizens of Europe greater confidence in the way the EU works. This is essential. We urgently need to win back the trust of our fellow-citizens by applying the present rules correctly and efficiently. If we do this, we shall have greater legitimacy when it comes to asking for the necessary Treaty changes later on.</p>
<p class="contents">However, swift action does not mean rushing. We need the kind of mature reflection that is characteristic of this House. Clearly, therefore, I do not intend to make proposals until you have drawn up your opinions on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission realises that the renewal process the White Paper has begun can be brought to a successful conclusion only if the European Parliament and the Council find the political will to start changing the way we work under the existing Treaty through a collaborative effort.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore welcome dialogue of different sorts between the European institutions, if necessary by setting up a joint working group Commission, Parliament and Council working group to look in greater detail at our proposals on governance.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank you, most sincerely, in advance for your commitment and support.</p>

In addition to establishing the common market, the single currency and the beginnings of a common foreign and security policy, we have also become an area of peace, justice and security, and in this we are a model for many regions of the world. But why is it that our citizens do not see the actions of the various institutions of the European Union in a proper light, as we might expect? Why is it that they so often fail to evoke a positive response? The question that immediately comes to mind is of course why the European Union has such a poor external image and why it is so bad at initiating and implementing its policies.</p>
<p class="contents">These questions of course provide the basis for the Commission's White Paper of 25 July of this year, and we are delighted that the Commission President, Mr Prodi, is here to discuss this issue with us for the second time today and has just offered us cooperation within an interinstitutional working party. I think this is an excellent suggestion that we should accept promptly and in a constructive spirit.</p>
<p class="contents">Another question is why our public image in the EU Member States is so patchy – I do not wish to say dismal – yet it cannot really be said that the European Union stumbles from one failure to the next. I think that a key point here is what the Commission says at the beginning of the White Paper: it should go back to concentrating on its core activities. The Commission should not allow itself to get tangled up in a mass of individual proposals and decisions so that in terms of overall policy strategy you cannot see the wood for the trees.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, there are a few more questions that we need to consider in some depth before we will find the appropriate answers. We certainly recognise that the Commission – and I think that all the institutions need to do this – has subjected and is continuing to subject its actions to a critical review process, after which it can then adopt any changes necessary after discussion with us.</p>
<p class="contents">We also support the Commission's intention to focus on particular areas, but we have to say that the Commission should in that case undertake appropriate work with the press. It should make it very clear to the public what European legislation consists of and how it has to be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a second important issue here. There is no point in the Commission setting up its own substructures in various fields, and I believe that it has in fact largely ceased to do this. It should make use of existing public agencies at national, regional and local level to implement Community legislation. There is no need for the Commission to arrange direct involvement in every local district and in every medium-sized town. Although it is important to keep citizens informed, suitable forms of interaction should be used. Framework legislation produced by the Commission should provide for implementation at regional and national level, and it seems to me that the Commission's first proposal in the 25 July White Paper blurs the distinction between the various levels too much. So what is needed? Joint regulation? Open coordination? To what extent are European agencies needed? We need to address all these questions in our interinstitutional working party. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swoboda (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Mr Prodi, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am very grateful for today's report. We are moving ever closer and our views have more and more in common, but there is still a way to go, and there is one particular point on which I believe that we still differ.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, you have today clearly declared your faith in a form of parliamentary democracy that of course has important consequences for our work as a whole, and in particular for the role of ‘civil society’. That is another of those rather nebulous concepts rather like ‘governance’, but ‘governance’ is used in contexts where there are no parliamentary democracies or cannot be, as in the case of ‘global governance’. In the case of civil society, and I think you were very clear about this, we need to stress that although it has a consultative role and a supporting function, it is the European Parliament and of course also national parliaments that are at the heart of democracy as we know it. As you said yourself, they are an expression of the will of the people, and we must insist on that point.</p>
<p class="contents">The key point on which there are still differences between us is the issue of alternative forms of regulation. We are not so presumptuous as to think that only Parliament can regulate and that only Parliament can create appropriate regulations, including detailed regulations. However, the difficult thing is to decide on the framework, details, a political objective and technical implementation. So I must insist that this Parliament is always consulted on this issue and that it is not the Commission that decides, but that there should be a joint decision, a kind of Interinstitutional Agreement between the Council, Parliament and the Commission. This applies in particular to the issue of call back that we have also been discussing today.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make this crystal clear: we need both things. We need a Parliament call-back procedure in connection with alternative forms of regulation, and we need to reform comitology. We have nothing against the reform of comitology proposed in the White Paper, but it is not enough. It is necessary if the decision-making process at parliamentary level is to become more democratic, but it is by no means enough. Mr President, I hope I have understood you correctly in understanding that you will not present anything to the Laeken European Council unless it has been discussed with this Parliament beforehand and the views of this House have been sought. You said this in general terms, and I welcome that, and I can see from your nodding that that is indeed your intention. That represents a great step forward compared with the last time, and I would like to thank you very much indeed for that.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I would like to make one more thing clear. This is not about Parliament getting involved in the Commission's executive powers. However, we very much reject any attempts on the part of the Commission – and they have been made – to get involved in the legislative process and to arrogate legislative powers to itself. This emerges from many sentences and passages in the White Paper, and we must reject this. The Commission has executive powers, but legislative competence is a matter for the Parliament and the Council and we absolutely insist on that! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the candidate countries, enthusiasm for enlargement is in decline. There is little confidence in the European institutions, and the individual citizen can feel that the gap between ‘those in Brussels’ and ‘those of us at home’ is extremely large. We are all painfully aware of this, and I am very pleased to find such a large measure of self-criticism in the Commission’s White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party welcomes the White Paper on Reform of European Governance. These changes are an important part of the major work of reform we are facing over the next few years to make the EU more easily accessible, efficient and democratic. We are very well disposed towards the start made by the White Paper. It points out the problems and shows where changes are required.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the overarching proposals are entirely in line with what the Liberals have been pressing for over a period of quite a few years. There must be an increase in openness and public control. The new rules adopted earlier this year in accordance with Article 255 are a first step on the way. The decision-making processes must be simplified and made clearer. There must be regional, as well as local, involvement at an earlier stage of the decision-making process, and we must discover mechanisms for regular consultation at these levels for it is, after all, regional and local authorities that will be implementing the majority of the EU’s decisions. It is also very encouraging that the Commission wishes to work more with framework legislation and strengthen the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.</p>
<p class="contents">There is little that is very specific in the White Paper, however. What, precisely, can be done about this? How is the individual citizen to be made to feel more involved in decision-making? And how, in particular, is the Commission to set about promoting the change of attitude or cultural revolution that has to take place in the Commission if all the reforms are to become a reality? We are aware that many of Mr Kinnock’s proposed reforms have come up against pretty formidable resistance. Bureaucracies – and the Commission is a large bureaucracy – change slowly, and many people are impatient to see results. We cannot afford to fail.</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper is now under consideration. I hope that many will feel prompted to respond and present their views before part two appears. Parliament will produce a report. In this connection, it was, moreover, extremely encouraging to hear Mr Prodi propose a joint working party, made up of representatives from the institutions. I hope that the Commission, together with Parliament, will also be active in making the White Paper more widely known and not expect people just to find it accidentally on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for this first part of the White Paper. We look forward to seeing part two. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am always surprised that this is commented on in a wounded tone as if we were misunderstood, as if all this were unfair, and even the answers on this subject have a very paternalistic ring about them. They say that it is all about explaining things better to the public and presenting our policies to them more clearly. Unlike Mr Swoboda, I do not think that we have really made any progress in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The concept of good governance is very vague, and people do not really understand what you are promising them. You are promising transparency, openness and consultation, but that is not what is at stake here, Mr Prodi. The major misunderstanding – I might almost say a misunderstanding of historical proportions – is that this Commission does not have any conception of European democracy. It has no conception at all of democracy at supranational level.</p>
<p class="contents">All these paternalistic ideas that you have presented here miss the point that you do not have the courage – and have not had the courage for years – to highlight the democratic deficits of the European Union with sufficient clarity, and to recognise that the Commission must forego some power if such a thing as European democracy is to exist, and that you need to work alongside this Parliament on many key issues, for example on preparing a constitutional process and the main elements of that process.</p>
<p class="contents">No, genuinely tackling the dissatisfaction that exists would mean addressing the state of crisis which exists as regards legitimacy. We govern people with regulations because we do not have the courage to say that we have been making laws for years now. We call them regulations because the democratic legitimacy of these laws is very fragile, because the separation of powers has not been achieved, because the principle of openness of legislation has not been achieved, because the process of committing the administration to laws has not been achieved, and because instead there is disproportionate scope for discretion, which cannot be reconciled with democratic principles, because we have an irregular administration in many areas, such as the committee structure. It is not regular, there are no staff regulations, there are no clear loyalties, and the processes for appointing staff in these areas are by no means transparent and are easy to manipulate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, you cannot reconcile the idea of a good technocracy with a debate on democracy. Just as there is no such thing as a good dictatorship, there is also no such thing as a good technocracy. You will have to address the issue of a European democracy and the position of the Commission in this process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am bound to agree with Mr Voggenhuber on this point: as far as I am concerned, the issue at the centre of the whole debate around governance is the question of democracy – strengthening democracy and above all strengthening the public's rights, especially under the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I say that because one thing is clear: the very best policy will achieve nothing if it does not impact on the public or if the present state of affairs continues, in which the public believes that what happens in Brussels is far removed from them and their day-to-day concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Mr Prodi, that the public quite rightly expects two things: the first is transparency in decision making and the second is clarity as regards political responsibility for decisions. I believe that this has to be the focal point from which our joint deliberations start, both for the Commission and of course also for the other institutions. I would like to talk about transparency for a moment. The White Paper talks about a cumbersome system of almost 700 consultative bodies supporting the Commission. If I remember correctly, you yourself picked up this point in the White Paper on the reform of the Commission, and announced back in June that a list of these consultative bodies would be published. In the White Paper before us, you promise that details of these bodies will be published by the end of the year. I am very much in favour of that. This is a question of transparency, and it could help to remove some of the prejudice against the work of the Commission and the other institutions. However, publishing details of consultative bodies is one thing, and, as I see it, accepting political responsibility for decisions is quite another.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point in the White Paper that I would like to mention is the ‘culture of consultation and dialogue’. I certainly regard that as a very good proposal. I think that the Commission on the one hand and the Council and Parliament on the other would be well advised to jointly consider how a new culture of consultation and dialogue can be achieved in terms of greater involvement for civil society. I think it would be better if the Commission did not propose a code of conduct on minimum standards for consultation for itself, but rather if we could jointly consider whether there is not some scope for all three institutions to make a joint commitment under an Interinstitutional Agreement. You spoke earlier about a dialogue of this kind, about the possibility of setting up a working party, and I am keen to accept that suggestion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, what impression do you think the citizens of Europe can have if, after the attacks on New York and Washington, they have seen Chirac, Blair, Fischer and all the European leaders marching off to Washington, and then the President-in-Office and President Prodi a good last, or nearly so – through no fault of their own, of course – and it even seems on Monday – and that is saying something – even Berlusconi may go?</p>
<p class="contents">All this in itself reveals a deep-seated problem for as long as we give that impression (and we either give it or not). Therefore, in my opinion (and here I agree with Mr Voggenhuber), the Commission should stop talking so much and risking being misunderstood, especially in view of the Convention – which we hope will be a positive step and will give a boost to this Union. Instead, it should concentrate on crucial problems like representation abroad, which is its own role; it should reassume its role as the driving force behind European integration, something it is losing and may lose forever. It should also be daring and make ambitious proposals, such as asking, for instance, what face Europe is showing to the outside world, since we cannot really have ten different faces on such international matters.</p>
<p class="contents">This, then, is my message to you, Mr Prodi: more concrete proposals, stronger proposals, particularly in view of the post-Laeken meeting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not everything has to be included, but just those things that cannot better be taken care of at national, local or individual levels, such as the internal market, the common currency, external and internal security, borders, customs and certain environmental issues.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, the proposals relating to democracy are not sufficiently concrete. We therefore need cooperation across the institutions in order to move forward. We must build upon a clear division of power in which political responsibility can be insisted upon. The objectives need to be clarified and the initiatives adapted accordingly. It is <span class="italic">necessary</span> to be able to hold people to account in a democratic system governed by law, and the prerequisite for this is a common basis of values with clear guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">An effective European democracy requires discussions across linguistic and national borders, together with an education system and media adapted in the light of these. The proposed multi-level democracy <span class="italic">can</span> contribute to legitimacy and greater confidence in the institutions, but it must not degenerate into a democracy characterised by bargaining or corporatism and which is so often marked by corruption. Cooperation with civil society <span class="italic">can</span> make political measures better suited to their purpose, but the role of politicians <span class="italic">must</span> be <span class="italic">clearly</span> distinguished from civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">We now hope that the Commission will in future comply with the values in the proposal and, faced with each new initiative, ask four questions: Is the measure proportionate, that is to say appropriate to the problems that are to be solved? Is the solution in keeping with European democracy? Is the proposal in line with the EU’s vision and basic principles? Can people be held to account?</p>
<p class="contents">The more people are involved in European cooperation, the better. Do not imagine, however, that legitimacy in itself creates democracy. Rather, it is democracy which creates legitimacy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my capacity of shadow rapporteur for the PSE Group for the White Paper on Reform of European Governance in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I would now like to explain our position from my point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome your proposal for efficient governance by setting up autonomous agencies, the proposals facilitating co-regulations and self-regulations, the will to consult representatives from specific sectors and the proposal on citizens’ and the civil society’s right to information, participation and consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">We object, however, to a deal between the interested sectors and the European Commission without any parliamentary control. That is not our idea of democracy. We want to decide beforehand, in tandem with the Commission and the Council, when detailed legislation is necessary, when framework legislation suffices and when we can sanction a form of co-regulation or self-regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that in many cases, it will be useful to delegate technical details to the comitology procedure, provided they are technical details, and the political component has been extracted completely. Furthermore, the call-back mechanism, to which the European Parliament can refer, should this prove necessary, must be regulated in advance.</p>
<p class="contents">It is possible that the deployment of the social actors in the case of self- and co-regulation is a much more efficient way of working. Not only should we consult the sectors about the decision-making process. In certain cases, even social non-profit organisations could also play a role in the implementation. But if the sectors are allocated certain tasks, the monitoring role by the European Parliament must always remain clear, and the European Commission must carry its responsibility. Clarity always remains condition No 1.</p>
<p class="contents">The dialogue with social actors must be concrete and yield results, and must not become a talk shop which thrives on repetition. For what the citizen and the PSE Group want is result: democratic control and recognisable political priority by the European government. At present, decision-making in the EU is too diffuse and too sluggish, which leads to alienation. The PSE Group, also in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, is now offering to break this cycle. That is possible and should be done before the Laeken Summit. The Commission should then reach an agreement with the European Parliament which can be implemented by the end of the Spanish Presidency. The ball is now back in the court of the Commission. We count on you, Mr Prodi. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If, instead, we consider the reasons why it was drawn up – reasons that should have been given greater coverage in the text itself – we realise that it has a very solid and highly relevant political core. In the G8 debate here in this House, I pointed out that, while globalisation is proceeding apace in all fields, it is hard for it to involve politics, which thus remains inadequate and slow compared with what is happening in other sectors. This is undoubtedly one of the basic reasons for citizens’ widespread mistrust of institutions at all levels, from local to European to worldwide. Besides, what do the people of Seattle, Gothenburg or Genoa, leaving aside the more extreme positions, want of politics, if not to control globalisation? What answer are we in a position to give, today, apart from our own inadequacy?</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union project is, of course, still the only concrete example that can meet these demands, but it has not yet expressed its democratic potential to the full. The White Paper is thus a valuable instrument, provided Parliament shows the same willingness to specify those substantial organisational reforms that will enable it to reconstruct and revive European democratic citizenship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to do so particularly from the standpoint of my own constituency, Scotland, but not only from that point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">It is interesting to note, when you reflect on Scotland, that about 80% of the competences exercisable by the Scottish Parliament concern domains in which the European Union has a shared competence. When we make laws here, the Scottish Parliament and government are bound by them and have to put them into effect; that is quite right and it is the same across other similar regions. But sometimes it can produce ridiculous results, for example when environmental laws are too detailed to allow sensible local discretion in adapting common principles to local situations. The water problems of the Island of Islay or the Glen of Strathspey are hardly comparable with those of the Rhine basin. A one-size-fits-all approach to water law can have absurd results, for example in respect of the Scotch malt whisky industry, despite its established environmental friendliness over 200 years.</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper says, as did Commissioner Prodi this morning, that the Commission will consult regional and local government early in the policy-formation process and will seek to legislate so that local knowledge is effectively deployed in the implementation process. That is quite right and very welcome, though it was a pity he only devoted one sentence in his opening speech to it. Many of us had expected that the White Paper would contain a far stronger statement, especially in relation to the so-called partner regions exercising their own constitutional powers of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe will fail to regain or retain the affections of the citizens of the Union – and that includes the people in Scotland and our counterparts in many similar lands such as Catalonia, Flanders, Wales, Galicia, the Basque country – unless the regional and local governments with whom people there finally identify are fully respected partners in the governance of Europe.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Beazley (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr Prodi, your paper on European governance is an important milestone, but on a technical issue my colleague, Mr Dell'Alba, pointed out to you in a previous debate that, while the word ‘governance’ may be very common in the English and French languages, in Italian political culture it is to some extent opaque. If that is the case, it may well be that we have to get the message through in each of the EU languages. Perhaps attention could be paid to those languages in which the word ‘gouvernance’, first used by Sir John Fortescue in England in the fifteenth century when the English political class spoke French, is less clearly understood than in English and French. We ought to look at that point.</p>
<p class="contents">Reading your paper, it struck me that in a sense the first stage of recovery in the building of Europe is for the Commission itself to recover its self-confidence and poise. I pay credit to you Mr Prodi, and to your colleagues Mr Patten, Mr Barnier and others, for having succeeded in restoring this poise after the resignation of your predecessors. However, as you know – and you drew attention to this in your speech – there is concern in Parliament about giving respect to the institutional triangle.</p>
<p class="contents">There are fears about your use of civil society, which we all know really means consulting lobby groups. The most effective lobby groups do their job, which is not to represent society at large – that is this elected Parliament's duty – but to represent their own vested interest. So I am afraid the fact that you drew attention to this concern has not allayed our fears and we will continue to insist that it is we, the elected Members of this House, who represent the interests of society at large and you should not set up groups meeting directly with the Commission, evolving policy and then handing it down to us to rubber-stamp.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not our understanding of parliamentary democracy. I am sorry that Mr Farage has left. He obviously does not believe in parliamentary democracy. He wants a referendum every five minutes. It is absurd that in my own country, once the Prime Minister, Mr Blair, summons up the courage to confront the Chancellor, Mr Brown, we will be asked in a referendum to decide whether or not to join the single currency. Can you imagine our financial and economic future being discussed in public houses up and down the country? This is a job that elected politicians should do.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards your paper, the European Parliament and the Commission should be partners in the construction of Europe, not rivals. If we remember the days of Jacques Delors, your predecessor, he had a clear programme, a vision: the 1992 single market. He set out a time frame and turned that vision into reality. We must do the same with enlargement and constitutional reform, widening and deepening.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr Prodi, will you organise a public platform for the leaders of the candidate countries that will be joining the EU? I know you have already met the new Polish leader, but the public at large needs to be able to see in practice that we have a vision of a fully complete, united Europe and that you, Parliament and the Council are working together to achieve this.</p>

Mr Prodi, I would like to thank you for making it clear here today that you will not be bringing forward any proposals to amend the constitutional position unless you have the consent of the European Parliament and without a clear vote by Parliament as a directly elected body. That is more than we have been told so far, and I am delighted about that.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time I would like to thank you for trying to clear up any misunderstandings. However, there are some things I am still not clear about. I hope that you will be able to deal with those in your reply as well. You said that fewer proposals would be emanating from the Commission. There can be no objection to that, as long as you can tell us how this new vacuum is to be filled, because you know – just as my fellow Members and I do – that the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice stipulated very clearly the legislative role of the European Parliament and the roles of the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">If you are now telling us that the Commission will be making fewer proposals, one of the implications of that is that you will be presenting framework proposals. If that is what you intend, Mr Prodi, then you will have to ensure that there is a call-back mechanism and a comitology reform. This is not just a drawback of the present system, as you just suggested, but rather an absolute necessity in the context of the ideas or proposals that you have for the future. No one in this House wants framework proposals, but if you want them, then you must make sure they go hand in hand with proper democratic measures that do not adversely affect Parliament's rights.</p>
<p class="contents">You say that you want more modern measures such as voluntary commitments; no one in this House wants that. However, if you still want that, you will have to protect democratic rights within the European Union and ensure that there is an Interinstitutional Agreement that leaves the rights of Parliament, the Council and the Commission intact.</p>
<p class="contents">You also said that the White Paper opens up the way for an interinstitutional debate. It certainly does that. But I would ask you, Mr Prodi, to state clearly before us that you do not intend to go back on the Treaties of Maastricht, Nice and Amsterdam, and that you share the views of the majority of the Members of this House about what I have said. Not a single piece of legislation should go through without the European Parliament being involved. There should not be any voluntary agreements and there should not be any framework agreements unless democracy is protected.</p>

Firstly, this paper is slightly more modest than its title suggests. When you first titillated us with the prospect of presenting this White Paper over a year ago, we were all very excited at the idea of having some great constitutional blueprint. In fact, you have very wisely produced a paper on good administration rather than a blueprint on governance or constitutional government as a whole, and that pragmatic and focused approach has much to commend it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I very much welcome your announcement today that you wish to establish an interinstitutional working party. I have always felt it was a mistake to try to treat governance as if it were a piece of legislation which was first presented by the Commission and then batted between the institutions. This is not normal legislation, but an intensely political debate that requires an intensely political and cooperative approach between the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is one that you touch upon quite politely in the White Paper. I will be less polite: we can do as much as we like at European level – in Strasbourg and Brussels – to improve administration and governance and make our decisions more comprehensible, legitimate and understandable. However, as long as national political institutions and national political cultures remain frozen in the 19th-century mould and pretend that either the EU does not exist or is some far-off spaceship, we will never make great advances in this honourable enterprise of improving governance. Governance can only be built brick by brick from the bottom, from the ground floor, from our nations and regions. That is where we should all start. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Parliament does not think it is a bad idea for the Commission to set up all the consultative bodies it wants, that it should meet with all the non-governmental organisations it wishes, that it should consult everyone through the Internet, or that it should talk to all citizens on a personal level. This seems like a good idea to us and we should probably do the same thing.</p>
<p class="contents">What worries us is the second part of the White Paper; or to be more precise, the proposals to improve Community regulations. The Treaties of the European Union – as Mrs Roth-Behrendt pointed out – are based upon the principle of the division of powers. Article 6 of the Treaty makes reference to national constitutional principles. All national legislations are based upon the principle of the division of powers, by which legislative prerogatives are under the control of bodies elected by the people.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the European institutions there are two such bodies: the Parliament, directly elected, and the Council, comprised of Ministers responsible to their own national Parliaments. The role of the Commission of the European Communities is to be the Community executive, and the role of Parliament is to support and strengthen the claims of the Commission to be an authentic Community executive.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if the Commission enters into the regulatory framework and endeavours to take on competences or powers that have been conferred or that should be conferred on the European Parliament by the Treaties, in these areas – as Mr Swoboda and Mrs Roth-Behrendt have stated – the Commission must remain in close contact with Parliament. To be precise, Mr Prodi’s suggestion that the Commission could present the Laeken European Council with proposals on improving Community regulations, without waiting for Parliament to deliver its opinion, seems to me to be a dangerous thing.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commission, before putting forward any proposal to the Laeken European Council on improving Community regulations, enters into close contact with Parliament with the aim of listening to our point of view and in this way conveying to the Laeken European Council the Parliament’s concerns and interests in this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a bad time because any debate on the internal structure of the European Union and the way it functions, and on the legitimacy of the European Union itself will at present be dwarfed by the need to protect Europe's citizens against international terror and violence, with more arcane subjects being overshadowed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is also a good time for the same reason, by which I mean that the European Union has an opportunity at this precise moment to respond to people's fundamental need for safety within the EU, and for legitimacy combined with an ability to act outside its own borders. Transparent, open and accountable decision making can accordingly help to make Europe's citizens more aware and at the same time conscious of the added value Europe can bring. Your White Paper is a contribution to that added value, Mr Prodi.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, I particularly welcome those proposals in the Commission's White Paper that aim for a systematic dialogue at regional and local level, at a more active role for the Committee of the Regions, and the proposal that from 2002 onwards there should be an annual report on the implementation of the Amsterdam Protocol on Subsidiarity and Proportionality. Subsidiarity and the Community method are not after all mutually exclusive. The division of tasks between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament must be clear, just as a balance between the Member States, the regions and the EU needs to be struck under their institutional triangle.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that the European Parliament and the national parliaments should play a central role in the public debate on the future of Europe. That is why I find it amazing that in its White Paper the Commission does not consider the idea of a convention as requested in the report by Mr Leinen and Mr Méndez de Vigo. An open convention which works out the decision-making basis for the Council, with representatives from the Commission and from national parliaments and from the European Parliament, together with representatives of the Member States and the candidate countries and from the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee sitting as observers, is an appropriate and essential forum for bringing the Union closer to its citizens and achieving transparency, and it must supplement and support internal reforms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He obviously has learned nothing about public policy if he thinks that we can run the whole of Europe on a series of referendums. This discussion is probably one of the most important that we will have before enlargement. It is neither as hallowed nor as sexy as an IGC, but until we get the actual delivery mechanisms of democracy and public policy right, the boring, tedious administrative detail, then we do democracy an injustice.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to reform our governmental processes. There are many proposals in the White Paper that cause nobody any problems, but issues like co-regulation and the delivery of public policy by external agencies do cause problems. We cannot afford not to address these issues. Our institutional overload, as we all know, is quite dramatic in the Union and with enlargement it will get worse. We need to ensure, however, that when we reform those processes – whether it be issues concerning co-regulation or external agencies – we see democratic control as the key factor, democratic control in a democratic framework. This will not be a resource-free exercise. It will also require significant person power to deliver it, at least in the early stages. The Commission has to face this. It will not be a cost-cutting exercise by any means.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if there is a criticism that has to be made of the Commission, and I am glad it has realised the importance of this criticism, it is that its White Paper did not address the role of Parliament. Now I realise that the Commission might be sensitive about doing so, in case it brings the wrath of this House down on it. That represented a fundamental failure in the early discussions between the Commission and Parliament. So I am very pleased that this has now been rectified and we can move forward to produce the sort of governmental structure which we require. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At this particular point I believe that the events of recent weeks have brought more seriousness into politics and that the public is making greater demands on politicians. This provides an opportunity to contribute to a renaissance of political matters and also to a significant renaissance of cooperation between leaders, those in positions of responsibility and the representatives of the people, that is to say the parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">That is how we should approach this debate. When you say in the introduction to your paper that the public feels greater distrust, more apathy and more powerlessness, I agree with you. However, in your second paragraph you say that this problem is acknowledged by national parliaments and governments alike, and that it is particularly acute at the level of the European Union. I have a problem with this wording. We – Parliament and the Commission – are acting as if national governments and national parliaments were on one side and the European Union on the other. The public is particularly aware of this contradiction, with the Member States and the European institutions apparently on opposite sides. We need to make it clear for once and all that we collectively are the European Union! There is virtually no such thing as a European decision without the participation of the national governments, but there are a good many European decisions without codecision by the European Parliament. Codecision leads to transparency and openness and facilitates dialogue, and is therefore the starting point for a clear separation of powers and allocation of tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">Your report talks about leadership. I wish to call for more Commission initiatives based not so much on a minimum Council consensus but rather on what Europe needs. It talks about cooperation with the regions, yet in the Belgian Presidency's proposal for the convention the Commission of the Regions is not even a full member of that convention. Yet that is what we need. We talk about more information, but our actions are limited to giving the Member States more money for their information work, while the Member States do not give their own parliaments sufficient information about their decisions in the Council, and therefore exclude their citizens from European decision making.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I wish to call for proposals for sanctions in the case of misuse of EU funds, because that leads to distrust about the institutions on the part of the public. Wherever the EU is involved, that must be made evident, from the European institutions themselves to the smallest local council.</p>

But this means, Mr Prodi, and I must stress this point, that in the twenty-first century democracy will continue to be associated with the word ‘parliamentary’ and not with the word ‘consultative’.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We do not want to go back to the pre-parliamentary democracy era and the White Paper should not be associated with that idea. Framework legislation and the use of other regulatory mechanisms can only be something positive if they are linked with appropriate guarantees. In the case of framework legislation the effect of these guarantees should be to ensure that the power to define is not handed over to some agency or other, but is reserved to Parliament. It is not only Parliament's privilege to insist on this, it is Parliament's duty.</p>
<p class="contents">You say that you want more transparency and consultation, but whom are you excluding and whom are you including? Associations and non-governmental organisations that can pay for expertise will be better off than those who do not have these resources. And in practice some people will surely be better able to make their voice heard than others. Will this not mean that we are making the playing field for the various parts of civil society in the European Union still more uneven? I believe in a level playing field for the various actors and institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the White Paper is not clear enough about this. I call on you to make this clear, because I have to say that when it comes to financial market legislation, the implementation of the Commission's financial action plan tends to give one co-legislator a stronger position than the other co-legislator, the European Parliament. That does not seem a very promising road to go down. This imbalance needs to be rectified, and at the next intergovernmental conference Article 202 of course needs to be amended by creating a call-back right.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission could also demonstrate its good will at this stage and make it clear that it does not intend to surreptitiously change the balance between the institutions. We, as a parliament, owe that much to society, because parliamentary activity does not just mean controlling things, but also shaping them. I do not want to leave that task to a variety of committees chaired by people without any democratic legitimacy and who are not co-elected by Parliament, as is the case in the United States for example.</p>

It is a well-known saying that ‘if you don't know where you're going, then you won't get there’. First and foremost we need to be very clear in Europe about what we are doing; our aim is not to create a single State of Europe, but to have a union of sovereign States that are cooperating when and where necessary. Unlike Mr Farage, I believe there are many occasions when it is important that we cooperate in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally we all know that the none of the institutions are held in high regard. That is not because they are bad. It is because they are complex, remote and not understood. Frankly, we will continue to face the same problem, whatever specific reforms we come up with, if they remain obscure, complex and unexplained. I say to my colleagues in this Chamber that one thing the people of Europe do not understand is why we oscillate between Brussels and Strasbourg. It is up to us to listen to some of the problems that people express to us.</p>
<p class="contents">I was disappointed in President Prodi's White Paper. He virtually neglected the role of the ombudsman. After all, the ombudsman is in the front line of dealing with the complaints and concerns of citizens. I was also disappointed last month by the response of Commissioner de Palacio, whom I normally respect, who was quite dismissive about the code of good administrative behaviour. We must make sure that we have good administration. That means that we must have an enforceable code common to all of the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Petitions has asked the Ombudsman to report to us on the problems that citizens are presenting to him. We want to listen to citizens. I extend an invitation to President Prodi, if he really wants to understand what the citizens of Europe are finding difficult with the European institutions, European rules and regulations, to give up one afternoon and come along to the Petitions Committee to listen to what citizens are saying. He would certainly have an afternoon's entertainment hearing what people really think.</p>
<p class="contents">In brief, what I am saying is this: listen to people; listen to those who know what they are talking about; be clear about your objectives; and then explain yourselves in clear and simple language.</p>

<p class="contents">Today’s debate on governance is important because it aims at encouraging broader discussion on the meaning of European integration and its goals. It complements the debate on the future of the Union, and thus it should concentrate on the connection between general objectives and the concrete actions seen by the citizens. As we all know, what really lies at the basis of this deliberation is the realisation that the long-term credibility of European integration is undermined by the lack of mutual recognition between public structures and civil society. We must therefore involve numerous sections and expressions of civil society to the greatest extent possible, because in this way the citizens will also be playing a greater part in policy- and decision-making. This is an important task that the institutions of the European Union must all make a real effort to carry out together.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, I would recall that during the last Parliamentary term the European Parliament itself, and in particular the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, recognised the need to initiate and formalise a dialogue with civil society. To do this an effort must be made to identify the most representative groups, so as to avoid an excess of consultations and overlapping. We therefore ask for an Interinstitutional Agreement on this, which will lead to a division of labour and, at the same time, collaboration between Commission, Parliament and Council.</p>
<p class="contents">A second important point, which has already been hinted at, is the need to simplify Community legislative procedures, distinguishing, that is, between political and legislative decisions, which must not become detailed technical instruments; and distinguishing between Parliament’s prerogatives and competences that belong to the executive.</p>
<p class="contents">Something that you, Mr Prodi, have mentioned is therefore important: the need to specify a call-back mechanism for secondary legislation which can safeguard and strengthen the role of the European Parliament.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Corbett (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, as the last speaker from my group and as coordinator of the group, it falls to me to try and summarise the positions that have been expressed. Listening to the debate I feel that our group's views are very much the centre of gravity of Parliament as a whole on this question. If I could try and summarise this in two sentences, it would be to say 'yes' to better information, consultation and more systematic consultation of non-governmental actors and so on, but 'no' to delegating decisions to a sort of cosy deal between the Commission and industry.</p>
<p class="contents">We would say 'yes' to delegating technical and implementing legislation, but only if there is an adequate procedure to bring things back if they go wrong. In other words, there is considerable sympathy in Parliament for much of what the Commission intends to achieve in its White Paper but genuine concern about what might be the real effects of some of the proposals therein.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me take the example that has come up recently of the self-regulation on pedestrian safety, where the Commission has made a deal with the automobile industry. This is a very good deal in many ways and a lot of what has been agreed is a good step forward for pedestrians' safety. But what if it were not very good?</p>
<p class="contents">What if it contained some outrageous things that would not be acceptable to this Parliament representing the citizens? We represent all the citizens of Europe not just those who are organised in NGOs. What if the automobile industry subsequently does not apply the deal, because it is not enshrined in legislation? What can we do to remedy the situation if one or the other manufacturer does not respect the deal? That is the sort of concern that is being expressed in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the commitment of the Commission only to take this forward once Parliament has given its view and to explore these issues further in an inter-institutional working party. That is a very welcome development. I am very glad you gave that undertaking today and I look forward to taking this matter further.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, I am very pleased with today’s debate, since it has shown that our positions are converging, we agree on most points and, most importantly, we share working methods. I would say we have laid the groundwork so that, together, we can conclude this period of reforms under the present legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">A common concern has also emerged which, even though it was not part of today’s debate, is closely associated with it: a common concern for a Europe that should speak with a single voice and interpret people’s growing anxieties about the institutions. These anxieties affect not only our Member States but also the enlargement States, where there is a growing problem of distrust towards the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, many criticisms have been raised concerning the plurality of the voices of Europe, a plurality which Europe took to Washington after the tragedy. Let us not confuse this with plurality of presence. The content was absolutely identical: in Washington we spoke with a single voice, and after the discussions we left President Bush with the European position, which was a highly operational position, with specific areas for collaboration in justice and internal affairs and the financial problem of money recycling, fields in which we proposed lines of action on which Europe should come together.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe part of the citizens’ anxieties derive from the complexity of our working procedures and the fact that they are hard to understand, problems that the White Paper attempts to address – partially, at least – through enhancements to the democratic system and transparency and through greater efficiency and speed in decision-making, while fully respecting or rather increasing the prerogatives of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I confirm, then, at the end of this short debate, that we intend to arrive at a clarification of our respective functions, but no one questions the role of the European Parliament and the Council in holding political control over the Commission’s executive work. Not only do we acknowledge this control but – I recall what Mr Corbett said in the last speech – we believe this control is absolutely essential.</p>
<p class="contents">I also confirm – and here I must confess that the misunderstanding arose from a mistake by the Commission, something it expressed poorly – that the Commission does not intend to take any decision, either prior to Laeken or at any other time, without first listening to Parliament. We had insisted on the need for decisions to be made quickly, but in every case we must first consult Parliament fully.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyway, today we have made some progress. Mrs Kauffmann and others have made some extremely useful suggestions. The idea of organising a joint Parliament-Council-Commission working party to establish a code of institutional behaviour in the framework of the existing rules is a path I think we should explore. We need to be clear about this aim; that is, we must set up a procedure to streamline the decision-making process, because, I repeat, it is slow and poorly understood. The new procedure must make it unnecessary to systematically resort to committee procedures without detracting at all from the powers of Parliament and the Council, but rather enhancing their political responsibility. The Commission is willing to examine this path. With all honesty and without any ulterior motive, I wonder whether the Council will be willing to do so; we, in any case, are. For this to happen, I ask Parliament to be politically determined and insist on this approach. This discussion also prepares for the debate on the future of Europe, which is to be organised by the Convention. If we start out now in the directions outlined here, I believe it will help us later to find the institutionally most appropriate solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Today there was one point of formal divergence that we should discuss in the area we have described, which is the procedure termed ‘call-back’. I believe the current committee system is a distortion of democracy, which is why we have looked at it critically. It mixes legislative and executive functions, without there being any real political control. The call-back proposal apparently improves the situation, but in fact it makes the system more confusing because it makes it more difficult to separate our functions and see the difference between them. I think this is an area we should focus on in a future meeting of the bodies we have proposed, in order to clear up this point: we must work together for a system in which the Commission executes and the European Parliament and the Council exercise political control before measures are adopted. If there is always this possibility of call-back, Parliament will obviously end up taking on a strictly executive function. I repeat: let us work on it, because not only am I being perfectly sincere but it is absolutely clear in my mind that this is an extremely delicate point of democratic control.</p>
<p class="contents">We should use the same methodology with the agency problem. The Commission believes that in some cases they are necessary, but we must not multiply them <span class="italic">ad infinitum</span>. We should turn to them only when there are highly complex technical roles and they have an autonomy of their own. We agree with you that democratic control over these agencies is needed, control that should take three forms: when the agency is set up, and Parliament plays a fundamental part in this decision together with the Council; when its budget is checked, and it is Parliament that checks it; and when a check is made on the workings of the Commission, which is the body responsible for these agencies. This, then, is the Commission’s position.</p>
<p class="contents">Two other points have emerged here: these are points included in the White Paper or connected with it although not actually included in it. They are participation by civil society and the problem of participation by the regions and autonomous local areas. I believe it is essential for the regions and local administrations to play an active role, and in the forthcoming Convention too. If we really define Europe as the Europe of subsidiarity, we must be consistent to some degree at least, and on this I have no reservations at all.</p>
<p class="contents">On the problem of consulting with civil society, if we read the White Paper carefully there is no expropriation of Parliamentary, democratically elected bodies. On the contrary, there is a different discourse: whereas now civil society is consulted privately and indirectly, we are proposing that such consultation should be transparent and in the open, so that everyone can see where particular ideas and positions arose or where certain suggestions come from. This, to me, is a step forward. I understand I may have created concern because, when faced with such clear evidence of a process, Parliament may say, ‘But that is our job!’ I can assure you that we have the opposite objective: we must consult civil society because it is useful for us and it is useful for you, but consulting means consulting; it is absolutely unacceptable that this should be seen as an alternative form of decision-making that could be confused with or compared to that of Parliament. I say this quite clearly because you will never have heard the Commission proposing, for instance, to bring civil society into the Convention in a role involving decision-making aspects. I do think, however, that transparent, clear consultation is a step forward that we really should take.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat: it has never been our intention to attribute an institutional or constitutional role to consultations with civil society, even though we are concerned to understand what is happening within that society, and thus to keep our eyes open and ears tuned, ever alert to whatever is happening. In a certain sense it is like the suggestion made by Mr Perry to attend the Committee on Petitions, in order to keep our eyes open.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, please remember that the Commission’s proposal has two objectives: first, a more parliamentary democracy; and secondly, a more efficient democracy. In the discussion on the relationship with Parliament, the call-back problem lies in this context. We want a more parliamentary democracy in which the role of Parliament is clear and precise, but also more efficient, one in which the executive role is not continually called into debate by procedures. I believe this could be clarified with the proposal of working together on these issues over the coming months. This may be beneficial and lead to progress in future in our way of working, under existing legislation for the time being, in expectation of the great institutional reform process which should start after the Laeken Summit.</p>
