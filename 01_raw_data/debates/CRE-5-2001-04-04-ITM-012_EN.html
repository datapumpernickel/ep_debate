This report is on the proposal for a Council decision on four programmes to do with cooperation and exchange in the area of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. To recap: GROTIUS is a programme of cooperation between legal practitioners with a budget of EUR 8.8 million. OISIN is a programme of cooperation between law enforcement authorities with a budget of EUR 8 million. STOP is a programme to coordinate action to combat the trade in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children with a budget of EUR 6.5 million and HIPPOCRATES is a new programme concerned mainly with training for the prevention of crime and is to be allocated a budget of EUR 2 million. Including HIPPOCRATES is a good idea insofar as fundamental aspects of the programme, such as its duration, access and funding rules, tally with the proposals in the other programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has proposed extending the GROTIUS, OISIN and STOP multi-annual programmes by a further two years. In principle, we should vote in favour of extending these programmes because they have proven to be conducive – even though not all the Member States take part in them – to effective cooperation in combating and preventing crime, thereby helping to implement the Tampere conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s implementation reports confirm that the programme objectives have been achieved. However, an external study has highlighted persistent weaknesses in the implementation of the three programmes, for example in connection with the management and dissemination of the project results. There is also some doubt as to whether the mobilisation of project agencies has been improved by reducing the cofinancing limit from 80% to 70%.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of including candidate countries in these programmes at the earliest possible opportunity, simply because the reform of the police and judiciary in these countries leaves a great deal to be desired. I should therefore like them involved at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">The only real exception which I take to the Commission proposal concerns the time scale. I would have liked a single framework programme to have been submitted now. I am positive that, with greater commitment on the Commission’s part, this would have been feasible. The Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs would have liked a more comprehensive and ambitious programme from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">There are reasons against continuing various funding programmes separately from one another. It is difficult to allocate a project to a specific funding programme if it relates to a general subject, such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights, or to several technical areas at once or involves both Member States and candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Running individual programmes in parallel increases the probability of conflicting aims and makes it difficult to carry out a financial evaluation and check the coherence of individual programmes with the general objectives of the Union. It is also difficult for Parliament to keep track of the programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that most funding is for third party projects begs the question of whether the institutions have no priorities of their own which require funding. I am thinking here, for example, of asylum seekers, of victims of crime or projects to improve infrastructure. In addition, a separate budget has been proposed for pilot projects. The Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs therefore proposes that plenary support the Commission proposals but, at the same time, calls on the Commission to present a proposal well before the end of 2001, consolidating all the initiatives designed to create an area of freedom, security and justice on the basis of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union and Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community, in order to strengthen citizens’ rights and fundamental rights. So much for this aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters. It was decided to set up a judicial network in criminal matters back in 1998. This network operates via national contact points which advise and support local authorities. Following teething troubles of a mainly technical and linguistic nature, the network now helps considerably in simplifying cross-border investigations into criminal offences.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal suggests extending the method of cooperation between national contact points to civil and commercial matters, a measure long overdue in my view. I welcome this project as an opportunity to simplify judicial cooperation between Member States and, more importantly, to facilitate cross-border legal procedures. The activities of the network should, in the final analysis, benefit the citizens; improving judicial cooperation is merely a half-way objective, the final objective being to create an area of justice for our citizens, which is why the Committee’s proposed amendments specify that citizens should be able to take recourse to the courts and authorities in any Member State as easily as they can in their own, thereby incorporating in the proposal the objective formulated by the European Council in the Tampere milestones. The basic objective should be to guarantee proper access to the law and fast, reliable procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">I also see this network as an accompanying instrument for the purpose of implementing the Brussels II Convention. In order to learn from the experience of the judicial network in criminal matters, the new network needs to cooperate closely with the contact points of the judicial network in criminal matters. It would also be a good idea if the secure electronic information exchange system to be set up were based on the current administrative electronic data exchange programme. Here again, I would stress that candidate countries should be included at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">A central, electronic EU index of legal cases and a data bank containing a register of judgments would be invaluable to courts and persons taking recourse to the law. A detailed proposal on this has already been submitted. I am grateful for the amendments proposed by Mrs Wallis, which helped to clarify the text, and I am grateful for the support for my amendments in committee. I cannot support Amendment No 8 limiting the number of participants and agree with the Commission here. Nor was anyone able to convince me of the merit of Amendment No 13 on a pilot project within this network. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Strasbourg, Brussels, throughout Europe, throughout the world, across borders, crimes will be committed tonight, people will be injured, property will be damaged. In this respect, it is the right time to be talking about the GROTIUS programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Keßler, for her thorough preparation of the analysis of the GROTIUS programme. I think that this programme, Mr Vitorino, is one of the main elements in a European area of freedom, security and justice. I should like to make a point here, on behalf of my Group, of acknowledging the fact that the Commission has committed itself in this programme to what is, in fact, a relatively new area, given its original remit.</p>
<p class="contents">The GROTIUS programme will create islands of competence in the application of the law which we can extend one by one and gradually increase, because we can adopt as many directives, regulations and agreements as we want; if they are not applied, all our efforts are in vain. The area of money laundering, which we have just debated, is precisely one such area in which good progress has been made in establishing the legal preconditions needed in order to fight it, including at European level. At the end of the day, however, too little use is made of these instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">The GROTIUS programme will help to ensure that European law is not just law in the books, but law in action. I can therefore say, on behalf of my Group, that we are unreservedly in favour of continuing the GROTIUS programme and I should also like to say that it is European money extremely well spent.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the basic structure of the programme because it is fully and completely in keeping with requirements regarding the application of the law. Training measures, exchange programmes, studies, seminars, publications, are exactly what allow our legal practitioners to make use of European law and European possibilities. However, I must also point out that the requirements of legal practice are very varied. That is because training systems differ, the degree to which people are affected varies widely in the various regions of the European Union and, of course, the national judicial systems have very different definitions of what they expect from individual professional groups, be they judges, public prosecutors, lawyers etc. This was also the unanimous view of the Committee on Legal Affairs, which I am also speaking on behalf of here today. The Committee on Legal Affairs numbers a great many legal practitioners.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to illustrate this with a very specific example. In cities such as Frankfurt, London or Paris, training in European money laundering legislation may be crucial, while in regions on the border between Germany and France or Italy and France, it is a relatively minor problem, which is why – and this is the point which particularly concerns me – the flexibility of the GROTIUS programme is crucial to its success.</p>
<p class="contents">Although one measure or another perhaps meets all the requirements in one Member State, it may completely bypass them in another region, which is why we wondered during our discussions if it made sense for the Commission to set focal points for training etc. in annual programmes. We feel that it makes more sense to create a flexible, pragmatic, practicable framework within which those who wish to receive further training in European law can determine the subject matter themselves and tailor the various measures accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the programme and hope that it will continue to bear fruit for legal practice in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today in this House we held the annual debate on the European area of freedom, security and justice. Oddly, this theme of our citizens' access to justice in civil and commercial matters was not mentioned. This is very strange in an internal market where we actively encourage our citizens and enterprises to travel and conduct their commerce across borders. There is therefore a heavy responsibility on us to provide access to justice when things go wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal states that its aim is to create a European judicial area which will bring tangible benefits to every citizen. I hope it will not disappoint. It is a proposal on two levels. First, a network of judicial authorities and personnel to ease cross-border procedures in civil and commercial matters. But it is the second level that interests me: to give information to our citizens on how to pursue cross-border litigation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is difficult and not to be contemplated without competent and specialised legal advice. Our citizens are increasingly finding themselves involved in complex cross-border problems: road traffic accidents, buying property or a timeshare, actual problems that face our citizens. Whilst we move towards extrajudicial remedies, we must also ensure that judicial remedies are accessible. That is why my Group will support the amendment that was supported by the Legal Affairs Committee to secure a pilot programme of access to specialised legal advice. This should be central to this network – a network of judicial personnel is one thing, but a network that really provides cross-border access to justice would be the best way to recognise progress towards a real area of justice in Europe for our citizens, and this on the day of the annual debate on that subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Coelho (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, with this initiative we are extending the experience we have gained through the Judicial Network in criminal matters to the civil and commercial spheres. First and foremost, we have focused on the importance of cooperation and exchanges of information between the Member States’ judicial authorities, with a view to creating an area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mrs Keßler, whom I wish to congratulate for the quality of her work, warrants our support, particularly because it makes judicious suggestions, specifically on cooperation between this new network and the already existing network in criminal matters, on the participation of countries that have applied for membership of the Union and on the desirable and necessary transparency in the way the network operates. Above all, however, the report warrants our support because of its suggestion for improving information for the general public. It is worth bearing in mind that the ultimate aim is to ensure that European citizens can seek justice in the courts and authorities of any Member State as easily as they can in their own country. In order to achieve this objective, a public information system must also be in place which can inform Europe’s citizens of their rights. I believe that there is a lack of information and clarification in this area and this is another reason for welcoming the new competences granted to Commissioner Vitorino as the person responsible for generating improved communication and information strategies within the Commission. I hope that the qualities he has always demonstrated will enable improvements, which we can all see are urgent and much needed, to be brought to this thorny and delicate subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to say a few words about the programmes that are also under discussion. With regard to their importance, we all agree with the rapporteur’s suggestion that it makes sense to finance the various programmes under one framework programme: dispersion does not bring advantages, and I think that, in this way, we would be able to make gains in terms of synergies and clarity. I should also like to hear Commissioner Vitorino’s opinion on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to quote a few excerpts from a recent interview which was published recently in a Dutch magazine. International organised crime is more successful, more powerful and more dangerous than ever. The judiciary is meanwhile losing virtually all of its grip on major, transnational crime across the world. Whilst drugs dealers, human traffickers and arms dealers enjoy the full benefits of globalisation, the judiciary remains hopelessly caught behind its own national boundaries. This will be the golden era for international crime. Today’s international crime syndicates are global business corporations. They are applying the principles of what global business corporations should do, as taught at the Harvard School of Business: think international, form joint ventures and forge strategic alliances. The European Union, Europe, will become one huge Disneyland for organised crime. It is, therefore, crucial that a European judicial network is set up promptly. Not only for criminal affairs, but just as much for civil and trade affairs. It is both urgent and necessary for Europe, especially in terms of judicial matters, to organise itself professionally. We should, in this respect, perhaps follow the lead given by organised crime. Our Group supports both reports submitted by Mrs Keßler. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>  <span class="italic"> Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the chairman and members of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and the rapporteur, Mrs Keßler, for their support for the Commission proposals as well as for the information they have given on the strategy to reorganise the programmes, which was nevertheless clear from the explanatory statement of the proposals the Commission itself presented.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s intention is to pursue the action of the existing programmes for two years and to launch Hippocrates at the same time and for the same period. Essentially, the aim is not to interrupt sources of financing and to avoid any discontinuity in its action which would only serve to weaken the projects and the objectives that have been set. The de facto situation is that these programmes came to an end in 2000. It is imperative that they be renewed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the new Hippocrates programme for the prevention of criminality, which is one of the most important aspects of the fight against crime, it takes its name from the celebrated Greek physician, for whom prevention was better than cure, and is based on the experience gained by the Commission in other programmes under Title VI of the Treaty on European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Bringing the legal base and the ways of managing the new Hippocrates programme into line with the other programmes will, I am sure, simplify the management and utilisation of financing programmes which are now running smoothly after five years of experience on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">In Mrs Keßler’s draft report, the merger of the different programmes is clearly indicated within a timeframe which, in fact, coincides with that put forward by the Commission. This method will, moreover, enable the Commission to rationalise the management of the programmes and to integrate them into a general framework which corresponds to the area of freedom, security and justice called for by the Treaties, by the Vienna action plan and by the conclusions of the Tampere European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s objective is to integrate all the programmes into a coherent block. This may lead to the presentation of framework programmes under Title VI of the Treaty on European Union and Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community and of another in the context of asylum and immigration which, in my opinion, merits a different type of treatment to the other objectives. This strategy to merge the programmes will, I am sure, strengthen the effectiveness of management and transparency and will help to better inform the European Parliament about what will follow.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is therefore absolutely on the same wavelength as the European Parliament and I can only welcome this. But our main concern, naturally, is to prepare this coordination in the correct manner. That is why the Commission will pursue the debate which is already under way and will make the most of the time available to it to extract the essential elements. We will present our proposals for consolidating the programmes along the lines indicated in Mrs Keßler’s report by the end of 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">We are counting on constructive dialogue with, and the support of, the European Parliament to make this operation a success.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to the Commission proposal for a Council decision establishing a European judicial network in civil and commercial matters. As you are aware, Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union states that the aim of the European Union is to maintain and develop an area of freedom, security and justice. The Vienna action plan and the conclusions of the Tampere Summit recognised that citizens could only enjoy freedom in an area of justice in which they could gain access to the courts and to the authorities of all Member States as easily as in their own countries. In an amendment you propose, quite rightly, spelling this out in the text of the decision we are debating today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Vienna action plan and the Tampere Summit were very precise as regards the domain we are dealing with. They called upon us to study the possibility of extending the principle of a judicial network to the civil domain and to establish an information system which citizens could access easily and which would be supported by a network of national authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore in this context, which was sketched out by the Treaty on European Union, the Vienna action plan and the Tampere Summit, that the proposal for a decision we are debating today is enshrined.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, we are seeking tangible benefits for all our citizens. We want them to be able to turn to the courts of any Member State just as easily as they can to those in their own country, so that individuals and companies alike can exercise their rights. And we want to achieve this by putting in place a bipartite mechanism, to both parts of which, I hasten to add, we attach the same importance.</p>
<p class="contents">The first part is about establishing a flexible, non-bureaucratic structure which will ease the flow of judicial cooperation between Member States. This is already the case in the criminal domain, from our experience with which we have learned a great deal. The second part, which is just as important, is about going beyond what is currently being done in the criminal domain and putting in place a system to provide all citizens with easily comprehensible and accessible information which will help them to overcome their reluctance to defend their rights in a Member State other than their own and will thus ease their access to justice in this Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Keßler, as well as the draftspersons of the opinion of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, Mrs Wallis and Mrs Wenzel-Perillo, for the support they have given to our initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the proposals for amendments contained in the legislative proposal, first of all I can accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 5 and 9. I would like to point out however that, in connection with Amendment No 3, we do not see an obstacle to future instruments being able to provide specific cooperation mechanisms. Concerning Amendment No 9, on the other hand, it is fitting to allow a certain margin of flexibility in its operation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Amendment No 4, the Commission has its doubts. However, this does not mean that the Commission rejects the idea of developing databases in the field of judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters. On the contrary, we would like to be able to develop such databases in this field provided, for example, they can be of significant assistance for monitoring the implementation of adopted or future instruments. We also believe the network may be very useful for this purpose. That is why, although we are unable to accept the amendment as it stands, in response to the wishes expressed by Parliament, I would like to clearly point out in the recitals that the network may collaborate in the development of specific, precisely targeted projects in this field, for which priorities will be duly established in the light of the immediate actions of the civil judicial network.</p>
<p class="contents">Another amendment that the Commission cannot accept as it stands but whose essence will be written into the text of the decision is Amendment No 7. The Commission would, in fact, like the network to be able to use the services offered by the IDA programme as far as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also able to accept part of Amendments Nos 10 and 11 and stresses that the prescribed 3-year period will start once the network is actually up and running. Nonetheless, I have to admit that the presentation of annual statistical reports seems to us to be an excessive burden on the network.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission is unable to accept Amendment No 8 and has its doubts about Amendment No 6 concerning collaboration with the judicial network in criminal matters. We will do everything within our power to ensure that this collaboration is put into practice. Nonetheless, given the differing legal basis and pillar between civil judicial cooperation and criminal judicial cooperation, it does not seem appropriate to incorporate into the text what, in any case, will be done in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, through this proposal we hope to put in place an effective instrument which will enable us to achieve our ultimate goal: to bring about a European area of freedom, security and justice in civil and commercial matters. This is something which affects not only the will and the everyday lives of our citizens but also the proper functioning of the single market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
