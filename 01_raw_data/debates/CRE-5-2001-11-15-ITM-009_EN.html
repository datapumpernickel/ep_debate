And in this case, revealing the truth can only lead to condemnation.</p>
<p class="contents">The world of road transport seems to have broken free from any legal framework, from any control standards. Freight companies exempt themselves from having operating permits, work permits are becoming optional for drivers who increasingly come from outside the Union, when their driving times verge on the limit and when they themselves verge on sleep. How many more Gotthards and Mont Blancs must go up in flames before they are covered by strict legislation, by an effective system of controls which is both harmonised and trans-European? The residents of all sensitive or high-density areas and all professionals are calling for Europe to intervene and the matter is of the greatest urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">The most sensible course of action would now be to set up safety escorts for convoys of lorries in every major tunnel. Until this first safety measure is put in place, lives will still be in danger when these two accident-stricken tunnels are reopened. We must no longer be asked to show patience over this harmonisation of safety standards for tunnels. Instead, the finger must be clearly pointed and this political nervousness, this lack of commitment on the part of public authorities to the costly but necessary restructuring of underground tunnels must be condemned. Although a review of practices in the road transport sector is required, an in-depth discussion of our transport policy is no less needed. The tragedies that have taken place in these tunnels demonstrate the physical and ideological shortcomings of the ‘everything by road’ approach, which clogs up transport links and chokes the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us open up our eyes, then, and cast off the blinkers that force us to see only roads, and we will finally see the entire European network of stations and railway lines that are almost completely overlooked in terms of providing piggyback transport. We will see that some ports, such as those in Italy, offer transit options that are likely to reduce traffic considerably on the road links of European trade. The memory of the victims of Gotthard and Mont Blanc must inspire us to adopt a new approach, one that is more forward looking and more respectful of our means of transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact even then we were already discussing the tragic accident in the Gotthard Tunnel. If we continue just to talk about this and do not take any measures then we will have to be prepared for the fact that there will be more accidents in these delicate and sensitive areas, in particular in the Alps. However, in my opinion, and on the basis of my understanding of politics, this is unacceptable. That is why we must do all we can to actually implement the proposals which the Commission has already rightly made in its White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no doubt that specific safety measures are also needed in the tunnels. I have no doubt that stricter monitoring of working time, above all, is also required. I hope that we will soon conclude the conciliation on this and that we will then move on to implementing and monitoring the measures on working time across Europe. However, the fundamental problem is surely that there is too much freight rumbling through the Alps by road in heavy goods vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">This is certainly not – as time and again it is wrongly assumed, appealing to popular sentiment – about standing in the way of economic links and cohesion; it is simply about this cohesion, these economic links and trade in general being created in a way which firstly is environmentally sustainable and secondly minimises the risk of accidents. We will never be able to avoid them altogether, but we can minimise them and in so doing we can also above all give the railways a golden opportunity. I – and I myself have also produced a report on opening up international freight routes – am in favour of the railways being stronger competitors here. At the same time, I am however, on behalf of my group, also in favour of the transport policy, as postulated and laid down in the White Paper – I will say this once more in conclusion – being implemented quickly, in fact very quickly indeed, so that steps can be taken as soon as possible to avoid there being more accidents like the one in the Gotthard Tunnel. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament will, most likely, vote in favour of the resolution. We will move down the agenda and things will continue as before, because calling for an integrated transport policy for the whole of the Alpine region in one resolution is not enough to ensure that it is actually implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">There must be a genuine rethink of transport policy at European level. There must be the political will to confront the road transport lobby and, above all, there must be investment to develop rail networks to meet the needs of everyone, not just to make profit. This would require a radical break with your policy of privatisation and of dismantling public services.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the organisation of goods transport is inseparable from the global economic system. The development, for example, of the zero stock system, which is highly profitable for private interests, is an aberration from the social point of view, because it is responsible, to a large extent, for clogging up the roads. Giving priority to private interests, therefore, is bound to conflict with the general interest. This motion for a resolution, for which we will be voting, will just be added to the long wish list that the European Parliament is continually producing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the final day of the last part-session – 24 October 2001 – we were discussing the reopening of the Mont Blanc tunnel. There was a bit of an argument – some were in favour, such as yours truly, and some wanted to put back the date of this major event. Suddenly, into the middle of the debate came the news of the other incident in the St Gotthard tunnel, an unforeseen incident similar to that which had occurred in the Mont Blanc tunnel and which we had thought would now never be repeated.</p>
<p class="contents">Those in favour of opening the Mont Blanc tunnel to traffic immediately were once again advocating this line of action on health grounds, basing their argument particularly on a document produced by the operating company, which, pompously – and maybe rightly – stated that the Mont Blanc tunnel, rebuilt after the accident, is now the safest in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I remember announcements, official pronouncements, so to speak, describing the St Gotthard tunnel as the most important tunnel certainly in Europe if not in the world. Now we know that a very run-of-the-mill accident was enough in the past, is enough now and will be enough in future to turn these megasafe tunnels into people traps, and the many victims always pay with their lives. It is difficult to apportion blame for these incidents; moreover, that is not for us to do. However, one statistic does need to be mentioned here, for it concerns something for which we and, in particular, the Commission are responsible. Indeed, considering that five times as many vehicles pass through the St Gotthard tunnel as usually run on all the other major routes through the Alps, we are faced with a transport policy error, and that is partly the fault of Europe, for most of the vehicles, particularly the heavy goods vehicles, are European.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore put two questions to the Commission. What has happened to the directive on harmonising the minimum safety requirements for road and rail tunnels? And I would ask the Commission, what has happened to the action plan for an integrated transport policy in the Alpine region? When the answers have been given to these two questions, we can proceed to the usual road versus rail argument.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, I do not agree that heavy goods vehicles should be banned from using the tunnel. Road haulage contractors have a right of passage and a right to provide a service as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to push ahead on two fronts at European level. First, we need enhanced specifications and, secondly, we need to support motorrail services through the Alps.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission announced in the White Paper referred to by almost all the members that it intends to propose European regulations setting out minimum safety standards for tunnels. These standards will apply to technical equipment, traffic regulations, user information, training for staff operating the tunnels, for staff dealing with accidents when problems arise and for rescue services. It is a complicated endeavour which needs to take account of a plethora of different parameters, given the extent to which one tunnel differs from another in terms of geography, size and traffic density.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, the Commission is carrying out pre-preparatory work with the help of first-class experts, with a view to submitting a proposal to Parliament at the beginning of 2002. In the meantime, it also intends to convene a meeting of political and economic agencies operating in the Alps and the Pyrenees. Of course, even the best legislative proposals are no good unless they are adopted and applied. And as regards the safety of tunnels in particular, I should like to remind the House of other proposals which have yet to be adopted. I should like to remind the House of the proposal to introduce digital tachographs which allow the time spent on the road by lorry drivers to be controlled accurately and which several Member States have opposed. Or the Commission proposal on working conditions for lorry drivers, which Mr Swoboda has already referred to. Then there is the question of certifying professional drivers and the question of small lorries which constantly exceed the 90 kilometre limit and have become accidents waiting to happen on the majority of roads in most Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The fire in this tunnel also illustrates the need for information for tunnel users. It is clear that, had users been informed, many could have escaped via the emergency exit or by getting out of their cars immediately. And, of course, this particular accident again raises the question of freight transport through the Alps. The absolute priority, in the medium term, is to provide rail links to alleviate freight transport with motorrail services as quickly as possible and this is one of the major priorities in the White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">In the period between 1994 and 2000, the European Commission funded studies into the implementation of the new Lyon-Turin rail link. So far 60 million has been spent, about 50% of the total cost. This project, in which the Community is, to date, indisputably the biggest provider of funds, is one of 14 projects approved by the European Union Council in Essen in 1994 which, unfortunately, it will not be possible to complete before 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The Brenner rail route also needs to be commissioned as quickly as possible, in accordance with the 1996 guidelines on the western European transport network. So what can be done in the short term following the problem created by the closure of the St Gotthard tunnel? Immediate use should be made of motorrail facilities in the Alps. This accident, and its dramatic repercussions, are yet another reason to make every possible effort to shift freight from the roads to the railways, a mode of transport which only accounts for 8% of the market in Europe, compared with 40% in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has also taken new initiatives. In January 2001, it proposed that the Council sign the transport protocol annexed to the Alpine Convention on behalf of the European Commission, as a political message on restoring the balance of distribution between the various modes of transport. Because of difficulty in funding these projects, the White Paper proposes Community legislation laying down fairer pricing principles which take account of all the costs incurred for each mode of transport, together with safety costs.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the Commission has taken or intends to take various specific measures in order to resolve the particular problems besetting the Pyrenees, the Alps and other sensitive areas. And I can assure you that it will make every effort to guarantee users the highest possible safety standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
