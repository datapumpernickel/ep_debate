<p class="contents">With the fifth draft directive on motor vehicles, we want further to improve the protection of accident victims and, at the same time, take account of the requirements of the internal market. What are we proposing?</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, any loss arising out of a traffic accident in the European Union – whether those involved are from the same or from different countries – ought, in future, to be settled within a reasonable period. Otherwise, there should be the threat of financial sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the sum insured ought, in future, to amount to at least EUR 2 million, irrespective of the number of victims and the nature of the losses. I have doubts, however, as to whether this amount will be sufficient. In December 1998, a British judge decided the case of a Dutch student who had broken his neck in an accident and since been paralysed from neck to toe. The court awarded the accident victim compensation of approximately GBP 9 million, some GBP 8 million of which related to purely financial loss.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there are still doubts as to who is obliged to assume liability for an accident caused by a vehicle without a number plate or with a false or stolen number plate. In such cases, we need clear regulations in favour of the accident victim. In future, compensation should be paid from the guarantee fund of the country in which the accident occurred. Take, for example, the case of a Dutch hit-and-run driver who causes an accident in Italy with a vehicle stolen in Poland that has false German number plates. Who is liable? In future, it should be the Italian guarantee fund alone, which would obviously try to obtain redress.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the period for which a policyholder working temporarily in another Member State is protected ought, in future, to be increased to twelve months. During this period, he ought neither to have to register a new address for his vehicle nor to have to effect a new insurance policy. Those are only some of the proposals. They are really there for the purpose of tying up loose ends. At a later stage, we shall deal with the real problems of the future, i.e. reform of the compensation provided for non-material losses in the European Union. We discussed this last year in Trier at the Academy of European Law: in other words, the protection of pedestrians and cyclists as vulnerable road users. That was the theme in Trier this year at the Second European Road Traffic Law Conference: in other words, the accident victim’s right to claim directly against his own insurer.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider that to be a modern concept. The Commission should therefore set to work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Harbour (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, very much for the painstaking work that he continues to do on behalf of citizens and motorists throughout Europe in filling gaps in their insurance cover. Insurance has to be as foolproof as we can possibly make it, because that is what consumers expect. Many of us have dealt with constituency cases, because of problems or loopholes in insurance cover.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this proposal from Mr Rothley on behalf of our group, and particularly thank him because he has accepted a number of suggestions that I have made to him in this area and added them to his report. I just want to mention two areas specifically this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is an important provision that not only benefits citizens, but also encourages in a practical way the development of the single market. Currently, if European citizens wish to go and buy a new car in another country, they have to get special insurance cover for the period when they pick up the car from the dealership or the factory and bring it back to their own home country. Their current home insurer is not allowed to provide that cover. In Mr Rothley's proposals, they will be able to do that simply and easily. Cover can be extended for 30 days to encourage citizens to go and exercise their rights in a single market and shop across borders. That is something which the Commission, particularly the internal market Commissioner, Mr Bolkestein, will be pleased to support.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue, mentioned briefly by Mrs Gebhardt, concerns cover provided for citizens who take up temporary positions in other EU-Member States, such as students moving to a university wishing to take a car with them; workers on secondment or members of families moving to another country for a temporary period. They will be able to take their car and its existing insurance cover for a period of up to 12 months, without any problems. That is important. We know from complaints received, certainly in my case, from UK citizens that it has not been easy for insurance companies to provide such cover. Again, this is of practical benefit enabling citizens to exercise their rights in the internal market. In conclusion, I would like to say to Commissioner Bolkestein that I hope he will accept this proposal from Mr Rothley on behalf of Parliament and move as quickly as possible to bring these changes into effect in the form of further revisions to the Motor Insurance Directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallis (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, firstly I want to make it absolutely clear that I have every sympathy with what our rapporteur wishes to achieve in taking forward this proposal. As we have often noted before, motor vehicle accidents unfortunately touch the lives of far too many of our citizens as mobility across Europe grows. The Fourth Directive made great strides in dealing with these problems. However, I want to concentrate on the fact that the proposal "requires" Member States to implement in their national law the provisions relating to an improved compensation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">In essence, we have created a preferential system for European motor accident claims and therefore, logically, it makes sense to give those who experience an accident in a purely national context the same advantages. Logically, yes, but does this way forward respect subsidiarity? I am afraid not and this is an important point. I have therefore retabled an amendment to make this merely a recommendation to Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The point is that the issues raised here are a matter for national private civil law. It would involve substantial changes in tort law in England and Wales, for example. We would be putting motor vehicle accident victims in a class apart. What about the victims of medical negligence, industrial injury or any other type of claim against insurers?</p>
<p class="contents">At present our committee is looking carefully at the harmonisation of civil law. In that respect we have been rightly critical of a piecemeal approach, improperly researched. I merely wish to make the point today that this proposal does, and must, involve a much bigger debate with tremendous implications for our respective systems of civil law. It deserves proper and transparent treatment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gallagher (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, Mr Rothley's own-initiative report is indeed most welcome at this stage in the evolution of the single market. There is no doubt that the Fourth Motor Insurance Directive needs updating after 15 years in force. This period has afforded us sufficient opportunity to assess the effectiveness of the directive in contributing to a genuine single market for motor insurance. It is clear that there are a number of gaps remaining and that the insuree and the claimant still face certain difficulties which need to be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank Mr Rothley for his research in this area and for clearly identifying the areas in which the legal protection of accident victims can be improved. As long as there is room for improvement in this area, it is incumbent on us, as European legislators, to push forward and bring about a better set of conditions. While a certain amount of progress has been made, it is clear that a single insurance market does not yet exist. This deprives consumers of the best that companies across Europe can offer in terms of choice, in terms of flexibility and, of course, price. Motor insurance is a multi-billion euro business and further competition must be encouraged so that consumers can reap the benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">One glaring inconsistency in the motor insurance field is in the area of temporary residency. Current rules often place consumers at the mercy of insurance companies. This must stop. I strongly support the notion that citizens who wish to take up temporary residency outside their home country should be allowed to bring their personal motor vehicle without running into financial and administrative obstacles. The freedom to live, work or study abroad must mean just that – freedom – and not hidden barriers. Having to re-insure and re-register can be such hindrances. In my own country we currently have the shortest re-registration period, with only one day allowed. It is frequently difficult for temporary residents to obtain local insurance cover at a reasonable price. A one-year grace period during which the home country insurer would be obliged to continue cover is perfectly reasonable. This would mean one less headache for citizens considering temporary residency in another Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">We often hear in this House that European citizens somehow feel far removed from decisions taken at European level, that the issues dealt with are not ones that impinge on their daily lives. It is all the more welcome, therefore, that we in Parliament should take the initiative in matters such as this where we can make a real and tangible contribution to the rights and legal protection of our citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That certainly applies to the tens of thousands who lose their lives on the roads and the hundreds of thousand who are injured in road accidents every year.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly in those cases, but even if there is only material damage, the suffering should not be exacerbated by endless tugs-of-war with the insurance companies.</p>
<p class="contents">As cross-border transport, both in the freight and in the private sector, increases, so do the problems in obtaining motor vehicle insurance cover. Mr Rothley has specified these in his report and, in doing so, has underlined the need for something to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">While number plates now bear the European emblem, indicating the Member State inside the circle of stars, in many cases the number plate provides no information. Cars brought back from another Member State retain their old number plate for far too long while, on the other hand, it is made unnecessarily difficult to retain the number plate temporarily in another Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the minimum cover for legal liability is concerned, I share the rapporteur’s view that it is high time it went up. Unfortunately, it seems that EUR 2 million will be needed in practice to cover the damages in virtually all cases.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore support the appeal to the Commission in the draft resolution to send a proposal to Parliament this autumn. This period may be brief, but the rapporteur has already provided the blueprint for the proposal in this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that the Commission regrets the absence of Mr Rothley this afternoon. This is not the first time that I have had an exchange of opinion with Mr Rothley and his colleagues on motor vehicle insurance matters: I remember vividly the discussions we had on the Fourth Motor Insurance Directive: that directive has now been adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore I know that Parliament has a special concern for the effectiveness of the insurance cover which protects millions of European citizens who may become involved in motor vehicle accidents. Indeed, the most recent developments for the EU motor vehicle insurance framework – the Fourth Motor Insurance Directive to which I have just referred – resulted from a specific request from Parliament. The legislation was adopted last year. From the end of 2002 it will help improve the situation of visiting motorists, namely those unfortunate European citizens who are victims of a road accident while they are outside their home country. That directive was also a remarkable development because it was the first occasion on which Parliament made use of its new powers under Article 192 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament now calls upon the Commission, in my person, to take further action in this field. This time the object of Parliament's requests is not to fill a gap in existing rules but to modernise and reinforce the single insurance market in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say on this point that the Commission is fully aware of the need to modernise the motor vehicle insurance directives – after all, the first of these directives was adopted 30 years ago. For that reason, and in consultation with Member States, industry and victim support groups, in 1998 the Commission started a comprehensive exercise to review our insurance directives. That exercise is now at a very advanced stage, but has not yet been completed.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to express my sincere thanks to Parliament in general, and to Mr Rothley in particular for his initiative, which is in line with, and provides a new impetus to, the Commission's work in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also say that some aspects of the actions proposed in the resolution, such as a harmonised deadline for registration of vehicles imported from another Member State, may go beyond the scope of the insurance directives. That has already been pointed out during the discussion in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, when it was also stated that if we are to go in that direction we will require a different legal basis from that used for insurance matters.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, other actions, such as the insurer's obligation to provide a claims declaration, ought to be implemented in such a way that these actions do not run counter to the principle of the freedom of tariffs which inspires the Community's insurance legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to reassure Parliament, that even if we are not in a position to submit a proposal within the time limits requested in the resolution, the Commission will do its best to secure the rapid adoption of a comprehensive proposal aimed at modernising the legal framework of motor insurance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
