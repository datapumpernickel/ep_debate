<p>You will of course be aware that the question of human rights is always discussed at the annual Joint Council and Ministerial Meeting between the EU and the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC), which includes Saudi Arabia. The specific question of women’s rights is discussed with the GCC within that framework.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Council expects that it will be possible to bring up discussion of human rights, including women’s rights, at the next EU-GCC Ministerial Meeting which is due to take place on 26 May 2008. At that meeting the Council will present the EU’s view on women’s rights and listen to the view of its partners from the GCC.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-1060"></a>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 February part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Bali Action Plan marks the beginning of a comprehensive negotiation process to be concluded in December 2009 at the Copenhagen Conference at which it will be necessary to discuss, inter alia, the shared vision for long-term cooperative action, mitigation, adjustment, technology and funding. If I may, I will set out the component parts in greater detail.</p>
<p>The first component, that is to say the shared vision for long-term cooperative action, including a long-term global goal for emission reductions, is of essential importance in guiding future joint efforts in the fight against climate change.</p>
<p>The second component, that is to say enhanced national and international mitigation action, is set out in a carefully worded text which balances the action of the developed countries and that of the developing countries.</p>
<p>The Bali Action Plan has also brought the USA back into the UN process. Furthermore, the traditional line which had divided Annex I parties and non-Annex I parties since 1992 was abandoned in the text of that resolution. A clear distinction was also established between the action to be taken by developed countries and that to be taken by developing countries in order to prevent the developed countries from using this opportunity to abandon their quantified emission reduction commitments.</p>
<p>The third component, that is to say enhanced action on adaptation, will include international cooperation to support urgent implementation of adaptation actions, risk management and risk reduction strategies, disaster reduction strategies, and an increase in economic diversification.</p>
<p>The fourth component includes enhanced action on technology development and transfer to support action on mitigation and adaptation, and the fifth component relates to enhanced action on the provision of financial resources and investment to support action on mitigation and adaptation and technology cooperation.</p>
<p>The text of the resolution contains all the items which the EU called for and in no way prejudices the final outcome of the negotiations on them. A final assessment of the Bali Conference will be possible only in the light of the text drawn up at the Copenhagen Conference.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-1065"></a>

<p>According to the weekly 'Der Spiegel' (January 2008), the German authorities are planning to exchange a hostage of German nationality, Donald Klein, who has been held by the Iranian authorities since 2005, for a number of terrorists belonging to the Iranian satellite organisation active in Lebanon, Hezbollah, among them the ringleader of the terrorist operation of the Iranian regime which resulted in the elimination of four opposition figures in the Mykonos restaurant in Berlin in 1992.</p>
<p>The Federal Court of Berlin concluded that the terrorist act was the brainchild of Iran's spiritual leader, Ali Khameini, and the former Iranian president, Ali Hashemi-Rafsanjani.</p>
<p>There have been recent press reports concerning the release of those responsible for these assassinations of Iranian opposition figures.</p>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 February part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>As regards the possibilities of promoting and developing transalpine routes, as the member will no doubt be aware, and in accordance with Decision No 884/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 amending Decision No 1692/96/EC on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network, the priorities of the trans-European transport network include: establishment and development of the key links and interconnections needed, inter alia, to fill in missing sections, complete major routes and overcome natural obstacles, and integration of security and environmental concerns into the design and implementation of the network. Article 8 of the abovementioned decision further states that the Member States must also take account of environmental protection in connection with the trans-European transport network.</p>
<p>Mention should be made of the two priorities set out in Annex II to the abovementioned decision, namely the rail link Berlin-Verona/Milan-Bologna-Naples-Messina-Palermo and ‘Priority Project No 6’, the rail link Lyon-Turin-Venice-Ljubljana-Budapest. According to the progress report drawn up by the project coordinator Karel Van Miert in July 2007, activity on the rail link Berlin-Verona/Milan-Bologna-Naples-Messina-Palermo has progressed swiftly in the second year and a memorandum of understanding on the Brenner Tunnel has been signed between Austria and Italy. In December 2007 the Commission adopted a decision on the request for cofunding for the Brenner Tunnel.</p>
<p>‘Priority Project No 6’ - the rail link Lyon-Turin-Venice-Ljubljana-Budapest - also resolves the problem of crossing the Alps, that is to say from west to east. This priority also includes the Mont Cenis Tunnel, which is already under construction and is a cross-border project of Italy and France. In connection with this project mention should also be made of the Trieste–Divača link in respect of which the Commission approved cofunding for drafting design documentation and preparatory work in December 2007. Activities on that project are under way and a memorandum of understanding between Italy and Slovenia concerning that section was signed in July 2007.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0005"></a>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 February part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Slovenian Presidency will devote particular attention to the Western Balkans. The stability of that region is of crucial importance for the security and prosperity of the entire EU. A number of events can be expected during the transition process in 2008: a review of the 2003 Thessaloniki Agenda, conclusion of the network of stabilisation and association agreements, and strengthening of regional cooperation in several areas. The Council will continue to support the prospect of EU membership for the Western Balkans and bring it closer to the people of the region (primarily it will help prepare the beginning of dialogue on liberalisation of the visa regime with the countries of the region). In addition, the establishment of a Regional Cooperation Council will be a further important achievement of regional cooperation and an expression of enhanced regional ownership. The Council has emphasised the importance of regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations and the need for cooperation between neighbouring countries in seeking mutually acceptable solutions to unresolved issues.</p>
<p>In carrying out a comprehensive examination of the Western Balkans, account must be taken of the considerable progress that has been achieved in recent years: greater stability, democratic reforms, economic growth, enhanced regional cooperation and progress on moving closer to the EU as part of the stabilisation and association process. However, certain significant challenges remain: the fight against organised crime and corruption, compliance with international law (ICTY) and finding a solution to the issue of Kosovo’s status, the latter being the most important from the point of view of stability in the region. Therefore, the issue of Kosovo’s status is a key priority of the EU presidency. The Council considers that it is a European problem to which it is necessary to find a solution which will contribute to regional stability and the prospect of EU membership for the countries of the Western Balkans.</p>
<p>On 17 February 2008 Kosovo’s parliament passed a resolution on Kosovo’s independence. In the conclusions of its February meeting the General Affairs and External Relations Council stated that the resolution commits Kosovo to the principles of democracy and equality of all its citizens, the protection of the Serb and other minorities, the protection of the cultural and religious heritage and international supervision. The Council welcomed the fact</p>
<p>that the international community will maintain its presence in Kosovo on the basis of UN Security Council resolution No 1244. The Council noted that the Member States will decide on their relations with Kosovo, in accordance with national practice and international law.</p>
<p>In the conclusions of its February meeting the General Affairs and External Relations Council recalled the EU’s longstanding commitment to the stability of the countries of the Western Balkans. The Council reiterated the EU’s readiness to play a leading role in strengthening stability in the region, and recalled the European Union’s commitments contained in the conclusions of the European Council of 14 December 2007, as well as the agreement to Joint Actions establishing an ESDP Police and Rule of Law mission and appointing an EU Special Representative in Kosovo. The European Union will also continue to cooperate with the UN, KFOR, OSCE and other international actors in order to preserve stability in the region.</p>
<p>The European Council reaffirmed its commitment fully and effectively to support the prospect of EU membership for the countries of the Western Balkans. It asked the Commission to use Community instruments to promote economic and political development and to propose concrete measures to the broader region in order to advance in that direction.</p>
<p>The main objective of the EU presidency with regard to the successor States of the former Yugoslavia in the EU on the road towards the EU are as follows:</p>
<p>Serbia: the EU presidency will encourage Serbia to create the conditions necessary for the swift signing of the SAA and to make progress on attaining applicant country status, and will support Serbian leanings towards the EU, improve the EU’s visibility in Serbia and encourage Serbia to continue its successful regional cooperation.</p>
<p>Bosnia and Herzegovina: the presidency will encourage the political actors to create the conditions necessary for the earliest possible signing of the SAA, promote the prospect of EU membership for BiH and enhance the EU’s visibility. It will support political dialogue and State-building efforts in order to provide, through constitutional and other reforms, functional and effective State institutions which will enable the country to improve the lives of its citizens. It will also support efforts by EUSR Miroslav Lajčák and continue preparations for the planned transition from the OHR to a strengthened EUSR office following an assessment of the PIC and creation of the necessary conditions.</p>
<p>Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: the presidency will, in close collaboration with the Commission, support the deepening of political dialogue and continued implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement and encourage speeding-up of the reform process to create the conditions necessary for the next stage of the country’s integration into the EU. The presidency is aware of the name issue and encourages both sides to make efforts to attain, through a constructive approach and negotiations under the auspices of the UN, a mutually acceptable solution and thereby to contribute to regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations.</p>
<p>Montenegro: like all the countries of the Western Balkans, Montenegro is a possible applicant country for membership of the European Union. The speed of progress along the road to the EU depends on the speed at which Montenegro adopts and implements the necessary reforms. As regards signing a stabilisation and association agreement, Montenegro has made good progress. However, at present it is necessary to focus on implementing the SAA, building and strengthening Montenegro’s national institutions, further strengthening administrative capacity, and the rule of law and promoting the fight against organised crime and corruption. These areas are of fundamental importance to any functioning European country. The Council will continue to support Montenegro in these efforts.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0007"></a>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 February part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council’s position is that ‘the political situation in Palestine’ to which the member refers in his question necessarily requires the fostering of institution building, good governance, civil society contributions, support for the growth of the Palestinian economy, and the strengthening of the rule of law to prepare for the establishment of an independent, democratic and successful Palestinian State on the West Bank and in Gaza, which will unite all Palestinians and coexist in peace and security with Israel and its neighbours.</p>
<p>The EU therefore welcomes the results of the International Donors’ Conference for the Palestinian State last December at which over USD 7.4 billion were pledged to support efforts to build effective, democratic institutions and a successful economy for a future Palestinian State in accordance with the Reform and Development Plan presented by Prime Minister Fayad. The EU remains determined to contribute considerably to this effort in accordance with its Action Strategy ‘State-building for Peace in the Middle East’, which includes the broad range of its aid operations. The PEGASE funding mechanism, which will provide support for the Palestinian people, was also launched recently.</p>
<p>In its conclusions of 28 January 2008 the Council expressed its deep concern about recent events in Gaza and the grave disturbance at the border between Gaza and Egypt. It condemned the constant firing of rockets into Israeli territory and all other activities which are contrary to international law and endanger civilians. While recognising Israel’s legitimate right to self-defence, the Council called for an immediate end to all acts of violence. It reiterated its grave concern over the humanitarian situation in Gaza and called for the continuous provision of essential goods and services, including fuel and power supplies. It reiterated its call on all parties to work urgently for the controlled re-opening of the crossings in and out of Gaza for both humanitarian reasons and commercial flows. In that context, the Council underlined its support for the proposal by the Palestinian Authority to take control of the crossings, and supports the Arab League resolution in that respect. The EU will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to the population of Gaza and stands ready to assist in the economic rehabilitation of Gaza. The Council stated that the EU is ready to consider the possibility of resuming its monitoring mission at Rafah under the provisions of the relevant international agreements related to access and movement, which were concluded in November 2005.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0041"></a>

<p>After the 1999 conflict in the Kosovo province of what was then the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the criminal and civil justice system collapsed. Although the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia had jurisdiction over Kosovo, it was clear that it would only be able to try a very limited number of cases. Therefore, the UN established the International Judges and Prosecutors Programme to incorporate a limited number of foreign judges and prosecutors into the local criminal justice system. Regrettably, the performance over more than seven years of the International Judges and Prosecutors Programme has failed to meet expectations. Local prosecutors and judges are still not prepared for cases involving crimes under international law. Legal reforms essential for such cases still have not been enacted into law. No date has been set for completing the rebuilding of the justice system so that it can operate without a continuing international component.</p>

<p>The judicial system in Kosovo continues to deteriorate and the judicial institutions are finding it difficult to provide an appropriate service in terms of both criminal and civil justice.

<p>The Council is still deeply concerned about the situation in Sri Lanka, as demonstrated by the EU declaration of 8 January 2008:</p>
<p>‘The EU deeply regrets the Sri Lankan Government’s decision to abrogate the ceasefire agreement concluded with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in 2002. This decision and the current military campaign further deteriorate the country’s already difficult situation, including the humanitarian and human rights situation. Without the ceasefire agreement prospects of negotiating a lasting, peaceful solution to the conflict in Sri Lanka are narrowed further. The EU particularly regrets that the work of the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission will be terminated.</p>
<p>The EU has been similarly concerned by LTTE acts of terror in recent months and statements promising further violence from their side. The EU urges both parties to put an end to all hostilities and avoid further escalation.</p>
<p>The EU calls upon the Government of Sri Lanka to come forward with a substantive devolution offer around which negotiations can start, as soon as possible. For an arrangement to serve as a feasible basis for negotiations, it needs to go beyond past offers and the EU urges both parties to work towards a solution that would bring a peaceful and lasting resolution to the conflict.’</p>
<p>The EU is presently examining a proposal for a political solution to the conflict on the island, which the All Party Representative Committee presented to President Rajapakse.</p>
<p>It is clear that the situation in Sri Lanka has still not stabilised. The Council has therefore decided to send a diplomatic mission there to study the development of events and express concerns on behalf of the EU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0017"></a>

<p>The Basque Autonomous Community and the Autonomous Community of Navarre have taxation systems distinct from that of the Spanish State. The economic agreements with Euskadi and Navarre (Concierto Económico and Convenio Económico respectively) govern these tax systems. Although these systems are independent of the Spanish system, neither past Treaties nor the Lisbon Treaty attribute any competence in the field of European fiscal policy to the Basque and Navarrese Governments. This fact makes it difficult for these autonomous communities to defend their tax systems within Europe.</p>
<p>The Spanish State is not the only European Union Member State with different tax systems inside its borders. The difficulties Euskadi and Navarre have in defending their tax systems crop up repeatedly.</p>

<p>Under existing Community law, the imposition of taxes does not fall within the competence of the EU and in any event falls within the sole competence of the Member States. Moreover, the Member States alone are able to decide on the internal allocation of taxation powers to the various territorial and/or regional sub-units in a country. The Community legislature has no role to play in such decisions. The relevant Member States may at most call on it to take account of the specific features of national systems when amending legislation to harmonise Member States’ tax legislation.</p>
<p>The Court of Justice of the European Communities has consistently held that the Member States have competence in the field of taxation but must exercise that competence in accordance with Community law. Therefore, national law cannot be incompatible with harmonisation measures, where they have been adopted. Furthermore, national taxation powers must be exercised within the bounds of the Treaty and therefore cannot constitute prohibited State aid or a prohibited restriction on free movement. However, it is not the Council but rather the European Commission and the courts which establish whether or not national tax measures are consistent with Community law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0024"></a>

<p>The Council answers the question relating to the effectiveness of the implementation of Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA as follows:</p>
<p>Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA<a href="#defann_14_2" name="refann_14_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> of 25 October 2004 lays down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of illicit drug trafficking.</p>
<p>Under Article 9 of the Framework Decision, Member States are to take the necessary measures to comply with the provisions of this Framework Decision by 12 May 2006 and transmit to the General Secretariat of the Council and to the Commission the text of the provisions transposing into their national law the obligations imposed on them under this Framework Decision.</p>
<p>In a letter of 4 September 2006 the Netherlands informed the Council of the implementation of the Framework Decision in its national law and also submitted the text of the provisions transposing the relevant obligations into its national law. Those provisions entered into force on 1 July 2006.</p>
<p>As regards the question of how an individual Member State fulfils its obligations under the Framework Decision, it must be borne in mind that under Article 9 the Commission is, by 12 May 2009, to submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the effectiveness of the implementation of the Framework Decision, including its effects on judicial cooperation in the field of illicit drug trafficking. Following this report, the Council is to assess whether Member States have taken the necessary measures to comply with this Framework Decision.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>Azerbaijan has a huge number of refugees in relation to its population: around one in seven Azeris is a refugee. Some 4% of the world's total number of refugees are in Azerbaijan. The problem of 'internally displaced persons' (IDPs) has already existed for 14 years in Azerbaijan. Many children have known nothing but the life of a refugee and are living in inhuman conditions and do not go to school. The huge camps in which they live are hotbeds of social unrest, epidemics and crime. The government is failing to tackle this problem. The majority of 'internally displaced people' are being left to their fate, without proper accommodation, food or medical and health care.</p>
<p>Azerbaijan is bidding to hold the Olympic Games in 2016. Will the EU be putting pressure on Azerbaijan to tackle the refugee problem and in general to show greater respect for human rights? Azerbaijan does not hold democratic elections, the rights of the media are restricted and impunity and corruption are rife. Will the EU if necessary be opposing Azerbaijan's bid to hold the Games, bearing in mind that initial hopes that the holding of the Olympic Games would encourage China to improve respect for human rights are proving vain?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 February part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council attaches great importance to the refugee problem and also to elections, human rights and media freedom in Azerbaijan and thus devotes particular attention to these issues. These issues concern fundamental European values which Azerbaijan recognised by its membership of the Council of Europe and the OSCE and its involvement in the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan (ENP).</p>
<p>The European Union strongly supports the Azeri refugees and internally displaced persons and hopes that they will be able to return to their homes as soon as possible once an overall peace agreement has been reached. Furthermore, the EU frequently stresses that it is prepared to provide financial support for the reconstruction/repair of Nagorno-Karabakh and the neighbouring occupied areas when a peace agreement has been reached. This would facilitate the return of refugees and internally displaced persons.</p>
<p>The Council has repeatedly – in particular in the statement by the EU Presidency on the parliamentary elections in Azerbaijan dated 7 November 2005 – expressed its disappointment at the assessment of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) that in spite of some progress compared with previous elections the 6 November 2005 parliamentary elections fell short of many OSCE obligations and Council of Europe obligations and standards with regard to democratic elections. The European Union is now encouraging Azerbaijan to increase its efforts to establish democracy, having regard to the fact that presidential elections will take place in October 2008.</p>
<p>In recent months the EU has repeatedly expressed its concern at the worsening of the situation in the country with regard to human rights and fundamental freedoms. These developments will have to be closely monitored in the run-up to the presidential elections.</p>
<p>EUSR Peter Semneby and SG/HR Personal Representative on Human Rights Riina Kionka visited Baku together in July 2007 to encourage further dialogue on the media.</p>
<p>A statement on the sentencing of Eynulla Fatullayev in Azerbaijan was published on behalf of the European Union on 8 November 2007.</p>
<p>On 8 January 2008 the European Union expressed its pleasure at the pardoning by President Aliyev of 119 prisoners, including several imprisoned journalists, and its belief that the presidential pardon is a positive step towards Azerbaijan’s fulfilment of international and European obligations with regard to freedom of the press. Nevertheless, the EU remains concerned that three journalists (Mirza Sakit Zahidov, Ganimat Zahid and Eynulla Fatullayev) are still in prison. It called upon the Azerbaijani authorities to release or pardon them at the earliest opportunity. In addition, it supports the introduction of a moratorium on proceedings for defamation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the EU will – also within the framework of cooperation with the OSCE and the Council of Europe – continue to take every opportunity to express its concerns about the refugee problem, elections, human rights and media freedom in Azerbaijan. It has already done so at meetings of the EU-Azerbaijan Cooperation Committee (in Baku on 28 September 2007) and the EU-Azerbaijan Cooperation Council (in Luxembourg on 16 October 2007).</p>
<p>The European Union Special Representative for the Southern Caucasus, Ambassador Peter Semneby, is also helping Azerbaijan implement political and economic reforms, in particular in the field of the rule of law, democratisation, human rights, good governance, development and poverty reduction. During his visits to Azerbaijan Ambassador Semneby also meets members of the opposition party in that country.</p>
<p>The Council therefore intends to keep monitoring very closely developments in Azerbaijan in those respects and, where necessary, to discuss them with the Azerbaijani authorities. One such opportunity for discussions with the Azerbaijani authorities was presented by the visit of the EU Troika foreign ministers to Baku on 4 February 2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0029"></a>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 February part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council would like to thank the member who has expressed interest in this important matter. Reducing the burden of cancer is a priority of the Slovenian Presidency in the field of public health. On the basis of discussions as part of the conference entitled ‘The Burden of Cancer – How Can It Be Reduced?’ held in Brdo (Slovenia) on 7 and 8 February 2008, the Presidency will draw up conclusions on cancer which the Council will adopt on 10 June 2008.</p>
<p>Considerable inequalities and gaps in terms of cancer mortality, morbidity and survival rates have existed for a long time within and between the Member States. The reasons for these differences are the very different levels of service as regards disease prevention, diagnostics, treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care. In its draft conclusions the Council therefore stresses the need in the EU to adopt an overall cancer prevention and control strategy which will help remove gaps in diagnostics, treatment and care.</p>
<p>Although it should be stressed that the organisation and provision of health services and care, such as are required where cancer is discovered for example, fall within the exclusive competence of the Member States, in its draft conclusions the Presidency proposes that the Council call upon the Member States to give cancer patients the best possible care. However, this is possible only with the aid of qualified multidiscipline staff, the appropriate equipment and facilities and effective diagnostics and medicines.</p>
<p>The European Commission has announced two sets of European guidelines for best practice in the screening and diagnosis of breast and cervical cancer (guidelines on colorectal cancer are to be drawn up by 2009). These guidelines demonstrate the role the European Union can have – in collaboration with national governments, professional organisations and civil society – in preserving and improving the health of European citizens.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0058"></a>

Following the recent conference entitled ‘The Burden of Cancer – How Can It Be Reduced?’, which was held in Brdo (Slovenia) on 7 and 8 February 2008, the Presidency will present Council conclusions on cancer which the Council will adopt on 10 June 2008.</p>
<p>It has been demonstrated that targeted screening is an effective strategy for reducing the risk of developing and dying from cervical cancer. The Commission recently finished drawing up a second edition of the European guidelines for quality assurance in cervical cancer screening which should be regarded as a European reference standard and best practice.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a new field has opened up in the field of cancer prevention with the development of vaccines for certain kinds of carcinogenic strains. In its draft conclusions the Presidency proposes that the Council encourage the Member States to consider these new preventive measures against the pathogen that can cause cancer.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0050"></a>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 February part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Morocco has taken a strategic decision to move closer to the European Union. The European Union and Morocco are establishing increasingly close partnership in many fields. For the European Union it is a strategic partnership of fundamental importance since it involves a region where sources of instability continue to exist.</p>
<p>At the same time, the partnership with Morocco is founded on a commitment to certain common values. Respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms forms the basis of relations between the EU and Morocco and an essential element of the EU-Morocco Association Agreement. These values also form the core of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and were confirmed in the EU-Morocco European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan in 2005. The relevant issues, including the situation in Western Sahara and its consequences, are normally to the fore at all the meetings held as part of bilateral dialogue. Morocco is committed to these values. This is reflected in the significant reforms which have been implemented in recent years in the field of politics and also in the fact that Morocco is willing to discuss these issues with the European Union, in particular in the Subcommittee on Human Rights, Democratisation and Governance, which has met twice to date, most recently in November 2007.</p>
<p>Morocco has been seeking advanced status in its relations with the European Union since 2001. Since then considerable progress has been made. Within this overall framework and the framework of the neighbourhood policy the European Union and Morocco agreed at the most recent meeting of the Association Council on 23 July 2007 that they would facilitate ways of examining options to strengthen considerably relations which would grant Morocco the advanced status it was requesting.</p>
<p>The EU-Morocco Association Council decided that it was necessary to assess implementation of the ENP Action Plan. The Association Council also established an ad hoc working group which, on the basis of the progress made in implementing the action plan and the other plans submitted within the framework of other forums, is studying new objectives for the partnership and further steps to develop bilateral relations, including a large number of contractual relations, as already provided for in the Action Plan. The Commission’s next communication on European neighbourhood policy, which is due to be presented in April, will be significant in that respect. All this will be included in the discussions at the next meeting of the EU-Morocco Association Council, which will be held in the second half of this year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0052"></a>

<p>On the pretext that there is no ‘realistic prospect for a world without nuclear weapons’, five former chiefs of general staff and senior NATO commanders insist that the ‘nuclear first strike’ option remains an ‘indispensable instrument’ for prevention. The ‘preventive nuclear strike’ is part of the arsenal of the USA’s bellicose, imperialist policy. Thus, as part of their proposals for an enhanced role for NATO, the five former top officials recommend the use of a preventive nuclear strike, even without authorisation from the UN Security Council, when, in their view, there exist ‘threats to western values and the western way of life’. Their recommendation, which has already been presented to the US Pentagon and to the Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, is due to be discussed at the NATO summit meeting due to be held in Bucharest in April where it is certain to elicit strong reactions.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom does not participate in the Community’s common visa policy. Therefore, the Community does not have to take any measures which would be binding on the United Kingdom as regards facilitating procedures for applying for and issuing visas for members of the Olympic family to enter the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom may, if it so wishes, take account of Council Regulation (EC) No 1295/2003 relating to measures envisaged to facilitate the procedures for applying for and issuing visas for members of the Olympic family taking part in the 2004 Olympic or Paralympic Games in Athens<a href="#defann_22_1" name="refann_22_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and Regulation (EC) No 2046/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2005 relating to measures envisaged to facilitate the procedures for applying for and issuing visas for members of the Olympic family taking part in the 2006 Olympic and/or Paralympic Winter Games in Turin<a href="#defann_22_2" name="refann_22_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. These two regulations are based on the fact that Greece and Italy are Member States which implement fully the Schengen acquis and thus participate fully in the Community’s visa policy.</p>
<p>On a more general level, United Kingdom bodies can make use of the recommendations from the handbook for police and security authorities concerning cooperation at major events with an international dimension (OJ C 314, 22.12.2007, p. 4).

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 February part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>EU policy towards Belarus continues to be based on a dual approach. On the one hand, it maintains restrictive measures (the visa ban and assets freeze) against Belarusian officials responsible for oppression and abuse of democratic principles and, on the other, is increasingly willing to cooperate with Belarusian society, including contacts with the authorities. The EU has laid down the release of all political prisoners and an end to the arrest of opposition supporters and civil society activists as the first condition for the actual commencement of cooperation with Belarus. This message has been stressed repeatedly, inter alia in interviews with the High Representative for the CFSP, Javier Solana, for the independent Belarusian media in 2007 and also directly in talks with the Belarusian authorities.</p>
<p>The Belarusian authorities often infringe basic human rights as regards the political opposition, the media and freedom of assembly. Although involvement in opposition political organisations in Belarus is not unlawful, in practice it is impossible for those organisations to carry on their activities. Politically motivated arrests and detentions (albeit sometimes only for a short period) are continuing. Last year dozens of opposition activists were beaten up and detained. However, in January and early February five out of six political prisoners were released. Only Aleksandr Kozulin remains in prison for political reasons.</p>
<p>The Council is aware of the problem of increased visa fees for Belarusian nationals since the end of 2007 when the neighbouring countries which are EU Member States joined the Schengen area. The European Union does not want Belarusian nationals to have more favourable treatment with regard to obtaining visas than nationals of its other neighbouring countries. However, visa facilitation negotiations are necessary for the introduction of lower visa fees. Unfortunately, the Belarusian Government has not responded positively to the EU’s proposal for participation in European neighbourhood policy which would encourage that country and at the same time impose obligations on it. Consequently, it is still not possible to commence visa facilitation negotiations.</p>
<p>The Council is still willing to conduct dialogue with Belarus on the gradual regulation of bilateral relations, including relations as part of an agreement on partnership, cooperation and European neighbourhood policy, if the Belarusian authorities demonstrate that they are actually willing to respect democratic values, human rights and the rule of law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0061"></a>

<p>The EU has taken upon itself the role of driving force in efforts to reduce the greenhouse effect. A decisive measure in this connection is reducing citizens' energy consumption. The EU countries and the Commission should not, therefore, on the one hand urge Europe's citizens and undertakings to increase their energy efficiency and reduce their carbon dioxide emissions while at the same time imposing barriers to imports and increasing the cost of such measures by means of punitive tariffs on imports of low-energy light-bulbs from China.</p>

<p>The Council would first like to draw the member’s attention to the answer of 5 March 2007 to written question <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2007-0080_EN.html">E-0080/07</a> and the answer of 23 May 2007 to oral question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2007-0291_EN.html">H-0291/07</a> concerning anti-dumping duties on imports of integrated electronic compact fluorescent lamps (CFL-i) originating in the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p>On 15 October 2007 the Council adopted Regulation (EC) 1205/2007<a href="#defann_27_1" name="refann_27_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which extends that measure by one year following conclusion of the review. The aim of the regulation is to address unfair competitive advantages resulting from the export of such lamps to the Community and to find a proper overall balance between the wishes of consumers, manufacturers and retailers.</p>
<p>By adopting the regulation and restricting the payment of duty, the Council took account of the interests of importers and consumers and was able to affect the introduction of those measures. If those measures had been implemented for more than one year, their negative effects would not have been proportionate to the benefits which they bring to Community manufacturers.</p>
<p>The Council’s objective is to strike the correct balance between one agreed objective, namely to increase energy efficiency and reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the Community, and another equally important objective, namely to protect the Community’s industry from the trade-distorting practices of non-member countries. The questions put by the member were discussed and taken into account in the final decision on adopting the regulation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The online ‘EU Bookshop’ service provides several search functions to meet the information needs of European citizens in all the official languages (23).</p>
<p>The Office is constantly improving the site’s technical aspects, including use of all the official languages when ordering publications. This function is currently only available in English.

<p>Under the Third Community Support Framework 2000-2006 for Greece, an amount of some € 22.7 billions has been committed for Community assistance in the Greek regions from the four Structural Funds (ERDF, ESF, EAGGF and FIFG)<a href="#defann_31_1" name="refann_31_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. By the end of the year 2007, an amount of some € 16.6 billions was paid from the Structural Funds. This amount corresponds to 73% of the total EU structural allocations to Greece. However, it should be underlined that, late December 2007, the Greek authorities submitted to the Commission a payment claim of some € 2.5 billions, all Structural Funds included. The evaluation of this claim by the Commission's services is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Following the wildfires which ravaged part of Greece in summer 2007, the Greek authorities applied for modifying the Operational Programmes and Community Initiatives of the third programming period (2000-2006). This modification will not include any retrospective modification to the financing plans of the programmes. The programming period 2000-2006 has been completed and therefore re-programming is no longer permissible. Consequently, no transfer of credits from one Operational Programme to another, from one Priority Axis to another within the same Operational Programme, or from one Community Fund to another could be acceptable. The only modifications that the Commission could accept are those which do not require the modification of the financing plan of the programmes, namely, transfer of credits from one measure to another within the same Priority Axis through revision of the Programme Complement.</p>
<p>The Greek authorities also applied for a one-year extension of the eligibility deadline of the Operational Programmes and Community Initiatives of the third programming period (2000-2006). In reply to the Greek request, the Commission considers that a one-year extension of the eligibility deadline of the Operational Programmes and the Community Initiatives can be granted, provided there is a direct and substantial link between the unforeseeable event of the wildfires occurred in summer 2007 and the implementation of the Operational Programmes and Community Initiatives for which the extension is requested. Consequently, such an extension can be accepted for Western Greece, the Peloponnesus, Continental Greece and Attica, as these programmes concern precisely the regions where the wildfires occurred.</p>
<p>As regards the national Operational Programmes and the Community Initiatives Leader+ and Equal, the Greek authorities were asked to communicate to the Commission all substantive elements demonstrating that the aforementioned criterion of direct and substantial link is met. The technical discussions on this issue between the Greek authorities and the Commission's services are still on-going.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The appropriations earmarked for payments under heading 1a in 2008 come to over EUR 40 billion and, although they are higher than the sum proposed for this heading in 2007, there are fears as to whether they will cover the funding needs of the individual Member States. It should be borne in mind that the majority of both sectoral and regional programmes presented by the Member States for the 2007-2013 period were approved by the Commission. That being the case, implementation of at least some of them will take place in 2008 and requests for appropriations for payments will rise noticeably.</p>

<p>The question seems related to the expenditure under Heading 1b (Cohesion for growth and employment) rather than 1a (Competitiveness for growth and employment). The following information should be presented.</p>
<p>2008 payment appropriations for Heading 1b amount to € 40.6 billion, an increase of 7.5% over the 2007 figure. This amount comprises three components:</p>
<p>advance and interim payments relating to the commitments under the new 2007-2013 Financial Framework, which is the largest component;</p>
<p>reimbursements to clear the stock of outstanding commitments (RAL) for the 2000-2006 programmes and projects;</p>
<p>and a residual amount to clear the remaining RAL for the pre-2000 programmes.</p>
<p>In order to propose the level of payment credits for the 2008 budget, the Commission took into consideration:</p>
<p>forecasts of payments provided by Member States (for both programming periods);</p>
<p>analysis based on the previous years' payments execution;</p>
<p>experience with the start up of the 2000-2006 programming period.</p>
<p>In the budget 2008:</p>
<p>In accordance with Article 82 of Regulation 1083/2006<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> (Pre-financing), the Commission reserved sufficient payment credits to execute the second advances for all new 2007-2013 programmes. It is worthwhile to underline that most of the programmes have been adopted late in 2007 and thus the first advances have just been paid (in December 2007/ January 2008).</p>
<p>The 2008 budget contains also € 13.6 billion for execution of interim payment according to Article 86 of Regulation 1083/2006 under the new programming period.</p>
<p>In accordance with Article 71 of Regulation 1083/2006, before the submission of the first interim payment claim, or at the latest within 12 months of the approval of each operational programme, each Member State shall submit to the Commission a description of its management and control systems. The description shall be accompanied by a report setting out the results of an assessment of the systems set up and giving an opinion on their compliance with Articles 58 to 62 of Regulation 1083/2006 (Management and control systems). These documents are subject to the Commission's approval.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned requirements may lead to significant delays and in effect result rather in under-spending of the budget than shortage of funds.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The final date of eligibility of expenditure from the 2004-2006 period for Structural Funds can be up to the end of 2008 for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) and up to the end of 2010 for the Cohesion Fund projects. That said, the Commission has launched in 2007 the ex post evaluation of Objectives 1, 2 and 3 2000-2006, which will evaluate the impact of Structural Fund resources in all 25 Member States before the 1 January 2007 and will provide information on how the Funds were used, in terms of what the resources were spent on, what was achieved and the effectiveness of implementation systems. Results from this evaluation will be available in 2009. Ex post evaluation of the Cohesion Fund will be launched in 2009, with results available in 2010. The later date of the Cohesion Fund evaluation arises from the need for as large a number as possible of projects to be completed in order to evaluate their impact.</p>
<p>At this point, the absorption of Structural Funds – ERDF and ESF – is more advanced than that of the Cohesion Fund.</p>
<p>The current state of play as of 17 January 2008 indicates a payments absorption rate of 79.7% for the European Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), 72% for ERDF, 65.29% for ESF, and 44% for the Cohesion Fund (CF) for the ten new Member States. So far, all of the Structural Funds operational programmes have complied with the n+2 rule and no budget has been lost (apart from Slovenia for EQUAL and Slovakia on Objective 3). Implementation of Structural Funds programmes in the Member States concerned has been taking off in the last year and is now on track.</p>
<p>The present situation therefore indicates satisfactory progress in respect of project implementation and compliance with the planned implementation timetables.</p>
<p>The vast majority of Cohesion Fund projects are still ongoing and most projects will only be finalised by 2010. The final date of eligibility of expenses for the Cohesion Fund is 31 December 2010. Full absorption will depend mainly on the timely implementation of projects and the timely certification of expenditure to the Commission. Although the Cohesion Fund implementation is somewhat slower than for the ERDF and ESF, there are no grounds at this stage to suggest that the absorption of Funds will be other than very good. Implementation challenges can be observed particularly in the environment sector (Poland, Lithuania). The majority of the delays are due to the technical and administrative complexity of the projects in the environmental sector. However the countries concerned are working toward improving the progress of projects and addressing the administrative shortcomings and at this stage the expectations are for a very good absorption of the 2004-2006 allocations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0037"></a>

<p>One of the goals of both the old and new Lisbon Strategies was to make the European Union the most competitive economy in the world by 2010.

However, some regions in the European Union have natural limits placed on their innovative capacity by their geographical and infrastructure situation, most notably mountain regions. In the light of the most recent developments, what specific measures is the European Commission planning in order to improve innovative capacity in mountain areas by 2013 and thereby ensure the even development of competitive capacity, territorial cohesion and regional development in the European Economic Area?

<p>Mountain areas with their various disadvantages and considerable diversity stemming from their geographic peculiarities (e.g. isolation, difficult accessibility, climatic conditions) constitute a particular challenge for regional policy.</p>
<p>The Commission is of course aware of these problems and has been very active in pursuing a policy aimed at the improvement of the situation of disadvantaged regions i.a. by adopting the Fourth Report on Economic and Social Cohesion on 30 May 2007. It confirms the importance the Commission attaches to achieving greater territorial cohesion in Europe and to the particular difficulties certain territories are facing. The Commission will communicate the results of the discussion on the questions raised in this report in the context of the Fifth Progress Report on Cohesion due for spring 2008.</p>
<p>As you know, the new regulations for 2007-2013 and the Community Strategic Guidelines contain explicit provisions for mountain areas, thus creating the basis for progress in addressing territorial specificities in programming documents. Additionally, the Territorial Agenda of the European Union adopted at the informal ministerial meeting in Leipzig in May 2007 strives to strengthen territorial cohesion.</p>
<p>During this meeting the Commission presented also a document which assesses the way national strategies for 2007-2013 would propose to tackle territorial issues. One of its observations was that only a few Member States set clear and explicit interventions for specific types of territories. However, some € 6,400 million were "earmarked" specifically for mountain areas. As a consequence, the Ministers requested the Commission to develop further this analysis and to present a Report on Territorial Cohesion (Green Paper) in 2008.</p>
<p>This report under preparation and its adoption is scheduled for the third trimester of 2008 with the aim of launching a broad debate on the concept of territorial cohesion of the European Union and its Member States. It will raise a number of issues concerning the need for a more integrated approach on territorial cohesion in the future as well as the use and implementation of the concept at various levels and in different policy domains. This report will also cover policies specific to mountains and other areas facing geographical difficulties supporting a harmonious and balanced development of the Union. This common vision is essential for avoiding the fragmentation of European policies while taking into account the specificities of the areas concerned.</p>
<p>It is also worth recalling that under the European Territorial Cooperation and especially under the trans-national strand there are spaces among the 13 cooperation areas where partners can clearly benefit from the trans-national approach both from a geographical and thematic point of view. The programme "Alpine Space" 2007-2013 which covers the Alpine regions of Germany, France, Italy and Slovenia and in which Liechtenstein and Switzerland also participate, is an example of one such trans-national programme. Approved in September 2007, the 130 million euro programme, 98 million of which represents European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) funding, aims to increase the area's competitiveness and attractiveness through working jointly in fields where trans-national cooperation has been shown to be more effective and solutions more sustainable than acting alone. The programme has three priorities. In the field of competitiveness and attractiveness, the programme aims to promote innovation, entrepreneurship and research and development (R&amp;D) among small and medium enterprises (SMEs), to enhance cultural heritage and strengthen urban areas as engines for sustainable development. Another area of paramount importance to Alpine Space countries is accessibility. Here the programme will focus on securing fair access to public services, to transport, particularly sustainable and innovative mobility and also to connectivity which forms the basis for a knowledge-driven Information Society. The prevention, mitigation and management of natural and technological hazards is the programme's third priority. Enhancing cooperation in environmental protection issues, stimulating an integrated approach to conservation and resource efficiency are among the issues addressed.</p>
<p>The broad consultation launched by the Commission at the occasion of the 4<span class="sup">th</span> Cohesion Forum put forward the question how cohesion policy should address territorial specificities and how the global challenges affecting these areas should be treated. There is undoubtedly an urgent need to reinforce multi-level governance and to ensure consistency between actions to promote territorial development and the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0063"></a>

<p>The Commission Communication "Towards a Common Immigration Policy"<a href="#defann_35_1" name="refann_35_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> of December 2007 establishes the need for a stronger and coherent European approach towards migration. This appeal was confirmed by the most recent European Council.</p>
<p>This need felt by many European citizens is also reflected in the various instruments the European Union has at its disposition.</p>
<p>There are first of all the instruments in the area of justice, liberty and security. These include the External Borders Fund, the Frontex Agency and the European Refugee Fund.</p>
<p>The issues related to demographic change and specifically migration flows have indeed been one of the elements that Member States have taken into account when drawing up their national plans and operational programmes. Illegal immigration is one of these issues that affect both the economic and social cohesion within a region and between regions.</p>
<p>The framework for Cohesion Policy, through its Regulations and strategic guidelines, provide the interface between these European policies and the national needs and opportunities that have been identified.</p>
<p>The management and implementation of Cohesion Policy programmes financed through the Structural Funds is primarily the responsibility of the Member States and their regions.</p>
<p>In the above mentioned context, the European Social Fund (ESF) outlines action aimed at the better preparation of migrants and reinforces their social adaptation, while the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) also makes provisions – of relevance to migration – that could support investments and infrastructure expenditure in the sectors of public health, social inclusion, labour market conditions, cross-border activities and even activities in non-EU countries under certain conditions provided that such expenditure is foreseen in the relevant operational programme(s). The answer to the first part of the question is therefore positive. The policy has taken the migration dimension into account in its particular national, regional and local context.</p>
<p>The Commission reminds the Honourable Member of the recent Cohesion Reports in which the involvement of local and regional authorities in the development and implementation of immigration and asylum policies is stressed. These authorities, together with the social partners, non-governmental organisation(NGOs) and other local actors, play an increasingly important role in integrating third country nationals into society and economic life. A coordinated approach is needed, which includes ensuring access to education and training, health and social services, decent housing and so on. The reports also contain information on net migration and linked issues such as demographic and labour market change. The policy developed has also been fed and inspired by various calculations using social economic models and thus implicitly taking immigration aspects on board.</p>
<p>In relation to Greece, the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) for Greece for 2007–2013 sets out the overall strategy for Cohesion Policy. It takes account of the socio-economic situation in Greece, in order to develop a vision for the development of the country. In doing so, the presence of immigrants is of course a factor in the analysis undertaken.</p>
<p>The resulting Operational Programmes (OPs) address the issues posed by the presence of immigrants and focus in particular on their integration into labour market, with specific actions being foreseen.</p>
<p>The particular challenges posed to Greece as a frontier country in terms of illegal immigration are addressed by programmes administered by Directorate-General (DG) Justice, Liberty and Security (JLS). The Commission has elaborated a number of measures, based on the principle of solidarity, to support in particular those Member States such as Greece that are confronted with increasing migratory pressures. Member States are already working together in joint operations in the Mediterranean, under the coordination of the Frontex Agency, aiming at a more effective surveillance of the EU's Southern maritime borders and the open sea with a view of curbing seaborne illegal immigration and of preventing humanitarian tragedies. Taking into consideration that countries with a maritime border have experienced pressure of spontaneous arrivals of irregular migrants and asylum seekers, they should actively use the financial support available from existing or planned funding possibilities, like the European Refugee Fund, the External Borders Fund, the Integration Fund and in near future the Return Fund, which are allocated to the Member States in proportion to their share of burden.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In the Commission’s opinion, Directive 89/552/EEC, the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (previously known as the Television without Frontiers Directive), as amended by Directive 2007/65/EC of 11 December 2007, updates the European legislation to adapt it to the current European audiovisual landscape, the envisaged changes in the markets, technological progress and new advertising techniques in use. The reasons are set out below.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Directive concerned covers all linear audiovisual media services (provided on the basis of a programme schedule), irrespective of the technology or platform used (traditional broadcasting, mobile telephone, Internet Protocol (IP) television, etc.), and non-linear audiovisual media services (on-demand video or programmes). The result is that all audiovisual commercial communications, not just television advertising, are now subject to the rules stipulating that such communications must not cause physical or moral detriment to minors.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Directive stipulates that the Member States and the Commission must encourage audiovisual media service providers to develop codes of conduct regarding inappropriate commercial communications, accompanying or included in children’s programmes, concerning nutritional substances such as fat, trans-fatty acids and salt, excessive intakes of which in the overall diet are not recommended from a medical point of view. These codes, which are to apply to the media service providers themselves (and indirectly to sponsors and advertisers), are in addition to the new provisions that Member States will have adopt to transpose into national law the provisions of the Directive aimed at protecting consumers, especially minors, and must facilitate their application. Moreover, since obesity in children is a problem that is caused by different factors, the Commission proposes in its White Paper on obesity of 30 May 2007<a href="#defann_37_2" name="refann_37_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> a comprehensive multi-sector strategy promoting various measures aimed, in particular, at providing better information to consumers, facilitating access to healthy food, encouraging physical activity, etc.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the Directive recognises the importance of, and calls on the Member States to promote, media literacy as a special means of protecting families and children from harmful or offensive material (paragraph 37 of the preamble). The communication on media literacy in the digital environment<a href="#defann_37_3" name="refann_37_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> encourages actions that enable young audiences to develop a critical approach to commercial communication.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>European Network Information Security Agency (ENISA) has so far achieved very good results, considering its limitations in terms of funds and personnel. In only two years of activity, ENISA has proven, as supported by plenty of evidence, to be the right answer to Europe’s needs in the field of network and information security. All unsubstantiated claims about the ‘location’ of the seat have been definitively answered. Greece has repeatedly demonstrated its willingness and commitment to actively contribute towards the success of ENISA, by providing the Agency with substantial support. The presence of ENISA in Heraklion is also a significant step forward towards decentralisation and regional development in Europe.</p>
<p>There is a strong need to avoid wasting accumulated know-how and invested resources. We ask the European Commission why it does not support ENISA to continue effectively its successful activities by increasing its budget, staff and competences? Why are the tasks, competences, budget and staff of the new Telecoms Agency not assigned to ENISA?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission made proposals for the reform of the EU Telecom Rules on 13 November 2007. A key aspect is the proposal to create the European Electronic Communications Market Authority (EECMA),<a href="#defann_38_1" name="refann_38_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> to stimulate creation of pan-European services in a Europe without frontiers, and further strengthen the internal market in electronic communications.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s opinion, network and information security must be a key policy priority of the reform to enable all stakeholders, including telecoms operators and regulators to respond faster, quicker and in a coordinated way to security breaches and attacks. This is why the Commission proposed to enhance the security-related provisions of the current EU rules, taking into account the results of a public consultation last year. Notably, the proposed package introduces better instruments to fight against network security breaches and to strengthen networks against cyber attacks.</p>
<p>Even though the findings of the evaluation of ENISA indicate that its achievements were adequate or even good,<a href="#defann_38_2" name="refann_38_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> the Commission believes that today’s network security challenges should be addressed by ensuring new synergies between the work of telecommunications regulators and security experts, with a view to making Europe’s information and communication networks more secure. Moreover, these synergies should be utilised in assisting the effective implementation of the strengthened network security rules. This is why the Commission’s proposal includes a substantial focus on the challenges posed by network and information security in the broader context of the dynamics of the internal market in electronic communications.</p>
<p>The scope of EECMA is much wider than that of ENISA. EECMA will play a very important role in the reform of the whole field of electronic communication regulations. Because the activities of ENISA relate to a limited, albeit important, part of this field, the Commission has proposed a new Authority that will integrate responsibility for the activities currently undertaken by ENISA. A proposal for a Regulation amending the current ENISA Regulation to extend its duration until the EECMA assumes responsibility for its activities on network and information security on 14 March 2011 was necessary and has therefore been adopted by the Commission on 20 December 2007.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission recalls the scope of its strategy for mobile TV outlined in the Commission Communication of July 2007 on Strengthening the Internal Market for Mobile TV. In this document, the term mobile TV refers to broadcast terrestrial mobile TV services only. The Commission is aware that there are various ways to provide mobile TV, ranging from cellular networks to satellite. However, terrestrial broadcast is an indispensable element to develop a mass market for these new innovative services and this is why it is at the centre of the Commission's current action. The Honourable Member in her question asks for a clarification of the definition of mobile TV in the context of content regulation. As mentioned, mobile TV in its scope as mentioned refers to a sub-set of audiovisual media services which are governed by the recently adopted Audiovisual Media Services Directive. Like "fixed" television broadcasts, broadcast terrestrial mobile TV is defined as a linear audiovisual media service as outlined in Article 1(e) of the Directive.</p>
<p>The eCommerce Directive, which does not provide for a specific definition of audiovisual services but a general definition of information society services, also coordinates certain fields with regard to those audiovisual services which are provided at the individual request of the recipient.</p>
<p>Regarding the second part of the question, which deals with media pluralism, the Commission would like to quote from the Audiovisual Media Services Directive: "Audiovisual media services are as much cultural services as they are economic services. Their growing importance for societies, democracy – in particular by ensuring freedom of information, diversity of opinion and media pluralism – education and culture justifies the application of specific rules to these services." Provisions in terms of protection of minors or cultural diversity as stipulated in the directive apply to mobile TV as to any other service covered by the Directive.</p>
<p>Mobile TV is a nascent service platform which should benefit from a light touch regulatory approach. Therefore inappropriate obligations such as must carry rules should not be imposed. However, the main national channels, both public and private, will be most certainly in every mobile TV bouquet out of business decisions, as offerings would lose much appeal without them.</p>
<p>The Commission would also like to draw the Honourable Member's attention to the fact that DVB-H, the mobile TV standard favoured by the Commission, can carry a large number of channels, thus enhancing media pluralism.</p>
<p>The last aspect of the question deals with radio spectrum. The two Directives mentioned have no direct relationship with the regulation of radio spectrum. From a spectrum policy viewpoint, mobile TV services delivered over the airwaves should follow the same rules and regulations as any Electronic Communication Services, as defined in the current EU regulatory framework.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Communication on Creative Content Online was indeed adopted on 3 January 2008. It explores added-value actions that could be taken at European level to improve the competitiveness of the European online content production and distribution industry.</p>
<p>The online distribution of high value "creative content" represents a major structural change in the European content market. Such high value "creative content" covers music, audiovisual content, radio, online games, online publishing and educational content. New market developments also arise from Web 2.0, i.e. user-created content.</p>
<p>The Commission encourages the content industry, telecoms companies and Internet service providers to work closely together to make available more content online, while at the same time ensuring a robust protection of intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to stress that the debate within the Content Online initiative will also address the new advantages and opportunities offered by the new technologies with the view to strengthening the creation, marketing and competitiveness of European culture in general. In line with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention on cultural diversity, the Commission considers as a priority to support cultural diversity in creative content.</p>
<p>The Commission deems that there are four main, horizontal challenges which merit discussion, exchange of good practice and possibly a coordinated approach at EU-level: availability of creative content; improved licensing for creative content; interoperability and transparency of Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems; and an effective fight against piracy.</p>
<p>The market for online creative content is emerging and developments take place at a rapid pace. This calls for a twofold approach to deal with already identified challenges that need to be addressed quickly, and to launch further discussions on some of the existing and forthcoming challenges.</p>
<p>To help kick start the process the Communication on Creative Content Online has launched a focused public consultation in preparation for the adoption of a Recommendation by the Council and the Parliament. The public consultation is based on a questionnaire included in the Communication and the deadline for replies is 29 February 2008. The questionnaire focuses on three issues: interoperability and transparency of DRM systems; multi-territory licensing for creative content; and legal offers and piracy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in parallel, the Commission is creating a stakeholders' discussion and cooperation platform, the so-called "Content Online Platform". The remit of the Content Online Platform will include the issues mentioned in this Communication such as: availability of content, improvement of rights clearance mechanisms, development of multi-territory licensing, management of copyright online, and cooperation mechanisms to improve respect of copyright in the online environment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0043"></a>

The first report of the European Regulators' Group (ERG), which was published on 17 January 2008, now states that operators do not regard this as a major problem because relatively few consumers are involved. Moreover, it is possible for most providers to cancel charges arising from 'inadvertent' roaming as a sign of good will. However, we learn from an inquiry to the Association of European Border Regions (AEBR) that many residents of border areas are still receiving excessively large bills. Technically, it is possible to prevent inadvertent roaming by means of location using triangulation and by means of traffic steering. It should also be possible to inform consumers that inadvertent roaming can be prevented by switching off the 'automatic network selection' option in their telephone.</p>
<p>Does the Commission consider that the goodwill policy of operators, referred to in the ERG report, is sufficient? What does the Commission think of the idea of requiring providers to inform consumers about this and also to take measures at source to definitively put an end to the annoying phenomenon of inadvertent roaming?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Under Article 7 (3) of the Roaming Regulation, national regulatory authorities are required to be alert to the particular case of involuntary roaming in the border regions of neighbouring Member States. The Commission is required to report to the Council and Parliament on the functioning of the Roaming Regulation at the end of 2008 and will include the issue of involuntary roaming in that Report. In that context all national regulatory authorities, under the auspices of the European Regulators Group (ERG), have carried out a first detailed data collection exercise which, at the behest of the Commission, included questions to all operators in the EU on the issue of involuntary roaming.</p>
<p>As stated by the Honourable Member in his question, the ERG has now issued its Report which included responses from operators to questions that had been raised concerning inadvertent roaming. Operators claimed that inadvertent roaming was not a significant problem, with apparently relatively few consumers adversely affected. Providers claimed that information was generally available on their websites, and where a particular issue was identified by national regulators (for example between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland) providers generally took additional steps to ensure consumers were aware of the issue, in some cases offering specific bespoke tariffs. The majority of providers also reported that where roaming genuinely occurred inadvertently, charges may be waived as a goodwill gesture.</p>
<p>The Commission is now considering the ERG's findings and will shortly discuss this issue again with the national regulatory authorities to ascertain what further action could be taken by them to address this issue. The Commission shares the concern that this is not an insignificant problem for those affected. Also, following specific complaints, the Commission has recently contacted national regulatory authorities in Germany, France and Luxembourg asking for their comments and details of the action they are taking on this issue. The Commission believes that the initiative undertaken by the Irish and United Kingdom authorities provides a very good example for others to follow. It is too early to say what conclusions the Commission will come to on this issue in its end of year Report to the Council and Parliament. ERG will publish a second Report to the Commission in July of this year.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Commission believes that problems such as involuntary roaming are the result of the fragmentation of the EU telecoms markets into 27 markets. This issue can be addressed by its proposals for greater harmonisation of regulation including a European Telecom Market Authority to support the Commission and national regulators in regulating better, more speedily and more consistently across the EU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission’s proposal <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2007&amp;nu_doc=0699">COM(2007)0699</a> raises serious questions about its effectiveness and efficiency, because it ignores the significant efforts made and the considerable resources devoted over a long period, disregards the good results presented so far by the existing Agency, and discards a valuable asset of the Community in a key policy area, making no provisions for taking on board the staff of ENISA and their expertise.</p>
<p>The majority of Member States appear to favour a coordination of activities in the telecommunications area rather than a heavy-handed regulatory approach, a role that may be well fulfilled by ENISA, if a thin layer of competences in telecommunications is added to ENISA’s mandate (currently under revision).</p>
<p>The Commission is therefore asked: why is the Community value built by ENISA being discarded instead of expanding the mandate of ENISA with a view to encompassing the planned new activities of ETMA?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The mid-term evaluation of ENISA, launched in 2006 by the Commission<a href="#defann_42_1" name="refann_42_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, indicated that the Agency’s achievements were adequate in the light of the limited means at its disposal. They confirmed the validity of the policy rationale behind the creation of ENISA and its original goals as well as the relevance of acting through a European agency. Improvements made following suggestions by the evaluators and the Management Board are contributing to improve ENISA’s work.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Commission believes that today’s network security challenges should be addressed by ensuring new synergies between the work of telecommunications regulators and security experts, with a view to making Europe’s information and communication networks more secure. Moreover, these synergies should be utilised in assisting the effective implementation of the strengthened network security rules. This is why the Commission's recent proposals include a substantial focus on the challenges posed by network and information security in the broader context of the dynamics of the single market in electronic communications.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that its proposal<a href="#defann_42_2" name="refann_42_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> to create the European Electronic Communications Market Authority (EECMA) will stimulate the creation of pan-European services in a Europe without frontiers, and further strengthen the single market in electronic communications while enabling all stakeholders, including telecom operators and regulators, to respond faster and in a coordinated way to security breaches and attacks.</p>
<p>The scope of EECMA is wider than that of ENISA and it will reach a critical mass in terms of human resources and budget. EECMA will play an important role in the reform of the whole field of electronic communication regulations. The activities of ENISA in contrast relate to a circumscribed albeit very important part of this field, which is one of the reasons why the Commission has proposed a new Authority integrating responsibility for the activities currently undertaken by ENISA.</p>
<p>A proposal for a Regulation amending the current ENISA Regulation to extend its duration until the EECMA assumes responsibility for its activities on network and information security on 14 March 2011 was necessary and has therefore been adopted by the Commission on 20 December 2007.</p>
<p>A new Authority must be free to hire its own staff. Naturally, it will be hiring the best people that apply for positions. ENISA staff should have good prospects in this process, since they are highly qualified, have the right profile and in addition can put forward their directly relevant experience at ENISA.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission agrees with the honourable Member that it is essential for the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries to have an independent and effective media.</p>
<p>As part of the programming for the 10<span class="sup">th</span> European Development Fund (EDF), priority has been given to democratic governance in all its dimensions in the dialogue between partners in the preparation of the cooperation strategies and national indicative programmes. In that regard, the Commission and the EU Member States represented in each partner country have carried out an analysis of the democratic governance process and governance profiles have been drawn up.</p>
<p>The press situation and restrictions on press freedom and capacity are analysed in the profiles. The conclusions are incorporated in the programming dialogue with the partner country, which is encouraged, where necessary, to commit to reforms in various areas and to implement measures to tackle the problems highlighted. All press matters are thus an integral part of the programming dialogue, but they are also discussed during the regular political dialogue under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement.</p>
<p>As regards financial support, where the reform measures or actions envisaged by the government require financial backing within the framework of the cooperation between the Community and the partner country under the Cotonou Agreement, EDF funds may be used. Indeed, €1.5 million was recently allocated to the media support project in Mauritania for analyses and viability studies on press firms, strengthening radio services, improving the distribution of the print media, supporting radio and written production, and enhancing journalist capacity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, most of the media support activities financed by the EDF are part of broader projects focusing on democratisation, human rights and the rule of law. This applies, for example, to most electoral assistance projects, which have a component on media assistance, journalist training, logistical support for communication agencies and support for civil society organisations for the monitoring of media activities.</p>
<p>EDF financing can be usefully supplemented in particular by funds from the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), which does not require any explicit prior agreement from the partner country authorities. The EIDHR provides direct support for the initiatives of civil society actors. Examples of actions to support the press or promote press freedom in ACP countries include actions in Chad, Namibia, Rwanda and Sudan.

<p>The Commission has adopted a policy aimed at establishing and strengthening passenger rights. In line with this policy, the Commission launched in 2007 an impact assessment study on the establishment of rights of passengers with reduced mobility in maritime transport. On the basis of this study, the Commission is currently finalising an impact assessment that assesses different options in view of improving the rights of passengers when travelling by ferry or cruise, and more particularly passengers with reduced mobility.</p>
<p>It is correct that such initiative does not appear as such in the Commission's Legislative and Work Programme 2008.

<p>Officially, the Zambian Government aims to guarantee access to HIV treatment for all by 2010.</p>
<p>In a recent report, Human Rights Watch describes in detail how the Zambian Government is failing to provide HIV treatment for women. Numerous obstacles prevent women from gaining access to appropriate treatment; these include inveterate gender-based violence and the discrimination inherent in property law and divorce law. Human Rights Watch's conclusion is clear: unless the Zambian Government enacts specific legislation against gender-based violence and eliminates discrimination in other fields of the law, women will never enjoy full access to HIV treatment (report by Human Rights Watch, 'Hidden in the mealie meal: gender-based abuses and women's HIV treatment in Zambia', in: Human Rights Watch, 'Zambia: abuses against women obstruct HIV treatment', 18 December 2007).</p>
<p>Does the Commission endorse the conclusions of Human Rights Watch? How is this issue raised? Does not the Commission consider that the provision of development aid should be made conditional on progress in this vital field?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The report by Human Rights Watch to which refers the Honourable Member has been reviewed with interest by the Commission. The comprehensive review of the situation regarding women's access to antiretroviral treatment and in particular the qualitative analysis based on a series of interviews and focus group discussions provides important insights with regard to the impact of gender-based abuses on women's human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment. It can be assumed that the findings are equally relevant to other countries in Southern Africa and developing countries at large.</p>
<p>As noted in the report, in 2006 women accounted for 57% of the approximately 1.1 million people living with HIV in Zambia. While more women than men have ever been tested (15.3% and 11.4% respectively), and 61% of those accessing HIV treatment were women, the report rightly underlines the significance of addressing gender inequality and gender-based abuses as barriers for scaling up access to HIV treatment for women, and in particular to ensure optimal adherence for women receiving HIV treatment.</p>
<p>The Commission is equally concerned with regard to the marked difference in HIV prevalence in particular among young women and young men (in 2005 12.7% and 3.8% respectively), which is driven by and reflects the great and persistent disparity among men and women in Zambia, ranking number 130 among 144 with a Gender Development Index of 0.383. The situation in Zambia is also characterized by widespread violence against women including children, rape and sex-for-food practices.</p>
<p>However it is important to note the impressive progress made by the Government of Zambia and partners in scaling up access to HIV treatment, from only 1,483 people in 2004 to more than 122,700 in September 2007. In addition, the government has taken several steps to enact and enforce legislation and services addressing sexual abuses, including the creation of victim support units and shelters as well as the recent amendment of the Penal Code to widen the scope of sexual crimes, which has led to more severe punishment for sexual offences.</p>
<p>The conclusions and recommendations of the Human Rights Watch report correspond well with the support planned for Zambia in the context of the 10<span class="sup">th</span> European Development Fund. Human Development/Health will be a focal sector with the objective of enhancing human development in Zambia through secure, improved access to good quality basic health services, including equitable access to health services especially for children, women and disadvantaged localities.</p>
<p>The Commission works in close coordination with Member States and other donors to support the Fifth National Development Plan, where gender features as a full chapter with the goal to eliminate gender imbalances and attain gender equality, and also appear as a specific focus under the health chapter. The government plans to fully integrate the gender dimension in the monitoring and evaluation system related to the human development area, in particular addressing poor performance in reduction of maternal mortality and discrimination against women in access to health care including family planning.</p>
<p>The constructive and concrete recommendations of the Human Rights Watch report provide valuable guidance for government efforts to ensure women's rights, services which work for women and women's participation in decision making, and for the European Commission's policy dialogue with the government.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0004"></a>

<p>In June 2005, the European Council called for a period of reflection on how to take the institutional reform forward. In response to this call, the Commission adopted Plan D for Dialogue, Democracy and Debate on 13 October 2005<a href="#defann_50_1" name="refann_50_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. It experimented ways of bringing people together locally, nationally and across borders and of giving them the means to debate in an informed way about European issues. It also encouraged Member States to organise a broad public debate on the future of the European Union, involving citizens, civil society, social partners, national parliaments and political parties, with the support of the EU institutions. The main axis of Plan D was defined as listening better, explaining better, and going local to engage citizens. As a matter of fact, Plan D did not involve any extra money. The initiatives were financed through the re-focusing of the Directorate-General Communication (DG COMM) budget in order to make the Commission action more efficient and citizen-oriented.</p>
<p>The leading vehicles of these actions were the trans-national European citizens' projects co-funded by the Commission. Three were EU-wide<a href="#defann_50_2" name="refann_50_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>and three involved part of the Member States<a href="#defann_50_3" name="refann_50_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.The aim of these projects was to enable people from the different national public spheres to connect with each other and with the decision-makers. Therefore, the projects explored different ways of combining virtual and face to face communication as well as deliberative consultation and polling at national and European level. Overall, approximately 40,000 citizens participated physically in the six trans-national projects, while they reached out to about 1.5 million people via the internet.</p>
<p>Besides these projects, Citizens' Fora events took place in the majority of Member States. The "Debate Europe" forum was conceived as an online discussion space where EU citizens could exchange their views and opinions on a variety of EU-related subjects. Since its launch in March 2006, the forum has received thousands of contributions and over 1.3 million views. It won the European eDemocracy Award in 2006. The Europe Direct centres organised 3672 regional and local events with citizens. A special Eurobarometer survey on the future of Europe was published in May 2006 and some of its items were integrated into the standard Eurobarometer surveys.</p>
<p>In November 2006, the Commission decided to co-fund a series of regional and local civil society initiatives targeting youth and women; to develop a network of European public spaces in Member States; to re-launch the debate on the Internet; and to better target Eurobarometer surveys. Fourteen Commission Representations are now co-funding a series of local civil society projects covering a wide range of issues including the social inclusion of women, helping young people to understand better the European Single Market, food safety and climate change. In 2007, "European public spaces" were set up as a pilot project in three locations: Tallinn, Dublin and Madrid. These spaces provide information and documentation, host exhibitions, films, debates, forums and lectures as well as training and seminars on European issues. Using web-based multilingual conferencing facilities, they are also able to host trans-national debates. The "Debate Europe" website on Europa was re-launched at the end of January 2008. It is easier to use and will, for the time being, focus on three main topics: the Future of Europe, Energy and Climate Change and Intercultural Dialogue.</p>
<p>The listening, two-way dialogue approach promoted by Plan D proved to be well suited to the period of reflection of 2005-2007. The standard Eurobarometer surveys carried out in spring and autumn 2007 show a marked increase in citizens' support for membership of the EU, in the positive perception of the EU and of trust in its institutions. Although these developments also depend on other factors, the Plan D approach is a useful way to accompany the development of a European public sphere. It is a form of political communication which is well adapted to the emergence of multicultural and cross-border democracy in Europe. It is therefore destined to become a long-term framework for communicating with citizens and promoting participatory democracy on EU-related affairs.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Under the Tempus Programme, an amount of €20 million has been earmarked on an annual basis for the cooperation between academic institutions of the Western Balkans and the EU Member States in the field of higher education.</p>
<p>In addition to the possibilities offered to the students from all the third countries under the Erasmus Mundus Programme, the Commission has been offering through the pre-accession instrument a considerable number of scholarships for students from the Western Balkans. Specifically, €4 million have been earmarked on a yearly basis since 2006 for scholarships to students following an Erasmus Mundus master course as of the academic year 2007-2008 (“Western Balkans window”), and an additional €6 million have been earmarked since 2007 for scholarships to students and academic staff at all levels as of the academic year 2008-2009 (“the Erasmus Mundus External Cooperation window”). A further increase of the amounts allocated and the corresponding number of scholarships offered is currently under consideration.</p>
<p>In the framework of the Youth In Action Programme, additional support has been provided from the pre-accession instrument (€1 million in 2007, and €1,5 million planned in 2008) to expand the possibilities of youth exchanges and trans-national projects among young people and youth organisations in the Western Balkans and with the EU Member States, which contributes to foster inter-ethnic and inter-religious dialogue.</p>
<p>Inter-cultural dialogue is also promoted through the Culture Programme, which stimulates cooperation and cultural exchanges in order to promote the diversity of cultures and languages in Europe and improve knowledge among European citizens of European cultures other than their own. The Culture Programme is open for all candidate and potential candidate countries. The candidate countries (Croatia, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Turkey) and Serbia already participate in the Culture Programme. Candidate and potential candidate countries are also eligible to participate in the Europe for Citizens Programme. Croatia participates already, and preparations are under way for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania.</p>
<p>As announced in the 2007 Strategy Paper on enlargement<a href="#defann_51_2" name="refann_51_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, a new facility to promote civil society development and dialogue will be established this year. This new Civil Society Facility aims to contribute to open democratic societies in the candidate and potential candidate countries through strengthening civil society bodies and their role in the political process. The facility will cover three areas of intervention:</p>
<p>support for local civil society initiatives and capacity building, reinforcing the role of civil society;</p>
<p>programmes to bring journalists, young politicians, trade union leaders, teachers etc into contact with EU institutions (“people-to-people” programmes);</p>
<p>support for building partnerships and the development of networks between the civil society organisations in the beneficiary countries, business, trade unions and other social partners and professional organisations, and their counterparts in the EU to promote transfer of knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>Overall support to civil society in the Western Balkans through the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) will increase substantially, reaching an estimated amount above €90 million for the period 2008-2010, an estimated threefold increase with respect to the period 2005-2007. Assistance provided to civil society under the IPA complements support given under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR)<a href="#defann_51_3" name="refann_51_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Inter-cultural dialogue is also supported through projects on natural and cultural heritage as well as the cross-border-cooperation component of the IPA Programmes, which include projects for people-to-people contacts and other inter-cultural activities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Pursuant to EC Treaty (art. 151), EU competence in the culture area consists in contributing to the flowering of the cultures of the Member States, while respecting their national and regional diversity and at the same time bringing the common cultural heritage to the fore.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Commission is very active in the promotion of cultural diversity and is mainstreaming this value in many of its activities and programmes.</p>
<p>Intercultural dialogue is one of the three objectives of the Culture programme (2007-2013), meaning that projects supported under this programme have a strong intercultural dimension. The two other objectives are the mobility of cultural players and of art and cultural works.</p>
<p>Furthermore, 2008 is the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. The Commission is going to support many projects specifically aimed at fostering intercultural dialogue. Several other activities are planned in this context throughout the year in order to bring the richness of European cultural diversity to the fore.</p>
<p>In addition, under a pilot scheme for artist mobility voted by the Parliament, the Commission will undertake a feasibility study this year for a comprehensive scheme designed to provide a European wide system of information on the different aspects to mobility in the cultural sector. It will also publish a call for proposals aimed at funding networking structures supporting mobility at national level in order to develop exchanges of best practices.</p>
<p>All these activities will nurture the Commission's medium-term reflections with a view to preparing the next generation of programmes in the field of education and culture for the post-2013 period, in which cultural diversity will continue to have a central position.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0015"></a>

<p>Today, the provisions of Directive 93/119/EC allow for derogation from stunning in the case of religious slaughter taking place in slaughterhouses. This reflects the Protocol on the Protection and Welfare of Animals<a href="#defann_54_1" name="refann_54_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> annexed to the EC Treaty which insists on respecting religious rites when considering the welfare requirements of the animals.

At the same time, the Commission has no plans to extend further this derogation from stunning prior to slaughter.</p>
<p>As regards the drafting of a new EU legislative proposal on the protection of animals at the time of slaughter or killing, the Commission confirms that it has started in 2006 a process of revision of Directive 93/119/EC<a href="#defann_54_2" name="refann_54_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. The possible content of new provisions in this area has been widely discussed with stakeholders, and the Commission expects to present a draft proposal by July 2008.</p>

<p>The Commission is aware of the project concerning the gas pipeline through the Baltic Sea, known as the "Nord Stream" project. Indeed this project is included in the list of priority projects of Decision No 1364/2006/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 6 September 2006<a href="#defann_56_1" name="refann_56_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, as "North European gas pipeline". Article 13 of this decision stipulates that where an environmental impact assessment is required in accordance with relevant Community legislation, the results of such an assessment have to be taken into consideration before a decision on the carrying out of the projects is actually taken in accordance with the relevant Community legislation.</p>
<p>An environmental impact assessment under the Espoo Convention (Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context) is currently in process and expected to be concluded later in 2008. Similar questions related to environment have to be treated in that framework and assessed by the competent authorities of the Member States concerned. It has to be noted that consultations with other countries, contracting parties of the Espoo Convention are an important part of this process.</p>
<p>With respect to the specific question, it is understood that glutaraldehyde is to be used in pressure tests of oil and gas pipelines as a biocide to prevent bacterial growth that produces corrosion. This use of glutaraldehyde would be covered by Directive 98/8/EC concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market<a href="#defann_56_2" name="refann_56_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and would fall under product-type 12 (ie slimicides), which covers products used for the prevention or control of slime growth on materials, equipment and structures used in industrial processes.</p>
<p>Glutaraldehye for product-type 12 is to be assessed under the 10-year review programme established by Directive 98/8/EC for the evaluation of substances used in biocidal products which were already on the market at the time of entry into force of the Directive. Until the substance evaluation has been concluded, biocidal products containing glutaraldehyde and used in product-type 12 can remain on the market and Member States can continue to apply their national rules regarding the placing of biocidal products on their market.</p>
<p>The Water Framework Directive (WFD) 2000/60/EC<a href="#defann_56_3" name="refann_56_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> aims to protect both the inland and coastal waters against pollution. One of its objectives is to prevent deterioration of the ecological status of water bodies. In authorising any activity like the one described in the oral question, Member States should ensure that the WFD's objectives are respected and that any deterioration of status is prevented.</p>
<p>With respect to nature protection, the site in question seems to relate to a Site of Community Importance (Natura 2000 site) of Gotska Sandön-Salvorev. This site is located at the Northeastern corner of the Island of Gotland and it has been mainly designated for the protection of underwater sandbanks. The total size of the area is 60 500 ha. The site is also distribution area of grey seals which are protected under the Habitats Directive<a href="#defann_56_4" name="refann_56_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. The rules for the protection of sites which have been designated as Sites of Community Importance under the Habitats Directive are laid down in article 6 of the Directive. This protection regime inter alia foresees that the effects of projects which are likely to have a significant impact on a Natura 2000 site must be duly assessed and that such projects may be authorised only under certain conditions. If the pipeline project mentioned by the Honourable Member is likely to have significant impact on the above mentioned Natura 2000 site, it is the responsibility of the competent Swedish authorities to make sure that the abovementioned provisions are being respected. This means that the authorities must ensure that a sound assessment of the project's impact on the protected nature values is carried out before the project is authorised.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The aim of Commission Regulation (EC) 1546/2006<a href="#defann_58_2" name="refann_58_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> is to address the threat to civil aviation that is posed by home-made liquid explosives. As such, it prohibits passengers on flights departing from Community airports from taking liquids in hand luggage in individual quantities greater than 100ml.</p>
<p>However, an exemption has been granted for liquids sold at airport shops and on-board aircraft when certain security conditions are met, including the "tamper evident" bag system.</p>
<p>Given that Community legislation does not apply in third countries it cannot be assumed that airports in third countries or non-Community air carriers have security requirements that are equivalent to those applied within the European Union and the European Economic Area. Consequently, such airports and airlines cannot automatically benefit from the exemption.</p>
<p>However, the Commission has developed, in Commission Regulation (EC) 915/2007<a href="#defann_58_3" name="refann_58_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, a means of establishing equivalence of security measures for liquids sold at third country airports, and in such cases an exemption may be granted.</p>
<p>This possibility is available to all third country airports and the Commission has thus far received applications from several third countries.</p>
<p>To date, one country – Singapore – has satisfied the Commission of the equivalence of the security provisions at its airport with those applicable in the European Union in accordance with Regulation (EC) 915/2007. Thus liquids bought there may be exempted from confiscation at security points at Community airports, provided the liquid is in a tamper-evident bag and that it also displays satisfactory proof of purchase on airside at Singapore within the preceding thirty-six hours.</p>
<p>The process of granting equivalence for the security provisions at third country airports is determined largely by the third country itself, as is any wish to apply for the process. In order to be granted equivalence they must demonstrate that their security standards are equivalent, which includes analysis of the national legislation and other pertinent information. In addition, they shall be applying the recommended security control guidelines of the International Civil Aviation Organisation for screening liquids, gels and aerosols and using tamper-evident bags for liquids sold at the airport. After the analysis of this information the Commission may supplement it by means of an inspection.</p>
<p>Whilst many third countries have expressed an interest in having their airports added to the list of exempted airports few have provided this information to substantiate their case or, in some cases, have regrettably not introduced the use of tamper-evident bags in airport shops.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Water Framework Directive<a href="#defann_59_2" name="refann_59_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> (WFD) allows for a particular water-use activity to be potentially exempted from water charges only in cases of "established practices", i.e. practices that already existed under national laws at the time the Directive was adopted (2000). Therefore, it does not allow for new exemptions for specific water uses. According to the Irish authorities only households were exempted from paying water at the time the Directive was adopted.</p>
<p>It is important to point out that there are other conditions applicable to a possible exemption under Article 9.4. Member States must ensure that it does not compromise the achievement of the objectives of the Directive and should report the reasons for not fully applying the principle of cost recovery in the river basin management plans.</p>
<p>A proper water pricing is one of the most important tools to provide incentives to use water resources efficiently. The principal purpose of water-pricing under the WFD is therefore not to raise revenue, but to send a price signal acting as an incentive not to waste an exhaustible resource that requires expensive infrastructure to deliver and that may be necessary to sustain biodiversity and protect other important resources such as fisheries.</p>
<p>Charging for water on a metered basis – just like electricity or other utility – is perfectly consistent with EU water policy. Therefore the Irish Government approach to charge for water is in line with the WFD. On the other hand, while the choice of mechanisms for the funding of schools is entirely a matter for the Irish authorities, the Directive creates no obstacle to funding arrangements which enable Irish schools to meet their essential running costs, including for water. There is therefore no objection to block grants (a global amount) or capitation grants (amount per pupil). This combination of water charging and fixed allowance would allow schools to meet the normal metered costs while still providing an incentive for them to save water.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The question of the Honourable Member highlights the issue of the European Union speaking with one voice on external Energy issues. The Commission is working on all the aspects of the external energy policy falling into its present competence and is working towards a coherent approach outlining the possible instruments in this respect, which it expects to detail further this year. The EU's medium term security of energy supply, as well as the international geopolitical situation affecting energy supplies, is a cause of common concern for all Member States and requires the definition of a common European concept of security of supply, bearing in mind the following aspects.</p>
<p>First, the Member States of the European Union have the right to determine their choice between different energy sources and the general structure of their energy supply. However, in the context of the growing role of imports in the EU’s energy mix and the need to adopt a more coherent and focused EU approach to external energy security, the European Council of March 2007 recognised the importance of developing a common external policy approach in support of energy policy objectives.</p>
<p>Second, for major infrastructure projects, it is crucial to have a concrete debate within the EU on the collective interest in order to identify common priorities and promote greater co-ordination between Member States' policies. This happens already within the Trans European Networks for Energy (TEN-E) programme, which allows for the setting of European priority projects. Such a debate should contribute to a better understanding of the full impact of South Stream on EU interests and security of supply.</p>
<p>Third, it is important that Member States increasingly exchange timely information with the Commission and with each other on such bilateral projects that have implications for the EU’s security of energy supplies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0027"></a>

However, where problems of odour arise from the operation of certain industrial installations, those problems fall within the scope of Council Directive 96/61/EC of 24 September 1996 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC).<a href="#defann_62_1" name="refann_62_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> The industrial activities covered by that Directive include among others the production of chemicals on an industrial scale as well as waste water treatment plants in case they are associated with activities covered by the Directive.</p>
<p>Under the IPPC Directive, competent authorities are required to issue for each installation a permit including emission limit values or equivalent parameters and technical parameters based on best available techniques, taking into account the technical characteristics of the installation concerned, its geographical location and the local environmental conditions.</p>
<p>All the environmental impacts of the IPPC installations need to be controlled in the permits issued, for instance the releases into air, water, the generation of waste, the efficient use of energy and the protection of soil. Appropriate measures need also to be taken to address problems of odour which might arise from the operation of certain installations and, for example, the Reference Document on Best Available Techniques in Common Waste Water and Waste Gas Treatment/Management Systems in the Chemical Sector is specifying Best Available Techniques for the reduction of odour emissions.</p>
<p>Odours from waste management are regulated by Article 4 of Directive 2006/12/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on waste, which provides that Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that waste is recovered or disposed of without endangering human health and without using processes or methods which could harm the environment, and in particular without causing a nuisance, inter alia, through odours.<a href="#defann_62_2" name="refann_62_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>In addition, Annex I to Council Directive 1999/31/EC of 26 April 1999 on the landfill of waste<a href="#defann_62_3" name="refann_62_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>mentions that measures shall be taken to minimise nuisances and hazards from a landfill through emissions of odours.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Symmetry is the name given to the integrated management system designed to provide full life-cycle management of the programmes, actions and projects of the Directorate-General for Education and Culture (EAC) as well as the Education Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA), and not simply the local financial system intended to replace Appfin.</p>
<p>The core financial and contractualisation module of Symmetry has been in pilot production since September 2007. An initial group of 41 pilot projects from 4 actions split between the Directorate-General and the Executive Agency have been used to prove the system (100% of commitments and 75% of pre-financing have been successfully completed; the remaining pre-financing could not be completed yet for budgetary reasons). These outcomes are considered positive and will lead to a gradual ramp-up to full production capacity over the course of 2008.</p>
<p>The principal contractor for the supply of the system is Intrasoft International; while in a secondary lot worth about 5% of the market, Siemens Business Services was selected as Quality Assurance contractor. The contractors were chosen by means of open public call for tender<a href="#defann_63_1" name="refann_63_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and the first specific contracts for developing the system were signed in December 2001.</p>
<p>To date a total of €7,485,982 has been paid to cover all aspects of development including quality assurance, acceptance testing, user helpdesk and training services. A payment of €903,216 was made in 2007 to procure a high-performance server platform in the Commission's Luxemburg Data Centre for a period of four years.</p>
<p>The system has taken longer to reach its targets due to the need to be adapted to significant changes in the financial and organisational environment; in particular the introduction of the New Financial Regulations 2003 and 2006, the creation of the EACEA and the introduction of accrual accounting in January 2005.</p>
<p>When comparing Symmetry with Appfin, the latter is a local financial system with a restricted interface towards the central ABAC system and a limited set of functions. Symmetry offers a far wider range of functions including: online proposal submission, proposal selection, project contractualisation, follow-up, closure and reporting. Comparison of running costs is therefore difficult; however, once the main wave of development is concluded (end 2008) the running costs of the financial sub-systems of Symmetry should be lower than those of the ageing Appfin system.</p>
<p>The Internal Audit Service (IAS) has planned an information technology (IT) audit of the Symmetry application, once it is in large-scale operation, in the period 2008-2009.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>Some large European companies, such as Total and Shell, are continuing to burn off gas in Nigeria in conjunction with their oil-extraction operations, which is enormously damaging to the environment and also to the health of people living nearby. Gas is the by-product of the oil which is extracted in Nigeria and provides 95% of the country's income. The quantity of gas which is flared in Nigeria is equivalent to a quarter of Britain's entire consumption. According to the World Bank, 40 billion dollars is wasted every year by flaring natural gas, and the practice is responsible for 400 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere per annum. According to the World Bank, companies would do better to catch the gas and sell it in liquefied form. However, this would require investment.</p>
<p>In October 2007, the Nigerian Government announced that, as from 1 January 2008, flaring of gas would be banned. At the beginning of January, however, it decided to postpone the deadline until the end of 2008. The postponement is said to have resulted from pressure from the multinationals. In European countries, gas flaring in conjunction with oil extraction is prohibited. Will the Commission pressurise these companies to halt this damaging practice, or will it impose penalties on them if the Nigerian authorities do not punish them for their activities?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The damaging practice of gas flaring in the Niger Delta has a severe impact on the local environment, on the economy of Nigeria and also contributes massively to global climate changes. The Commission's recognition of the importance of taking action to reduce gas flaring is recalled in the "Africa-EU Strategic Partnership" (Priority action 5 "Partnership on energy") issued at the Lisbon EU-Africa Summit in December 2007. The Niger Delta is the place on earth in which the largest flaring operations occur. This practice – which begun some 40 years ago – has only been marginally reduced by the large investments made by multinational oil companies to liquefy natural gas. Nigeria, traditionally an important oil supplier is also becoming a major gas supplier. Its reserves make it the seventh largest natural gas reserve holder. In 2006 Nigeria exported to Europe 83% of its liquefied natural gas (LNG) production corresponding only to about 60% of the total gas extracted. The remaining 40% - mainly gas associated to oil wells lacking the infrastructure to collect and produce natural gas – was flared. Recent estimates indicate that some 24 billion m<span class="sup">3</span> of associated gas are flared every year. The government plans to raise earnings from gas exports to 50% of oil revenue by 2010 which will require investment in the range of € 10-12 billion to build large infrastructure including more gas liquefying plants and gas pipelines. One of the projects under consideration is a Trans-Saharan gas pipeline crossing the Sahara desert which in the future will provide an additional opportunity for gas export and could supply gas directly to Europe, through Niger and Algeria.</p>
<p>In such a context it was indeed disappointing to learn that the deadline set by the Government to stop gas flaring had been postponed to the end of 2008. While we hope that the new deadline will be met, we note that stopping gas flaring seems to have become a priority for the Government of Nigeria. Major stakeholders recently came together to develop a road map for the elimination of flaring within a realistic time frame. The representatives from several ministries and sector companies agreed to establish a Flare Reduction Committee – chaired by the Minister of State for Gas - the work of which is likely to be facilitated by the World Bank Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFR), which the Commission is supporting and contributing to.</p>
<p>Two avenues are available to the Commission to address gas flaring concerns: i) the EU/Nigeria political dialogue under Article 8 of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement; and ii) the ongoing programming of the development cooperation under the 10<span class="sup">th</span> European Development Fund (EDF).</p>
<p>Concerning possible interventions against the EU oil companies operating in Nigeria, in the form of pressure or action, the Commission does not have the legal power to impose sanctions. As part of its policy to promote corporate social responsibility (CSR), however, the Commission does support CSR codes of conduct that are adhered to by companies on a voluntary basis in and outside the EU. For example, the Commission is supporting and contributing to such codes of conduct as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, which is a powerful tool to monitor the revenues derived from the mineral sector. The Commission is also committed to promoting awareness and implementation of reference international instruments and initiatives on CSR, such as the International Labor Organisation (ILO) Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) and Social Policy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for MNEs and the United Nations (UN) Global Compact.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0034"></a>

<p>In July 2007 the European Commission adopted a Communication on water scarcity and droughts. These issues have emerged as a major challenge and climate change is expected to exacerbate it further as underscored by the Commission Green Paper on adaptation to climate change<a href="#defann_67_1" name="refann_67_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Communication identifies a set of policy options at European, national and regional levels to address and mitigate the challenge posed by water scarcity and droughts. To name just two key orientations promoted in the Communication: (1) Progressing towards full implementation of the Water Framework Directive; (2) Putting priority on water savings and all possibilities to improve water efficiency.</p>
<p>This Communication is based on the assessment of the EU water saving potential. In some regions, up to 30% of the volume of water consumed in buildings could be saved. In some cities, leakages in public water supply networks can exceed 50%. Similar wastage of water has been recorded in irrigation networks. There is therefore a huge potential for water saving across Europe. Water saving must become the priority and all possibilities to improve water efficiency must therefore be explored.</p>
<p>Policy making needs to be based on a clear water hierarchy. Additional water supply infrastructures should be considered as an option only when other options have been exhausted, including effective water pricing policies.</p>
<p>Alternative options like rain water harvesting are increasingly considered as potential options across Europe. Their development is subject to EU legislation and needs to be in line with the water hierarchy principle.</p>
<p>Further to the Communication, the Commission is now launching an in-depth risk and impact assessment of all alternative water supply options including rain water harvesting.</p>
<p>The Commission will present the outcomes of this assessment in the follow up report of the measures of the Communication to be adopted by the end of 2008. Initial results will be presented at the meeting of a Stakeholder Forum planned for early September 2008 in Zaragoza.</p>
<p>Regarding developing countries affected by droughts, desertification and land degradation, the Commission is actively involved in supporting the implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. Programs to address this problem obviously include sustainable water resources management schemes. The Commission also supports specific programs related to water management and rainwater harvesting and use as part of its development programs. Finally, the EU Water Initiative is also a privileged tool to progress towards the achievement of the objectives of the World Summit on Sustainable Development and the Millennium Development Goals.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Third European Road Safety Action Programme (EC 2003) specifically outlined a key proposal to ensure the proper enforcement of the most important safety rules in the areas of speed, drink driving and seat belt use. This resulted in a Recommendation on Enforcement in the field of road traffic law (European Commission 2003). The European Commission had a cost-benefit analysis carried out on the basis of proposals similar to the Recommendation. It assessed that increased enforcement would result in a total annual reduction of 14 000 road deaths and 680 000 injuries in the EU (ICF Consulting 2003). The Recommendation stated that the European Commission would by autumn 2007 evaluate if enforcement policies had improved sufficiently across the Member States and consider proposing more binding legislation, such as a Directive.</p>
<p>What have been the findings of this assessment and how will the European Commission ensure the improvement of traffic law enforcement in the Member States and cooperation across their borders?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has indeed carried out an assessment of whether enforcement policies have improved sufficiently across the Member States since the Commission Recommendation on enforcement in the field of road traffic law was adopted.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the findings of this assessment are not positive, since the trend over the past years in road safety has not improved. True, the reduction of the number of fatalities was 6% in 2004, but in 2006 it was 5% and last year there was no reduction at all. Over the period from 2001 to 2007, the number of fatalities has decreased by 20%, while a 37% reduction would have been necessary if we want to reach the European objective of halving the number of road fatalities by 2010.</p>
<p>Enforcement has proven to be a very effective instrument for reducing the number of road accidents over a short time. Given the wide variety of traffic and road conditions found across the European Union, it is not appropriate to consider harmonising domestic traffic laws and penalties. But domestic laws and penalties must be respected by all drivers if road safety is to improve and at present we cannot be sure that drivers and car owners who commit a serious offence in a Member State other than that of their residence will be effectively pursued and sanctioned after they have returned home. Mechanisms for the exchange of data between national authorities remain limited and bilateral agreements have not delivered an effective EU-wide system. This is a serious loophole in enforcement which reduces the overall effectiveness of enforcement and the credibility of controls in the minds of domestic drivers. Here there is a clear European dimension and an issue to which Europe can bring a solution: a system of exchange of information on vehicle data is needed which would enable the Member State where an offence has been committed to find the person responsible regardless where in the European Union that person resides and to allow the responsible authorities to impose the corresponding sanction. This will encourage universal respect of road safety related traffic rules and ensure equal treatment of all European citizens under the law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0039"></a>

<p>The Honourable Member asks whether the Commission sees an opportunity to adapt Annex II.2 of the Birds Directive in a way that the corvids would be huntable for Austria.</p>
<p>It has been stressed to the Austrian authorities as well as to other interested parties who have contacted the Commission about this matter in the past years that the revision of Annex II of the Birds Directive (79/409/EEC<a href="#defann_69_2" name="refann_69_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>) is a very complex and lengthy procedure as it requires a full legislative process by co-decision, involving the Council and the Parliament.</p>
<p>In light of this the Commission has already made it clear that any adaptation of such kind must be done in a strategic way together with all Member States and must be based on comprehensive information on the conservation status of the species in Annex II. Such an approach may lead not only to the inclusion but also to the exclusion of certain species from Annex II.</p>
<p>At this moment the Commission does not envisage an adaptation of Annex II.2 of the Birds Directive. However, work is currently being undertaken in relation to some management plans for Annex II species.</p>
<p>In relation to the specific problem of Austria which seems mainly related to the hunting of crows, the Commission has on many occasions suggested to the Austrian regions to overcome their difficulties by making full use of the derogation procedure (Article 9 of the Directive). Derogations are permissible under Article 9 of the Directive for the purpose of preventing “serious damage to crops, livestock, forests, fisheries and water” and a range of other reasons. Some Länder have already taken this advice. The Commission can only continue to give that advice.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission agrees with the Honourable Member on the importance of free distribution both for the citizens and for the fruit and vegetables sector.</p>

<p>The transitional measures will authorise Member States to allow for withdrawals, including free distribution to become eligible expenditure from 1 January 2008, before the national strategy is established. Several conditions will have to be fulfilled in that respect.</p>
<p>First of all, the Member State will have to ensure that its national strategy adopted in 2008 covers withdrawals. Secondly, the producer organisations will have to modify their operational programmes to meet the requirements of the reformed fruit and vegetables CMO as soon as the national strategy is established and before an application for the related payment is made.

<p>EU policy aims, inter alia, to close down permanently and redevelop uncontrolled waste tips, to introduce compulsory processing for all solid waste before it is buried in landfill sites, to use waste as a source of energy and to recycle packaging waste (Directives 75/442/EEC<a href="#defann_72_1" name="refann_72_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, 1999/31/EC<a href="#defann_72_2" name="refann_72_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, 2004/12/EC<a href="#defann_72_3" name="refann_72_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and 2006/12/EC<a href="#defann_72_4" name="refann_72_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>).

<p>The Commission has received a considerable number of complaints concerning the operation in Greece of illegal or uncontrolled sites, where the waste disposal endangers human health and harms the environment. In order to stop this practice, the Commission initiated a horizontal infringement procedure which concerns the operation of all illegal or uncontrolled waste disposal sites in Greece. In its judgment of 6 October 2005 (case C-502/03), the European Court of Justice declared that Greece had failed to comply with its obligations under Articles 4, 8 and 9 of Directive 75/442/EEC on waste<a href="#defann_72_5" name="refann_72_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> as amended (now Directive 2006/12/EC<a href="#defann_72_6" name="refann_72_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> - Waste Framework Directive). The judgment established that at least 1 125 illegal or uncontrolled landfills are operational in Greece. Greece must now comply with this ruling, in accordance with Article 228 of the EC Treaty. In this regard, the Greek authorities adopted a new national waste management plan and updated their regional waste management plans. Those new plans aim at the closure and rehabilitation of all illegal or uncontrolled waste dumping sites by the end of 2008 and their replacement by appropriate waste management infrastructure.</p>
<p>According to information received from the Greek authorities in October 2007, the Greek authorities have adopted decisions for the closure and rehabilitation of 1 038 illegal or uncontrolled waste dumping sites, while for 774 dumping sites the necessary rehabilitation works are underway. The Commission services are assessing this information and will take all necessary measures in order to ensure that Greece complies with the ECJ ruling.</p>
<p>The Commission collects information about recycling levels in Member States as an element of verifying the proper implementation of Community legislation. In 2005 Greece has achieved a recycling level of 41.8% which is well above the previous target of 25% recycling (set for 2001) but is still below the target of 55% recycling of packaging set for Greece for 2011. The detailed data for Greece as well as other Member States are available at the website http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/packaging/data.htm" </p>
<p>It should be noted that the information given at this page may be subject to change when countries send updates or corrections of data provided.</p>
<p>The management of hazardous waste in Greece is under scrutiny of the Commission. Greece has not adopted an adequate management plan for hazardous waste and tolerates the uncontrolled disposal of the majority of the hazardous waste produced, violating several key requirements of the Waste Framework Directive which is the central pillar of EU legislation designed to ensure environmentally sound waste management in Member States.</p>
<p>After being sent a final warning in December 2005, Greece modified its legal framework for the management of hazardous waste and adopted a new management plan that was sent to the Commission in March 2007. Despite that adoption, Greece is still not complying with its obligations.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the plan is too general and does not provide a coherent waste management strategy. The Commission takes the view that the management plan adopted is not sufficiently precise, in particular as regards the identification of suitable disposal sites, and that the inventory of hazardous waste is not yet definitive for all categories. Thousands of tons are stocked "temporarily", pending disposal or recovery. Greece has admitted that 600 000 tons of hazardous waste are stocked at sites considered by the Greek authorities as "polluted in principle".</p>
<p>While the Greek authorities have recognised the problem and are committed to solving it, the adopted management plan will not ensure the resolution of the problem. Therefore, in January 2008 the Commission decided to refer the case to the European Court of Justice (ECJ).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Council Directive 96/29 Euratom<a href="#defann_73_1" name="refann_73_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Basic Safety Standards Directive, requires that Member States ensure that all types of practices resulting in exposure to ionizing radiation are justified in advance of their introduction. This implies that an analysis is made of the societal benefit generated by the practice, and it is demonstrated that the net benefit, is positive. The decision on whether a practice is justified however lies with national governments.</p>
<p>There is a potential exposure of hidden persons in the case of X-ray screening of vehicles to counter illegal immigration. Council Directive 97/43/Euratom<a href="#defann_73_2" name="refann_73_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> includes specific provisions on exposures of individuals as part of so-called "medico-legal procedures", i.e. procedures performed for legal purposes without a medical indication, such as security screening. In particular, Article 4.2 (c) of this Directive requires that Member States ensure that special attention be given to keep the doses arising from medico-legal exposure as low as reasonably achievable.</p>
<p>The issue of justification in this category of practices, which is very complex, was discussed among radiation protection experts and stakeholders at a conference organised by the Commission (Dublin, 2002)<a href="#defann_73_3" name="refann_73_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. A second conference of this type is in preparation for this year.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the X-ray screening of vehicles must be conducted in full respect of other provisions of the Basic Safety Standards Directive, e.g. for the protection of those operating the equipment, where appropriate truck drivers, bystanders etc.</p>
<p>Concerning the question whether the Commission encourages other Member States to consider the wider use of the equipment described, it should be noted that there is no Community competence. The Schengen Borders Code<a href="#defann_73_4" name="refann_73_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> only determines the general rules how border checks shall be carried out. Besides the rules laid down in Annex VI of the Code, the details of the procedures for the checks are to be decided by Member States according to national law. This includes also decisions concerning the adequate equipment. The latter does not exclude the possibility of co-financing national equipment with means of the External Borders Fund.<a href="#defann_73_5" name="refann_73_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a></p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission, in its response of 16 January 2007 to the Parliament's Written Declaration No 0038/2006, recognised the high level of public concern regarding the animal welfare aspects of seal hunting and undertook to make a full objective assessment of the animal welfare aspects of seal hunting and, based on the results, to report back to the Parliament with possible legislative proposals if warranted by the situation.</p>
<p>In the framework of this assessment process, the Commission requested the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to issue an independent scientific opinion on the animal welfare aspects of the killing and skinning of seals. On 6 December 2007, EFSA adopted its scientific opinion stating that "there are only a limited number of quantitative studies published in peer-reviewed journals to be used as the basis for the efficacy of various killing methods with an adequately high degree of certainty." EFSA also concluded that "it is possible to kill seals rapidly and effectively without causing them avoidable pain or distress. However, the Panel also reported evidence that, in practice, effective and humane killing does not always happen."</p>
<p>The management, monitoring and enforcement issues related to seal hunting are currently being examined through a Commission-funded assessment study, which will be completed end of February. This study assesses the potential impacts of a possible ban of products derived from seal species, focussing in particular on trade, legal and socio-economic aspects. The Commission has also launched a public consultation through internet to gather a wide variety of views on trade in seal products and their links with concerns on seal hunting in general or welfare aspects in particular.</p>
<p>The Commission will take a decision on the policy response on the basis of its own impact assessment by taking into consideration the results of the above-mentioned actions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0048"></a>

The question was raised about who should finance the acquisition and maintenance of the equipment necessary to implement the directive - the retention of telephone conversations, SMS messages, unanswered calls and other data for a period of twelve months. Under the Lithuanian Constitution, the State has no right to delegate to private individuals its task of ensuring the security of society and preserving public order by asking them to perform these duties without public funds.</p>
<p>In view of the above, will the Commission say who is footing the bill for the acquisition of the equipment by communications enterprises in the EU Member States? How is the Data Processing Directive being implemented in the EU Member States? How are citizens protected against the fraudulent use of information concerning them?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Data Retention Directive obliges Member States to require providers of public electronic communications services and networks to retain traffic and location data for a minimum period of six months and a maximum of 24 months and to ensure that these data are available for the investigation, detection or prosecution of serious crime. As such the Directive essentially imposes obligations on communications providers and networks to retain specified data for an appropriate period of time under certain conditions.</p>
<p>These obligations may generate significant additional costs for communications providers and networks. However, the Directive does not oblige Member States to reimburse providers for any costs which they incur in connection with these obligations.</p>
<p>To the extent that Member States wish to grant aid to undertakings with respect to the costs of data retention, they must notify this to the Commission in accordance with Article 88 (3) EC. Moreover, such aid could be approved only if one of the exemptions of Article 87 (2) or (3) EC was applicable. This would require in particular that the aid must have an incentive effect, i.e. that such aid helps to achieve an objective which goes beyond the mere implementation of obligations which already result from European Community law.</p>
<p>In November of last year the Commission invited all Member States to a meeting on transposition of the Data Retention Directive. This included a Roundtable discussion of Member States' approach to reimbursement of costs incurred as a consequence of the Directive and indicated a wide range of practices.</p>
<p>Member States' approaches vary considerably. For example, one Member State is introducing systems which will reimburse additional costs incurred by providers and which will involve pre and post auditing of providers' costs to ensure a cost neutral approach. Some others provide for a system which allows payments to be made to providers based on a pre-established set of tariffs without assessing the specific cost base of individual providers. Many Member States do not intend to reimburse any additional costs incurred by electronic communications providers as a result of the Directive. Finally, a number of other Member States are still assessing the full implications of a cost reimbursement system and have not yet arrived at a final position. A report of the November 2007 meeting can be found on the Commission's Europa web site<a href="#defann_75_2" name="refann_75_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>As for transposition into national law, Member States should have transposed the Directive into national law by no later then 15 September 2007. To date 12 Member States have notified their transposition measures to the Commission. In November of last year the Commission began infringement proceedings against those Member States which had not notified the Commission of their transposition measures. An overview of how Member States are transposing the Directive can be found in the report of the November 2007 meeting.</p>
<p>The Data Retention Directive also provides important guarantees against misuse of data retained under the Directive. The strict purpose limitation of the Directive implies that retained data cannot be used by private enterprises or individuals. Moreover, the Member States are anyway under the obligation to ensure that provisions in national law relating to access to retained data comply with the European Convention on Human Rights and ensure full respect for the principles of proportionality and necessity. The general data protection regime provided for by Directive 95/46 remains applicable to the retention of data by the operators.</p>
<p>These provisions are further complemented by strict data security requirements designed to guard against accidental loss or unauthorised access to these data. By way of example, the Directive requires that communications providers and network operators shall ensure that only "specially authorised personnel" may access the data. The Directive further requires national measures to provide that intentional access to or transfer of retained data which is not in accordance with national law, shall be punishable by appropriate sanctions, including the possibility of administrative or criminal penalties.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The phenomenon of corruption has assumed alarming proportions in Greece. According to Transparency International, one in five Greek citizens admits that he or she has given bribes in order to expedite some business in the public or private sector. The phenomenon of corruption is concentrated chiefly in services such as public hospitals, urban planning, tax authorities, banks and municipal and prefectural authorities. Over the last few years corruption has even spread to the justice system. It is calculated that the total value of illegal bribes exceeded € 600 million in 2007.</p>
<p>Is the Commission aware of the increase in corruption in Greece, and what does it believe are the principal reasons for this? What data does it have available and how is it addressing the phenomenon of corruption in respect of the use of Community funds by Greece? How can it contribute to stamping out corruption?

<p>The Commission is aware of the data published by Transparency International.</p>
<p>The Commission does not possess complete data concerning the methods used by the Member States to combat corruption, in particular in the public sector. Therefore the Commission cannot assess to what extent increased levels of corruption in Greece may affect the economic and social convergence with other European countries.</p>
<p>Against this background, the EU has been very active in the field of the fight against corruption and has adopted a comprehensive group of instruments to tackle this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Following the introduction of the EU Convention on the protection of the Communities' financial interests in 1995, a Protocol drawn up in 1996 addresses the issue of corruption in relation to the Communities' financial interests.</p>
<p>In 1997 the EU Convention on the fight against corruption involving officials of the European Union or officials of Member States of the European Union was drawn up. The Convention criminalises corruption involving public officials, requiring Member States to be able to investigate and prosecute cases, even when they involve an official of another Member State of the European Union. The Convention is in force since September 2005.</p>
<p>Framework Decision 2003/568/JHA on combating corruption in the private sector was adopted in July 2003. It requires Member States to provide for offences of corruption in the private sector, whether involving a profit or non-profit organisation. In June 2007 the Commission adopted an implementation report which found that transposition of this Framework Decision into Member States' legislation was still at an early stage.</p>

<p>The Commission is aware of the continued existence of "European City Guide" and similar directory companies and continues to reply to numerous letters from Members of Parliament and businesses.</p>
<p>As the Commission has stated in the past since this problem concerns business-to-business (B2B) relationships much of the EU consumer protection legislation does not apply. An exception is Directive 2006/114/EC of the Parliament and of the Council concerning misleading and comparative advertising.</p>
<p>The competent law courts and/or public enforcement authorities of the Member State from which such schemes operate are competent for deciding on a case-by-case basis whether a commercial communication is misleading and to take appropriate enforcement action.</p>
<p>Several competent authorities and courts, for example in Spain and Belgium, have already taken enforcement action against these practices.</p>
<p>The Unfair Commercial Practice (UCP) Directive does not cover B2B commercial practices since there was no case for maximum harmonisation of the national laws on acts of unfair commercial practice (for example B2B misleading advertising, slavish imitation, denigration).</p>
<p>A full harmonisation Directive on unfair B2C commercial practices was already a very ambitious proposal, which would have failed if its scope had been extended to B2B unfair competition practices.</p>
<p>It resulted from the consultation and the works in Council that there was no consensus on extending of the scope of the directive to cover B2B unfair commercial practices.</p>
<p>It must also be stressed that not all the Member States have a system to address unfair commercial practice.</p>
<p>Some Member States (for example Germany, Austria and Sweden) were in favour of extending the scope of the directive to acts of unfair commercial practice. Others (for example the United Kingdom, France and Ireland) supported consumer protection but opposed the introduction at EU level of a fully harmonised system to address unfair commercial practice.</p>
<p>Although the Commission cannot intervene against companies involved in such practices it has attempted to increase awareness of the problem by presenting the issue to European business organisations. Furthermore, the Commission has written to the competent authorities in the relevant Member States, including Spain, to highlight that the situation is on-going and to request further information on this issue. The Commission is awaiting replies to some of these letters.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The question of the Honourable Member addresses issues, which fall within the scope of two separate sets of Member State's obligations, notably obligations under the EU asylum acquis and obligations to respect fundamental rights when carrying out immigration or border controls.</p>
<p>The Commission does not dispose sufficient information which would enable it to drive a concrete conclusion regarding the actions of the Greek authorities referred to in the question of the Honourable Member.</p>
<p>As far as the implementation of the asylum acquis in Greece is concerned, the Commission has undertaken a number of procedural actions concerning the failure of this Member State to implement its obligations under Community Legislation.</p>
<p>Thus, the Commission inter alia has opened infringement procedures against Greece for non-communication of transposition measures under Council Directive 2004/83/EC on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted<a href="#defann_81_1" name="refann_81_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> (Qualification Directive) and Council Directive 2005/85/EC of 1 December 2005 on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status<a href="#defann_81_2" name="refann_81_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>If needed, the Commission will proceed with further procedural steps in accordance with the power conferred to it by Article 226 of the Treaty establishing the European Community in order to ensure that the Member State comply with its obligations under the EU asylum acquis.</p>
<p>The Commission would also like to highlight that the EU financial support to ensure inter alia proper reception conditions for asylum seekers as well as the identification and integration of refugees and persons granted subsidiary protection has been available for Greece. On the basis of the numbers of officially registered asylum applications, € 1 283 253, 07 have been allocated to Greece under the European Refugee Fund II in 2007 and € 1 571 280, 36 will be available under the European Refugee Fund III in 2008.</p>
<p>As concerns the movement of persons in need of international protection within the European Union, the Commission would like to refer to its proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 2003/109/EC of 25 November 2003 concerning the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents to extend its scope to beneficiaries of international protection.<a href="#defann_81_3" name="refann_81_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> If adopted, the Directive would enable third country nationals granted refugee status or subsidiary protection to acquire long-term resident status in a Member State as well as to reside in other Member States for various reasons, including employment and self-employment activities, subject to the provisions of the Directive.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission wishes to reiterate its firm position that Greece must comply with fundamental rights when it exercises border controls or takes measures against irregular stay of third country nationals on its territory.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>The importation of Brazilian meat into Europe is an issue with high priority, partly because there is currently a shortage of beef in the EU. To introduce barriers to trade, therefore, is contrary to our fundamental principles relating to free trade and openness. Agricultural policy is already being severely criticised, and measures of this kind - debarring for unclear reasons a product which citizens want to have - do not benefit support for European farmers. In Sweden it is estimated that the price of beef could rise by 30% if the ban remains in force for long. However, I share the Commission's concern to assign priority to safeguarding human and animal health. It is important to remember in this connection that the strong upturn in sales of Brazilian meat in Europe was largely due to the outbreak of mad cow disease in the late 1990s.</p>
<p>I would ask the Commission, therefore, how it intends to help solve this problem, and how can the Commission guarantee that these temporary measures genuinely remain temporary and proportional, so that they do not damage the interests of consumers, to the advantage of the European farmers' lobby?</p>
<p>It is important for Europe's consumers that this issue should be resolved without delay!</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>To protect EU public and animal health, the European Union has put in place a comprehensive set of requirements for imports of meat. The fulfilment of these requirements is verified by the Commission, in particular through on-the-spot inspections carried out by the Commission inspection services (Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) located in Ireland). Recent inspections in Brazil have identified serious instances of non-compliance with Community import requirements for bovine meat.</p>
<p>The Commission has therefore adopted measures to strengthen the control and surveillance of animal holdings, from which bovine meat could be sourced for import into the EU. The definite list of holdings together with their audit reports is expected to be received from the Brazilian authorities before the end of February 2008. In addition, the Commission is prepared to organise a further FVO inspection to Brazil late February 2008.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that these measures have consequences on trade. They are the result of Brazil's repeated failure to address the deficiencies identified.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the measures are designed to be temporary. Trade could recover as these measures permit additional holdings to be listed provided they fully meet EU requirements.</p>

<p>According to the Staff Regulations, officials, temporary agents and contract staff (and their spouse and dependents, if they are eligible for the household allowance) have the right to an annual flat-rate payment of travel expenses from their place of employment to their place of origin.</p>
<p>For staff employed within the European Union, this payment is made automatically, thus the number of actual beneficiaries corresponds to the number of officials eligible for the payment. The figures are as follows:</p>
<table style="border-collapse:collapse; border-color:#EAF2FF; border-style:solid; border-width:2px; align:center; widh:100% " cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<p>Total annual travel expenses</p>

<p>22 958 780</p>

<p>17 814</p>
<p>2007</p>
<p>28 209 707</p>
<p>18 389</p></table>
<p>For officials who work outside the European Union, Article 8(4) of Annex VII to the Staff Regulations provides for the reimbursement of travel expenses in the form of a flat-rate payment corresponding to the cost of return air travel for the staff member, their spouse and dependents from their place of employment to their place of origin (or to another destination for those entitled to the payment who do not live at the place of employment).</p>
<p>As regards reimbursement, the Commission pays this flat-rate fee each year in July subject to prior presentation of boarding passes as proof of travel. Therefore, only those who provide proof that they have taken the journey will be eligible for this reimbursement.</p>
<p>For these staff members, the budget spent and the number of files processed are shown in the following table (elements collected from different data bases since data were not processed under the same IT system during 2005/2006 and 2007). These figures include beneficiaries (and their dependents) posted to Commission Delegations at least part of the year during the said exercises. Some of the beneficiaries have also received flat-rate payments for the time spent when posted inside the territory of the European Union.</p>
<p>These are not the final data, since regularisations for 2006 and 2007 exercises are still ongoing.</p>
<table style="border-collapse:collapse; border-color:#EAF2FF; border-style:solid; border-width:2px; align:center; widh:100% " cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">

<p>In 2006 and 2007 the increase in the number of beneficiaries is due to the application of the new Staff Regulations of 2004. Former staff employed in different status (local agents of technical assistance – ALAT – and individual experts) were converted into contractual agent positions, which resulted in new recruitments under the conditions of employment of other servants of the Communities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0073"></a>

<p>The Commission Communication "Preparing the Health Check of the CAP reform", adopted on 20 November 2007 states that a revised Article 69 would require a relaxation of the present rule that those measures under such provision can only apply at a sector level.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently finalising an impact assessment report on the Health Check of the CAP. The aim of this report is to examine the different options that can be proposed by the Commission from an economic, environmental, social and administrative point of view. As part of this analysis, the revision of Article 69 is also being examined.</p>
<p>The impact assessment report will accompany the legal proposals on the Health Check. The Commission has planned to adopt this package on 20 May 2007.

<p>In 1995, the EU was the world's second-biggest exporter of high-technology products. In 2005, it became the biggest exporter of such products, accounting for 17.2% of world exports in the field, but also the biggest importer, with 19.1% of world imports. In 2005, the total value of the Union's exports and imports in the field rose to EUR 230 bn and EUR 198 bn respectively. Over the period 2000-2005, the EU's exports of high-technology products registered an average annual growth of 1.7%, while imports fell by an average of 1.3% per annum. The category 'electronics and telecommunications' accounted for the largest share of European imports and exports of high-technology products (in 17 Member States and Norway).</p>

<p>The Commission notes with satisfaction the increased European Competitiveness in high technology products.</p>
<p>The capacity of enterprises in the EU to produce and export high-technology products depends on a wide range of framework conditions, some of which can be set at EU level, and others which lie within the powers of the Member States. In 2005 the Commission set out its industrial policy<a href="#defann_85_1" name="refann_85_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> for the coming years, based on a combination of horizontal and sectoral initiatives, followed by a mid-term review<a href="#defann_85_2" name="refann_85_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> in July 2007. The Commission plans in the future to strengthen its work with Member States on industrial policy in the framework of the relaunched Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs.</p>
<p>A particularly important factor in the competitiveness of high-technology products is the level of investment in Research and Development. The Commission’s policy in the field of research and technological development, particularly the seventh framework programme for research and technological development, is a vital contribution to the international competitiveness of the high-technology sector of European industry.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
