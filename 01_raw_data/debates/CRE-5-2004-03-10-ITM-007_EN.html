For some reason a nasty virus has descended upon me in the last three quarters of an hour so if I do not make a great deal of sense and if I leave early I hope the reasons are at least forgivable.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to summarise where I see this legislation has improved or changed for the better during our deliberations. In a sense the proposal from the Commission had quite a faltering and uncertain start. I was struck as rapporteur by how weak the apparent support from a number of European airlines was for this measure. They expressed a fear, which I certainly shared at the beginning of the discussions, that the instrument being proposed and discussed here could, if mishandled, be a pretext for protectionist behaviour rather than, as is intended, a targeted instrument to deter unfair pricing and excessive use of subsidies elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">The original draft was a little too open-ended. It rather bluntly stated that the European Union would have the power to extend for the first time anti-dumping disciplines from the trade in goods to the trade in services, without a great deal of detail about how that would take place. Our efforts in Parliament during the first reading in particular have been to fill in some of the gaps, to make it a more usable and credible instrument, rather than a sort of blunderbuss threat which might arguably have been too crude to use at all.</p>
<p class="contents">To that end we are all pleased that the Council has adopted some of the amendments we tabled at first reading, notably, and probably most importantly, those specifying in the legislation itself that the Commission must develop a detailed methodology by which dumped, unfair prices are calculated so that there is a coherent and credible methodology to distinguish dumped prices from normal pricing.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased the Council has adopted that. I am very grateful to the Commissioner and the Commission for accepting those amendments too. As rapporteur, I would have liked both the Council and the Commission to move a little further towards our position as adopted at first reading. I remain a little concerned that there is no caveat in the legislation to the effect that this instrument should only be used if significant material injury is inflicted upon European Union aircraft carriers. There is a theoretical, potential danger that this instrument will be used to pursue frivolous or insignificant cases. This instrument needs to be used sparingly and I would have preferred to have seen greater adoption of our wording, which targeted it at the really important cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I accepted the wisdom of my wiser colleagues in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, to which I am only a very occasional visitor, who told me in the debate ahead of the second reading that this was a good package to settle with. I happily did so, except on one issue, in a sense on behalf of the Commission, which had understandably expressed concern about the provisions of recital 5, and which suggested that this regulation would be subservient to existing bilateral agreements. I am extremely grateful to the Irish presidency for persuading its colleagues in the Council, according to all the accounts I have received, that the offending wording should be deleted so that a rigid hierarchy between bilateral instruments and EU instruments would not be established to the detriment of the latter.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me take the remaining seconds to thank the Commission services, which have been enormously helpful in providing a lot of technical detail to a complete ignoramus like me. I should like to thank the Commissioner for proposing this in the first place and accepting the final settlement, the Council and, most importantly, my colleagues in the Committee on Transport. I am, as I said before, an interloper from the trade community and it was certainly an interesting and useful exercise for me to see how trade policy and transport policy have in this case come together in an extremely satisfactory manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the Commission, the safety measures in very small airports had to be adapted because they were difficult to put into practice. It was necessary to alleviate the distress that was caused by the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 of 16 December 2002 establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security.</p>
<p class="contents">Safety in aviation has always been important to the public and therefore also to this Parliament, even more so after 11 September 2001. That is why the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism carefully studied the topic in 2002 and insisted on 100% control, appropriate technical standards and attention to the question of who should pay for everything. On 16 December 2002, a Regulation was approved, and entered into effect a month or so later. I was still new to this House at that time and was not really in a position to follow those discussions. The Regulation in question had been prepared by the Commission in a short space of time, in order to respond to the increased sense of lack of safety in civil aviation. Parliament was very keen to approve the Regulation at the earliest opportunity. From the first experiences with applying it, it transpired that there was room for improvement in some areas and that some terms needed clarifying. That is how this amending proposal, which is mainly technical, came about. It appeared inefficient and expensive to apply the same safety regulations to airports for small aircraft only and for adjacent zones for light aircraft in larger airports.</p>
<p class="contents">Even so, safety must be guaranteed in those places too. That is why safety measures established nationally will now apply each time when the Regulation provides for measures that are, objectively speaking, impractical or disproportionate. Accordingly, for general aviation involving small aircraft, delineated areas have been introduced which are separate from the rest of the airport. In addition, a criterion for the eligibility of being a small airport has been clarified. The word 'control' has also been clarified, and a number of inconsistencies have been removed. I take the view that it is important for the Regulation to be made clearer and for the mistakes in the legislative text to be corrected, but, above all, to ensure that the regulations are practical and applicable. We once again have an excellent working relationship with the Commission, but if at first reading, the Council adopts a position as a result of which the Regulation is altered dramatically, we should probably review our position. I suggest at this stage to approve the proposal amending the Regulation, and would thank the services for the support that I have had during the compiling of my report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicholson (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, this report evolved from the need to look at insurance cover for aircraft carriers after the atrocities that took place in New York on 11 September. It seems a long time ago, but it still remains in our memories. We had to try to achieve a level playing field between European airlines and the airlines of the United States, which then received even greater support than our airlines. We also have to keep the necessary balance between the rights of travellers, their security and, above all, the safety of air travel against these new terrorist challenges that threaten everyone in Europe, and indeed in the greater world.</p>
<p class="contents">We have come a long way towards achieving this. After the first reading, the Council accepted 16 of the committee's 26 amendments, which included the provision that the depositing of proof of insurance in one Member State should suffice for all Member States. It also accepted the definition of a passenger. State aircraft have been exempted. The application of global amounts in accordance with commercial practice has also been accepted as have, in a range of other areas, the inclusion of local flights, measures to be taken when aircraft land without adequate insurance cover, and withdrawal of operating licence if the insurance cover is not sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">But there still remain areas of difference between us. The Council did not share our view on how to regulate for overfliers. Nor did it agree with Parliament's view on the need for a harmonised inspection regime. Members will recall my concern on how our proposals would affect the small aircraft operators and how we could resolve that, as also those involved in leisure flying, be it in gliders, hang-gliders or microlights. I believe it would be totally wrong to penalise any of these areas. That is why I held out for a fair deal for them.</p>
<p class="contents">For all our aircraft in the middle to large categories we are now in basic agreement. To safeguard the leisure flyer, in respect of gliders and microlights, I have asked my Group to put forward an amendment. I have agreed with the Council and the Commission – and I hope other colleagues will be able to agree with this as well – on what I believe is the best consensus available.</p>
<p class="contents">There are those who have said to me that this still does not go far enough, but I think we have the best consensus available to us at this moment in time. It allows those involved in flying for pleasure to be exempt from insurance cover for war and terrorism. Microlights have small engines, air stall speeds as low as 35 knots and limited weight. I believe the amendment covers an adequate compromise. If the Council and Commission agree, I will withdraw my amendment and there will be no need for a third reading of this particular report. We can then go forward into the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add one word of caution. This is an area of legislation that can change rapidly. We should return to and revise this directive within three to four years, in the light of whatever changes may take place. We must see and analyse the effects of this directive. The truth is that the major players in the aircraft industry have been totally unconcerned, it has not affected them. But it is the small, the vulnerable and the hobby flyer who could suffer most.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Commission and the Council for their extremely positive cooperation. I would like to thank the Irish presidency because it was, as stated in Mr Clegg's report, positive in ensuring we came to a final conclusion. Without that we would not have had this result, which I trust will bring forward a directive that will work.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank my shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation, which has enabled us to get to this stage, and also my committee colleagues for their cooperation. For me this has been something of an exercise in bringing a directive to Parliament that, by the time I go for re-election will, I hope, be effective legislation. That is something that will live with me for a long time. I look forward to the future. This is now a very good report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament has decided that we should deal jointly with three issues relating to the air sector, but which are of a different nature. I am therefore going to talk about them consecutively and separately and I am going to follow the order used by the honourable Members in their speeches.</p>
<p class="contents">I will begin with unfair pricing practices in the supply of air services from countries not members of the European Community and I would like to thank Mr Clegg for remaining in the Chamber for a while despite his condition.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like firstly to say that I am delighted that we have reached the second reading under the best possible circumstances in relation to such an important proposal, which must protect the position of our air sector, although it is absolutely correct to say that under no circumstances must it be used to restrict competition or the entry of third countries into our sector, but rather quite the opposite. What it must do is prevent our companies from having to face a situation of disadvantage when compared to third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We can expect this text to enter into force soon thanks to the wonderful spirit of cooperation between the institutions and in this regard I would like once again to thank Parliament and in particular Mr Clegg with whom we have worked in close cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The text provides the Union with new competences in order to defend itself in the event of certain anti-competitive practices on the part of third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This House has repeatedly expressed its concern about the harm which could be done to the competitive operation of the air market by certain subsidies granted by third countries. Mr Schmitt, draughtsman for the report on the negotiation of bilateral agreements on the part of the United States, has insisted on this very point and I hope that the approval of this regulation on this type of unfair practice at second reading will respond to his expectations and therefore assist development in the field of agreements with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In its first reading, the European Parliament contributed to clarifying and increasing the efficiency of the mechanisms laid down in the draft regulation, particularly by means of setting of time limits. The only amendment proposed at second reading will make the text completely consistent, laying down the sequential organisation between the activation of the mechanisms established in the bilateral instrument of the State and that of the Community instrument. In this regard, the Commission entirely agrees with the objectives of this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Once adopted – very soon I hope – this regulation will be an essential instrument so that the Union can prevent and correct any practice which may be adopted by third-country airlines which contravenes unfair competition standards.</p>
<p class="contents">I would insist that this represents an important supplementary stage to which we can add the other progress made over the last year in the consolidation of our air transport policy with the aim of fully controlling the vitally important international dimension of the air sector and defend the already very prominent role our industry plays.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the second report, I would like to highlight the work of the rapporteur, Mr Dhaene, and say that in the case of civil aviation security, in view of the numerous proposals presented, the introduction of certain modifications of Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 on civil aviation security, is not very significant. In truth, the intention is to rectify certain deficiencies in the framework regulation which the Member States indicated in 2003 on trying to apply the European Union rules in the field of aviation security to smaller airports, in which, due to their size and activities, there were aspects which did not make much sense.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal does not relate to any point of principle and I am happy to say that both the Council and the European Parliament have expressed their will to adopt it quickly at first reading. In this regard, the Commission is prepared to maintain a dialogue on possible changes to the content of this important regulation during the next legislature, if we consider that there are still issues to be dealt with.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the third report by Mr Nicholson, whom I wish every success in the coming elections, on insurance requirements for air operators and air carriers, I must say that I am delighted with the long journey taken by the proposed regulation. It is an extremely important regulation as we saw after 11 September, when our air companies were stretched to their limits and had to respond with the support of the public sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision-making process has led to strong support from all the institutions in order to reach a compromise. I would like to express my satisfaction at the constructive role played by this Parliament and I would stress once again the importance of this institution’s role and actions in achieving social support and the support of the sectors and people involved. I would like in particular to thank Mr Nicholson for the vital work he has done.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been demonstrated that aviation insurance is necessary in order to guarantee that people and property are adequately insured against possible damage on the ground and in flight. We want to guarantee cover for damage of all types, including that caused by acts of war or terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission understands and supports the form and the content of the amendment presented by the European Parliament to the common position. In fact, to a large extent it reflects the Commission's initial proposal in relation to sporting and recreational flying which uses small aircraft, weighing less than half a tonne.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, with regard to the damage caused by war and terrorism, it makes the insurance requirements for certain aircraft subject to the principle of subsidiarity. This guarantees, on the one hand, that governments, if they wish, can establish the insurance requirements for such risks and, on the other, that this type of aviation activity can be maintained without excessive costs, since the insurance requirements in the case of war and terrorism laid down in the regulation will not be applied to aircraft of less than 500 kg, which includes gliders and microlights.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that Mr Nicholson is completely right to say that we are dealing with a legislative proposal which will very possibly have to be revised within three or four years because it will depend on the international progress made in this field – and we hope that it is as positive as possible – in relation to liability with regard to third parties and progress on the Rome Convention – which is currently dealing with the issue. When the time comes, that will oblige us to modify the proposal, which is something we are prepared to do.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I hope that the general result will be acceptable to Parliament and the Council and that the codecision procedure on this issue can be completed at second reading during the current legislature.</p>
<p class="contents">So I would like to end, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by once again thanking the three rapporteurs for their wonderful work, which falls within the framework of our support for the European aviation sector and I hope that, with the agreement of the Council, it can be completed quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is rather sad that there is nobody here – no journalists, no members of the public – but that is how things are. The three rapporteurs have done an excellent job of dealing with substantial legislative initiatives, and we are pleased with the progress that has been made.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Clegg for having enabled us to come to an agreement with the Council on a joint regulation protecting our airlines against subsidisation and unfair pricing practices. Both of us – indeed, I believe, all of us – agree that this is not so much about the use of weaponry as about stocking up an ammunition box, one that we hope will enable us to prevent unfair subsidisation in America, among other places. We can in any case, if a stop is not put to it, threaten them with a whole ammunition depot full of sanctions against their airlines and to the benefit of our own. While we have no desire to restrict competition, we do want to have an ammunition box for the sake of fair competition at global level.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Dhaene has done well to improve the practical details of the Regulation establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security. I think that Parliament and the Council will endorse the Commission’s approach, which involves adapting the highly stringent rules that we need, post-9/11, to smaller airports in a practicable and affordable way, so I am grateful to Mr Dhaene for his practical solution. Contrary to what might sometimes be believed, we are not just engaged in enacting meaningless laws.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Nicholson probably had the toughest brief, that of insurance requirements, which is the most expensive issue to deal with. On these, insurance premiums depend, and they can get very expensive. I think we have managed to reconcile both the passengers’ interest in having a proper and high level of insurance cover and the airlines’ interest in premiums that remain affordable. The amounts involved represent a fair compromise. It is, I think, a very fine thing that Mr Nicholson has managed to take the right approach to gliders, too.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my thanks to Vice-President De Palacio. We are engaged – as we need to be – in adopting every kind of legislation relating to air transport by the end of this legislative period. One might say that a majority in this House, drawn from every political group, is united in favouring the adoption of these practical rules for really safe air transport, so, on behalf of my own group, let me thank the rapporteurs and the Vice-President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since 11 September 2001, there has not been a dull moment. Before I comment on the content of the reports, I should like to tell the House how satisfied I am that we have received a European approval for the merger of Air France and KLM and that the competent American authority has also given its stamp of approval. This is important for the industry, particularly in terms of strengthening the European aviation industry, because there is more to come. Even more is yet to be done to ensure that the industry has a sound economic basis.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the report by my colleague Mr Clegg, who has now left the House, I should like to stress the value of the amendment in the light of increasing competition. Many international competitors of European aviation companies operate unaffected by government measures, and this enables them to compete with European aviation companies in improper ways. It is good to stand up to this sort of practice.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the report by Mr Dhaene is concerned, I find it extremely agreeable if someone can indicate so specifically and realistically why he is not writing an own-initiative report at the moment. I think this bears witness to much class and I expect him to organise another bicycle trip; perhaps that is when the next round of discussions can be held.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as for Mr Nicholson's report, I am pleased that we were able to work together so intensively at a very early stage, across the political divide, to achieve a realistic result which is also in keeping with the ICAC (International Civil Aviation Conference) agreements that refer to a system of international premiums. Within this framework for European aviation, distortion of competition is virtually ruled out. The special exemption to which attention was drawn this evening is, of course, extremely important for ultra-light aircraft, government aircraft and historic aeroplanes. I am delighted with the progress and I also think it is very positive that Mr Nicholson has made every effort, right until the end, to ensure that we have a sound product here before us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
