Evans’s report is very important and I voted in favour of it.</p>
<p class="contents">The right of freedom of movement of European citizens is still being violated in many ways. Students in particular often encounter barriers and difficulties in Member States that should no longer occur under EU legislation. Studies by the European Commission show that needless red tape is causing problems for students from other EU countries. Residence permits are granted for just short periods of time and it is awkward and costly to renew them.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some unfortunate situations. In Spain students are required to deposit – in a Spanish bank account, note – special sums of money that act as a guarantee in order to rent accommodation. It is also complicated to arrange for students’ families to move. Recently it came out that certain estate agents handling rented accommodation in London would not accept a foreign, for example, a Finnish, guarantor that ensured the Finnish student’s rent would be paid. European rights of citizenship do not seem to carry much weight in this situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We were already condemning the financial difficulties facing Erasmus students during the last session.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone agrees that this mobility must be encouraged in the name of the free movement of persons, but also and especially because of all the benefits to the young citizens of Europe and hence the European Union. Unfortunately, in practice, the obstacles are still there. That is what the Commission proposal deplores and the Evans report confirms.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the recommendation, based on Articles 149 and 150 of the Treaty, Member States need to be encouraged to adopt measures which will steadily remove the existing difficulties, and the citizens of the Union should be offered a platform of rights leading to real mobility. While this proposal is a step in the right direction it still contains a number of gaps which the Evans report remedies.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, it includes researchers within the scope of the recommendation. I think that this is crucial, given that its importance is constantly emphasised in the context of building a European research area.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Evans also demonstrates that people hoping to benefit from programmes in this area need to be better informed about their social security entitlements.</p>
<p class="contents">Knowledge of foreign languages is accepted as a necessary precursor to mobility. Remember that 2001 has been designated European Year of Languages. It is therefore vital to promote the learning of at least two Community languages, to encourage linguistic and cultural preparation prior to any mobility measure.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are the scandalous taxes on renewal of residence permits. These must be regarded as an obstacle to be eliminated.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also stresses the need to eliminate obstacles to mobility, be they legal, linguistic, cultural, financial or administrative. I call on the Member States to coordinate the formalities to be fulfilled for enrolling in the establishments of other Member States. I am especially thinking of deadlines. To illustrate my point, I need only refer to a case brought to my attention last Friday. A young man who had passed his Baccalaureat was refused registration in Belgium, because he had missed the deadline by three days!</p>
<p class="contents">It is very difficult for French Baccalaureat candidates to meet a deadline of 15 July when they only receive their results in mid-July, and must then obtain recognition of their qualification – recognition which, in my opinion, costs far too much – not to mention the young people who have to re-sit and who are penalised by a year in some cases because of that. This is just one example among many. I shall end by mentioning one of my pet subjects, mutual recognition of qualifications. To avoid repeating myself, I refer you to my earlier speeches. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report is all the more important because it comes at a critical time for the European Union, a time of enlargement.

<p class="contents">I will deal firstly with Amendment No 15. This amendment highlights a procedure concerning the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire. </span>The Association Agreements concluded between the European Union and the candidate countries, and those which have yet to be concluded, should incorporate regulations banning discrimination against groups protected under Article 13. It is all the more crucial for this step to be taken if certain candidate countries have minorities that require protection on the employment and occupation front.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: Amendment No 18. The amendment refers to the fact that many Member States have provisions in place that could lead to discrimination against homosexuals seeking employment. However, the amendment does not emphasise the importance of criminal law provisions in dealing with such behaviour. It takes the form of a recommendation, in as much as it states that the Member States should annul these provisions. In phrasing it this way, the principle of subsidiarity is upheld. This does not fall within Europe’s sphere of competence.</p>
<p class="contents">I was slightly disappointed that we did not have the opportunity to get majority support for the need to set a limit on the storage of documents. I had proposed six to twelve months. As I see it, that would be realistic in operational terms. I worked for companies for many years. We were unable to achieve this. What we did manage to achieve though, and what pleased me enormously, was that we were able to make it abundantly clear that special regulations must be introduced for religious communities, because we must make it possible for people to identify with the idea behind and the fundamental aims of these communities. We scored a major common victory there, to my mind, and we also finally managed to secure regulations benefiting the physically handicapped. I am delighted that people have been so willing to compromise today, as indeed our voting has shown. I would like to thank you all again most warmly for your excellent teamwork. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, 5 October 2000, did not start well, but it has become the happiest day of my time at Parliament, for today Amendment No 62 to Mr Thomas Mann's report has been adopted.

<p class="contents">In my opinion, this is an extremely important result: it shows – if I may be permitted to rejoice at this, Mr President – that there is some point to my being here. I would like to thank the Members who helped and supported me – for I could not have achieved this result alone – Mr Speroni of the Lega Nord, Mr Thomas Mann, the rapporteur, from the European People's Party, Mrs Lambert of the Group of the Greens and Mr Helmer from the British Conservative Party.

<p class="contents">For example, Article 9(1) of the proposal for a directive, provides that when persons who consider themselves wronged because the principle of equal treatment has not been applied to them take action, they need only establish a presumption of discrimination before the court; making it incumbent on the defendant, that is, the employer, to prove wrongful accusation. This article has been slightly modified by an amendment from the European Parliament, which complicates the wording, but does not alter the general thrust.</p>
<p class="contents">If this directive were adopted, it would then be up to the accused employer to prove his innocence, not up to the accuser to provide evidence for his claim. Thus, the usual principles of the rule of law are being gradually altered under the influence of an extremist approach to combating discrimination, with the European Parliament and Commission only too happy to join in and poke their noses into every national law.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet again, we cannot approve of this shift, which is also going to be boosted by the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, because its present wording extends the anti-discrimination clause that the Treaty of Amsterdam has already introduced into European law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That kind of provision bears witness to the Community’s commitment to promote a more just, more egalitarian society, and above all, it has opened the way to appropriate Community action aimed at contributing to the fight against discrimination in general. It means the efforts made by the Community to promote gender equality can be completed by attacking new grounds for discrimination. It gives new and significant impetus to Community action in an area where a certain legislative <span class="italic">acquis</span> and fruitful cooperation with civil society exist.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the basis on which measures to combat discrimination have been adopted. The proposals consist of two draft directives, covering discrimination in employment and discrimination based on race and ethnic origin, and an action programme intended to support the efforts of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the parallel directive on equal treatment irrespective of race or ethnic origin, the Council succeeded in reaching political agreement after the European Parliament revised its opinion on the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore had to vote on the directive on equal treatment in employment and the 2001/2006 Action Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">To explain my votes, I would first say that the right to equal treatment and protection against discrimination is a fundamental human right. But while this right has been recognised, it is very far from being converted into reality, hence the advantage of adopting determined and coordinated measures at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Mann report on equal treatment in employment, I shall limit myself to emphasising my satisfaction that the grounds for derogation have been successfully reduced to the minimum. Otherwise the door would be opened to abuses contrary to the aim of this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain possibilities remain and I have to admit I am unhappy about them. These are the grounds for derogation in matters of religion. The provision for derogation on religious grounds on the basis of the notion of essential and direct occupational requirements carries the risk of broad interpretation. As a confirmed secularist, I cannot associate myself with that.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, I am concerned about the derogations authorised on the basis of age, as older people are particularly at risk of discrimination in relation to employment.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the action programme to fight discrimination, the European Commission’s proposal was broadly satisfactory. There were some deplorable gaps and inaccuracies which have been corrected, with my support. I felt it was essential to broaden the scope of the programme in order to ensure the implementation of Article 13 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very pleased that harassment will in future be regarded as a form of discrimination and that there is recognition that discrimination must be prevented, not just combated.</p>
<p class="contents">It was important to reaffirm the need to associate the candidate countries with this programme. Everyone is well aware of the problems faced by certain minorities in those countries. My final comment relates to the budget for this programme, EUR 98.4 million. That figure is obviously inadequate given the actions envisaged.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I support the spirit of these proposals and I have voted for most of them, the exception being where they are in contradiction with my secularism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is actually one of three parts of a package of measures on combating discrimination based on the new Article 13, introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, and includes a Community action programme.</p>
<p class="contents">These texts should, then, fill a glaring gap in the construction of Europe: recognition of the real needs of people excluded or marginalised in our societies because of disability, age, or membership of a minority. The texts therefore represent some of the first steps towards the people’s Europe that we have wanted for so long. So, I enthusiastically support this proposal for a directive and the very positive amendments proposed by our rapporteur to improve its effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">In so doing, I wish to stress the importance of the amendments to improve the protection of people with disabilities by clarifying the terms ‘reasonable accommodation’ of the workplace and ‘undue hardship’ for the employer, and those toughening the ban on discrimination against older people who freely choose to go on working – 63% of Europeans aged 55-64 do not work – and those strengthening the vital autonomy of management and the unions as well as the crucial role of social dialogue in actually implementing equal treatment in businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel, the amendment extending the exception to the principle of non-discrimination to the wider ‘social’ activities of religious organisations, where the discrimination is solely based on religious conviction and on no other grounds, is a reinforcement of the specific nature and original contribution of these structures as compared with public or private services.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the amendments providing for penalties against companies infringing the principle of equal treatment by excluding them from public contracts seem to me both poorly adapted to the purpose and subject to divergent interpretation. In addition, they open the door to distortions in competition between businesses in different European Union countries. That is why I wish to express reservations on that point, while voting in favour of the text as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Amendment No 37: the form the committee have proposed for Article 4.2 of this directive is good and could ensure there is a significant degree of continuity in the wider social activities of religious organisations, which is a basis for all European socio-political thinking, and is still an important part of its activity in practice.

His report was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we then had 13 improvement amendments to consider, in addition to the 60 contained in the Mann report on the directive proposed by the Commission. There is a saying we would do well not to ignore in our efforts to amend the Commission proposals, which are actually well thought through as a rule, and this is how it goes ‘what is better is the enemy of what is good’. That is only common sense in fact.</p>
<p class="contents">One could not help but wonder if common sense had always prevailed in the drafting of certain, no doubt well-meaning, proposed amendments that were now before us.</p>
<p class="contents">If the directive is to be adopted and implemented, it must not be encumbered with a literary approach and wishful thinking, which have no place in a legal document.</p>
<p class="contents">That is most certainly true of the amendment which proposes that this directive should end the sexually discriminatory practice of stipulating that only male personnel can wear a tie. If absurdity could kill then the authors of such an amendment would definitely no longer be with us.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is also going too far to expect employers to provide statistics on all aspects of their employment of people falling within the scope of this directive. The authorities already have their work cut out. This brings to mind another sound rule of thumb: ‘no one can achieve the impossible’.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that we can do without the entire contents of the new Article 12 (a). The Commission rightly refrained – on the basis of the subsidiarity principle, of course – from instructing the Member States to set up new institutions for monitoring the application of the principle of equal treatment, which could be consulted by every conceivable, and inconceivable, group of people or association etc, requesting free handling of their complaints, and which could even be granted access to confidential personnel files.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite all the inconsistencies and superfluous proposals, which do nothing to help the cause, I did not want to vote against the report at the final vote. But here too, I feel that ‘less would have been more’, and the Commission proposal, without the superfluous amendments, is the better and more logical instrument for ensuring equal treatment in employment and occupation, which is, after all, what we want. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However the EPLP has strong reservations about the following areas.</p>
<p class="contents">On disability, whilst we welcome the principle of the proposals, the UK are justly proud of our own disability discrimination legislation, but we do not want to impose our model on other Member States. However, we do want to ensure the directive lets us continue with the approach in the Disability Discrimination Act, although we recognise that some relatively minor changes may be required.</p>
<p class="contents">On age, the EPLP welcomes the principle of fighting age discrimination in employment and training. This is a very complex area and the proposals are far-reaching and ambitious. However, we feel it is important that the Community has legislation which is clear and workable.</p>
<p class="contents">On religion/belief, the EPLP welcomes the principle of protection on these grounds. For the UK this would end the anomaly whereby two non-major Christian groups (Jews, Sikhs), receive protection both from direct and indirect discrimination under the UK Race Relations Act as they are recognised by the courts as ethnic groups as well as religious groups. Under some circumstances, Muslims receive protection, but only in cases of indirect discrimination, whilst Afro-Caribbean Muslims, white Muslims and indeed Christians, receive no protection at all. However, the UK is one of the most religiously diverse populations in the European Union, so it is important that the proposals are right. The EPLP is concerned to ensure that the directive will permit Section 60 of the UK Schools Standard and Framework Act 1998 to remain unaltered.</p>
<p class="contents">On sexual orientation, we welcome the principle of the Commission's proposals to fight discrimination on this ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Further Concerns:</p>
<p class="contents">Much of the text will need further clarification before it is finalised. We have concerns about the unclear definitions of 'reasonable accommodation' and 'undue hardship' in Article 2(4), and the possible contradiction with the public procurement directives in the amendment on Article 55. Several areas of difference with the race directive should be eliminated, such as the definition of indirect discrimination in Amendment No 21, the defence of rights in Article 8, the text on victimisation in Article 10, and Article 11 covering dissemination of information. We also feel that the directive should be clear about which differences of treatment on the grounds of age are permissible and which are not.</p>
<p class="contents">We have concerns about several elements which appear to be overburdensome: notably application of the legislation to volunteer workers in charities and to public posts, and also compulsory collection and monitoring of statistics. We are concerned about the inclusion of health, social security and assistance as there are considerable national differences in how these matters are handled and whether they form part of the employee/employer relationship. There are also elements which, we feel, should be left to Member States such as overall implementation, provision of training to particular age groups of workers, the nature of a mediation system, and how SMEs are to interpret the directive. Finally, some elements should be permissive rather than mandatory to cater for different Member State practices.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the negations to come will provide an opportunity to tackle these issues and we look forward to enactment of the directive and the benefits it will bring to workers in the UK and other EU countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rapporteur Van Hulten expressed the following view in an interview with a Dutch weekly magazine, “It is called Europe, it is in Brussels and is corrupt.” Thanks to the action taken by a “whistle blower” and the Committee of Wise Men, corruption has been brought out into the open. In the interview, Mr Van Hulten is right in saying that we will not be able to draft a positive agenda until we have solved problems such as fraud, waste, but also a lack of efficiency and effectiveness in decision-making.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial reform, more specifically the establishment of an internal audit department, is conducive to the European Union’s effectiveness. Rapporteur Van Hulten is right in filling in the gaps in the Commission proposal: what is needed is a clear definition of the distribution of responsibilities between financial control and internal audit. But if Mr Van Hulten would like to dedicate himself to an efficient and effective Union, we, along with the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, cannot see why he should exempt smaller institutions, such as the Committee of the Regions, from internal audit duty.</p>
<p class="contents">This view is at the expense of transparency of the financial regulation. Naturally the number of transactions in the smaller institutions is smaller than in the large ones – the 800 000 transactions performed annually in the Commission eclipse the 10 000 transactions performed annually in the Committee of the Regions. But this only says something about the staffing levels of the internal audit department and nothing about the financial significance and hence usefulness of such a department.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the reason why I have applied for split voting on Amendment No 3. In this way, it will still be possible to include the obligation of an internal audit department in the proposal. Although the rapporteur shares my view that all institutions must be given equal treatment, he would like to postpone this equal treatment until the definitive review of the financial regulation in eighteen months’ time. In my view, if the opportunity presents itself to step up efficiency within the EU institutions, each day that passes while we are waiting is one too many.</p>
<p class="contents">To set up an internal audit office in the institutions will naturally require effort, but that effort will remain the same, whether it is made now or in the future. The image of Europe is not served by the efficient operation of the large EU institutions alone; in many respects, it is probably the small ones that make all the difference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is no link between the development of the arms industry and EU cooperation in the area of military policy. The EU has decided to develop a joint military capacity in order to fulfil the so-called Petersberg objectives (crisis management and conflict resolution outside the territory of the EU), but it has no common defence policy. The individual EU countries are members of NATO and the WEU, or else are non-aligned. Policy on arms exports must start from that point, and a distinction must be made between supervising an arms industry developed for political reasons (namely crisis management) and arms exports for purely commercial reasons. In our view, such exports ought to be kept to a minimum and, in the long term, completely abolished.</p>
<p class="contents">We are particularly opposed to the wording of Paragraph R and Paragraph 1 d) and e) of the report, to the effect that the development of arms exports should lead to the development of a common defence policy and the establishment of a defence identity within NATO, and that the arms industry should benefit from the EU’s developing a common code of conduct on arms exports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many of Mr Titley’s proposals and comments in the report represent improvements to the Council’s original report. Nonetheless, we have decided to vote against Mr Titley’s report for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="contents">The report means continued recognition of the importance of a strong European military capacity instead of placing the emphasis on the need for disarmament and peace. The report sees arms export controls primarily as a method of avoiding awkward situations for Europe’s military industry and not as a way of achieving disarmament and peace. Moreover, the report discusses European arms exports as a way of solving future local conflicts in the immediate vicinity of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the request from the Group of the Greens, the rapporteur has also consistently failed to discuss Turkey which, through its membership of NATO, is in practice excluded from the codes of conduct.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also means that Europe’s war industry is regarded as an economically important industry, and that is an indefensible perspective on an industry whose primary task is implicitly to kill and annihilate people.</p>
<p class="contents">As long as the European Parliament is unable to make the logical connection between the production and sale of arms and the continued global military destruction of the environment and human life, we cannot support reports such as this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am therefore in favour of a code of conduct which renders it impossible to produce and export arms and which results in arms factories switching over to the production of useful commodities. From this perspective, I have read Mr Titley’s proposals and examined to what extent his text contributes to a world of peace without weapons. In general terms, I endorse the small steps forward, even if they do not, by any means, completely lead to the solutions put forward by myself. It is a different matter if such a small step forward puts a spanner in the works when it comes to reaching real solutions. I believe that the choice today is not between complete freedom in the arms trade and this code of conduct. If these were the two options, I would endorse the code of conduct as the lesser of the two evils, the underlying rationale being that something is better than nothing. However, the real choice is between this code of conduct and a complete ban. The code of conduct is based on the assumption that the arms trade will continue to exist and that European arms production must be promoted. The excrescences are being regulated because it is they that draw attention and instil indignation. The issue of the arms trade itself remains out of range.

We all now recognise the impact and the harm which the daily and increasing bombardment of violent television programmes and similar multimedia products wreaks on young people, who are less discerning because their critical faculties are not fully developed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission text and the report contain a number of accurate findings as regards the adverse impact on the psychological makeup and developing personality of children and, consequently, on the dangers in store for tomorrow’s society as the result of their watching these programmes and using these products. However, their proposals are confined to watersheds and programme classification and, in adopting the Oxford University report on television programme filtering devices, which parents have to buy before they can use them to protect their children, are targeted specifically at digital and subscriber television.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, the delicate and sensitive issue of the protection of our children, i.e. the members of tomorrow’s society, are being hijacked by commercialisation and the profit motive.</p>
<p class="contents">The entire onus of protecting children is on the parents and the question of the actual production and broadcasting of programmes which are harmful to children is hardly even touched on. And, assuming that they can afford these filtering devices, how are parents supposed to protect their children from so-called children’s programmes, the majority of which contain scenes of violence and some of which are scarier than horror films? And how are they supposed to protect them from the violence which inundates multimedia products and the Internet?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication acknowledges the problem but proposes no specific measures because it is blinkered by the philosophy of market liberalisation and competition, and any proposals which it makes fail to get to the heart of the harsh reality – a reality especially harsh on children – of the unaccountability of multinationals which, in their lust for profit, are indifferent to the impact which their programmes and products have and which not only shift the entire responsibility to parents but even expect them to buy new products to protect their children. The only reference to companies is to do with a code of self-regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">We do agree with a number of interesting proposals on protecting children in the Angelilli report, such as the need for a detailed study into the moral and legal aspects of the protection of minors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Under the provisions of Article 22b(2) of the ‘Television without frontiers’ directive (Directive 97/36/EC of 30 June 1997, amending Directive 89/552/EC), the Commission was required to conduct an inquiry into the advantages and possible disadvantages of measures designed to facilitate control by parents and educationalists over the programmes minors can watch. I am delighted this study has been completed. The legal and ethical framework does indeed vary from one Member State to another in line with national traditions and culture. There is no single European definition of a minor nor is there full agreement on what is or is not harmful to minors watching certain television programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone agrees, however, that it is in the public interest to make a decisive stand against the wave of violence and other content dangerous to young people which is flooding television programmes and audiovisual services transmitted via networks, in order to protect the psychological balance of minors. Minors are different from adults. They are more vulnerable, less able to exercise critical judgement and at greater risk of being disturbed. Like the rapporteur, I believe measures intended to protect young people from violent and harmful programmes should not be limited to traditional television but should apply to all media.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think it is essential to put the emphasis on teaching children media skills. So there is a need to strengthen national and regional awareness-raising campaigns on the protection of minors in the media context, involving families and the education world. Also, television programme filtering devices must be sold at prices affordable to all.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, such measures obviously do not imply that the service providers should in any way be relieved of all responsibility for the content they broadcast. Given that issues linked to radio and television are the responsibility of the Member States, I support the request made to them that they and the Commission lay down in law the responsibilities incumbent on the media companies. I also think it is essential for European Union television operators to draw up a code of self-regulation for the protection of minors.</p>
<p class="contents">I end by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report confirms that it is in the public interest to protect children from viewing excessive television violence and other programmes that may produce harmful effects.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject of this report is both highly specific and highly complex. Any further analysis of specific technology such as filtering systems will have to take account of the advances in technology which are evident today. This report is based on the principle of common sense. It is premised on the need for television broadcasting to take responsibility for the protection of minors by means of a self-regulatory code which should apply throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">A committee of experts will also be constituted at a European Community level with the mandate of drawing up a memorandum setting out general principles for the protection of minors in the media context.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now incumbent on the European Commission and the European Parliament and all interested parties to work together to see how best young people can be protected from viewing excessive television violence. I would hope that the key television broadcasting organisations, both from the private and the public sector within the European Union, will engage positively in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly we must recognise that technology is changing rapidly within the television sector within Europe. Digitalisation of old analogue television networks is taking place across the length and breadth of the participating Member States of the EU. This, too, will lead to greater challenges for legislators to put in place the necessary protective measures to guarantee that young children are protected from viewing wholly violent and inappropriate television programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">I will be working closely at national European level to ensure that EU governments implement the necessary legislation to put in place the necessary protective mechanisms which I have addressed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With viewing averaging three hours per day, it is the most extensive human activity after sleep and – for adults – work.</p>
<p class="contents">Changes at work, like more working women and more flexible hours, mean children are increasingly left alone with the small screen. There are various solutions, but none is satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">A self-regulation code for professionals is an excellent solution, however. I feel that this is the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur has stressed, parental control must not end with TV. Children are also great consumers of the Internet and video games. The approach must include all forms of image transmission.</p>
<p class="contents">I have voted firmly in favour of Mrs Angelilli’s report. She spells out the difficulties of operating at Community level, when every Member State has its own history and its own special relationship with its national television. Individual cultural features are reflected in the content of programmes. Furthermore, the definitions of child and minor differ from one legal system to another.</p>
<p class="contents">I also support the amendments from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party which contribute useful details on ‘who does what’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with them completely; however, I should like to point out that this is a minor issue at a time when there is a major issue at stake. What I mean is that these proposals are contained in a non-binding Commission communication, while the binding "Television without frontiers"; directive (97/36/ΕC) to which they refer is being infringed time and again by almost every Member State. Under these circumstances, it is essential that all the Member States comply with Community legislation as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I have ascertained from a personal investigation in the relevant Commission services that eight Member States (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Portugal, Sweden, Spain and the UK) are applying Community legislation, while the rest (France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and Luxembourg) are infringing it one way or another.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with my fellow Member that these measures should not be confined solely to television and should also apply to the Internet, which no longer has any reason to “envy” television, now that its multiple applications include film projections.</p>
<p class="contents">If all these proposals are to be translated from theory into practice, we need to create filtering and classification mechanisms which allow parents to select the programmes which are suitable for their children. Encouraging industry to move in this direction through international collaboration and increasing parents’, teachers’ and children’s awareness will act as a catalyst. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It must be said that although equality between women and men has been proclaimed by law, the facts are there to remind us that the discrimination and difficulties women face unfortunately persist.</p>
<p class="contents">Women are the most vulnerable to unemployment. The 1998 report makes a special study of the phenomenon of unemployment and the economic impact of under-employment of women. It also analyses the measures taken to incorporate employment policies strictly focused on women or policies to restrict gender discrimination in employment, for example, in employment contracts, types of employment and remuneration.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, women are often in ‘flexible’ jobs; temporary contracts and low salaries are typical in sectors where women employees are in a majority. Women’s careers are often unstable, and they can only acquire experience with difficulty. That situation is often illustrated by low levels of social protection and precarious living conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Women are also over-represented in ‘typically female’ occupations but under-represented in jobs with responsibility and in the professions. Furthermore, women are not as well represented as men in rapidly growing sectors such as information and communications technologies, with women tending to occupy the lowest level in the hierarchy. It is therefore crucial to restore balance by establishing education and training policies specifically geared to young women.</p>
<p class="contents">Gender disparity is also prevalent when it comes to wages and salaries. Figures available for 1995 show that for the European Union as a whole, the hourly wage for a woman is only 73% of that for a man doing equal work.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore fully support the rapporteur in urging the Commission to pursue its efforts and in particular to strengthen the ‘strategic’ nature of its annual reports, by assessing the effectiveness of policy initiatives rather than contenting itself with describing them.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think it is necessary to stress that Community standards of respect for women’s rights and equal opportunities should be implemented in the candidate countries even before they join.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I invite the Member States to pursue the dual strategy advocated at Community level, involving mainstreaming and specific actions for women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we have before us is a motion which, although not lacking in proposals for studies and research, stops well short of a real approach which will highlight crucial problems not yet resolved and the new problems which are beginning to threaten existing rights and achievements, together with their real causes.</p>
<p class="contents">Women are still one of the most vulnerable sections of society, whose rights are rudely trampled underfoot by the current social and economic system. That is what we should have acknowledged first, then we would not have had such a knee-jerk report singing praises and dispensing declarations of intent.</p>
<p class="contents">Equal opportunities at work, equal social participation, equality in health and elsewhere are impossible within a framework of reactionary policies offensive to human dignity as a whole, without equal social prospects, in a society of unemployment and underemployment, with no welfare state, a society in which human values are costed and commercialised.</p>
<p class="contents">Social rights and social achievements are not expanding; on the contrary, they are increasingly being eroded on the grounds that they are too expensive. The flexible, elastic forms of employment generously offered to women are not a sign of progress; they are sleights of hand by the economically powerful in a bid to counteract the economic crisis and safeguard competitiveness and excessive profits at the expense of workers and women. And the first victims are women, who still get less pay for the same work, who still tend to occupy inferior, unskilled jobs, who face more problems and who have unequal access to the job market. They are the first to fall foul of cuts in public spending, privatisation of the health sector, the right to health care and medical attention – never mind the right to prevention and information programmes. They work in conditions which are bad for their physical, mental and spiritual health, conditions which affect women more than men because they have to juggle so many duties and take on double and triple social roles. Even the report acknowledges that, “In addition to their general failure to substantiate the impact of policies and programmes, the reports also fail to discuss the factors behind continuing inequality.”</p>
<p class="contents">How can progress in resolving women’s problems and offering them institutional protection against all forms of discrimination be planned and strengthened within the framework of a social and economic system which commercialises and subjects everything to the rigours of public financial policy and the quest for greater profit? A policy of fundamental protection for women cannot be implemented unless we redirect and radically restructure our social development model. In the face of plans and practices to exploit and oppress, in the face of discriminatory tactics, we call on women to enforce and claim their demands together with men within the framework of a wide grass-roots battle front in each individual country.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it has some positive points, this motion merely skirts round the problem. We fear that its proclamations and good intentions are, yet again, no more than ‘lame excuses’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
