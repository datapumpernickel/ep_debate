However, there is no common VAT system operating within the European Union at this time, and the present lack of uniformity in this regard has led to fragmentation of the workings of the single market operating across fifteen different fiscal areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that it is impossible to know about all the VAT provisions in force in the other Member States of the EU means that taxpayers have to operate in a situation of legal uncertainty as well as having to work with various different bureaucratic structures in different Member States of the EU. VAT is one of the areas covered by the second phase of the SLIM initiative (Simpler Legislation for the Internal Market) in which the European Commission has shown considerable interest.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, SLIM has identified the need to bring in simpler VAT refund procedures which would assist business across the European Union in the payment of refunds for the sale of goods or the provision of services. As part of the ongoing work to improve the common VAT system, the European Commission has put forward proposals concerning the right to deduct VAT costs that have been incurred. It seeks to change the current system by which traders have to go through exceedingly complex and costly procedures to ask for a refund from the tax authorities in the Member State in which the VAT was incurred. This will be replaced with a simpler system under which companies can use their regular VAT return to deduct VAT incurred in another Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal also seeks to lay down common rules for the right to deduct VAT on certain categories of expenditure which have an element of private consumption such as food, drink, hotel accommodation and passenger cars.</p>
<p class="contents">I support measures which help business prosper and operate more effectively within the territories of the EU. The European Union must introduce fair and definitive rules governing the common VAT system based on the principle of a single place of taxation and deduction.</p>

Both the rapporteur's recommendations and the Commission's proposal make significant changes to tax deductibility in respect of business usage of cars, hotels, food and drink, and entertainment. In many instances these proposals will add to the administrative burden of businesses, especially small‐ and medium‐sized enterprises. In addition, not enough flexibility has been built into the proposals to reflect national systems of addressing such VAT deductibility.</p>

The European Commission has examined the problems caused by the interaction between traditional regulation and the requirements of the on‐line economy and it tries to identify areas where strengthened international coordination is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">It does not propose a specific solution to these questions as such and it does not suggest that global regulation should be introduced for the Internet or that new international entities should be created. However, I believe that the idea to establish an Internet charter which will be a legally non‐binding document setting out internationally agreed objectives and principles in areas such as taxation, liability, jurisdiction and data protection would be a very good idea indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">From a European perspective, the main purpose of this charter would be to ensure that European companies and organisations can fully participate in the opportunity offered by the Internet and electronic commerce so as to avoid premature and conflicting regulations and to ensure that the interests of consumers are safeguarded at all times.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy of Parliament is right to endorse the European Commission's proposal for an international initiative for the Internet and electronic commerce. Such a document would ensure that a set of internationally agreed objectives be drawn up in close cooperation with other countries, most notably the United States of America, and would encourage simplified regulatory governance of the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">Information technology has made extraordinary strides in recent years and the advent of the Internet has brought the benefits of IT into many homes and businesses in recent times. The setting up of an Internet charter would be a very sensible idea and one which would be for the benefit of consumers. The rights of consumers must be of paramount consideration for the European Commission and the European Parliament at all times.</p>
<p class="contents">From an Irish perspective I welcome the recent initiative by the Irish Government which seeks to make Ireland the centre of electronic commerce in Europe in the very near future.</p>

I therefore agree with the Commission that a broad dialogue between the authorities, business, consumers and international organisations is absolutely essential. For the same reason, I have long supported the creation of an international Internet Charter, and I therefore welcome this proposal from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I also support the extensions of the charter recommended by the committee, for example to protect the interests of consumers and avoid conflicting legislation, both inside and outside the EU.</p>

Strengthened international coordination will assist the fight against pornography on the Internet and protect consumers taking advantage of the electronic marketplace against credit card fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">In an increasingly knowledge‐based society, the Internet is a major tool of empowerment for the people of the North West, Britain and Europe as a whole, whether in the marketplace or the workplace.</p>
<p class="contents">The Labour Party has a long track record of supporting the development of information technology. It was Tony Blair who reached a ground‐breaking agreement with British Telecom to connect every school in Britain to the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">A recent survey found that 29 % of British adults now have access to the Internet. I want to see this figure increase and Internet access broadened to as wide a cross‐section of society as possible. A successful, high‐skill economy demands that knowledge be available to the many and not the few.</p>

I should like to outline the main considerations that led us to this conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear from the outset that it is not easy to apply the principles of the single market to commercial communications while at the same time meeting the public interest objectives. Each Member State has its own rules on the admissibility of commercial communications, and the wide range of laws, rules and practices reflect the diversity of the religious, cultural and social values held by people in the Member States. So it is more than just a legal problem. Promoting efficiency is a good thing, but when the need for efficiency takes precedence over ethical and cultural aspects – such as by saying that they do not come within the concept of ‘the general good" – then as legislator you no longer have any means of guaranteeing the necessary respect for fundamental values or of preventing people from being hurt or offended by things said in commercial communications.</p>
<p class="contents">The recognition of religious, cultural and social differences in the Member States should therefore be given full consideration in any legislation on cross‐border commercial communications. Recitals D and H and paragraphs 2 and 5 of the resolution call for exactly the opposite. Finally, it must be seen as an omission that not a single mention is made of the harm done indirectly to the environment by the fact that many commercial communications simply encourage consumerism.</p>

They employ more than a million Europeans and are still growing, thanks to the development of new information technologies and new demand. The Commission has now decided to adopt a number of measures which will make it easier to offer commercial communications services across borders, but not of course at the expense of the general interest. The Commission's initiative is a necessary and positive one, but I agree with the committee that the actions proposed should be adjusted and made more specific in a number of respects.

<p class="contents">In Ireland the local post offices play a very important role as a contact point for people, especially the elderly. Also, of all the public utilities, people employed in the Post Office generally live in their working area and contribute to the local economy and community development.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it is vital that any moves towards liberalisation will have to be preceded by a full state‐by‐state evaluation of the economic, employment, social and community effects.</p>

The Luxembourg Socialists have always stressed the social and economic importance of the postal services and the need to provide quality services. They also insist on a universal service that is not a minimum service, but one which ensures optimum coverage of the whole national territory. The Commission had announced that it would present a new proposal on the gradual and controlled liberalisation of the postal services before the end of 1998, but nothing came of it.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore support the wish of the European Parliament to evaluate the consequences of liberalisation before any further progress is made. This evaluation must be based on the Commission"s feasibility studies, but also on Parliament"s own analysis, in cooperation with the postal services in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the evaluation must take into account not only short‐term profitability, but also the consequences for employment, the social benefits for all consumers, and efficiency for the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the manner in which the Luxembourg Socialists will approach any other moves towards liberalisation on the part of the Commission.</p>

Now, according to some information, the Commission services are preparing a new proposal for a regulation. This would call into question the provision that was recently decided on, which notably moves towards increased liberalisation. However, we had decided that, before undertaking any review, we should evaluate the effects of the new regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we admit that any measure can be adapted to make it more effective, we question the merits of a major review of all the recent regulations on the European postal services, when we have still not established the results of those regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">If we try to legislate too much, and too quickly, we legislate badly. This is why we think that, before any changes are made, we need to know the effects of the regulations that are in force.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, we therefore ask the Commission to undertake an impact study of the changes brought about by the 1997 directive. This evaluation would consider the consequences of increased liberalisation of the postal services, covering the social, economic and financial aspects. The results of such a study would enable the European legislatures in the various countries to have highly precise information in order to be able to judge whether it is really necessary to take new measures, and to what extent.</p>
<p class="contents">As long as the results of this impact study of Directive 97/67/EC are not known in each country, we consider any change in the regulations to be inappropriate.</p>

Schengen creates the conditions for freedom of movement which we are seeking. It is in all of our interests that the Schengen Convention should work effectively, without undermining integrity. And indeed on these issues there is reason to praise the report.</p>
<p class="contents">My concern is the Nordic Passport Union. In Scandinavia, we have an effective system of freedom of movement, and it is important that this can still be maintained when Schengen becomes part of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">This requires better Scandinavian adaptation to EU legislation. One example is the extradition legislation in Norway. Other examples can also be found where coordination in Scandinavia is necessary. The Nordic Council should go through the legislation to find areas which involve Schengen in order to achieve a common Nordic harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The police and customs cooperation in Scandinavia, the Nordic Passport Union and the common travel zone between the UK and Ireland are all examples of effective ways of developing freedom of movement which do not involve creating more police controls than in other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislation in the Nordic countries is not uniform, but there is a significant degree of approximation. This shows that such approximation could also take place at European level, in step with the increase in day‐to‐day interaction between the Union's citizens, thereby also strengthening our common sense of identity and culture.</p>
<p class="contents">Legal approximation between countries must always be handled very carefully. However, it is clear that this is needed within the Union. It would make living together in the Union easier.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been possible to detect a certain north/south divide in the concept of right and wrong in the debates this week, as far as irregularities in the Commission are concerned. Approximation between our countries with regard to a concept of justice would be welcome, exactly as has taken place in Scandinavia.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank the presidency for its kind words about my reports on organised crime, especially the latest on preventative measures, which I hope will be able to provide a stimulus towards developing a common approach to legal issues.</p>

As this paragraph disappeared in favour of Amendment No 4, which is more neutral, we did vote for the final text, despite the adoption of Article 19, which we would also have liked to have removed.</p>
<p class="contents">We felt that it was necessary for this report to be adopted in order to urge the Council to make up for the delays that it denounces and to take into account Parliament"s demands on relations between Parliament and the Council.</p>

<p class="contents">In other words, the free movement of persons is a priority and the countervailing security measures must, in all cases, take second place. This astonishing statement sheds a very dangerous light on Articles 61 onwards of the Treaty of Amsterdam and could be sufficient cause for France to halt the ratification of the Treaty in order to find out more.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, we would find it intolerable if the Council working group, which is currently considering the division of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> between the first and third pillars, were to block the Schengen safeguard clause. This clause must be introduced in its current form and without the slightest restriction into the first pillar, notwithstanding the recitals of the Schengen Protocol, which, absurdly, seem to state the contrary. If necessary, the French Government will have to go as far as using force on this issue, as it is so crucial for the security of our fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by expanding a little on this. For a week now, in the debates on fraud, we have been hearing the Commission say that if everything is going badly it is because it is overloaded with tasks that it does not have the resources to undertake. Now, the recommendation on Schengen that we have just adopted after the Amsterdam Treaty demands that an unthinkable number of new tasks be transferred to the Commission, from the international criminal networks in Naples to tracking down illegal immigrants in the suburban areas of France. Do we not think, by any chance, that things are already going badly enough?</p>

We do not support the Schengen rules and their incorporation into the Union framework, which will deprive Member States of their right to take direct decisions on several justice and home affairs issues, such as those involving visas and asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation in the fight against crime is necessary. This should primarily take place between the national police authorities and Interpol, and not by building up a competing European police organisation, Europol.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason why cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs has not progressed more quickly probably lies in the fact that these issues are national ones and should therefore be decided at national level. However, cooperation in distributing flows of refugees in the event of crises is desirable.</p>
<p class="contents">Schengen is supposed to be about the free movement of persons. However, only a few articles deal with freedom of movement, while most of the Schengen rules are concerned with border and security controls. The register of persons which is being built up around Schengen is unacceptable, and violates personal integrity. Schengen could also lead to a less generous refugee and asylum policy. The whole Schengen system must be revised. Schengen could also have an adverse effect on the Nordic Passport Union, and we have therefore voted against the report.</p>
