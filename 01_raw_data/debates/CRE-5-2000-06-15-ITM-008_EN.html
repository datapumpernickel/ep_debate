<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, on 16 March, this Parliament adopted a resolution on the presidential and legislative elections in Peru, in which it expressed its confidence, within the context of cooperation in our relations with Peru, that the presidential and legislative elections would be held in a fair and transparent manner, in accordance with the universally held principles of democratic systems. Parliament called for the consolidation and the deepening of the rule of law in Peru and for democratic maturity from the Peruvian institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">After the irregularities in the first round which took place in April, Parliament decided to send a delegation of observers from this House to the vote on 28 May. Since the deficiencies and irregularities noted by different independent organisations, both Peruvian and international, had not been put right, and after the withdrawal of Mr Toledo, one of the two candidates for the Presidency of the Republic, the delegation from the European Parliament decided not to carry out its mission in those circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency of the European Union, in its declaration of 9 June this year, expressed its enormous concern at the irregularities and anomalies detected. Despite the fluid relations which the European Union maintains with Peru, which are embodied in the cooperation agreement with the Andean Pact which has been in force since 1998, we should remember once again that these very relations are based on the universally recognised principles of respect for pluralist democracy, the rule of law and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of these principles, the European Union must carefully assess the necessary response to this delicate situation resulting from the elections of 28 May. The Council of Ministers of the European Union, in its declaration of 9 June, has decided not to adopt sanctions against Peru at the moment. The meeting of chancellors of the Organisation of American States in Ottawa, having heard the report of the electoral mission headed by Eduardo Stein, has decided to send a new mission, which will include the Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Secretary-General of the Organisation of American States, in order to ensure that the Government of Peru is adopting the necessary measures to re-establish democratic legality. The OAS has not adopted sanctions against Peru at the moment either.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the candidate, Mr Toledo, during his visit to various countries of the European Union and to the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (incidentally, it would have been desirable for him to have met with Members of this Parliament during his visit to Brussels), expressed on several occasions the importance of preserving and maintaining economic cooperation and aid from the European Union to the Peruvian people.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, and before making any decisions – and this is one of the key points of our resolution –, we should, Commissioner, send a high level European Union mission which could, after meeting with all the political forces and with representatives of civil society, make an assessment of the situation on the ground in the light of the democratic clause, which is an essential element of the agreement between the European Union and Peru.</p>
<p class="contents">This mission seems to me to be particularly appropriate since the European Union is the main provider of development aid and economic cooperation, and it is also the main investor in Peru.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, since you have asked us not to take up the time allotted, and in summary, I will say that one of the main contributions which the European Union could make in this difficult situation – and I believe there is good reason, as I have just pointed out, not to leave the matter exclusively in the hands of the Organisation of American States – should be, in my opinion, to promote, on the basis of a guarantee of the full exercise of all civil and political rights, a consensus amongst all the forces which would allow democracy to be recovered, strengthened and deepened in Peru. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lipietz (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – (<span class="italic">FR</span>) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Greens wanted the joint resolution of this House to specifically consider the illegality of the election of Mr Fujimori as President of Peru and to ask that fresh elections be organised.</p>
<p class="contents">The joint resolution which will be proposed to you and to which the Greens have not put their names, merely highlights the irregularities and concludes that these challenge the legitimacy of this election. We are therefore dealing with a far weaker declaration than the one we wanted.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we deplore such a cautious choice of words. Let me remind you that the conditions of this election, at least in the second round, were so disastrous that not only did the main opposition candidate withdraw, but so did all the international observers. In these circumstances, it could be concluded, even before the election, that the election was not valid. After the election, obviously, Mr Fujimori’s government could argue that since their candidate Fujimori had obtained more than 51%, it had to be concluded that even in the absence of any opposition, the vote was valid.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, the vote count in many regions showed an excess of theoretical votes in relation to the first round, which is completely impossible given that there were no longer any opposition candidates. The excess vote was around 20% in some places. So not only was there no opposition, but it was even necessary to resort to fraud in order to obtain the figure of 51%. These observations should lead the European Parliament to proclaim the illegality of the election of Mr Fujimori and call for more elections, rather than being content with merely questioning its legitimacy.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike the case of Paraguay, we are not going to see this as a reason for voting against the resolution. We are prepared to put our names to the joint resolution of the other groups, provided, however, that two points are introduced. We agree with what Mr Salafranca said about making European Union aid conditional on sending a European Parliament delegation on current human rights to Peru. </p>
<p class="contents">However, we think this insufficient as, at this very moment, since the election in fact, military demonstrations and intimidation are being used against those members of the population who show their fury at this election, which is invalid in their eyes. We therefore ask that a tiny amendment be added, condemning the use of intimidation against the Peruvian population. This condemnation is not accompanied by any particular threat, and with regard to the conditionality of European Union aid, we gladly support the wording put forward by Mr Salafranca.</p>
<p class="contents">The second amendment we are proposing, on the other hand, is a sort of catching-up on the matter of legality. You know that the Organisation of American States goes further than the European Parliament’s joint proposal apparently does, as this organisation is actually volunteering to suggest a democratic way out of the political crisis which Peru is stuck in over this matter. We are simply suggesting that the Parliament should approve the current efforts of the Organisation of American States to find a legal, peaceful way out of the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the two amendments that would enable us simply to support the joint motion for a resolution.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, from our point of view, as well as lamenting the situation and supporting the democratic forces, it is still absolutely essential that, as we did in the previous case of Paraguay, we remind Peru of the need for any relations with the European Union to be maintained in compliance with the democratic clause.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, only by sending observers will we be able to assess the true situation and find a way to act appropriately.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, since two recent days, 9 April and 28 May, have caused us great concern, it is clear that we will only be able to act appropriately if we send observers, which we hope will be possible, and who we hope will be able to act effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Fujimori’s failure to take account of the condemnations of the OAS, and the warning of the European Union and other international bodies in relation to these elections, condemns that country to a form of isolation which will be to the detriment of the Peruvian people and will increase social and political tension. For this reason, the European Union must firmly denounce these proceedings and, having recognised the extent to which democracy has deteriorated, promote a series of measures which will help to overcome the current situation and lead to the repetition of the elections with full safeguards in place.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the best way to help Peru and, therefore, the European Union must make an effort so that its influence in Latin America may counteract so many years of anomalies and suffering and favour harmonious economic development, democracy and the consolidation of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation in Peru, like the situation in Paraguay, gives cause for concern. Nevertheless, I must say that what we have witnessed in Peru is nothing new. The President of Peru has for years been failing to play by the rules that we expect in a democracy. So I would not just send a delegation of observers to Peru, but I would also recommend that the European Union, the Council and also this Parliament should pay more attention to the whole region. We need more than just a resolution every now and again, we need to be constantly alert and critical, so that the people who are working for democracy are aware of our support.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would like to point out that is not just the OAS, important as it is for Latin America, that has supported democracy in Latin America. The European Union and this Parliament have in fact also played a key role here. We have spent a great deal of money in this region and it would be gratifying if now and again people talked about the European Union’s contribution in Latin America, and not just about North America’s role. This is not intended to be a chauvinistic remark, I am just making it so that justice is done towards us. I hope that the European Parliament’s views on Peru will not go unheard in that country. I know that a great many people set a lot of store by what this Parliament says.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would also like to mention that the longest standing relationship between the European Parliament and another parliament is with the Latin American Parliament – to which Peru also belongs – and that involves certain obligations. I accordingly hope that we will obtain a large majority in favour of this resolution.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

President Fujimori took power with dangerous plans: to give absolute priority to supposed economic efficiency, claiming that a strong hold on power was required to manage it, and to overcome what he called ‘party-ocracy’, subliminally blaming all the previous problems on the institutions of the democratic state.</p>
<p class="contents">Our fears were confirmed throughout Fujimori’s terms in office, and clear signs of authoritarianism were observed, which saw outrageous propaganda and systematic manipulation of the media. Furthermore, the President’s disregard for the rule of law became evident.</p>
<p class="contents">It was under those circumstances that the elections of April and May were held and, as we feared, they turned out to be a farce, and were recognised and denounced as such by anyone looking on.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, that is what our resolution says, and it is good and appropriate that the European Parliament’s voice should be heard in this respect, for our own dignity, and in order to demonstrate our interest in the democratic process in Latin America, but also in order to demonstrate our support, which the Peruvian democrats need and deserve.</p>
<p class="contents">While we are voting in favour of the resolution in question, I would like to point out two issues relating to its text.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, not just the mere fact that one of the candidates decided not to stand in the second round of the elections, but rather that that candidate was Alejandro Toledo, who is supported by all the opposition, and who in free elections would stand an extremely good chance of toppling Fujimori.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that I regret the fact that the resolution does not refer to the disappointing role played by the Organisation of American States throughout this process. In fact, having denounced the irregularities of the campaign, demanded the postponement of the second round and withdrawn its observers, it does not seem consistent that it should remain silent with no further reaction or sanctions, contenting itself in reality with merely condemning the situation. By taking this attitude, I believe that the OAS has discredited itself considerably.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by expressing our solidarity with Alejandro Toledo, with the democrats and people of Peru, denouncing Fujimori as a sinister and autocratic personality, rejecting the position of those people who have reacted with silence and even at times with a certain complacency – which has been well publicised by the President to justify his tattered legitimacy – and reaffirming our commitment to rejecting this farce and to closely monitoring the events in Peru for the sake of the respect for democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In view of the numerous irregularities and technical problems, and the adherence to the date for the second ballot, the European Union decided to recall its observers from Peru. As has already been mentioned, a similar decision was taken by the Organisation of American States. In taking this step, the EU wished to express its conviction that the Peruvian election could not have the democratic legitimacy that it would have had in normal circumstances, and which this country urgently needed. We must not simply express our regret about this step, we also need to consider what we can do to strengthen Peru’s democratic institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that it needs to be made clear to Peru, and as forcefully as possible, that we insist on strict observance of the principles of democracy and of the rule of law, and that this applies all the more so at a time and in circumstances when the democratic systems of other countries in the region are also being weakened. For example, we were discussing Paraguay just a few minutes ago.</p>
<p class="contents">In its statement of 9 June, the European Union stressed that it would support the OAS mission to Peru. We expect this mission to express its findings in the clearest terms and to come up with unequivocal results.</p>
<p class="contents">We will be following the situation in Peru with the greatest vigilance and are prepared to rethink our relations with Peru against this background. At the same time, the Commission attaches great importance to taking concrete measures to reinforce Peru’s democratic institutions and to promote political pluralism in that country, and will make proposals to that effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
