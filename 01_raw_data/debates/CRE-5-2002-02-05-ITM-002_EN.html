It made the work considerably easier. I also wish to thank my colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of the EIB has been of topical interest in the debate in recent years, and criticisms have been made. These have mainly been targeted at deficiencies when it comes to environmental issues, openness and transparency. The EIB has understood the criticism, and significant changes have taken place. For this, you, Mr Maystadt, and your colleagues deserve our recognition.</p>
<p class="contents">The analysis for the year is in many respects a follow-up to the sterling work carried out a year ago by Mr Lipietz. A number of the views put forward at that time are being repeated now. As is well known, the most important issue for the EU is enlargement. This involves a fundamental change constituting a major challenge both for the candidate countries and the current Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, most EIB loans go to different types of regional development project within the EU. That is certainly fully compatible with Statutes of the EIB, but future enlargement makes it necessary to reconsider this distribution of resources. There must be an increase in the future Member States’ share of the total loans.</p>
<p class="contents">Solidarity on the part of the EU must also, of course, extend to include third countries that until now have been recipients of EIB loans. Among these are the Balkan countries, the Mediterranean countries and the ACP countries. Now it is also Russia’s turn. There is also a need for discussion concerning which less developed countries the EIB is mandated by the Council to support and concerning whether, for example, the 49 least developed countries are not in fact in greater need than the ACP countries traditionally supported by the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In the information society, economic growth and an improved standard of living are not only the results of constructing new roads and factories, but also of education, innovation, new technology, e-commerce and the development of other knowledge-intensive sectors. In my view, this has to be reflected to a greater extent in the EIB’s activities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the EIB should continue to strengthen its support for small and medium-sized enterprises. There are clear opportunities for growth in this area. The EIB needs to become more active in making SMEs more aware of the possibilities that already exist for granting such loans.</p>
<p class="contents">From having been a rather closed institution, the EIB has begun to change its attitude to information and transparency. Contact with democratically elected representatives at local and regional levels is important. There is a knowledge of the projects at local level. Contact with non-governmental organisations has improved, and the bank’s web site has also improved. The EIB has published a list of projects at the assessment stage. In my opinion, it would be good if all the public documents from the internal evaluation unit were published on the Net.</p>
<p class="contents">As matters stand, the EIB is supervised by its Board of Governors, that is to say by the 15 Finance Ministers, but it lacks prudential supervision by a competent authority. The committee has discussed the possibility of letting the European Central Bank, or ECB, exercise supervision over the EIB because the EC Treaty provides for the Council to give the ECB specific tasks of prudential supervision. If the Council does not want to give the ECB this remit, the issue should be clarified at the next Intergovernmental Conference, with the objective of establishing proper prudential supervision of the EIB’s activities.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to improve the way in which the Bank fulfils its obligation to render accounts, the committee proposes that the external Auditors’ Committee forward its findings to the European Parliament, as well as to the EIB’s Board of Governors. Mention might be made of the fact that the EIB has already shown a willingness to cooperate more closely with OLAF.</p>
<p class="contents">The environment is the issue which the NGOs are most interested in. These issues received much attention in the Lipietz report last year. I believe that the EIB has become more aware of environmental issues and that the Bank’s support for environmental projects has increased considerably.</p>
<p class="contents">Another key factor is the EIB’s environmental assessment capacity. At present, the EIB has only one person responsible for coordinating environmental issues, while the project teams are composed of engineers and economists who have received additional environmental training. In my opinion, more staff are required in this area. More trained environmental experts should be appointed or contracted to review the environmental impact assessments correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, therefore, many demands upon the European Investment Bank. If all of these needs are to be met, it is necessary to increase the capital of the Bank. In line with what applies to commercial banks able to handle greater risks, the Member States should, for example, consider reviewing the ratio of capital borrowed by the Bank to capital of its own, with the purpose of including the EIB’s reserves.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should like to welcome the Commissioner to the House.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to comment on the amendments that have come in. I am able to support Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4 and 6 from Mr Lipietz etc. They do not change the content of the report but highlight the environmental issues and the issues concerning openness and transparency. I cannot, however, support Amendment No 2, which I find unnecessarily far-reaching. I am only able to support Amendment No 5 as a supplement to Paragraph 30. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It sheds light upon the important areas of Europe’s future development, which the EIB has a major responsibility for promoting within the framework of its powers. The report also addresses the demands Parliament should make upon the EIB as Europe’s financing institution. I therefore want to confine myself to highlighting a few more of those aspects I consider to be most significant. I am thinking of the candidate countries, the way in which projects are prioritised, small and medium-sized enterprises and supervision of the EIB.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the candidate countries are concerned, it is extremely important that there should be a significant increase in their share of the total loans of EUR 36 billion. In 2000, they had access to EUR 2.9 billion. In view of the forthcoming enlargement of the European family, there must be an increase if it is to be possible to achieve the objective set at the Lisbon Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to prioritising projects, it is important to safeguard Europe’s competitiveness and therefore prioritise infrastructure in the broad sense of the word. That applies, then, to communication not only in the traditional sense of roads, connecting links and the availability of energy-efficient transport systems for goods and people, but also in the sense of telecommunications, IT, e-commerce, education, increased knowledge and support for new technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Small and medium-sized enterprises at present account for more than 60 per cent of EU jobs. In an enlarged EU, they will probably account for a significantly higher percentage. Of the 18 million companies in the EU, 99% are small and medium-sized enterprises employing 66% of the workforce. More than 90% of these companies have fewer than ten employees. If, like many new companies, the existing small and medium-sized enterprises are to be given the opportunity to grow and become larger, or simply become large companies, more must be done in terms of supplying information, contributing to projects and providing access to venture capital.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has proposed that the Commission be called upon to give the ECB powers to exercise supervision over the EIB. I agree with that. The Bank has no national connection and cannot therefore be compared with a private commercial bank. The ECB is therefore a suitable supervisory body until such time as a possible European finance inspectorate is established.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the objective set by the Lisbon Summit, priority must be given to those projects which lead to economic growth, development and increased employment in an enlarged Europe and which attach major importance to small and medium-sized enterprises’ opportunities for growth. Competitiveness and staying power should be the guiding principles here.</p>
<p class="contents">Greater demands must be made upon the EIB in terms of providing information and evaluating projects and the importance of proper professional supervision and auditing must be emphasised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van den Burg (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, first of all, I should like to extend a warm welcome to the President of the European Investment Bank, Mr Maystadt. In February last year, I expressed the hope of turning the discussion of the annual report in this Parliament into an annual tradition, and this is what we are honouring now. It has taken a while before the report could be included on the agenda – indeed, it was already completed in November – but it is good to uphold this tradition.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I understand that, this coming Thursday, you also intend to present the plans for the future and the 2001 annual report to the press and the Council. Last year, we met immediately after this presentation, whereas this year, our meeting immediately precedes it, and I hope that you will be able to lift the veil and give us some information about these plans for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I deal with the content, I should also like to thank Mr Schmidt for his report and for the sound cooperation during the handling of the amendments tabled by us and other groups. In my opinion, it has been a productive group effort.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to turn to a number of points which were also raised in our annual report last year, and note with satisfaction that you have indeed devoted attention to these in your further plans, and that Parliament’s areas of concern indeed recur in the Corporate Operational Plan which you presented this year. I should like to comment on a few of these areas of concern. I will skim over other points, because these have already been dealt with by others. I trust that the environment will be dealt with adequately by the Greens and others. Needless to say, we support this, as well as the tabled amendments, although, like Mr Schmidt, we are loathe to replace Paragraph 30 which concerns the balance between the environment and other objectives. In other words, we do want to maintain this balance and only accept the amendment in question as a supplement. Transparency and evaluations have also already been commented on, and the subject of SMEs has already been raised by Mrs Grönfeldt.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, however, like to touch upon the matter of supervision. Last year, this was the subject of an extensive debate here, and you noticed that we made it very clear this year in the report that it is desirable for the European Central Bank to play a role in this supervision. You have probably seen the Financial Times of 29 January and ascertained that this is now also very much being considered in ECB circles. This was evidently raised during a lunch meeting with the Chairman of the FSA, the British financial authority, and I remember that we, too, raised the point during a lunchtime meeting with Mr Duisenberg and his colleagues in the past. It is my impression that, although the Bank is amenable to the idea, it is quite reticent because it is not equipped for this at the moment. I would call for a somewhat broader discussion to be held about this financial supervision in this Parliament, but also in the Council and in the Commission, for I have the impression that this topic is being dealt with in different reports in a very fragmented manner. It is important to sketch the broad outlines in this matter too. Perhaps we could do this in a more coherent discussion some time in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the EIB is concerned, it is not so much about supervision of the latter’s conduct. A number of arrangements have been made on this score and this supervision is also being exercised in a number of areas. It is mainly about the economic supervision of companies. The advantage of that could be that, by means of the financial resources available within the Bank, and also with the available reserves, more could be done and more risk-bearing action could be taken than is currently the case, provided that sound supervision is in place.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to another topic which, with a view to the future, will become an important point of discussion, namely that of increasing the Bank’s capital. I assume that the supervisors, the Ministers for Economic and Financial Affairs, will be talking about this during the forthcoming meeting in June. You have seen that, in Paragraph 33, we declare our support for such a capital increase. This matter should be brought to a conclusion from 2003, and should particularly play a role in enlargement. The point of departure in this is – this is actually a comment I should like to make – that it should add value to EIB loans. The EIB should not do what is also possible within the market, and I believe that it is important that it act in a transparent manner. Unfortunately, I am unable to make any of my other comments, but I shall do so in due course. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My colleague, Olle Schmidt, the rapporteur, has already expressed the opinion of the Committee on Economic Affairs on the annual report of the EIB and has presented proposals which, according to our committee, would improve its operation and also meet the need to provide it with greater resources to fulfil its commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw your attention to a very specific and topical point. In Laeken it was agreed that the EIB would carry out a study to create a financial instrument or institution which would guarantee that, in terms of the cooperation between the European Union and the third countries of the Mediterranean, the level of use of resources responds to the effectiveness and possibilities for development cooperation that the situation demands.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that in the Mediterranean, in the medium term, very serious conflicts may arise with the European Union itself, and that in order to ensure our own peace and stability in the future it is necessary to strengthen this cooperation and ensure better application of resources which, according to the experience of the first MEDA programme, has only been 30%. Therefore, this initiative agreed at Laeken, of presenting a proposal or alternatives to increase the level of application, seems to us absolutely essential and urgent.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, if this could be consolidated at the next meeting of the Special Council of Barcelona, we believe that it would be even more appropriate, because the whole issue of development cooperation with the Mediterranean was born in 1995 in Barcelona, under the Spanish Presidency. The current Presidency of the Council has also considered the issue of cooperation with the Mediterranean to be an urgent priority and we decisively support this initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it necessary for the European Parliament to express an opinion about the EIB’s activities because the EIB is not only a Bank but also an EU institution that finances large projects and uses Community funds to steer development.</p>
<p class="contents">The EIB has been criticised for neglecting environmental issues, as well as the issues of openness and transparency. Mr Schmidt also mentioned that positive changes to the EIB’s policy have taken place recently in response to the criticism. I hope that the EIB will continue in the same spirit.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report that addresses important issues. It proposes, for example, that loans to the candidate countries should be increased and that evaluations should be made more easily accessible to the general public. A further proposal is that dialogue between the two sides of industry, politicians and non-governmental organisations etc. should be strengthened as aspects of openness and transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">The report could, however, have been more vigorous when it comes to environmental issues. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has tabled six amendments that specifically address environmental issues and matters of transparency. A prerequisite for expressing our support for an increase in the EIB’s capital should be that the projects lead to sustainable development. Performance indicators must also be established so that the EIB’s activities can be measured and evaluated properly.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that the rapporteur expressed his support for most of our amendments. In accordance with Mr Schmidt’s wishes, I also accept Amendment No 5 as a supplement to Paragraph 30.</p>
<p class="contents">It would, however, be unfortunate if Amendment No 2 were not to be adopted. If civil society is to be able to keep track of an issue, the documents must obviously be available in the national language. I call upon MEPs to vote in favour of this amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With loans amounting to EUR 36 billion granted in the year 2000 and total capital of EUR 100 billion, it exercises significant influence through its policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of its influence, there has been very little discussion of the Bank. This is the second year that we are discussing the annual report in Parliament. What is perhaps most remarkable of all, however, is how little all this is discussed by the Bank’s owners, in the Member States and in the parliaments of the various Member States which, I believe, are in many cases quite unaware of the Bank’s activities.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation may be compared with that in relation to the World Bank, which has been exposed to extensive examination and debate, or with that regarding the European Development Bank which has also been examined in a different way to the European Investment Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">A good deal of criticism has been directed against the EIB’s activities and in two areas in particular. First of all, the EIB has been criticised for having supported a series of projects that have increased environmental problems, as well as for shortcomings in terms of environmental impact assessments. Secondly, the EIB has been criticised for a lack of openness and of willingness to engage in dialogue with, for example, environmental movements in different countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this criticism has been justified. Comparisons show, for example, that the World Bank is in actual fact significantly better than the European Investment Bank at providing environmental impact assessments and at publicising these. It is rare for the Left to have occasion to praise the World Bank, but it does in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">For some years now, the European Investment Bank has shown a new attitude to greater openness, which is very welcome. What is important, however, is that this new positive attitude also be followed up by practical measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schmidt’s report addresses certain demands for measures with which I agree, referring, for example, to the need for more resources, including more staff working on environmental issues and the question of greater openness. There is a need to go further, however. I believe, for example, that it is reasonable to demand that, if environmental impact assessments are carried out, they should always be published before decisions are taken. The EU’s demand for environmental impact assessments must also be fulfilled when loans are granted to projects outside the European Union, and these assessments must be available in translation in the national languages of the countries to which the loans are granted.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Investment Bank should also comply with the Århus Convention, entailing an obligation of great openness towards the environmental movement. This should mean a big improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">The EIB should also have a more evolved policy when it comes to development issues, for example, development in the Developing World as the Bank’s activities there increase.</p>
<p class="contents">The Gothenburg Summit gave the EIB the task of supporting sustainable development and concentrating on climate issues. This should have far-reaching consequences for the type of transport and energy projects that can be supported. It should imply, hopefully in practice too, a change of focus for the Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that increasing the Bank’s capital must be conditional upon reforms being carried out. Only if the Bank is obliged to implement such reforms should it be agreed to increase the capital.</p>
<p class="contents">I am opposed to the idea of allowing the European Central Bank to act as a supervisory authority. The European Central Bank is a genuinely undemocratic institution which should not be given tasks of this kind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

SMEs ensure growth and employment in Europe. It is therefore right, and indeed important in terms of Europe's development, that the EIB should step up its support for SMEs or carry on with it. Half of the total lent, about EUR 5.7 billion, was used for that purpose in 2000. This amount should be increased or its continued availability ensured. We must not stop the support measures. It is also important that more risk capital should be made available to these enterprises, and this is something which I personally strongly support.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that the points of criticism made in the report must be taken seriously. It is not acceptable for the EIB's own home page to list its activities in only two or three languages. By so doing, the EIB is limiting its own significance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Support for SMEs and for entrepreneurship as sources of employment is becoming more important, as external finance other than through banks is becoming more expensive and bank finance for small and medium-sized enterprises is becoming more and more problematic. When we consider what the European Investment Bank has achieved since 1968, in terms both of funds and of initial support for projects, I consider the outcome to be an impressive one.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that the integration of the EIF and the EIB under one roof, which was pushed through by the Lisbon Process, has resulted in an optimisation of the European Investment Bank's activities right across the board. I would therefore ask those who now want to push for the founding of another bank, to rely on, and make use of, the competence and qualified expert staff that the European Investment Bank has at its disposal. It is for that reason that I oppose the founding of another bank. It would surely also be in the interests of the Central and Eastern European States for the work of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and that of the European Investment Bank to be more efficiently harmonised and coordinated with each other. I am therefore sure that both the European Investment Bank's quality and its financial activity will be improved still further, or advanced, at the European Summit in Madrid, due, among other things, to the European Commission's consolidated report.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been pointed out by my fellow Members and also in Mr Schmidt's report, one must surely see to it that the best possible use is made of funds for small and medium-sized enterprises. It will, without doubt, be a matter for our concern that there may be a decreasing number of small and medium-sized banks and financial institutions available with which the European Investment Bank can manage the flow of its funds. So it is, of course, very encouraging that the European Investment Bank has a network of 130 active intermediaries and that activity in Italy has now resumed to an encouraging extent. We should bear in mind, though, that what matters, above all, is that small and medium-sized enterprises should really be enabled to get access to working capital and also risk-capital financing at their local level.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore important, Mr Maystadt, that an assessment should be submitted of what influence this activity by the European Investment Bank has actually had on growth and employment at local and regional level. Regional development is, after all, one of its main fields of activity. We know that the whole European Union benefits if economic and social cohesion can be realised at regional level. So this assessment must be carried out, as should in future be done, before the Spring Summits, so that even better use may be made of the European Investment Bank's instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">One final plea, Mr President. All the institutions are committed to the need for gender mainstreaming. I have noted that progress has been made in appointments to the European Investment Bank. There is so far, unfortunately, only one woman on its board, and so the Member States are urged to give women, too, the facilities and opportunities to play their part in the Investment Bank's work. I also note that, at its highest level of management, only one of the twelve officials is a woman. There must be changes here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I would like to thank Parliament for taking the initiative of holding a debate on the annual activities of the European Investment Bank. You know, and some of you have highlighted, the important role the Bank plays in the channelling of savings towards investment in key sectors of the European Union as well as sectors outside it.</p>
<p class="contents">You have highlighted the Bank’s fundamental objective of contributing to our aims in close cooperation with the Commission. The Bank has already implemented the Lisbon initiatives. Initiative 2000 is fully operational and continues to increase its actions in the funding of small and medium-sized businesses. President Maystadt will make some subsequent comments, but I would like to congratulate the Bank on the good work it is doing in this particular sector and, above all, on the transformation which has taken place as a result of paying greater attention to risk capital. In this respect, the European Investment Fund is turning risk capital into an important Community institution as a complement to the market forces which govern supply and demand.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you have suggested that the Bank should pay greater attention to environmental factors. I believe that we must be aware that each institution has its own function and the function of the Bank is basically financial. Environmental issues are fundamental, of course, but each institution must play its corresponding role.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two further comments. The first relates to the extension of the Bank to other areas. I believe that this issue is mentioned in the seventh point of the report. Nevertheless, we must not forget the extension of the Bank’s actions over recent years. We only need to remember that, in 2000, Croatia was included in the CCEE contribution and the special option for the Customs Union with Turkey, and that in November 2001 the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was included.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you have expressed your concern with regard to the careful monitoring of the Bank’s activities. It is true that the statutes of the European Central Bank open up this possibility, but it is also true that it has no authority whatsoever. Even if it had it, we would have to raise the question of whether the idea of monitoring the European Investment Bank is consistent.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Investment Bank is not a commercial bank. It is a multilateral bank which belongs to the Member States and has been established as a Community institution by the Treaty. Therefore, in my opinion, it is doubtful whether it is correct to have additional monitoring of one Community institution by another Community institution. Above all, bearing in mind that we now have a clear system for controlling the Bank by means of the auditing that is being carried out, which directly informs the Council and the government and is attended by external auditors. Furthermore, you also know that the Court of Auditors already carries out inspections of its activities when they involve European Union funding. Therefore, I believe that this issue warrants more profound analysis. We do not believe that we should create other monitoring posts or institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the issue of Barcelona and the possibility of funding cooperation with the Mediterranean, raised by Mr Gasòliba, President Maystadt will comment on the actions of the European Investment Bank. I will simply say that the Commission is working on the Laeken mandate in order to have a report as soon as possible. We would all have liked it to have been finished for Barcelona, but, naturally, we will have to follow the normal procedures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although the European Investment Bank has no formal obligation to report to the European Parliament, I think that it is natural, in a democracy, for all public institutions, including the financial institutions, to have to respond to questions and to take into account the priorities expressed by the representatives elected by the citizens. It is therefore a great pleasure for me to attempt to answer the questions that have been raised, bearing in mind that five minutes does not, of course, give me enough time to provide a detailed answer. We will, however, have the opportunity to continue the dialogue, particularly within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, under the dynamic chairmanship of Mrs Randzio-Plath and on the basis of the excellent report by Mr Olle Schmidt.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I would simply like to give some details in response to the four categories of questions raised. The first category contains questions on the activities of the EIB; the second relates to questions on supervision; the third category regards questions on the policy regarding information and transparency and, as for the fourth and final category, I will speak briefly about equal opportunities, an area that is particularly close to Mrs Randzio-Plath’s heart. First of all, as far as the EIB’s activities are concerned, Mrs Randzio-Plath quite rightly pointed out that regional development was still the main task of the European Investment Bank. In conjunction with Commissioner Barnier’s services, we developed a set of indicators and we are attempting to assess, in a more systematic manner, the impact of projects that we finance on regional development. The growing importance of the EIB’s activities in the candidate countries has also been mentioned and Mr Schmidt quite rightly emphasised this point. Enlargement is a huge challenge for us all, for those who are already in the European Union and for those who are about to join it. Clearly, the European Investment Bank must step up its work in these countries to assist them in fulfilling the conditions of membership as quickly as possible. Currently, the EIB already has a portfolio in excess of EUR 16 billion, so far mainly for infrastructures – such as transport, communication and energy infrastructures – but also for the environment and these funds are increasingly being granted directly to promoting the private sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The environment is another area on which the rapporteur and other speakers have focused in particular, and I think that it must be approached from two angles. The first angle is that of the number of environmental projects that we finance; these are projects which play a direct part in protecting or improving the environment. I can now give you – before anyone else hears them – the figures that I will be publishing next Thursday. Last year, we granted EUR 6 billion to environmental projects in the form of individual loans and EUR 2 billion through what we call global loans, in other words, loans to intermediaries, which themselves provide loans to local authorities. This therefore amounted to EUR 6 billion for environmental projects in the European Union and EUR 0.5 billion in candidate countries, which means that, currently, approximately one fifth of our loans go directly towards improving the environment. We hope to gradually bring this figure up to a quarter of the total volume of our loans.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the first angle, but there is obviously a second angle – and your Committee has quite rightly paid this a great deal of attention – which is that the other projects, those that are not directly aimed at improving the environment, must also take into account the impact they have on the environment. We must therefore put in place the resources to enable us to assess more systematically the environmental impact of these projects. This is the reason why, following a suggestion made in last year’s report by Mr Lipietz, we carried out internal restructuring and set up an environmental group within the project department, whose specific task is to ensure that proper account is taken of environmental aspects when assessing such projects. And we, of course, intend to further improve our resources dedicated to this task.</p>
<p class="contents">To continue on the subject of the EIB’s activities, we must mention the Mediterranean. Without going into too much detail, I would simply like to say that we have taken note of the objectives announced by the Spanish Presidency and that the EIB is at the Council and Commission’s disposal, if it is felt, given the extent of our activities in the Mediterranean, that the EIB can help to achieve these objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I note the concern expressed by several of you, particularly Mr Schmidt and Mrs Randzio-Plath, regarding the support given to small- and medium-sized businesses. We are continuing to provide this support, not only through global loans but also through the European Investment Fund, which last year gave risk capital of EUR 800 million to small- and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to supervision, we should bear in mind, as Commissioner Solbes stressed, that the EIB is already supervised in various ways. I would simply say that we are working to apply the prudential banking rules. If it were considered advantageous to organise additional supervision by a body that is specialised in banking supervision, the EIB would, of course, have no objection. We would welcome an external authority specialised in banking supervision checking that we are correctly applying the prudential rules.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the policy regarding information and transparency; first, we now publish all our strategy documents; second, we publish an overview of our assessment methods; third, we publish, with a few exceptions, the list of all the projects currently being examined so that the public can respond and submit its comments; last, we now publish all the full assessment reports carried out by the independent ex-post evaluation department, which was set up a few years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to end by briefly touching upon the subject of equal opportunities. Mrs Randzio-Plath has, on several occasions, drawn our attention to an undeniable imbalance within the Bank’s higher management. There is still only one woman on the Management Committee. I regret this, but it depends on Member States. As far as the management itself is concerned, we decided last year to appoint four women to senior management level, which will therefore begin to correct this imbalance.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, Mr President, we are determined to ensure that the EIB remains an institution that serves the European Union, something which requires, by necessity, greater cooperation with the Commission and strengthening dialogue with Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
