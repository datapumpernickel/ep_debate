<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Luis Francisco Herrero-Tejedor (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are going to vote on in a few minutes time covers, or attempts to cover, two fundamental objectives: firstly, to evaluate the application of the European institutions’ information and communications strategy, in other words, to look back and see what we have not done properly; and secondly, to propose certain effective ideas that contribute to making the information and communication policy better, in other words, to look ahead and see how we can improve that policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank all the political groups, in particular the shadow rapporteurs — María Badía, Giulietto Chiesa, Helga Trüpel and Manuel Portas — for the efforts they have made to enrich the report, something they have undoubtedly achieved, and to reach a broad agreement that allows us to vote on a text which hinges on five basic agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">We basically agree that we have to ensure that information reaches every citizen, that they receive it via the most modern instruments, that is to say, television, radio, the Internet and the new technologies. It is not sufficient for us to prepare responses aimed at a few citizens who are already aware of being European and who already know what they need to ask. We must ensure that awareness of Europe, of what it means to be European, reaches everybody, and that sooner or later, everybody feels the need to ask what the European Union can do for each of them.</p>
<p class="contents">We basically agree that, in order to do this, we must ensure that the messages of the European institutions reach the right audiences. We must ensure that these messages awaken the interest of the citizens, each and every one of them, according to their respective concerns, because it makes no sense to spend a lot of money providing generalised information that is ultimately of hardly any use to anybody.</p>
<p class="contents">Every household must receive the message that is relevant to that particular household. And to that end, information must be decentralised, it must be channelled by means of local and regional media, with the help of good professionals, genuine professionals who are able to give the media the kind of assistance they really need.</p>
<p class="contents">We basically agree that the citizens’ legitimate aspirations to participate actively in the development of the European Union will only be met if we are able to touch the emotions of the citizens. The European Union is no longer an ordinary international organisation with purely financial aims. It is a community of values. Those values are the very soul of the European Union. We must make it visible and we must make it attractive.</p>
<p class="contents">We basically agree that we can do little from here without the cooperation of the Member States and the national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">And we basically agree that it would be a mistake not to ensure that interinstitutional cooperation functions properly.</p>
<p class="contents">This final point, that of cooperation amongst the different European institutions, has so far led to a very fluid dialogue during the production of this report, an unusually fluid dialogue, I would say, with the European Commission, and we all want this to continue. But it is not enough to want it. Desires are not enough. Only facts matter.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fact that, through this report, the European Parliament has tried to bring itself into line with the Commission as far as possible. And the Commission now has two options: either to incorporate Parliament’s contributions into the new communication about to be issued, or to do without them. If you chose the first option, we will move forward; if you chose the second, we will take an enormous step backwards. The ball is in your court, therefore, Mrs Wallström, but since I am sure that you want to do the right thing, and since I can testify to your willingness to hold dialogue and to reach agreement, I am also sure that you will be able to take this opportunity for the Parliament and Commission to work together in this fascinating task of communicating Europe. Amen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Margot Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-president of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> I am very pleased to address today, in this House, the vital topic of communicating Europe to our citizens. Mr Herrero-Tejedor has done an excellent job in tabling a report that poses the right questions and suggests important answers.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the rapporteur’s suggestion that this plenary should have a debate on communication at least once a year. The support of Europeans for the European project hinges on our communication efforts. We have all known for years – and the ongoing public debates on the ratification of our Constitution show this clearly enough – that despite our common efforts to communicate, Europe’s citizens still say that do not know enough about, or are not interested in, the European Union, and do not understand its role and its benefits for them. Less than half voted in last year’s European elections. Apathy and ignorance are enemies of our democratic foundations.</p>
<p class="contents">As our latest Eurobarometer reveals, there is a clear correlation between the level of information and the support for the Constitutional Treaty; 75% of those who know the Constitution well declared they were in favour, while the support of those who have never heard about the Constitution is only 22%. The conclusion is evident: the need to communicate our projects is crucial for the future of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Communicating Europe is a highly complex task because European construction is in itself complex; because the European project is an evolving project and because perceptions of the European project vary and are defined, to a large extent, by national history and circumstances. Moreover, we should never forget that no communication can be better than the policies it wants to communicate. More than ever before, the European Union needs to explain its aims and policies clearly and comprehensively.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Barroso Commission has made communication one of its strategic priorities. The foremost priority of the present Commission is connecting with citizens. However, I should like to add that this is not just the Commission’s responsibility. In fact, it is very much the responsibility of all players: Parliament, the Council and, above all, the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will therefore put forward a White Paper on communication. It will identify options and possible solutions to the challenges that have been outlined and will be the starting point of a long-term process of structural reform and change in communication culture, involving all actors concerned within and outside the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The new approach will follow three strategic principles, which are also taken into account in the draft of the Herrero-Tejedor report that you are debating today. The first involves listening to people and taking their interests and concerns into account; the second, explaining our policies and their impact on people’s daily lives; and the third, connecting with people by communicating more and as closely as possible on topics that are of real interest to citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We have identified five main areas for action. The first is political commitment and ownership. Commissioners will engage as key communicators about all portfolios. They will also get involved in better planning and coordination of communication activities, which will concern all levels. The Commission will better integrate communication into our working culture and into policy formulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second involves professionalising our communications. That includes providing an effective and service-minded spokesperson service, improving research through polling and surveying and evaluating the impact of our communication activities. We must make better use of our tools and provide more and better training.</p>
<p class="contents">The third concerns connecting with and responding to citizens. That involves adapting messages and matching national and local concerns – instead of taking a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach – and conveying them as close to the citizen as possible. As proposed by Mr Herrero-Tejedor, that means using contemporary tools, giving priority to those which are more likely to reach the greatest number of citizens, such as television, radio and the internet; using a language that people understand and a more decentralised implementation; using our representations in the Member States as well as our relays and networks in close cooperation with Parliament and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Our fourth focus is on adapting the means to the objectives. I believe we can all agree that communication is a human-resource- and budget-intensive activity. We will, therefore, need to allocate financial and human resources in a manner corresponding to our goals. Communication will have to be considered as an in-built cost in all activities. All of that will be based on a qualitative and quantitative assessment of communication activities within the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, the fifth point is that we need to work together. We need to work with the Member States and with other actors. A progressive approach, leading to the possibility of forming an over-arching European Union approach to communication based on real coordination and synergies between the institutions, should be established. However, we cannot forget other key actors, such as national and regional governments and parliaments, civil society and the media, focusing particularly on the regional and local media in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The next step will be the White Paper and the results of the broad consultation process we will launch, which will, hopefully, lead to more consistent and efficient communication with Europeans, which is our common responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is what we learn from all Eurostat’s statistics, from our day-to-day experience of the public, from opinion polls at home and, of course, also from what is going on around the directive on the internal market in services and the debate on the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">In no way is it my intention to apportion blame here today, nor do I want to demand anything of anyone. It is for the EU institutions themselves to actually back up with actions what we have been saying in reports for years. At the same time, this is not a task for the institutions, but rather for the members, the Member States, the MEPs, the officials, the Commissioners, and for us ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is that, further to what Commissioner Wallström so rightly said, there are a number of things I would like to demand of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I demand that every Commission proposal should, from the very outset, specify in clear and precise terms what added value for the public the European regulation in question represents.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I demand that the Commission should submit to the Council a communication and information plan as part of the package when it is required to decide on any and every European project.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I demand a plan for the Europe-wide training and in-service training of journalists, to be carried out by the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say, fourthly, that it is the Council, to my mind, that is the principal cause of this public relations disaster. There was in the Convention a three-year debate on the drafting of the new Constitution, and the Council and the Member States slept through it. The Council and the Member States are not discharging their shared responsibility in the European legislative process, so let us do so, not least in our own countries, in providing the public with comprehensive and timely information.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, I demand of us ourselves that we use the funds we are left with for information and communication. It is intolerable that – as happened in Austria – an information document should be issued on the Constitution without any reference whatever, whether in word or image, to either the Members of the European Parliament or the Members of the Convention. I demand that more use be made of visitors’ groups, of exhibition and display facilities and of the translation service, enabling us to actually do the things we want to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The objective should be, above all, to keep the citizens constantly and adequately informed, with a view to promoting their knowledge of, and their interest and participation in, the European Union’s affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The debates going on in the various countries with regard to the approval of the Constitutional Treaty demonstrate that there is a serious lack of knowledge of the functioning, the policies and the work of the Union. The result of this strategy should demonstrate to the citizens that belonging to the European Union brings them benefits in terms of their everyday lives.</p>
<p class="contents">We must act on many fronts, making full use of the citizens’ preferred media, such as television and radio, since these are best able to reach them in their homes, and, in the era of the information society, it is essential that the Union’s websites appear in the official languages of the Union and also in the languages with official status in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The European citizens have the right to full and impartial information on Community affairs, in their own languages, on the basis of respect for and protection of cultural diversity and as a guarantee of their understanding and involvement in the project of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">If we really want our citizens to be informed, I believe it is entirely appropriate to insist that studies relating to the European Union be incorporated into the teaching syllabuses of the Member States, with a view to promoting a sense and an awareness of European citizenship from the outset.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union’s communication strategy has shown itself to be insufficient and defective so far, and it is therefore essential that the Commission take account of the recommendations in this report by Parliament in the communication that it is announcing for this very month, in order to bring the European Union closer to the citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We will vote today on a report concerning the European Union’s information and communication strategy that is seeking to improve the techniques and methods by which the Union promotes itself. Between these methods and the citizens, however, looms a wall of indifference, which is spectacularly demonstrated by the lowest ever turnout at the elections in 2004: only 45.7%. That is not only the effect of an insufficient and bureaucratic communication strategy, but of a Europe that is still very remote from its citizens, who do not know how it is made up, how it began, what its purpose is, whom it serves, of whom it is made up, where it is leading us, and whether it is useful or irrelevant to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear, this Europe is a construction site, and thus it is obvious that its main features are still not visible. At present, moreover, it is still a union of major economic, commercial and industrial powers, far more so than a union of populations and people. Its institutional architecture suffers greatly as a result of it, and the spirit issuing from it in no way fosters widespread participation by the people. It is also as a result of this isolation that there has arisen the bureaucratic narrow-mindedness that has impeded or obstructed its relationship with the people.</p>
<p class="contents">In a Europe of such contrasts, there is not much sense, in fact, in having built one-way, vertical information structures from the centre outwards, since this has imposed a uniform and standardised communication model that has not worked. It is a model, moreover, in which citizens have to seek out information for themselves and not the other way round: this simply means that no information reaches the great majority of the people concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">An effective information centre is required, a general staff of communication specialists. However, the concept of decentralised communication is also required, originating from the various countries and conceiving this communication in terms of different ways of thinking and languages; a concept of communication that is not solely propaganda.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that an effective way of informing European citizens on Europe is to emphasise not only its strong points but also its weaknesses, because it is also from those that the real, but not utilised, potential of Europe emerges. For this reason, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, I believe that it would be beneficial for all 25 countries to turn to a referendum, including those countries, such as Italy, that are not bound to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The result does not matter; in the end Spanish, French and British citizens will have a much greater understanding of Italians. This is a legitimate method of communicating in Europe; legitimate because it is democratic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We simply have to explain to the public that nowhere in the world is there anything like this project in the development of which we share, that it brings them benefits, that it is all about cooperation, mutual understanding and peace, and that it is political, for only then will we be able to inspire them with any sort of enthusiasm for it.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need, then, above all, is to get information to people where they are, using different kinds of information stands, with which we have to make both Parliament and the Commission present to the nations.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think more use needs to be made of the opportunities afforded by schools, which would, if appropriate, involve modifying curricula. I do not see this as propaganda, but as political education and information – in the best sense of the word – focussing on European political integration and on Europe’s understanding of itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with the suggestion that a hotline should be set up, that prizes should be awarded for good ideas, that more journalists should be invited and that now really is the time for us to put the European Constitution campaign centre stage. There should be more debates in the Member States’ parliaments, and in these we too should participate.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one problematic aspect that I would like to mention. We all agree that European information and ideas have to be transmitted via the media, but I am firmly convinced that the right thing to do is to continue – perhaps by means of joint projects – to support existing television stations, such as EuroNews, rather than to set up a Parliamentary TV channel, which I do not think is really going to appeal to people. Instead, we should support, and concentrate our resources on, the other communication technologies available to us, with which people are already familiar, rather than pour money into a European Parliament broadcasting station, with which we would reach fewer people than if we were to opt for another, cooperative, approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This can be resolved first and foremost by means of good policies and, less so, by means of good techniques. Where our opinions strongly diverge, Mrs Wallström, is that when we say it takes two to communicate, we do not mean that one side provides the information and the other takes it in.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a primitive concept that is still prevalent in the opinions expressed by Europe’s leaders. I should like to make three comments about the report, which makes great efforts to reach points of consensus or convergence. All culture is communication, yet the reverse is not true. We therefore disagree that the EU and the institutions can finance fictional works, films and artworks in order to disseminate and promote European ideas. Commissioned works damage culture, damage creativity and, in so doing, damage Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">My second objection concerns the dividing line between information and propaganda. It is one thing for us in this House to seek to involve the institutions in referendum campaigns, but the truth of the matter is that we are talking here about communication, of which the primary objective is to guarantee the adversarial principle, the right of reply, yet this is not mentioned in the proposal before us. Thirdly, there is the issue of using public resources and money intelligently. The concept of a parliamentary channel is bureaucratic and dated. It is a terrible idea. Contrariwise, the right way forward is to invest in Euronews, in information built on the foundation of editorial freedom; this is the right way forward, the way in which we can see news stories that we do not like. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is the dividing line between information and propaganda? It is not very clear.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Commissioner and the citizens of Europe who are following this debate to ponder certain terms included in this report, such as ‘persuasion’, ‘promotion’, and ‘insist’. Such terms make me fear that the boundaries between information and propaganda are at times dangerously crossed. The concern that emerges from this is that we are selling the European brand as if we were selling a can of Coca-Cola or a pair of shoes.</p>
<p class="contents">If it is the case that in Italy, where they did not want a referendum, citizens are not familiar with the European Constitution, or in Spain, where they actually approved it by a large majority, 80% of Spanish citizens were not acquainted with the European Constitution, I believe that any construction project that starts from the top and not the bottom is inevitably doomed to fail.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, I shudder at what I hear regarding our supposed need for more money and a new publicly owned European television channel, and the need for cash prizes to be awarded to film makers so as to make us proud to be European.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out to Members and to the Europeans who are listening to us that EUR 250 million has already been spent annually on communication on Europe. This sentiment must originate from the bottom and not the top. Billions of euros can be invested, but if there is no genuine democratic process then no one will take pride in being European on the basis of a Parliamentary report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today’s debate illustrates that we are still some way from being able to say that the EU institutions provide appropriate information and communicate well with the public. The information provided must also be reliable, and our citizens must be treated as equals and individuals. Most importantly, this information must reach those who need it, as well as those who are simply interested in knowing more. A further problem to be overcome is that information is not always available in all the official languages. I would add that transparency and a lack of bureaucracy should be the governing principles of information provision. This is rarely the case, unfortunately.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to comment on a number of issues relating to the Constitutional Treaty. As I see it, what is needed is clear and objective information on this Treaty, rather than propaganda, whether for or against. The Constitutional Treaty is an extremely detailed document, and the result of numerous compromises. Our citizens should therefore be provided with information they can trust, and the starting point should be good translations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nor, I doubt, will the British be reminded that, in our country, the State draws power from, and answers to, the people.

<p class="contents">Yesterday we debated the future of Europe 60 years after the war. The majority of speakers emphasised in different ways that Europe’s greatest achievements since the war have been preserving peace, reconciliation among nations, cooperation and acceptance of our diversity. Yet this peace is not a self-evident thing, and we will also need to strive for it in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy is a highly challenging assignment, which allows a person great freedom. And for that reason it is all the more important to have good, effective and objective information, so that we might more easily make correct and intelligent decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the appeal to European Union institutions for an improvement in the conditions for accredited journalists and the working relations with them, since the high costs mean that particularly newspaper and television houses in smaller countries cannot afford direct coverage and reporting from the sessions of its institutions or training for their journalists so they might have a greater familiarity with the working of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">On Spring Day in Europe this year I participated in a number of fascinating events organised in Slovenian schools. Students together with teachers had prepared cultural programmes, exhibitions and round tables. At these meetings I gained the feeling that young people are ultimately interested in what we do in the European Parliament, how you can obtain employment in European Union institutions, what jurisdiction the EU has, and what the constitution will mean.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the proposal that Member States include in their education programmes a familiarisation with European institutions, since no information can be effective if we do not have appropriate prior knowledge of a given topic. There also needs to be a reworking of the ‘Europa’ website, so that all the official languages will indeed become equal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What underlies this is that great lack of information, of which many of my fellow Members and I are constantly reminded at various events, and with which, indeed, we are reproached, and so it is for us to endeavour to improve matters.</p>
<p class="contents">It cannot be right, as we approach so important a decision as that on the European Constitution, that there should be no campaign of information and explanation, or at least no long-term one. It is irresponsible of us to allow such ignorance in this area, resulting in a great deal of popular disquiet as a result of the various misinterpretations, some of which we have just heard from various sides of the House.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to ask ourselves how efficient our current information and communication strategies are and how many members of the public they reach. There is a need not only for better cooperation between the institutions but also for structured partnership with the Member States. None of us can do it on our own. We need to look at and consider the various technical developments that have been achieved in the fields of radio, television and the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">There should also be more scope for European information in the regions, although this does of course presuppose willingness on the part of those with responsibility for them. As it is in schools that people are enlightened, and that knowledge is extended and deepened, the education ministers must make it their business to create a permanent place in the timetable for the European Union and its institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We were told yesterday – in speeches that were very different but all good – about how successful we have been in recent years in making European policy and moving the peace project onwards, but we can cope with whatever the future brings only if we involve the public, keeping them informed and expecting them to accept their share of responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I therefore believe that a communication strategy, as well as many other things mentioned in this report, should in the first place be aimed not only at ordinary people but also at opinion formers and politicians in the Member States, beginning with members of the national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it should have a clear and very precise purpose: that of bringing it home to people what goes on in the EU. It should not, as is sometimes the way of things, just be about anthems, flags and varieties of European music, such as the Ode to Joy from the Ninth Symphony.

PR and propaganda are about selling something for which there is no demand. The Commission was reasonably successful in maintaining the balance between information and propaganda but, unfortunately, the report is along the lines of more propaganda. Naturally, there is always a desire to appear in a positive light, but EU institutions need to be classed in the same category as authorities that are obliged factually and correctly to describe rules, laws and the work they do. I am therefore opposed to paragraph 5, according to which universities are to spread the EU’s values instead of critical thinking, analysis and knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">I object to paragraph 9, which is all about pure product placement, something we usually try to restrict. The calls for a European Parliament TV channel are unrealistic. It is better to have fair conditions for public service television and tougher rules to combat media concentration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I sit on the Committee on Culture and Education, which, through its rapporteur, will of course dutifully produce a report for us all to vote on. I have little doubt that the report will eventually pass through this place and find its way onto the statute books of every Member State. Is anybody listening – here, in this Chamber, or out there, in the real world? No one out there can affect that process; no one in here can originate or terminate reports that come our way, so why should anybody care?</p>
<p class="contents">But the Commission wants them to care, so it decides to spend millions of euros on propaganda – for that is exactly what this is. Paragraph 40 summarises the EU strategy of deception and propaganda. In one breath it is declared that the Union’s institutions have a duty to inform citizens clearly and objectively about the proposed Constitution, yet in the same paragraph it is decreed that these same institutions have a political responsibility to support ratification.</p>
<p class="contents">How, then, can objectivity figure when the final objective has already been decided? And you wonder why the EU is held in such contempt! My colleagues in UKIP and I will not be supporting the ratification of the Constitution or this shameful report, which admits the true problem but is designed to overcome it by propaganda and lies. I have said before, if the EU is the answer it must have been a silly question: that much you can communicate!</p>

The foundations of European policy are characterised by utopia, demagogy, political correctness and the absence of any reference to the values on which our civilisation is based. To this desire to have people forget what we are, on the model of the Communists who wished to make a blank sheet of the past, can be added a commercial dimension whereby the EU’s communication strategy inevitably becomes subject to market principles, to the point at which there is talk of promoting a ‘Europe’ brand in the same way as an everyday packet of washing powder.</p>
<p class="contents">Children, obviously seen by the fervent supporters of Europe as being more malleable, are the preferred target of this communication. A promise is even made to them to define the soul of this new Europe - an odd term, ‘soul’, when you have rejected any Christian references in your draft Constitution. As a cherry on the cake, the possibility is raised of allocating financial bonuses to media that have apparently been able to communicate the European idea and European values. Corruption is being reinvented, as it were, but at European level. That is a good start! In France, we are well placed to make a judgment about the way you view information. In the middle of the referendum campaign and in contravention of electoral law, 14 000 advertising hoardings have been erected on which selected and abbreviated articles are to be read, urging a ‘yes’ vote. We think all this is extremely worrying for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would be appropriate for us, when sitting here in Strasbourg, to cooperate with it in enabling the European public to see what is being done for them here. Communicating to the European public the added value that this House and its Members provide is one of our most vital tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the main problems is that the topics discussed in this House are very complex and wide-ranging, so journalists need incentives if they are to relate better to European issues. I suggest that we should award prizes for the best journalistic writing about what we do here, about countries and about worldwide issues. It is, as has already been said, of the utmost importance that we give our attention to journalists and to education. Again and again, I am surprised by the enthusiasm shown for our work by visitors to this House and by the positive frame of mind in which they leave it. That should continue to be the case in future.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also try to make it easier for schools to access European material in the new library programme that we have developed. There are a lot of excellent DVDs, which do a very good job of describing the work we do.

<p class="contents">when I was in Pärnu recently, in my native country, I was touched when an elderly woman came up to me and thanked me for providing information about the European Constitutional Treaty. It was her request that in future there should be significantly more information about the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I am fully in agreement with rapporteur Herrero-Tejedor that the provision of information about the European Union should be increased. The rapporteur has drawn attention to the great amount of room for improvement, from the content of the information communicated to a competition for original communication ideas. I agree with the idea that the mass media should be involved to a greater extent, and naturally the catchword here is television, this being the medium that most influences and engages society.</p>
<p class="contents">We should, however, engage in a little introspection. Do we in Parliament do enough work ourselves? I would like to illustrate my point with an example. Since the end of last year, Parliament has lacked a public relations officer who is fluent in Estonian. For half a year, Parliament has not issued a single Estonian-language press release on its website – it is fortunate that this is the case only for my native language. At the same time, however, I would like to ask specifically: ‘Who in Parliament is responsible for this question, and in what way?’ First impressions often shape our perception of things for many years to come. In the same way, the new Member States’ perception of the European Union is being shaped today.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that Parliament needs to provide a good example by respecting agreements on cultural diversity and language policy. The observation of these principles also presupposes continuous Estonian-language media work; in other words, that a sufficient number of public servants and translators and interpreters should be hired from new Member States as soon as possible, in order to ensure a smooth bilateral exchange of information.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to note the fact that the Estonian media is represented in Brussels by only one correspondent; as a result of this, the absence of Estonian-language reporting at Parliament is doubly bad, and needs to be solved immediately and without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for your attention! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What is the cause of this? It is not just about the work we do; rather, the cause is to be found in broad public opinion, and particularly the way in which it is reported in the media, for it is primarily they, rather than us alone, that influence the climate within which public opinion is formed, and so that is where we must start.</p>
<p class="contents">Much as I am in favour of the efforts to standardise school textbooks and of the adaptation of information to the groups for which it is intended, what matters is that our public relations work – that done here in the European Parliament and also by the other European institutions – should become more professional. It is still the case, for example, that nothing dramatic happens in this House that might be of interest to journalists and would make the proceedings clearer. Our votes are held quite separately from our debates. What this means is that we have to get the fourth pillar of democracy, the fourth of the four powers, the media, more involved. That is what we must aim for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me first of all to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for the work they have done on a subject as fundamental as the implementation of the European Union’s information and communication strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like firstly to emphasise the context in which we are led to express an opinion on the EU’s information and communication policy. A number of us have for some months been closely involved in referendum campaigns for the Constitution. The very many public meetings in which I participate never cease to bring it home to me how little knowledge many of our fellow citizens have of the European Union’s basic rules and policies. I therefore wish to support this report and emphasise three crucial points in it.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, there is a real need to pay greater attention to the content of the messages in order to arouse people’s interest on the basis of their individual concerns. The recent televised debate between President Chirac and young French people again emphasised the degree to which political leaders were struggling to highlight the positive impact of the European Union on our fellow citizens’ daily concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious, moreover, that only a system of decentralisation can facilitate access to information for a greater number of Europeans. I should like, for example, to testify in this House to the excellent work done by the European Parliament’s Marseille-based information office in my region.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am convinced that, as emphasised by the report, the information and communication policy will only be effective when knowledge of the European Union and its institutions is integrated as a subject in its own right into the Member States’ school curriculums.</p>

It is also a political arena with all the different views reflected, as is demonstrated here all the time.</p>
<p class="contents">In ending this debate, I would just like to repeat my thanks to you for your views. From much of what has been said, and some of the very good ideas we have heard, I can see there is convergence with what we are now preparing in the White Paper. But I must just repeat that communication – and this is also addressed to Mr Portas, for example – is a two-way process. It has to be a dialogue; it has also to involve listening to citizens. That is my second point and I mentioned it in my introduction. One of the guiding principles has to be to listen better to citizens and their concerns, otherwise we will not succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with those who have said that propaganda will not work. Scaremongering will not work either, so I think we have to be very careful in designing our information activities. I underline what has been said by Mr Karas and others. This is something for all players. It has to be integrated at the very start of the process of preparing different proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also received some very good ideas including journalist awards. A number of things have been mentioned that we will follow up. When our White Paper has been published, we will soon have a chance to come back with a number of these principles and very concrete proposals. Thank you for the debate.</p>

<p class="contents">Yesterday – in some cases as late as after 11 a.m – meetings that had been scheduled weeks ago to happen between 3 p.m and 5.30 p.m were cancelled at short notice. This was done at the President’s behest in consequence of the plenary debate due to be held at 3 p.m.</p>
<p class="contents">While I very definitely do see why yesterday’s debate was so important, I do not understand why I, as chairman of an intergroup, was informed as late as 11.10 a.m that it was due to be held, while other Members were notified between 8.30 a.m and 11 a.m. Nor am I sympathetic when cancellations occur at such short notice and the President, who had given this instruction, was seen, at 4.15 p.m. in the courtyard within the tower, toasting a number of visitors, at a time when we were required to be in the plenary and were not allowed to gather in the intergroups, working parties and other bodies.

<p class="contents">Today there is a strike at Strasbourg airport and many Members are unable to make proper travel arrangements.
