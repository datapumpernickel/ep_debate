<p class="contents">Exactly one year ago, on 12 October 2004, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council and Parliament recommendation on further European cooperation and quality assurance in higher education. This proposal is based on the results of the 1998 Council recommendation, so we are just continuing to work towards the goals agreed between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The main aim of this proposal is to facilitate the mutual recognition of quality assurance assessments across the European Union and in this way to achieve easy recognition of qualifications and easier mobility for citizens. It means allowing citizens to move with their rights and capabilities, not only as tourists within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal has been the subject of many fruitful debates in ECOSOC, in the Council education committee and in the Committee on Culture and Education of this Parliament. Discussions between the British Presidency, Parliament and the Commission have led to a set of compromise amendments which are the subject of your debate and vote during this part-session.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept all amendments proposed in the compromise text. I will illustrate some of them and the Commission’s position by referring to the most important amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the new recital referring to the Bergen communiqué. We believe it supports coherence between EU and Bologna quality activities. This is in our common interest, given the fact that Bologna signatory states and EU Member States are the same countries. We now have 45 countries in the Bologna process.</p>
<p class="contents">On recommendation B on higher education sector involvement, diversity and innovation, we also welcome the reference to the involvement of the higher education sector in the further development of quality standards and guidelines and the reference to the need to protect and promote diversity and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards recommendation C and point 1 of the Annex on the European Register, the amendments stress the role of the national authorities in the setting-up of a European register of quality assurance agencies. The amendments reflect the responsibility of public authorities for the national quality assurance systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Recommendation D is about universities’ choice of agency. This recommendation calls on Member States to enable higher education institutions to choose an agency from the register which meets their needs and profile. The amendment makes this freedom of choice conditional on permission given by national authorities. I am happy that the principle of free choice remains in the text because it is important.</p>
<p class="contents">Recommendation E on licensing and funding is deleted. International reputation enhancement is added. I welcome this. We consider that deletion of the licensing and funding purpose in the text does not exclude that national authorities may use foreign assessments as a basis for funding and licensing decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise text supports the main thrust of the Commission’s proposal. The Commission can accept the amendments. Implementation of the recommendation will help to make quality assurance in Europe more coherent and more effective. I therefore hope that the recommendation can be adopted at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress the remarkable work done by Mrs Novak in close collaboration with the Commission and the Council. This work has allowed us to come to an excellent result today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Higher education must become more transparent and even more reliable in the eyes of students and the citizens of Europe and also in the eyes of those living in other continents.</p>
<p class="contents">The report calls for the establishment of common bases for an internal system of quality assurance and for external assessment on the basis of common guidelines and criteria. In this way we wish to encourage all institutions of higher education to develop strict internal mechanisms for quality assurance and to apply the results of all assessments in order to bring about further improvement. It is equally important that the results of assessments be made accessible to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">The standards and guidelines as proposed by the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education have already been adopted – specifically at the meeting of ministers for higher education, which was held on 19 and 20 May 2005 in Bergen within the framework of the Bologna process. However, these common general standards and guidelines cannot be an impediment to development, and we need to encourage diversity and innovation among higher education institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Ministers have also welcomed the proposal to establish a European register of quality assurance agencies, and have called upon the competent authorities to pursue the further development of the practical aspects of implementation. Our report also stresses that, in order to avoid disparities, European Union activities in the area of quality assurance in higher education should be developed in line with the Bologna process, in which 45 European countries are involved.</p>
<p class="contents">As the process continues it will be necessary to establish a European register of reliable quality assurance agencies, and it will also be necessary to establish criteria and rules of operation for such agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">For the purposes of assessment or additional assessment aimed at enhancing their international standing in relation to their needs and profile, higher education institutions will be able to choose independently from the agencies in the Register, in accordance with national legislation or agreements with the competent authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, cooperation between agencies is desirable, with the aim of establishing mutual trust and the mutual recognition of assessments. This will contribute to the more rapid recognition of qualifications in the case of people studying or working in another country.</p>
<p class="contents">The more the European Union improves the quality of education on all levels, the greater will its opportunities be for at least coming close to the goals of the Lisbon Strategy. Here we should not overlook the fact that the people associated in this community can learn a great deal from each other, if of course we are able to cooperate and successfully exchange our experiences and examples of good practice. I firmly believe that each country has specific positive experiences and knowledge that can be shared with others.</p>
<p class="contents">At this time of rapid development and economic competition, our cooperation in the area of education and science is all the more necessary and urgent if we wish to keep pace with developments on other continents.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that all Member States and competent institutions will take this report seriously and will strive to improve quality in the area of higher education, something that will undoubtedly also bring greater satisfaction to students, professors and researchers as well as to us citizens, while at the same time improving mutual cooperation and economic growth in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Higher education in Europe must be improved in order to make it more transparent and to enhance its reputation, both for our citizens and for students and researchers from other continents. Few would question the fact that development and the ability to compete on the global market depend on levels of education.</p>
<p class="contents">Research is a key aspect of technological development, and the latter is closely connected to national prosperity. Since universities are centres for both cutting-edge research and teaching, the assessment of such institutions is of both academic and public interest. In order to ensure that higher education in all fields is of as high a standard as possible, a common set of standards and procedures for assessing individual universities, based on a wide range of criteria, should be used. It would be in the interests of individual Member States to find out how their universities perform in international comparisons, since it is the Member States which confer the right to award academic degrees, and which, in the majority of cases, also fund study towards such degrees.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has recommended that the Member States should set up quality assurance agencies in the field of education and accreditation. If such assessment agencies are to perform the tasks assigned to them, they in turn should undergo regular assessments, in order to guarantee that they are fully independent and professional. This would ensure that their findings would be regarded as accurate and not subject to any doubt.</p>
<p class="contents">Those most affected by the problems in question, namely students and university employees, should also be involved in the overall assessment system. Quality assurance at European level necessitates the drawing up of a trustworthy list or register of independent and reliable quality assurance agencies. In conclusion, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Novak, for her excellent work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of Lisbon’s objectives is further European cooperation in quality assurance in higher education. There are various criteria by which quality must be measured. The Member States’ own quality criteria are every bit as important as those of individual universities or those that apply on an international level to European higher education competing with other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">What this means is that it is necessary to set up quality assurance systems and accreditation agencies to – as we have already heard – evaluate institutions of higher education, or to improve those that already exist and make them more international, following that up with a Europe-wide register or list of quality assurance agencies from which the institutions of higher education would choose a suitable one, which would then carry out the assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">The assessment should rely on the standards and procedures adopted at Bergen, although these should not be regarded as static and unchangeable. Education is a living and constantly developing field; the requirements should be adapted to changing times and new developments, and I would add that cooperation with the higher education community is indispensable in this. The agencies are supposed to interlink with those in other Member States, and this they must do.</p>
<p class="contents">If we establish standards, we will end up recognising more degrees, diplomas and types of training, of which there is such an urgent need in a single educational area.</p>
<p class="contents">Although mobility is a quality criterion, it can have extremely negative effects where the number of students from a neighbouring country oscillates between 30% and 50%, with the consequence that the indigenous students lose out – as they do at present in Austria. I realise that the Austrian Government has left a certain amount undone in this respect, but I ask the Commissioner for his support in defusing this conflict situation, for doing so will be very important, not least in terms of its effect on the public perception of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is particularly relevant for new European Union countries, including my own country Lithuania. If we reject this proposal by the Commission, we would lose an especially important European vehicle, one which helps to ensure the quality of higher education throughout the European Union and to avoid squandering funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would like to insist on the need to take a further step by means of effective cooperation and coordination amongst these bodies, both national and European, since achieving mutual recognition of quality assurance systems and quality assessments is positive for all of the citizens, in that it facilitates the recognition of academic qualifications amongst Member States and the mobility of students and teachers. Both issues are key to improving our levels of education and the creation of a common European consciousness.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to make this possible, however, I believe that it is vitally important to promote the necessary mutual trust amongst all the actors involved. This also means the involvement of universities, teachers and students.</p>
<p class="contents">Only in this way will we be able to successfully face the challenge of the Europe of excellence on the basis of investment in education, training and research, which is necessary if we are to achieve a fully inclusive knowledge-based society within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The quality of academic learning is not simply a matter of receiving full mutual recognition for higher education qualifications. There is a much greater issue involved as well, namely the search for truth.</p>
<p class="contents">As stated by the Commission in 2002, the European educational model should serve as an example to the rest of the world where quality is concerned. The decisions taken at Bologna, Prague and Bergen are therefore crucial, and one of their main features is European accreditation. Accreditation agencies must be transparent and able to resist pressure of any kind. There is scope for abuse in connection with accreditation. Demographic factors mean that institutions compete strongly against each other for students, because their very existence depends on the latter. On the other hand, the immediate introduction of overly strict provisions may lead to serious difficulties for certain institutions that have not yet achieved their full potential. In such cases, it is important to give the institutions a chance to remedy their shortcomings.</p>
<p class="contents">A great leap forward in academic education has also taken place in my country, Poland. For example, some 300 private institutions of higher education have come into being there over the last 15 years, which is extraordinary.</p>
<p class="contents">All aspects of research and teaching must also have a moral dimension. In the interests of good quality learning, it is essential to nurture the relationships between teacher and pupil and between lecturer and student. We should remember the words of Solomon: ‘How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! And to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to emphasise the word ‘recommendation’, because it is the States that have the authority and right to decide. We shall hold a meeting at the level of education ministers in November.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that we have now entered the decisive second half of the Bologna process and that the credibility of the entire Bologna process is strongly linked to quality, which under the proposed system should be a matter of mutual trust. That is also why this issue is so very important for the future of European higher education, and for its attractiveness and status in the world, and here I naturally agree with many other speakers. Mr Janovský remarked that this is the higher goal – to make Europe regain its attractiveness and become a benchmark and arena for global themes or discussions, and for education reform policy.</p>
<p class="contents">One question posed by Mrs Prets specifically concerned Austria and the situation in that country. At a university level, the situation reflects the decision of the European Court of Justice last July. It is part of the primary law of the Union, that is, the Treaty plus the case law of the Court of Justice, and it is important that the States implement the Treaties as agreed. But the Commission is ready and willing to share its expertise, and to provide specific assistance in the search for ways to proceed in the future. This would, on the one hand, satisfy the terms of the EU Treaty, and on the other hand, provide a response to the specific problems or difficulties that we have in connection with mobility. But it would be premature to conclude this discussion now, since the working group has only just started its work with the specialists from the European Commission and the Member States, including Austria.</p>
<p class="contents">That is all, for my part – I would like to thank you not only for your report, but also for the proposal supporting that of the Commission, which, despite certain modifications, preserves its original character and meaning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
