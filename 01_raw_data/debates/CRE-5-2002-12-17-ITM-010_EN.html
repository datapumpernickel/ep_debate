<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ries (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Mr Liikanen, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, first of all, to thank my 12 colleagues in the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee. I can see Mr Bowe, Mrs Schörling, Mr Lund, and Mrs Van Brempt, all of whom have firmly and vigorously defended consumers’ right to safe, effective flame retardants. This joint text could not have been prepared without the efficient work of the Danish Presidency – who will receive the message – and the Commission either, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">We have come so far since 16 January 2001, when the Commission submitted this proposal for a directive which, I would remind you, was aimed at prohibiting the marketing and use of pentabromodiphenyl ether alone, a brominated flame retardant used, in particular, in the manufacture of polyurethane foam, a chemical substance that is harmful to our environment and our health. It is found at high concentrations, in particular in breast milk, with a significant risk of contamination in infants. Logically, therefore, at first reading Parliament pronounced itself in favour of prohibiting pentaBDE in all its forms, thus confirming the red card that the Commission had shown it. There was therefore unanimity with regard to this first substance.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, Parliament, in its vote of September 2001, also wanted this proposal to cover the two sister substances, octabromodiphenyl ether and decabromodiphenyl ether. Given the strong indications of the hazardous nature of octabromodiphenyl ether, both for the environment and public health, the European Parliament, once again with a very large majority, pronounced itself in favour of immediate prohibition.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament, however, chose to show decabromodiphenyl ether the yellow card, by proposing to defer its prohibition to 1 January 2006 at the latest and make it conditional upon the final results of a risk analysis. This approach strictly applied the precautionary principle and was not, at this point, shared by either the Council in its common position or the Commission in its amended proposal. In this kind of matter, where chemical substances are in the dock, debate is always tricky. We needed to establish a fragile balance between obvious advantages in terms of fire safety and equally proven disadvantages in some cases in terms of health and the environment. It is this balance in risk management, taking account of factors as varied as scientific risk assessment, proportionality and cost-benefit analysis, that was at the heart of the discussions within our Conciliation Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Three trialogues were eventually necessary to bring together the various points of view and reach a compromise that was acceptable to all, mainly where decabromodiphenyl ether was concerned, since, I must emphasise, as regards octabromodiphenyl ether, the pressure exerted by Parliament paid off. This pressure contributed to the swift, eventually negative conclusion of the risk assessment and convinced the Council to support us in prohibiting the use of this substance.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of decabromodiphenyl ether, the insertion in the joint text of a recital inviting the Commission to immediately assess the results of the risk reduction strategy, expected by 30 June next year at the latest, seems to me to be objectively the first compromise we have been able to achieve at this stage because, in this case, contrary to the case of octabromodiphenyl ether, in the absence of a final risk reduction strategy and, in particular, in the absence of risks to human health – the conclusions of the French rapporteur are definite in this regard – this deferment accompanied by strict conditions is justified. It should, however, be pointed out that decabromodiphenyl ether, which is mainly used in insulating products, in construction and textiles, is a particularly effective, fire-resistant flame retardant. In the United Kingdom alone, in the year 2000, 155 lives were saved and 4 537 injuries avoided by the presence of this kind of substance in furniture upholstery.</p>
<p class="contents">So much effort has been put into reaching this agreement in the Conciliation Committee. I sometimes had the impression, as rapporteur, that I was acting as a member of the European office for chemical products rather than a representative elected directly by the citizens because of the cumbersome, slow risk assessment process with little transparency. It has taken almost ten years for brominated fire retardants, which are included in the list of priority substances, to be assessed at last.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely hope that this textbook case will enable the Commission and, in particular, the Member States, to understand the need, when preparing future legislation on chemical products, to establish a new assessment method that is swifter, more effective and more transparent, a REACH system which, as proposed by the resolution adopted by Parliament in November 2001, is based on a genuine risk management strategy at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, and I shall go back to my footballing metaphor, whereas the Commission, in its initial proposal, only gave half a red card to pentabromodiphenyl ether, Parliament and the Council, as fair, impartial referees, give two red cards to pentabromodiphenyl ether and octabromodiphenyl ether and a yellow card to decabromodiphenyl ether, as the essential aim is to reconcile citizens’ immediate safety from fire hazards with the more long-term benefits in the field of public health and the environment. The joint text to be submitted to Parliament tomorrow fulfils this dual objective. For all these reasons, I would ask my fellow Members to support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is an important directive, as it would introduce a ban on substances that have been identified as dangerous brominated flame-retardants posing unacceptable risks to human health and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a far-reaching proposal as it bans the marketing and use of all articles containing these substances. The proposed directive will therefore encourage the marketing and use of safer alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the proposed directive provides not only for the protection of human health and of the environment but it would also preserve the internal market, as it would introduce harmonised rules throughout the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">The conciliation procedure that is about to be concluded has benefited from the fact that the risk assessment and the risk reduction strategy for ocataBDE became available in July of this year. We were therefore able to include 'octa' in this directive. The Commission believes that this is a positive outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Considering the discussions about the extension of the ban to the third brominated flame retardant, decaBDE, this requires further examination and finalisation of the currently ongoing risk assessment. Simultaneously, a risk reduction strategy will be developed. This is an important step in the procedure. It will allow the right balance to be found between the protection of health and the environment, on the one hand, and the need for effective fire protection on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">As the risk assessment procedure and the risk reduction strategy will be completed in the next few months, the Commission will soon be able to propose justified measures.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I am very glad about the successful cooperation between the European Parliament and the Council and hope that this important directive can now be finalised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The initial proposal to ban the use of the flame retardant pentaBDE was not considered by Parliament to be adequate, as closely related substances – octaBDE and decaBDE – were not included. Furthermore, Parliament was dissatisfied with the speed at which the risk assessment was being carried out, as this was delaying any real concrete decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">No one underestimates the value and importance of these substances: they are very effective flame retardants and they save lives. However, they appear to have dangerous effects on the environment and public health and, therefore, we felt something had to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that Parliament is pleased that the original proposal is now developed and that octaBDe has also been banned. However, Parliament cannot be totally happy about the fate of decaBDE, which remains to be decided. Parliament would like a clear date for action on this. The fate of this remaining substance is still hanging in the balance. We need clear reassurance from the Council and the Commission – by way of an insertion of a paragraph in the text during conciliation – that prompt, immediate action will be taken when the results of the risk assessment become available, as promised, in June 2003. I hope the Commissioner will confirm that tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, the PSE Group can support this proposal, which will be put to the vote tomorrow morning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those of us in Parliament’s delegation can be very satisfied with the simple fact that we succeeded in bringing about a settlement that also included octaBDE, meaning of course that it will be possible to introduce a ban more quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">I nonetheless see it as a failure in terms of EU environmental and health protection that the Commission and the Council did not comply with Parliament’s proposal also to include decaBDE in the ban. At least 75% to 80% of all use of brominated flame retardants involves deca, and the risk assessment we have available to us shows that decaBDE should have been banned immediately. A longer wait will involve further risks to public health. These substances are long-lived and bio-accumulative. They are stored in living organisms, and they cause changes in the behaviour of animals used in experiments. Deca may also be converted into pentaBDE and octaBDE, which are precisely what the Council wishes to ban. It can also be converted into brominated dioxins.</p>
<p class="contents">The scientific evidence is so worrying in terms of public health and the environment that the European Chemicals Bureau recommended the Member States to take a political decision or, more specifically, to employ the precautionary principle. In June 2002, the competent authority for the Member States considered it was necessary to take measures without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I have to say that the outcome is a failure in terms of EU environmental and health policy. I therefore believe that Mrs Ries will understand why my group will abstain from voting in the final vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is of course a good example of the European Parliament’s being able to promote the protection of the environment and of public health in Europe. The Commission only proposed a ban on the marketing and use of one of the dangerous flame retardants, pentaBDE, and, following demands by Parliament, the directive was successfully extended so that the final result arrived at by the conciliation committee also includes two further flame retardants. With regard to octaBDE, the risk assessment has clearly revealed that the substance entails obvious risks for the environment and public health, and it has now also, happily, been agreed to implement an immediate ban on the use of this substance.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the third substance, decaBDE, is concerned, the Member States and the Commission, on the other hand, initially maintained their opposition to a ban. A majority of the conciliation committee chose to defer to that state of affairs, so that decaBDE is only included in a recital in the directive and – if, quoting Mrs Ries, I may put it this way – has only been given a yellow card. It is safe to say that it will be the environment and public health that, for some time still to come, will now bear the risk of the use of this substance. I find that very unfortunate, and it illustrates of course the importance, in the chemicals area, of our being able to reverse the burden of proof so that it is the producers who have to show that the substances they use pose no risk to the environment and to human beings. Unlike Mrs Schörling, however, I believe that the outcome, whereby the result of the conciliation is being adopted, is, in spite of everything, a clear improvement upon the current situation. That is why I shall vote in favour of the conciliation proposal and the outcome of the conciliation in the final vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I said earlier, the opinion of the Scientific Committee in its risk assessment procedure will be completed in the next few months, and then we can complete the risk reduction strategy. If that is the case, the Commission will be able to make a proposal by June next year. My reply to Mr Bowe is therefore 'yes'. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
