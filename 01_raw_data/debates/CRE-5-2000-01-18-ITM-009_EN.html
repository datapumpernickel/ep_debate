<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, early last year, the 1997 discharge was postponed because this Parliament could not possibly grant discharge to a resigning Commission which could not enter into any commitments for the future. In its resolution, this Parliament stated that discharge could not be granted until we had received serious, far-reaching proposals for reform from the new European Commission. This report, therefore, appears at a crucial time, on the eve of Mr Kinnock’s reforms. It is an excellent opportunity for this Parliament to introduce far-reaching reforms to these plans. In the period leading up to this, it already appeared, on the basis of the initial drafts, that the Commission had made very important pledges. We asked for a whistle-blower’s regulation, and this is now in place. Parliament wanted financial inspection and audit functions to be separated. This has now been done. Parliament requires a code of conduct for Commissioners and Cabinets. This is in place too. Parliament asked the Commission to waive its excessive privileges. It did this as well. The Commission has also entered into commitments to cooperate with Parliament in terms of SEM 2000. Fundamental changes will also be considered for the technical assistance offices.</p>
<p class="contents">These are sound, first steps which illustrate that, if this Parliament so wishes, changes are not only possible but can also be translated into action quickly. We want more than that, however. The Commission should now produce an ambitious and far-reaching reform programme. This is not only necessary for proper public administration, it is a <span class="italic">conditio sine qua non</span> of regaining the trust of the European citizen. We now demand from the European Commission clear pledges concerning the following points. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Parliament must have complete access to all Commission documents. This, however, presupposes that we set up an internal scheme quickly in order to be able to guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive documents. In the context of providing information, I would like to draw the Commission’s attention to the fact that we are very concerned about the present draft plans on public access to documents. If the current draft is correct, then this is a huge step backwards in comparison to today. We must put an end to the situation in which financially powerful organisations with representation in Brussels are able to access information whilst the ordinary citizen is not. Neither can we tolerate a situation in which a public body holds the copyright to public documents. </p>
<p class="contents">We would also like a clear job description for each European official so that an official with conscientious objections can more easily object to tasks which are unethical or unlawful. </p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it should be the case that, if the Court of Auditors detects a mistake not just one year but two years running, the management should be held responsible for it, and this will have an effect on chances of promotion. Ultimately, we also need to achieve better cooperation, of course, between the European Court of Auditors and its national counterparts. </p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament has also asked the Commission to give an initial outline of the external aid policy reforms on 31 March of this year. It should no longer be the case that, although Europe is an economic power, we have no political influence because, when the chips are down, we cannot offer effective aid to areas which desperately need it. I would quote Gaza as an example. It is unacceptable that the Commission completed the construction of a hospital in 1996 and that, as yet, it has been left unused. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, since 1996, the discharge has acquired a heavy, political significance. It is one of the most powerful weapons Parliament has and must therefore be deployed with care. This is why we will most probably grant the discharge tomorrow. However, we are not surrendering this weapon without placing a time bomb in its place. Indeed, the 1999 discharge will not be given until all financial irregularities highlighted by the Court of Auditors have been cleared up. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this discharge report is naturally addressed to the Commission. But this does not detract from the fact that the European Parliament should also put its own house in order. As long as we have no status, we are not credible as a force for reforming the Union. The reforms of the European institutions are necessary in order to be able to continue Europe’s development process. We cannot have a decisive and fair Europe unless it is also open and democratic. All institutions must now join forces in order to work together towards building this type of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We went ahead because we felt we should start this Parliament in the way in which we mean to go on, that is, by making sure that we take good care of taxpayers' money in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">During the course of our work on this report it became clear that there are persistent problems in the spending areas under the control of our budget. They were not unique to 1997 and two strands seem to run through them. The first is a tendency for the Commission to embark on very ambitious programmes, particularly in third countries, without sufficient assessment of the practicalities of implementation and proper resourcing. The second involves serious managerial shortcomings in the Commission, in particular in relation to coordination across departments and management of external contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that all the Institutions bear some responsibility for the increasing workload of the Commission and for some of the lack of resources. That cannot excuse everything that we came across. Citizens of Europe expect the European institutions to be properly managed and they are right to do so. That is why I want to echo the comments from my colleague about the importance of the reform process which has been promised to the people of Europe by Mr Prodi and Mr Kinnock. From what I have seen of the reform process, it looks good. I saw some of Mr Kinnock's papers today, I heard some of what he had to say. I have every confidence that if we and the politicians of Europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need. But we need that reform process.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the general points raised in our committee's report have been covered in Mrs van der Laan's report. It is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it. It seems to hit on all the right points without just being like some of the old reports, a series of details. It groups them together and that is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two issues I would like to draw your attention to. One is nuclear safety in Eastern Europe. We have to get this right. The Committee of Independent Experts said the Commission was not managing this properly. We have to remedy that. The second point is about scrutiny mechanisms. We need from the Commission material we can use to help us scrutinise spending. We need proper information, given in a proper way and we all have to take this whole process a lot more seriously than in the past. It has been seen as a bureaucratic process to be done as quickly as possible in as little time as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope colleagues in this House will support the grounds for discharge for 1997 and, at the same time, that the Commission will push ahead with the reform process which is long overdue. Only in this way can we create a new culture in the Commission and at the same time get public confidence restored. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stauner (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Parliament now has to reach a decision, in plenary sitting, on whether to grant the Commission the discharge for the 1997 financial year that was refused on 4 May last year. Therefore we must ask what has changed, against a background that is truly historic as far as the EU is concerned. What improvements have there been? What is there to justify granting the discharge today? First of all there is – to some extent in any event – a new Commission. There has been a plethora of declarations of intent and announcements to do with reform, none of which have a great deal of substance to them. So far, no consideration has been given to creating codes of conduct for Members of the Commission and their cabinets.</p>
<p class="contents">I have taken note of what Mrs Schreyer had to say this morning on the complaint against the two banks and the support for creating protection under criminal law of the financial interests of the EU. These are also positive signs. Nevertheless, it has to be said that these will cost the Commission relatively little. The Commission has announced that it will present its reform programme in February 2000. Announcements and declarations of intent are one thing, fulfilling promises quite another. However, the Commission’s endeavours can only be measured in terms of actual results, for only in this way will it be possible to restore the enormous loss of confidence that the EU has suffered amongst the citizens of Europe, on account of various shortcomings and machinations.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been able to take stock since May 1999 and our conclusions offer no compelling reasons whatsoever for forming a decision on the granting of discharge. If, nevertheless, discharge is granted to the Commission for the 1997 financial year, this then will mean that we will – once again – be giving them a major vote of confidence. It is another story as to whether our citizens will have any sympathy at all for a renewed vote of confidence of this kind on the part of the democratically-elected monitoring institution that is Parliament, in view of the grave errors committed by the previous Commission which are, of course, a millstone around the new Commission’s neck. In addition, and after all this is important as far as the general impression held by the people is concerned, there is the fact that so far – at least as far as I know – the Court of Auditors has been unable to deliver a positive statement of assurance since this instrument was introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would advocate granting discharge for 1997 and also call upon my fellow MEPs to decide in favour, for, in so doing, we would be setting down a clear marker for a fresh start, as well as giving the present Commission the opportunity to make a fresh start – which would also be apparent to the outside world – in terms of coping with its admittedly onerous legacy. Furthermore, this would entail continuing to track down and resolve once and for all any irregularities or incidences of fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission is now to be granted discharge for 1997, then under no circumstances should this be interpreted to mean a clean bill of health for the past or <span class="italic">carte blanche </span>for poor financial management in the future, for it is known that friendship does not extend to money matters. This expression also holds true for the relationship between citizens and European institutions. And friendship, which means confidence in the reliability of the work of the European institutions in this context, is something we have more need of today than ever before. It is, above all, the forthcoming enlargement of the EU to include the states of Central and Eastern Europe that will produce far-reaching problems and impose burdens on internal structures and administrative developments. A Commission shaken by financial scandals could very quickly become the pawn of certain interests and objectives that most definitely do not feature in the Treaty of Amsterdam’s catalogue of aims.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, in the past, particularly in the year under review, problems have tended to arise in those assisted areas which are set to accrue greater importance when enlargement takes place; for example the structural funds and the deployment of Technical Assistance Offices. We must put a stop to this unacceptable situation with all haste, for we cannot ask something of the new Member States that we cannot deliver ourselves; nor does it help matters when the Commission and Member States point the finger at each other in turn and pass the buck from one to another.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur for the 1998 Budget, I would like to give advance warning that, in the course of the next few weeks and months, I intend to keep a very close eye on how and whether the Commission implements its reform proposals and how it shapes relations with Parliament in this very area.</p>

The Socialist Group will be voting to grant discharge. I am sure you will be relieved to hear that as well.</p>
<p class="contents">But that is not to say that we are satisfied, and that everything in the garden is rosy. It is clear that a radical overhaul of the Commission is long overdue. It indicates, however, that we acknowledge that steps are being made in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to outline some of the issues that we, as Socialists, have put down as amendments. We hope these will be carried because they are important in the way that they will impact on future reform.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the immunity of officials: this should be lifted if and when requested by a national prosecutor. We need to make it much easier to prosecute officials who are guilty of fraud and corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">It is critical to note that the Commission has too often failed to act on the reforms recommended by the Court of Auditors. The Court's report is there for a reason, our response to it is there for a reason and it is important that it is followed through. I have just heard now that an audit progress board is going to be set up by the Commission. Even if we hear nothing else, we know that is going in the right direction in terms of the reforms that we want to see. Too often we have put forward recommendations and they have not been acted upon even though you have said very often that you will act on them. We want to see that follow-through to a much greater extent in future.</p>
<p class="contents">The other issue is access to confidential documents. We have had problems in the past in terms of our responsibility in carrying out discharge because we have not had access to the documents we should have had. We understand that we also have a responsibility here, that if we are given documents we must ensure that confidential documents will indeed be kept confidential. We have put down an amendment to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">One issue which is referred to in the van der Laan report is the whole question of the Gaza hospital. The situation there is totally unacceptable. We will not put up with it for much longer and we are looking for immediate action on that issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Lousewies van der Laan. I do not usually bother congratulating people but I think she has produced a very cogent report and deserves our thanks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lagendijk (Greens/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, if we are honest, we find ourselves in a somewhat unusual situation. We are discussing last year’s discharge, but also the Commission’s responsibility. I would like to raise the problems which are still piled up high on our desks. The assessment of whether or not the discharge will be granted also depends to some extent on where the emphasis is placed. It is about a Commission which is no more. There is now a new Commission. Then it is logical to grant discharge, because how can the current Commissioner be blamed where 1997 is concerned?</p>
<p class="contents">The problems remain and this gives rise to doubts. We have to take a decision now regarding the Commission’s good intentions, but there is still no structural outline for these good intentions. Mr Kinnock will present his proposal next month. We are all very much anticipating this, but the facts are still missing at this time when we already have to decide whether or not to grant discharge. </p>
<p class="contents">It is clearly a dilemma with which the rapporteur has also struggled. This dilemma stretches beyond the areas which I have already listed. Take, for example, the pledges made by the Commission. They look good in themselves. I have read a few documents written by Mr Kinnock and we have every confidence in them. But I will give two examples from which it is not as evident that the good intentions which the Commission has now expressed will lead to a good outcome: the public nature and confidentiality of documents. The previous speaker already said something about this. A document is circulating at the moment – not at a low level, but at a high level within the Commission – which, instead of enhancing the public nature of documents, is having the opposite effect. This is an illustration of empty pledges not necessarily leading to good results. This also applies to whistle-blowers. Mr Kinnock has also devoted some fine-sounding phrases to this subject but, at the same time, it is entirely unclear, at this moment when we have to make a decision, what, for example, happens with whistle-blowers who want to get something off their chest and cannot do this internally but who want to address the outside world – the press or Parliament. We have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type. So there is doubt as to whether these pledges of the Commission contain enough substance at this crucial time when decisions need to be made. </p>
<p class="contents">This also applies, for example, to the very real projects which the Committee on Industry has introduced. In my opinion, the Commission and Mr Kinnock should come with good intentions and with sound plans on personnel policy and financial management, but each Commissioner who is now responsible for an area which has had serious shortcomings in the past should come with sound plans in order to improve the situation and not with general, empty proposals. </p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, our group still feels sympathy for, and patience with, the Commission because it cannot be held responsible for a large proportion of the mistakes made in the past, but this patience has a limit. Clear progress must be visible. At present, we trust that the Commission will produce these sound proposals, but it is not a foregone conclusion that it will do so. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, the 1996 discharge was the beginning of the end of the last Commission. I express the hope that – in fact, I urge the present Commission to ensure that – the 1997 discharge is the beginning of a true reform of financial policy by the Commission. Otherwise this discharge will not have been of any value. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In our Group, we find it hard to see how the financial administration for 1997 was in any crucial way better than that for 1996. In that year, we voted against granting discharge. As a result, we shall vote against granting discharge for 1997, too. We think that this picture of ours is confirmed by the examination carried out by the Court of Auditors. </p>
<p class="contents">It is both good and necessary that reforms have been promised. So far, the promises which have been made are still, however, to be fulfilled, especially where transparency is concerned. We are therefore going to vote in favour of the demands for reforms which are presented in the resolution, but against the granting of discharge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Union for a Europe of Nations Group cannot vote for approving the accounts for 1997. The report on so-called discharge contains a comprehensive and extremely critical survey of the accounts. We support these critical remarks, and I must therefore state that it would seem quite absurd, against this background, to vote in favour of approving the accounts. It has not been possible for the Court of Auditors to issue an auditor’s statement to the effect that the arrangements covered by the accounts are lawful, and we should regard it as extremely problematic if we, as Members of this Parliament, were to vote in favour of accounts without having any guarantee of the legality of the arrangements concerned. </p>
<p class="contents">The majority have made their approval of the accounts conditional upon the new Commission’s implementing a series of reforms, so as to ensure that what we are familiar with from the previous Commission’s period of office is not repeated. Again, I must say that we are concerned here with an extremely unfortunate confusion of the old Commission’s accountability for 1997 and the new Commission’s accountability for the future. We do not think that the new Commission, under any circumstances, could incur liability for the past. We think it is wrong to talk about the Commission’s liability as an institution. The mistakes up until 1999 are attributable to those who had responsibility at that time, and we still have no way of knowing whether the new Commission can do any better. </p>
<p class="contents">By means of this extraordinary procedure, Parliament is stopping itself from placing liability for the arrangements in 1997 squarely where it belongs, namely with the previous Commission. It was the 1996 accounts which led to the downfall of the previous Commission, and the 1997 accounts are just as incriminating. There is no reason why, against this background, we should agree to grant discharge. </p>
<p class="contents">As far as the decision to balance the accounts is concerned, we shall abstain from voting, and where, finally, the motion for a resolution is concerned, we shall attach most importance to the many correct instructions contained in this and vote in favour of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs van der Laan’s report – on which she has lavished a great deal of hard work, and for which we are indebted to her – proposes that we should grant discharge to the Commission for 1997. One might ask how it is that the current Commission is to receive the discharge for its predecessor’s budgetary management – Mr Camre just mentioned this – particularly as the discharge for the previous year, 1996, was denied.</p>
<p class="contents">That is just the way things are, however. In taking over the mandate, the new Commission has to assume responsibility not just for the achievements of the past but also for the mistakes made. Since, on account of the college system, discharge can only be granted to the Commission as a whole or, alternatively, denied or postponed, it is no longer of any consequence that four former Commissioners who belonged to the previous Commission that has yet to be discharged, crop up again as Members of this body. This question ought to have been asked when the new Commission was appointed.</p>
<p class="contents">If Parliament votes in favour of the Committee on Budgetary Control’s proposal this week and grants discharge, then the Commission must not take this to be a blank cheque. For it is the third section of Mrs van der Laan’s report that is the most important, to my mind, namely the motion for a resolution. The comments contained within, under eight headings, are an integral part of the discharge, the implementation of which forms the basis of our decision.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of the discharge procedure for the coming years – that for 1998 is already under way – Parliament will have to examine, as a matter of urgency, whether or not it was too quick to bestow premature praise on the Commission for 1997. We will be in a position to judge just as soon as the Commission presents its reform programme. We will be able to use the discharge procedure for 1998 to check whether efficiency, transparency and accountability, and likewise a sincere willingness to provide information, are being displayed vis-à-vis the discharge authority.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This discharge is to be granted pending a commitment from the Commission to undertake sweeping reforms; that is what it says in recital 1 of the motion for a resolution. Anyone, however, who believes that, regardless of the fact that discharge was refused for 1996, the discharge for 1997 will make everything rosy in the garden again, is very much mistaken! As far as I am concerned, the all-important question as to how willing the new Commission actually is to submit itself and its officials to supervision by Parliament and the judiciary, has gone unanswered.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you an example: one of the first issues we were confronted with, as the newly-constituted Committee on Budgetary Control, was the Fléchard case, which involved fraud in connection with the export of butter to the former Soviet Union at the beginning of the ’90s. On 7 January 1994, high-ranking officials in the Commission took the decision to largely waive the penalty which the company concerned was actually due to pay and which amounted to almost EUR 18 million. This was an outright violation of Community regulations in force and the first we knew of it was when an anonymous notice was sent at the end of 1998.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Everything I have heard Members of the Prodi Commission say on the subject hitherto boils down to a plea to stop poking around in things that happened long ago and to look to the future instead. The enormity of it all is that a Director-General and a number of Directors who were involved at the time have declared themselves innocent of the fact that, unfortunately, the minutes for the crucial meeting of 7 January 1994 have inexplicably disappeared. It is claimed that there was not just one copy of these minutes, but rather that there were several copies. It is said that whilst each participant received his or her own copy, sadly, none of these can now be found, none of them! Now, more than ever before, we can no longer say “forget it!” This is something that should be on OLAF’s list of cases relating to internal affairs requiring investigation but, as far as I am aware, it still does not feature there. This is also one of those cases that should be referred to the competent judicial authorities since, when all is said and done, allowing documents and minutes to disappear is no trivial offence but is expressly made a punishable offence in Article 241 of the Belgian Criminal Code. All I can say is that we will no doubt take up this theme again during the discharge procedure for 1998.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In response to this the Commission has entered into various commitments and has certainly adopted many reform measures. It is fair to say that the new President, Mr Prodi, and his team are certainly committed to implementing the financial control requirements as laid down by this Parliament. However, the reform of the European Commission must now be taken in the context of the debate that is going to take place in the run-up to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and the reform of various EU policies and initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Existing EU treaties will be amended so as to ensure, for example, that the enlargement process can succeed. I have no doubt further reform of EU institutions will be analysed in this debate. But from the perspective of small Member States it is important that, as the European Commission is reformed, it must be done in a way that ensures that small Member States continue to have representation on the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that implementation of the Budget for 1997 fell within the old Commission’s remit. The new Commission has, on the other hand, undertaken to carry out a cleaning up exercise following former scandals, and I must admit that I am not impressed at all. The old mindset which involved sweeping things under the carpet and protecting one’s friends unfortunately still exists. There are some who think that it is more in our interests to let bygones be bygones and make a fresh start. I do not, however, think we can make a fresh start if we do not tidy things up properly. I am referring here especially to the earlier scandals involving ECHO. I am very indignant about the fact that it is so difficult to get any documents handed over on this matter. I am the rapporteur for ECHO on the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I shall have a lot of difficulty carrying out my work if the Commission will not give me the necessary information. From the outside, it looks as if the Commission has something to hide. My investigations also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case. The Commission is not putting all its cards on the table and is in that way repeating ancient practice on the part of the Commission. It was this practice which led to the Commission’s downfall. I can therefore fully support the demand to give Parliament unconditional right of access to documents. Otherwise, we cannot carry out our work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, of course, the discharge procedure for the budget, together with the report from the Court of Auditors, that act as a source of information for the tax payers of the European Union as to whether, and to what extent, budgetary funds were spent thriftily and in accordance with political priorities, where errors occurred, but, above all, what kind of measures are being introduced to remedy the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The general public knows that the European Parliament is not treating the discharge procedure as a routine matter but is giving it every attention, and the Commission has also been aware of this since last year, when discharge was denied, which is what led to the resignation of the previous Commission. Therefore, today’s debate on the discharge of the 1997 budget signals the end of a long process. It has dealt with virtually all the important issues that the Commission is concerned with in the broader sense.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs van der Laan’s report addresses all these instruments. The report is very ambitious. It focuses on the reform measures that were introduced and, above all, on those that will need to be introduced. The Commission shares the rapporteur’s ambitious approach. I would like, Mrs van der Laan, to congratulate you on what is indeed a very ambitious report.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to look more closely at a number of points contained in the report. Firstly, the issue that rightly occupies a substantial amount of our time, that of externalisation of tasks. We have debated this at great length in committee and also in the framework of the budgetary procedure for the year 2000. The Commission has promised Parliament that it will introduce measures in this regard in the very near future.</p>
<p class="contents">Foreign policy is the area that has most relevance to that of the Technical Assistance Offices. My fellow Commissioner, Mr Chris Patten, together with the other Commissioners responsible for foreign policy, set up a review group, only at the end of last year, which is to undertake a very swift analysis of the tasks performed by the current Technical Assistance Offices and consider which of the tasks should be carried out in a different form in future.</p>
<p class="contents">The group has undertaken to submit specific foreign policy proposals shortly after submitting the global reform package. The Commission is unlikely to be able to submit a detailed proposal on this specific point as early as 31 March, but we hope to be able to do so very soon thereafter.</p>
<p class="contents">You emphasised the global approach in your report. This global approach is part of the reform package. However, I also wanted to mention that concrete measures are being prepared which are in line with the report by Mr Bourlanges and which are specifically intended for this sphere of foreign policy. </p>
<p class="contents">It is the aim of other demands in the report to increase transparency. Again, I can assure you that, as such, you have picked up on one of the Commission’s reform objectives. The Commission wants openness and believes that it should only refuse your Chamber access to information where there is a need to preserve interests meriting protection. I am confident that it will be possible to resolve these issues in the interinstitutional agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also intends to improve the information content of your accounts, above and beyond existing legal requirements, at your request and that of the Court of Auditors. I undertook, back in the debate on the Court of Auditors’ report, to take up this point, which also features in this report – namely, carrying out a systematic follow-up – because I consider it to be necessary. The Commission has already decided, on the basis of my submission, that the auditors are to take responsibility for looking after the accounts, including those for 1999, in such a way that they take on board the Court of Auditors’ criticism; that is to say, advance payments are to be itemised separately, so as to keep this information to hand.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against fraud must be stepped up still further. We briefly discussed OLAF this morning. I would just like to again mention the staffing increase for which provision has been made in Budget 2000. Mrs Stauner, the complaint I referred to this morning has not only just been announced, in fact it has already been submitted. I believe this also testifies to the fact that the Commission is not prepared to tolerate certain institutions wanting to back out of this regulation, which was passed by Parliament and the Council, rather it applies equally to every single one of the institutions of the European Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, you call for dialogue to be improved; more dialogue with the Member States about necessary improvements in those areas where they have the power of decision over Community funds. I also second your demands on this point and will see to it that the Commission does what it can to have them implemented.</p>

<p class="contents">As far as the issues surrounding the Gaza hospital and the Palestinian Parliament are concerned, I am able to tell you that the Gaza hospital will be open and available to out-patients as of 15 July and to in-patients from 15 October 2000. Secondly, the Commission will inform the European Parliament about the progress made in relation to the hospital and in relation to the selection of the consultants who are to prepare the invitations to tender for the construction of the Palestinian Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">All the reform measures I have mentioned are part of a global approach. Mr Kinnock is to present the global approach to you on behalf of the Commission and will talk about political priorities of this period of office and enlarge upon the need for firm and, above all, verifiable and comprehensible scheduling.</p>
<p class="contents">Implementation of these plans should make the European Union and its institutions, by and large, more powerful and transparent. Parliament’s task is to supervise the activities of the Commission, particularly within the framework of the discharge procedure. The Commission is very well aware of how resolutely and scrupulously the European Parliament is exercising this supervision. All the more reason for me to be pleased that the reform measures we have introduced meet with your approval and that you are prepared to form a positive judgement of the discharge procedure for 1997.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
