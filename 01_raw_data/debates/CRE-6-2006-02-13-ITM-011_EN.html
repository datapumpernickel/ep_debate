<p class="contents">I know that the proposals, when they reach the decision stage, may not fully satisfy all sides. Some would like to us to move more in one direction, feeling perhaps that we have not gone far enough, while others may believe that we should be more conservative and that we have already gone too far. However, I believe that this proposal, as it stands with many of the amendments tabled, is a balanced, logical proposal, which strikes a balance between the need for better handling of animals, for the welfare of the animals, especially in the chicken sector, on the one hand, while at the same time taking account of the financial cost and burden which it may cause to industry and undertakings in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should not underestimate, first of all, the close link between the proper handling of animals and the health of the animals, and this is particularly important now that we are debating the measures which will be taken in order to combat avian influenza, which has now arrived – albeit only in wild birds – in the European Union. On the contrary, if we follow a policy of proper handling of animals, all the protective measures, all the precautions we take are much more effective. Much better supervision is being carried out, there is much better identification of the health problems which can arise and, of course, this means, from a practical point of view, fewer diseases for the animals, fewer fatalities, fewer unsuitable chickens in such cases and, hence, fewer losses and lower costs. Consequently, it may, if you look at it superficially, appear to be a cost for entrepreneurs, for producers, for farmers; however, in actual fact, it is a benefit which will result in savings and will bring producers financial benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I would just like to state briefly that the World Bank recently issued a report setting out the financial benefits of the application of a welfare policy to animals and illustrating that there is also a financial benefit from these policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I wish to comment on is, of course, the question of aid for producers. It is particularly important that they should not bear the entire cost; however, European consumers are prepared to pay more if they know that certain products have been produced on the basis of policies for the welfare and proper handling of animals. Labelling – voluntary at first – we shall be presenting a report on compulsory labelling – will give producers the opportunity to make full use of the fact that they follow a policy which is well received by European citizens and, on the basis of our studies and research, they will be able to charge something extra, because European consumers are prepared to spend more. Of course, there is also a general, multi-proposal strategy, the strategic plan for animal welfare, which was adopted recently by the Commission and will come before Parliament for debate. This proposal may have preceded the proposal on the action plan, but it is in keeping with the principles and philosophy and proposals of this action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to mention the well-known question of the World Trade Organisation. I know that European producers may often feel that they are at a disadvantage to third countries. Constant efforts are being made to introduce terms and conditions for the welfare and proper handling of animals on the international market. It is not easy, but we are promoting it. The recent adoption by the World Organisation for Animal Health of principles relating to the proper treatment of animals is a first step in this direction and we shall intensify efforts in the same direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, bearing in mind the very high level of sensitivity of European consumers, we believe that labelling could give European producers an advantage. It will not be a disadvantage for them to follow animal welfare policies. On the contrary, something like this will give them access to the very large market of European consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union needs to respect, and lay down in law, the five freedoms of the animal, namely freedom from thirst, hunger and malnutrition, freedom from discomfort, freedom from pain, injury and disease, freedom to express normal behaviour and freedom from fear and distress. This directive accommodates these freedoms, and that is not a moment too soon.</p>
<p class="contents">It is first and foremost the European consumers and citizens who demand respect for animals and who – in an increasing number of countries – are prepared to pay a reasonable price for it. It is good that the Commission, three weeks ago, launched the action plan for animal welfare. Agreements and rules of this kind should be European; if not, Member States will start competing against each other at the expense of animal welfare.</p>
<p class="contents">The European consumer’s main concern about animal welfare at the moment is the welfare of broiler chickens. This was fuelled by reports of overcrowding in chicken houses and of breeding methods that were aimed at achieving ever faster growth, rather than strong bone structure and stronger heart and lungs. Too many animals sustain injuries on legs and chest due to poor litter. With my report and related amendments, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has sent a clear message to the Commission and the Council in support of animal welfare and of quality requirements, but also in favour of some flexibility in respect of the poultry farmer. I have also, in my report, attempted to lay down two principles that were not yet included in the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, genetic selection, the breeding of animals to obtain certain features, should never result in a decrease in, or threat of, the potential level of animal welfare of an animal species. This principle must be a cornerstone in any animal welfare directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, animal welfare should not be treated as secondary to socio-economic considerations. With this principle in mind, it makes sense to subject the quality of the chicken houses to certain criteria. These are criteria that good poultry farmers have met for a long time, since they reduce mortality rates and thus increase the yield. As Commissioner Kyprianou has already pointed out, animal welfare is in poultry farmers’ economic interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive also provides for professional and daily health and welfare checks, which, particularly in this day and age, are an important preventive measure against animal diseases. Even so, poultry need more room than they are often given. The amendment that Mrs Jeggle and I have tabled specifies that maximum quantity of poultry per square metre in the few days immediately preceding their being transported to the slaughter house must come down to 38 kg per square metre and to 34 kg by 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">Many EU Member States are already under or around this limit. I do not support amendments that favour even lower densities. Even though experts believe that animal welfare is at greater risk above a density of 30 kg per square metre, that is definitely not an absolute limit above which disaster is sure to strike. Above 30 kg per square metre, everything depends on good management, and that is precisely what this House can rely on. That is why the rules should be flexible in their application to farmers. Quality requirements and sanctions go hand in hand, but these should be proportionate and encourage better management. It makes no sense whatsoever to increase the severity of penalties or increase their duration for longer than is strictly necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who are opposed to this directive claim that global competition makes animal welfare standards of this kind impossible, and allege that Europe is subjected to stricter requirements than countries outside. As a matter of fact, that is not the case. Brazil, which is our biggest competitor in the poultry industry, already does all that this directive requires. Even if Europe were to stop bad animal welfare at its borders, Brazilian meat would still come in effortlessly.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the European sector will need to look at reducing costs and thus increasing the scale, or else at producing fresh, high-quality meat near the European consumer. What this directive encourages is already, we can see, becoming a trend, but that does not mean that the Commission should not place animal welfare on the agenda within the World Trade Organisation, and do so more firmly than it is doing now. I have questioned the Commission about this. What scope does the GATT Agreement offer for animal welfare? In Article 20 of this Agreement, import restrictions to protect human, animal or plant life or health are said to be justified on moral grounds. We need to press on down this road.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs concrete proof in order to get its citizens to regain trust in the EU. Sustainable development is one of the areas where the EU can score points. Animal welfare is part of this and that is why this directive should be put into practice soon.</p>

<p class="contents">The big problem with the Commission’s proposal is that it does not do enough in terms of animal protection. According to the conclusions drawn by the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare and on which our decision is based, stocking density must, for example, be lower than 25 kg if major injuries and unnecessary suffering are to be avoided. In line with this, many Members have tabled amendments precisely on the subjects of stocking density and the scoring system for foot pad lesions. These changes are necessary if we are to guarantee animal protection.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Parliament must take expert opinion seriously and show the Council that we want to see the Commission’s proposal tightened up when it comes to animal protection. That, and not perhaps the details of our amendments, is what is most important right now. I therefore hope that, tomorrow, a majority of this Parliament will vote in favour of these amendments which, as I say, obtained considerable support in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. A broad majority, on both right and left, voted in favour of them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This draft report, adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on this new directive on the protection of chickens kept for meat production, is balanced, because it takes account of the production practices of the majority of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The key point of this report is densities, as you know. From the information that I have been gathering, the densities laid down in the report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are more than acceptable in most of the European regions, but they could cause certain problems in certain very specific areas of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I have tried to reflect the opinion of the majority and, incidentally, with regard to amendments, I would like to warn you that I do not intend to support the majority of them. I do believe, however, that Amendment 42 responds to a highly justified political concern, extending minimum standards applied in the European Union to imports from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendment 44, which removes the implementation of labelling for meat subject to the new welfare directive, I must tell you that this runs counter to the need to give added value to these products in order to provide greater visibility for the efforts made by European producers.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has been producing abundant legislation over recent years with a view to improving animal welfare and responding to one of the concerns expressed by European public opinion. In this way, we have managed to considerably improve, sometimes at the expense of jeopardising the viability of the sector, the protection of laying hens, calves and breeding sows.</p>
<p class="contents">We must recognise that this effort should lead to an improvement in the quality of products for the European consumer, and this quality must be accompanied by an effective policy in the field of labelling.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, supporting the amendments that have been presented, the majority of which toughen the legislation pointlessly, will cause adaptation problems in certain regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this matter, I should like to begin by paying tribute to the rapporteur, Mr Berman, who has tried to strike a balance between positions that were much too far apart. It must be pointed out that one criterion was emphasised above all others, that of stocking density. We should condemn the Commission proposal for recommending the automatic registration of certain data, something that seems difficult for small producers to contemplate and to write off as part of their costs. Let us return, however, to stocking density, which is the main criterion at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">An initial economic approach in Wallonia shows that, on the basis of average revenue of 72 cents per kilo, the estimated loss of annual revenue for a 1 000 square metre building would be 55% for a stocking density of 30 kg per square metre and 24% for a stocking density of 38 kg per square metre. The sector cannot absorb this estimated loss of revenue. The planned elimination of countless producers in Europe and a stagnant or rising consumer demand will inevitably benefit imports from countries that are a long way away from applying our standards, or even from considering them. Animal welfare will be the loser throughout.</p>
<p class="contents">While I am therefore responsive to the rapporteur’s arguments aimed at moving European agriculture in the direction of sustainable agriculture, I should like, by way of conclusion, to underline two crucial elements. Firstly, moving in the direction of higher quality means that European producers will have an extra cost to bear. We should emphasise this difference and draw attention to it through the use of labels so as to put in practice, and explain the reason behind, a price differential that the Eurobarometer respondent – who is also a consumer – must be prepared to pay. Mass distribution has a key role to play in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly – and to conclude – it is crucial that we do everything in our power to ensure that the European Commission, with the help of international organisations such as the Council of Europe or the World Organisation for Animal Health, succeeds in making the WTO more compliant with the animal welfare measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It may well be his first report, but I think he did a very thorough job of it. As for the report itself, while I have to say that I do not know of anyone in this House who is opposed to animal welfare – everyone is, of course, in favour of it – I do nevertheless have my doubts about this proposal, because I think there is room for improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it imposes the same standards across the whole of the European Union, and I can imagine that in a cold climate such as Finland or in a totally different climate such as Italy, very different standards should apply with regard to stock densities. Things may well already be different in practice. The Commission fails to take this into account in any way, and as the previous speaker said, we have not yet seen an economic analysis. It is easy to say that animal welfare must not take second place to socio-economic priorities, but some people still need to make a living out of this; what exactly are the consequences for them? Does the Commission have any idea?</p>
<p class="contents">What matters most, of course, as has also been mentioned by many before me, including the Commissioner, although he did not manage to win me over completely, is a code of conduct. It is not very sensible, though, if we want to stress what are referred to as non-trade aspects, to table yet another fresh proposal in the middle of discussions in the World Trade Organisation, without knowing for certain that the importers comply. Why does the Commission not raise the subject of a code of conduct with the supermarkets and other large importers, and do so as soon as possible?</p>
<p class="contents">Where is the logic, if European producers are told that they need to meet such and such standards, while various supermarkets are allowed to import from the rest of the world with no restrictions, without the Commission demanding that checks of any kind be put in place? We only check for salmonella, or whatever, but we never check for animal welfare. That is what the Commission should do and that is what is missing completely from this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It goes without saying that there must be some who have not yet got that far, or else we would not need to prescribe it by law. I think the problem also lies in the fact that many of those engaged in fattening up chickens are no longer farmers, but rather industrialists, for whom respect for life is irrelevant to the business of getting a return on capital. I can tell Mr Berman that the only conclusion we can come to from seeing the way breeding was approached is that the primary concern was not the animals’ well-being, but rather the use to which they could be put in obtaining the maximum possible profit.</p>
<p class="contents">The very sight of these pens is enough to show the urgent necessity of our enacting legislation on them. On that we agree. I do think, though, that we have to take care that this directive and this regulation do not end up leading us to aid and abet this sort of industrial production. One problem is, in fact, that these stalls are often outwardly healthy, but that is only because they are protected by prophylactic inoculations and medication, which, while preventing an outbreak, allow the germination of the variants that are currently troubling us or that make bird flu particularly to be feared. This makes the preventive measures currently being adopted for free-range animals especially problematic, for it is the good conditions under which these animals are kept that enables them to develop the strongest resistance to diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to take good care that we do not end up catching the wrong people, and we must also ensure that the specialised markets for which these animals are supplied, which people accept along with the higher prices charged on them, are not run into the ground in such a way that farmers lose out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These standards are needed. Within the European Union we should be striving to ensure that animals are treated as humanely as possible. This applies especially to animals raised for meat production, such as broiler chickens.</p>
<p class="contents">We should spare animals unnecessary suffering to ensure humane treatment and out of regard for the standards of our civilisation. We should do so in the interests of our own health too. There is a large body of research showing that meat from animals raised in poor conditions and subjected to constant stress is simply less healthy. However, a problem of a rather different nature has arisen. The regulation imposes high standards on European Union broiler producers, but it does not apply to importers. Maintaining high standards is expensive, which means that our producers’ meat cannot compete with meat from producers outside the Union. They are exporting to the European market meat from poultry raised in countries where such high standards are not guaranteed. Many European broiler producers are threatened with bankruptcy, because they have become less competitive due to the fact that they have to meet high European Union standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The same standards should be imposed on imports as on meat produced within the Union, not only for the sake of the broiler chickens but also for the benefit of their producers and especially for the good of the consumers. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted an amendment tabled by the Union for the Europe of the Nations Group calling on the European Commission to ensure that these high standards are also met in the case of imported meat.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this should be a general principle that should apply not only to poultry but to all agricultural products. Union producers and importers must be required to meet the same standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many a time in this very Chamber have I denounced the disgraceful industrial farms, in which up to 80 million male chicks have been burnt alive to heat up the farms. I have denounced the way in which the chickens are slaughtered using electric stunning techniques. In fact, the chickens are not completely stunned, with the result that they are plunged into hot water while they are still alive: they are boiled so that they can be plucked.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore all agree that rules are needed. However, when European farmers read the directive, what do they see? They see that the broiler chicken is subjected to two daily medical visits, which are carried out by a veterinary surgeon who must be at least three metres away from the chicken; the area in which the chickens are kept must be illuminated by a non-flickering light with an intensity of 50 lux, 20 lux or 100 lux – no one quite knows – measured at bird eye level; the inside temperature of the farm must not exceed the outside temperature measured in the shade by more than 3˚C; the chicken’s litter must be 5 cm deep; certificates are required for the purposes of keeping chickens and of castrating chicks that are less than ten days’ old; the chickens’ foot pads must be examined, and the stocking density of the chickens must be limited to 28, 30, 35 or 42 kilograms per square metre, although it is not specified whether this means one kilo liveweight or metabolic weight.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, thousands of chickens are being slaughtered in Nigeria, and avian influenza is going to strike down 1.1 billion African chickens. All of this because we did not find the EUR 800 million that would have made it possible to administer to each African chicken the two necessary vaccines, at a cost of 40 cents per dose. I could also try to add a touch of black humour here. Faced with this deluge of precautions that are reserved for white chickens while black children are dying of leprosy, AIDS and tuberculosis, the little African child is going to end up saying: ‘when I grow up, I am not going to be a fireman, I am going to be a broiler chicken in Europe!</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, our Breton farms, for example, are relocating to Brazil – the leader in poultry farming – where not only are the chickens unprotected, but the children are too. The latter are treated like slaves so that the Brazilian farms can be kept in operation, and that is without mentioning the banana plantations, in which little eight-year-olds fall asleep exhausted on cardboard boxes and come into contact with plant-care products that make them dizzy, all for just USD 2 a day. Well, everyone has his or her own idea of what is most important. Some people choose white chickens whereas I, for my part, choose African children and Asian children. That is where foolishness leads you when you try to act virtuously and, with this directive, we are acting stupidly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some 5 billion broiler chickens are slaughtered in the European Union every year, and the great challenge presented by this report is that of finding a balance between the protection of animals, which is necessary, and the protection of jobs in the commercial production of broiler chickens.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt – not least in the minds of those who breed and keep chickens for fattening – about the rightness of our making a joint proposal for the improvement and harmonisation of the conditions under which they are kept in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I, too, endorse the report, but the producers operate, even today, with the tightest of profit margins. If standards are raised within the Community, they will in particular face the problem of imports from third states, where standards in production are far inferior to our own. I therefore call for the introduction of binding rules on labelling, founded upon compliance with standards of protection, which will be effective, binding and harmonised right across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I call for certain standards in the keeping and production of broiler chickens and other agricultural products to be demanded in future WTO negotiations. The EU’s high standard in food production should become an advantage for producers in the EU. While we want our animals to be protected, we cannot, at the same time, allow our producers to be put in a disadvantaged position.</p>
<p class="contents">The current threat of bird flu is another reminder to us of how important it is that broiler chickens should be produced safely, in adequate quantities and on a sound economic basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Due to numerous food crises, it has now also become a public health issue. Specific legislation in this area has therefore become urgent. I believe that that is something on which we have all agreed during this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">In producing this legislation, however, we must keep our feet on the ground. We must produce a viable and credible proposal, not restrict ourselves to making pointless gestures, which give the impression of being inconsistent with the Council’s current figures.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the report by the rapporteur, Mr Berman, whom I congratulate, combines a genuine concern for the welfare of animals, taking account of scientific data at all times, with the necessary flexibility in its application to make it possible for producers to accept the measures proposed and adapt to them. On the one hand, measures are proposed to prevent the practices that lead to pointless and gratuitous suffering for the animal, and, on the most hotly debated and controversial point — stocking density — credible and applicable figures are laid down that represent significant progress in this field and which are acceptable to the Council. I believe that we must show responsibility — and we have done this in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, this proposal maintains the necessary flexibility with regard to producers, which makes this minimal regulation genuinely applicable in the countries of the Union, and does not lead — as is usually the case — to the unnecessary closure of farms.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it provides the necessary firmness in laying down the regulations with a gradual application of sanctions and an estimation of the costs for producers with a view to ensuring that the burdens stemming from the directive do not fall to them — as is almost always the case.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would ask you to support the Berman report, in the form presented by the rapporteur and as supported by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. I believe that it is a measured and balanced proposal that takes account of the interests of all of the parties, which is not always an easy task. There is no question that its approval will have positive effects in terms of the quality of the final product, that is to say, for the well-being of European consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is they that have far and away the worst experience at present. They are bred in such a way that they grow extremely large and, as a result, as many as a fifth of them have injuries to their joints. Separated from their mothers at birth, accommodated in cramped conditions and placed under stress, they suffer throughout their short lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Berman has tried to find a good balance of measures, but the Committee on Agriculture unfortunately has a bias towards short-term interests. This must be corrected by means of the proposals by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. Better conditions are required both by our consumers and in the interests of animal health. I would thank Mr Jørgensen and others for their constructive cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">According to Eurobarometer, the individual animal protection issue that most Europeans want to grapple with is precisely that of improving the conditions of broiler chickens. Today, Parliament must listen to their voices. Vote, therefore, in favour of the proposals by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and in favour of the proposals put forward by Mr Jørgensen and the rest of us in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. Without these improvements, the industry will lose all credibility and is in danger of being destroyed – by low consumer confidence rather than by competing imports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let there be no doubt about this: the CDA is all for animal welfare and regards it as important. We also welcome the new action programme presented by our Commissioner. That does not, however, take away from the fact that, while it is clear that the European public does not think highly of animal welfare in Europe – God only knows why, though, for Europe does apply the world’s strictest standards – their behaviour as consumers is often very different, and that is where the problem lies.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that whilst we can introduce stricter standards in Europe, at the same time we could open the floodgates to imports if they are unrestricted. One could say that we do not make that mistake in the World Trade Organisation and that although Europe tries its hardest, more should be done. We can come to an agreement with regard to imports and import quotas. We can also do a deal with regard to labelling. We can also agree that we in Europe will in any event commit to those who have launched special projects, including the people behind the farmer’s chicken in the Netherlands and the ‘label rouge’ in France. It should be possible to support them by giving them extra incentives, so that consumers will buy their products. The CDA prefers this way of working, because otherwise we will produce yet more European legislation, which consumers may applaud well as citizens, but in respect of which they will display different purchase behaviour the minute they walk into a supermarket.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that what the public want is also translated into consumer behaviour. That is the very reason we are very critical of this report. We will be voting in favour of Amendment 42, by means of which something will at least be done about imports, and we will also support everything in this report that is related to improved recognisability through meat labelling.</p>
<p class="contents">As long as there are no guarantees, though, that imports can be subjected to the same criteria, as long as we are once again putting the European farmer on the back foot and are again making things more difficult for animal welfare in Europe, it will be extremely difficult for us to vote in favour of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A few months ago no one would have questioned this statement. Today however, poultry farmers are facing a new threat after the bird flu: the current regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The current draft regulation, which has given more consideration to animal welfare than to industry sector and economic arguments, threatens the competitiveness of this sector. Animal welfare aspects should indeed be taken into consideration. But we should not overshoot the target by imposing unrealistically strict regulations which force our farmers into a severe competitive disadvantage, endangering their livelihood. These people do not intend to be cruel to their animals – they just want to earn a living by doing what they are good at. Therefore, excessively strict regulations are unacceptable. Additionally, the planned excessive restrictions may lead to serious tension on internal markets, as well, because non-EU countries such as Brazil, which do not have to comply with these strict regulations, are able to sell their poultry products on European Union markets at significantly lower prices. The majority of average consumers, at least in the new Member States, choose the cheaper product, because their income does not allow them to pay a higher price for basic food, just because they are environmentally aware or care about animal welfare. In view of the professional, economic and animal welfare considerations, the acceptable stocking density would be 34 kilograms of live weight per square metre, with a maximum upper limit of 42 kilograms of live weight per square metre. Any figures included in the report that are lower than these are not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us trust in the expertise of poultry farmers, as none of them would be able to achieve good results with sick animals, which means that their primary interest is to conduct a rationalised economic activity, taking into account animal welfare considerations. Let us not make their task so difficult that they may be forced to give up poultry breeding altogether! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The economic aspects of the industrial production of broiler chickens have rightly been taken into consideration. However, the case also concerns the limits of the safe decoding and manipulation of animals’ genetic material.</p>
<p class="contents">We should have thought long ago about the dimensions of the industrial production of broiler chickens, not only for reasons of animal welfare, but also on account of the unplanned and unintended effects on the genetic material – in terms of resistance and reproduction, for example – of the animals providing our food, and the subsequent effects on us.</p>
<p class="contents">The danger of an outbreak of avian influenza is linked to the problem of control measures, and these measures do not consist only of vaccines.

It has achieved as good a balance as one could expect, because I recognise that this is not an easy area in which to balance all the different interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Two weeks ago, a poultry-processing plant in Northern Ireland closed with the loss of over 400 jobs, not to mention the other jobs on the farms and in the feed compound mills. The reason given was that they could no longer compete with cheap imports from Asia and South America.</p>
<p class="contents">I happen to believe that there is no such thing as cheap food. If food is cheap, it is not meeting the standards. Therefore I have to ask myself: is the chicken meat produced to our existing standards, never mind the proposed increased standards?</p>
<p class="contents">I support the part of the report that states, in Amendment 17, that we must insist on the same standards in third countries as in the European Union. At the moment we only pay lip service to this. We are tying the hands of our producers, our farmers, with bureaucracy and red tape, while allowing others to flood our markets with food that does not meet our standards.</p>
<p class="contents">This goes beyond the poultry industry: it is in the pig industry and in the red meat industry as well. They all have the same problem. I welcome higher standards, but I want the same everywhere. We must give consumers the choice. We must have proper food labelling; it must be clear, so that wherever consumers shop they can make a clear choice about what they wish to buy. They must know where the food came from. In many instances the supermarkets in the European Union are worsening standards by forcing down food prices. As I said earlier, there is no such thing as cheap food; cheap food is sub-standard food. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The proposal starts from the basis that the existing standards for keeping chicken for meat production are indeed very low in parts of the European Union at the present time, and that is demonstrated by painful leg disorders, enlargement of the heart, sudden death syndrome, ammonia burns on feet and so on. I welcome the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development’s proposals, but I still believe there is room for further improvement and that is why I have also signed the amendments tabled by Mr Jørgensen. In particular we need further action on stocking density, on uninterrupted rest periods – a minimum of six hours in the darkness – and on issues such as the inhumane issue of beak trimming.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, even if we only go as far as the proposal put forward by Mr Berman, there would be a big step forward for animal welfare, but it will also be a big step forward for consumers. Consumers worry about the conditions under which their chicken meat is produced and they worry about the health of the chicken they are eating. Properly reared chicken will be a better piece of meat when it goes on the plate.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to address the issue of cost. I have looked at the various estimates of what this would cost the industry. Even if you take the highest estimate, if you aggregate that estimate down to the cost per bird, you are talking about one British penny per bird. It is not going to be animal welfare measures that make our industry uncompetitive. I accept that the industry is facing real challenges from places like Thailand and Brazil, but there are other factors – cost of labour and other costs – that we cannot compete on. It is not animal welfare standards that will make the difference in terms of whether our industry survives or not, so do not use competition as a reason for rejecting these animal welfare standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to clearly state from the outset that I am in favour of a decent life for animals, for all animals in general and for chickens in particular. To look at the bigger picture, I say that this demonstrates our humanity towards all our fellow inhabitants of this planet.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must accept that, as has already been said, all this increases the cost of production in the European Union. On the other hand, of course, we allow chickens to come in from third countries; we allow everything to come in except weapons. In this way, we are causing European poultry farmers to close their poultry farms. This is unfortunate on two counts: both for the poultry farmers, a class for which we should show solidarity, and for the chickens, because we shall arrive at the point, in a few years' time, where chicken products will be imported from third countries which are produced without any protection as regards a decent life for the animals. Unless we want to be hypocrites, we must find a way of controlling the living conditions of chickens in third countries; otherwise we should not permit imports.</p>
<p class="contents">Labelling, which Mr Kyprianou, referred to, is a very good idea, we think it is an excellent idea and we want to proceed towards this sector, but we also need to think about subsidising poultry farmers for the costs relating solely to the measures we impose on them. Otherwise, we shall also wipe out poultry farmers and the poultry we bring in from abroad will have been raised under much worse conditions. Besides, it is not a crime for us to protect poultry farmers, a class which is asking for our solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This move on the part of the Commission is therefore to be welcomed, as is also Mr Berman’s report, and those who have been following the debate, with points of criticism and interventions flying off in all directions, have completed a difficult exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">One can take a positive view of Article 1 of the Commission proposal, according to which the Member States are at liberty to enact more stringent provisions, but those that the directive proposes are inadequate in certain respects, the issue most frequently discussed today has been that of how much stocking density can be allowed in terms of kilos of live weight per square metre. The Commission claims to be taking as its basis the report that the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare produced in 2000, but that is not in fact the case, for this report explicitly states that the occupying density must not exceed 25 kg per square metre if more serious problems for the animals’ well-being are to be avoided. Article 3 of the Commission proposal prescribes 30 kg per square metre live weight.</p>
<p class="contents">I endorse Amendment 53 from Mr Jørgensen, Mr Bowis and Mr Sacconi, which prescribes that chickens should be kept at a density of 25 kg per square metre, and that this density may be increased to a maximum of 30 kg per square metre if the owner complies with certain conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that high standards for animal welfare are good not only for chickens but also for farmers and consumers. What we have to do is get the balance right and I believe he has moved in that direction. It is not just about the number of chickens per square metre; it is also about the atmospheric conditions in the houses and whether there is straw or anything in them, so that the chickens have slightly better conditions during their very short lives.</p>
<p class="contents">When consumers go to the supermarket to buy chicken, it has to be clearly labelled. One of the problems is that you can often go into a supermarket now anywhere in the European Union and buy a chicken without being absolutely sure where it has come from and to what standards it has been produced.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner said that consumers like to buy high-welfare-standard chickens. Yes, they do, but these need to be clearly labelled. Also, the Commissioner must be aware that a lot of the imported chicken meat that comes into Europe arrives in a partially cooked state. That way it gets around some of the EU tariffs. It then goes straight into processed food, so that when we go to buy our chicken sandwich at a motorway service station, it will probably be made from imported chicken meat and we have no idea what sort of standards it has met.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 17 to Article 5 asks the Commission to bring in a clear labelling system for meat that is imported into the European Union after the legislation has been in place for six months. I urge the Commission to do that. When Europe introduces higher standards – as I believe it must – we have to be sure that everything else entering Europe meets the same high standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will simply add that the farmers’ welfare is also a noble cause and, in our view, a high-priority cause. This sector is already seriously threatened by non-European competition. I heard one of my fellow Members say a short while ago that there had been no farm closures, but that is incorrect because this is already a widespread phenomenon across the European territory. I will simply mention my own region – Brittany – which represents 35% of the French production of broiler chickens and which, above all, accounts for 18 000 jobs, 11 000 of which are in the agricultural and food industries. This is a region in which farms are currently being closed.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, if the current – and already very serious – distortions of competition increase, then we will witness a massive influx of products from third countries, coupled with a fall in our exports. Of course, it is all very well being told ‘produce high-quality goods’, but we know that adapting and restructuring are very risky, and in any case require a great deal of time.</p>
<p class="contents">A great deal of work has been done on this matter, but there are nevertheless some real shortcomings in the justifications of this text. I will mention the thresholds, which seem to give rise to a virtue contest, with the thresholds being set at the lowest levels possible; next, the assessment indicators of the ‘breeding contests’; and lastly, and above all, the impact study of the repercussions in terms of the elimination of farms and jobs in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to pose a question to Commissioner Kiprianou. Commissioner, in the current context of the threat of avian influenza, which is approaching Europe, or even already in Europe, how should one go about tackling the paradox between, on the one hand, high European standards in respect of animal welfare and, on the other, the necessary national measures for keeping poultry indoors? We should be grateful to receive your reply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps I should have quoted Mahatma Ghandi earlier: ‘The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated’. In the European Union, thank God, we have a very high level of civilisation. The largest number of letters and complaints I have received from European citizens concerns animal welfare, in particular broilers. So this proposal reflects the views of European citizens. It is based on science, but also on consultations with all the stakeholders over a period of three years to take account of all their views and concerns. It is a compromise. Some would like us to go further and have said it is a low-standard proposal. Others say we have gone too far. It is a step towards protecting the welfare of animals, but it also takes into account the interests of the producers.</p>
<p class="contents">Competitiveness is certainly important, but we know that the cost imposed on production by animal welfare standards is very low, something between 2.5 and 8 cents per bird. The other costs affect competitiveness. But I do not believe that European producers can compete on the basis of cost. They should compete on the basis of quality. I have some photographs here of the dermatitis caused by this intensive farming and I do not think that any European consumer would be willing to eat these birds; it is just that they do not know about it. So awareness and education are the best policy, together with labelling, which is very important. We have letters; we have Eurobarometer. European citizens are ready to pay more, provided they know, and we are working on that.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of avian flu, best practices in animal welfare help us implement preventive measures more effectively, to protect the industry and the birds from avian flu. If it is easier to detect sick animals, it is easier to control the situation, and therefore these proposals on animal welfare and protection against avian flu are compatible.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the amendments, because of the lack of time we will circulate a full list of those that have been accepted and those that have not. I would ask that this list be included in the verbatim report of proceedings of this sitting<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Many of the amendments were accepted because they are compatible with the philosophy of the proposal. Others cannot be accepted, mostly for technical reasons or because the provisions are already included in existing legislation. Proposals such as those that take account of climatic conditions, types of production, training of staff and the way the checks should be performed can all be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most sensitive issues was density. We feel that the proposal is a reasonable compromise. It meets the standards, it improves the situation and it establishes conditions and controls. We would therefore prefer that Parliament accept the Commission’s proposal on that point and we cannot accept that amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning mandatory labelling, we feel – and I agree with Mr Parish that it is very important – that six months is a rather short period. It would be very difficult to produce a substantial report with specific proposals, so we need more time for that.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the issue of cost, not everything can be measured in monetary terms, but I know it is a very important aspect. Animal welfare is a very small part of the production cost. I mentioned earlier that in one of the cases the World Bank studied, with the adoption of a very small number of improvements in the treatment of birds, a farm managed to save USD 320 000 per year. I think that proves that adopting animal welfare policies is only really a cost in the short term; eventually it makes a profit and there is a financial benefit for the producers.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Members again for their support for this proposal, which is a big step towards improving animal welfare in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is also right to deal with this matter at European level. Too often, animal welfare provisions of this sort are thwarted at national level by the argument that ‘if we alone do it, we will put our producers at a competitive disadvantage, and production will simply shift to less scrupulous Member States’. By introducing the same rule across the whole of our single European market, we lessen that problem at a stroke, ensure a level playing field for our producers and protect chickens across 25 countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
