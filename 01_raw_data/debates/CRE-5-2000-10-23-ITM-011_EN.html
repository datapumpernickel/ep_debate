<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Klaß (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>– <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for the fact that we are, after all, to have the opportunity to discuss the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 68/193/EEC on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine, and I also hope that tomorrow’s vote will have a positive outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of area, production and consumption European wine growing is in a leading position globally. In several Member States wine growing represents a significant proportion of total agricultural production, and in many regions this sector is a crucial source of agricultural income. Wine growing frequently takes place in areas in which other forms of agricultural activity would be difficult or impossible. Wine growing is a very varied and dynamic sector characterised by long-established traditions and ancient cultures. The vine propagating material provides the basis for optimal grape and wine production as regards quality, excellence and quantity, and establishes these factors over a period of 25 to 40 years. It is thus extremely significant and it is essential to guarantee optimum reliability in terms of quality and trueness to variety. The trade in, and marketing of, material for vegetative propagation of vines has, up to now, been laid down in directive 68/193/EEC dating from 1968. The directive contains a number of provisions which up to now have allowed Member States to make unilateral exemptions from some of the rules, and the directive has already been amended several times.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the Commission’s proposal for amendments, which has grouped the amendments needed clearly in a single document and has also included new amendments arising from new developments and knowledge: as for example those concerning new types of propagating material for vines produced from herbaceous cuttings and <span class="italic">in vitro </span>propagation. The desired consolidation of the single market is very much to be welcomed. There is an urgent need to change or abolish old or outdated provisions so as to remove existing or potential barriers to trade. As far as I am concerned, French vine propagators should also be in a position to propagate vines for the German or Italian market, and vice versa.</p>
<p class="contents">The specific characteristics of wine production and its further development, in particular in technical and scientific areas, make it essential to stipulate detailed technical provisions which will contribute to the smooth operation of the internal market, improve marketing prospects and also protect the legitimate interests of consumers and producers. Accordingly, the Commission should publish a Community Catalogue of varieties, compiled on the basis of notifications from the Member States. This will bring greater trading security for European wine growers. Many amendments contain a better definition of terms such as ‘genotype’, for example. Accompanying paperwork and controls are important, and the Commission must ensure that only one document is required for each party, wherever they happen to be in Europe. High-quality and healthy vine propagating material is playing an increasingly important role these days.</p>
<p class="contents">The report has taken on a particularly explosive character in the past few weeks. This is because the Commission is proposing to create a legal basis with regard to genetically modified varieties. The Commission proposal refers to Council Directive 90/220, which is to regulate all genetically modified material, as a horizontal directive. We have done the same with respect to forest and plant material. However, the fact that directive 90/220 is still undergoing the conciliation procedure should not stop us from proceeding in taking exactly the same approach with vines as we have done with forest and plant material. All the amendments that are currently being introduced with regard to directive 90/220, under the conciliation procedure, will be applicable to vines at a later date. There is no genetically modified vine propagating material available on the market as yet; however, research is ongoing. The question as to whether genetically modified vines will be granted a permit at some future date, or whether this idea will be rejected by the wine producers and the wine trade, does not form part of today’s discussion of the directive. I am sure we will have the opportunity to discuss these matters at length on another occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive under discussion today guarantees that traditional vine varieties, which are characteristic of wine growing in the different regions, are to be maintained and protected. Traditional wine growing is our strength in the European Union, and so it deserves our support. I would therefore urge the House to assent to the report as it stands, and hope that this will enable the European internal market to be brought into play for vine propagating material. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The revision of GMO Directive No 90/220 is at the conciliation stage right now. It would be completely inconsistent not to wait until the end of this procedure before including references to GMOs in our directives and regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, at the proposal of the draftsman of the opinion, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has unanimously voted to do away with all the references to GMOs in this report. And please do not tell us that we are barking up the wrong tree, and that this revision does not have any implications concerning GMOs, since a regulation of this type already exists for forestry. At the moment, we consume wine, but we do not yet feed on the wood of our forests. Contrary to what the executive committee and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development would have us believe, this revision slyly but irremediably introduces genetically modified vines. This is a clear indication that the European Parliament would, indirectly, give the green light to GMO experiments in the field of vine propagation or improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">Why the rush? It is not at the request of the winegrowers or wine merchants or vineyard owners. On 5 July, some of these issued the Beaune declaration, expressing their great concern at the introduction of GMOs into their sector. We have received a reply from the confederation of producers of registered designation of origin (AOC) wine, saying, “We support the position of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, as it offers the guarantee that European regulations are not going to permit the implementation of procedures to authorise the sale of genetically modified wine-growing materials which may be harmful to the brand image of wine growing.” Just who is going to benefit from this amended regulation which includes GMOs?</p>
<p class="contents">The question – and the answer, of course – will have to come from the Commission, who must also tell us whether it is intending to continue to pave the way for us to end up with GMOs on our plates, and now in our glasses too. This is something that they are achieving, unfortunately, with the assistance of the French Presidency, in a way that is completely out of step with the way European consumers feel. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It now needs to be revised to take into account developments in phytosanitary regulations and scientific and technical progress, particularly in the field of <span class="italic">in vitro</span> propagation.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft text presented by the European Commission, as amended by the European Parliament Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, proposes some interesting advances. I shall cite the most significant here. The current draft rules out any possibility of any of the Fifteen Member States enjoying a unilateral exemption from the terms of the directive. This provision, which was not laid down in the initial version of the directive, is preferable as it makes it possible to avoid barriers to trade and to facilitate the movement of propagation material within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The material produced by <span class="italic">in vitro</span> herbaceous cutting propagation techniques, which by now have been sufficiently mastered were, of course, not covered by the 1968 directive. The new text introduces provisions recognising special characteristics. While research into a propagation material that is more efficient in health terms is of benefit to the user, it is important that this approach does not create a barrier to trade. The draft amendment seeking to guarantee freedom to market throughout the European Union material that complies with the minimum requirements of the directive should be approved unreservedly.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must ensure that the new provisions on genetically modified varieties are in every respect compliant and compatible with existing texts, or texts in preparation, in this field. Should this regulatory mechanism need to be expanded or clarified, it would be preferable to delete the provisions relating to this point from the draft directive.</p>
<p class="contents">We have reason to believe that the new or updated terms of the proposed directive offer a satisfactory response to the expectations of workers in the vine nursery and wine-growing sector and that they should contribute towards improving the quality of the proposed material and make it easier for the competent authorities to supervise the movement of vine cuttings and plants carried out by the institutions responsible for this. The regulations proposed by the directive, moreover, favour the production of diversified plant material by offering the best health guarantees, which is a basic requirement, in order to effectively support the restructuring of the Community vineyard sector, which is a key point in the new COM in wine-growing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The base legislation in force dates from 1968, a long way back, and a great deal of progress had been made in this sector since then: new materials have been tried out, often using natural methods and sometimes genetic modification. Hence the urgent need for a modern regulation which recognises these new possibilities available to European vine growers and, at the same time, protects traditional varieties of vine. It is my opinion that the Klass report should be adopted, particularly in view of the additional guarantees provided by amendments such as that tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development which clarifies the reference to directive 90/220, in the form in which it is going to be amended in respect of GMOs. Another amendment, tabled by Mr Garot and myself, refers once again to the precautionary principle and provides for the protection of those traditional forms of vine which would otherwise be overtaken by new experimental varieties.</p>
<p class="contents">I also feel that, abiding by this precautionary principle, referring to the possibility of genetic modification, means, for example, cutting down on the intensive use of phytosanitary treatments. The amendments tabled by Mrs Auroi and the Chairman of our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Developmen, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf as a further guarantee precisely of experimental varieties, are precautionary.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, I therefore consider that Mrs Klass’ report follows the right lines in a sector which is in urgent need of new legislation, a key, strategic sector for agriculture and the European wine industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Auroi (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what is the point of turning a technical report into a potential oenological disaster. The determination to amend the directive on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine may look like a laudable initiative to update a rather technical text, which is 32 years old. Personally, I find the ’68 vintage rather a fine one, but apparently the Commission has decided to modernise.</p>
<p class="contents">The very first lines of the Klass report clearly stress the value, not just the economic value but also the cultural value, of grape and wine production. Everything, then, could be for the best in the best of all possible European wine-growing worlds.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, as it turns out, that is not the case. The Commission has taken the opportunity of updating matters to open a Pandora’s box, even though this was something that not one European producer was looking for. While the Commission appears to be overcome with combined GMO and cloning fever, Mrs Klass goes further and goes into convulsions, compounding the GMO issue with all the genotypes she sees all around her. It must be said loud and clear, there was absolutely no need to stuff the articles of this directive with references to directive 90/220, which is currently being revised, unless the intention was to promote genetic manipulation in vines at all costs. And please do not tell me that this was done to anticipate this directive’s being revised or because GM vines do not exist except in laboratory experiments!</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, Mrs Klass, listen to the opinions of the experts from the <span class="italic">Institut national des appellations d'origine</span>, the French National Appellations Institute. The INAO has, on the basis of the information currently available, issued a blanket ban on the use of GMOs in any area whatsoever, which would therefore include, and I quote, genetically modified wine varieties and rootstocks. Would you care to read the Beaune declaration presented by the winegrowers of the Burgundy region? Do you wish to show the industry that Europe is working for better quality and respects the precautionary principle? Commissioner, withdraw the recitals and the articles incorporating GMOs and cloning into this draft. Mrs Klass, take out your amendments and let the relationship between GMOs and genotypes be clarified by the scientists.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a second problem area, Mrs Klass. You restrict the practice of grafting to herbaceous cuttings alone. In so doing, you protect what goes on in your own region, but rule out the grafting of hardwood cuttings in the winter period, even though this is the grafting technique that is the most widely used in Europe. This amendment should, therefore, be withdrawn.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, in order to respect the precautionary principle in both spirit and letter, should the articles and amendments which I have just mentioned not be withdrawn, then, as the wine growers themselves demand, we would have to fall in with the opinion of Marianne Isler Béguin, and the Committee on the Environment, and vote against them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There has been some turmoil lately, and I believe the genetically modified organisms will, of course, be inclined to dispute the purport of this directive. But in all fairness, it has to be said that no one is forced to use genetically modified material. It has had no place in viticulture so far. I am fundamentally opposed to genetically modified organisms and am a wine lover, and I would very much like to stick with the wine we have been producing to date. I therefore welcome the fact that we have placed additional emphasis on traditional, regional types of wine.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to genetically modified material, I take the view that the reference made in this report to directive 90/220 secures legal protection. Any prospective changes, will, and must, be made to this end. In addition, Mrs Klass, it is, however, important to stress the political dimension as well as the legal aspect, particularly where viticulture is concerned, and – providing we manage to do so – to keep viticulture free of genetically modified material if at all possible. I hope that the wine growers will have no truck with GMOs, for their own sake, because we know that consumers strongly disapprove. I hope this will inspire us to rule out the possibility of having genetically modified vines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission appreciates the wide consensus on its proposal. Its aim is to strengthen the internal market in the sector in question, to update the legislation in the light of technical and scientific progress which has taken place since it was last updated and to ensure that authorisation for genetically modified varieties can only be granted if the appropriate steps have been taken to avoid endangering human health or the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the third point, in its current form, the proposal contains references both to the development of a specific procedure for assessing the risk to the environment, which is similar to the procedure laid down by directive 90/220 in terms of the risks to man and the environment, and to the criteria and assessment principles laid down in Regulation 258/97 on novel foods and novel food ingredients.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has tabled 26 amendments. The Commission is able to accept the majority of them, that is 24 out of 26 amendments, as they are currently worded or with minor changes relating to the way they are worded or presented. For example, the proposal to recognise the specific characteristics of the genotype, referred to in Amendments Nos 4, 12, 15, 16 and 20, will be incorporated by changing the wording of the text.</p>
<p class="contents">The genetic diversity of the varieties with genotypes which are suitable for specific local environments will be taken into consideration in discussions on the appropriateness of continuing the possibility of marketing material for propagating these varieties, on the basis of Article 3, paragraph 5, point A of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">With reference to the other two amendments, Amendments Nos 2 and 18, we can only partially accept them for the reason that certain aspects are unjustifiably aggressive towards other countries – Amendment 2 – or because the reference to the Commission’s obligation to provide greater resources should a common catalogue of varieties be compiled – Amendment No 18 – is superfluous.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we can accept Amendment No 27, tabled by both Mr Lavarra and Mr Garot. I am happy to be able to inform you that we can also accept Amendments Nos 35 to 40, tabled by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, which are intended to reinforce the transposal of the safety and management requirements according to directive 90/220.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we cannot accept Amendments Nos 28 to 34 tabled by Mrs Isler-Béguin and others, for they would involve revoking the entire part of the directive which contains references to the GMO varieties and the related risk assessment. Moreover, these amendments have already been discussed but not accepted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept Amendment No 41, tabled by Mrs Schierhuber, either, for it concerns an excessively detailed definition in the light of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. If we were to accept this amendment, we would be running the risk of creating artificial barriers to trade, which would be contrary to the principle aim of the proposal for a directive which is to consolidate the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention and, once again, thank you to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
