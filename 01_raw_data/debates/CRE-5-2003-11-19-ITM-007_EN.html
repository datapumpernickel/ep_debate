<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Napoletano (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>.<span class="bold"> </span>– <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, this report deals with three Commission communications: the first has the title ‘Wider Europe - Neighbourhood: a new framework for relations with our eastern and southern neighbours'; the second is the communication entitled 'Paving the way for a new neighbourhood instrument'; and the third is 'Reinvigorating EU actions on human rights and democratisation with Mediterranean partners - Strategic guidelines’.</p>
<p class="contents">In Parliament’s view, this new policy must involve the 25 countries of the Union as it will be soon - in other words, those with which, on whatever basis, full integration with the Union has now been agreed, although at different times - and our eastern and southern neighbours. This is a coherent proposal applying to a complex geopolitical area stretching from Russia to Morocco, which, on the basis of its history, cultural relations and geographic proximity, may be defined as a pan-European and Mediterranean region. It is in this context that Parliament proposes soon to include the south-eastern dimension in this policy, that is, the countries of the Caucasus, and to look a little further in that direction at the other Middle Eastern countries, which cannot yet be included in this strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The report concentrates on the policies to be developed, as we believe that these policies should serve today, for the present time, first and foremost to build a common security area, provided we do not think of security only in military terms. Indeed, we are delighted that relations with neighbouring countries have been placed as the first item in the new security strategy submitted by the High Representative for European security, because our security is their security and this is an area that we can build together. Alongside this, there are a wealth of relationships to build, which should lead us to share with the countries in question mutually beneficial policies founded on a political and institutional dialogue that is backed up with appropriate instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">The report thus establishes a clear distinction between this strategy and that of future enlargement, confirming without any ambiguity the decisions to close the negotiations with Romania and Bulgaria by 2007, to assess by 2004 the possibility of opening negotiations with Turkey, and the prospect of accession for all the Balkan countries. We do not hide the fact in this report that there are other countries, such as Ukraine and Moldova, which make no secret of their aspirations to become members of the European Union. Even though this is not the strategy that will decide their admission, we maintain that taking part in this strategy can only bring this prospect closer and will certainly not make it less likely.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also looks closely at the specific features of such a vast, diverse, complex area. Russia was being discussed just now, and the document expresses our awareness that relations with Russia cannot be confined merely to a neighbourhood relationship. You will find one paragraph, however, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy had no hesitation in adopting, where the problems of democracy and the tragedy of Chechnya are highlighted as currently being obstacles to the normalisation of our relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Action Plans provide the Commission with a flexible instrument for establishing multilateral, regional and bilateral relations with these countries, just as the cross-border instrument will serve not to build walls along the new frontiers but to achieve an understanding and an enhancement of the local dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">The institutional question is also addressed in the report. These countries certainly cannot and should not share the Union’s institutions, but we insist that, in a dialogue between equals, there must be a place for governments, parliaments, local authorities and society itself, and the report includes recommendations to this effect. We also call for the human rights policy to be fully incorporated into this strategy. We believe, however, that there is as yet no fixed European policy on this subject, even though the Commission’s communication makes useful proposals and represents a step forwards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These initiatives, which will be taken forward alongside the existing instruments for relations with these countries, will be tailored to fit the specific circumstances of each country concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the beginning of the year, and even more so during our six-month term of office, the Presidency has been actively following the development of the European Union's new strategic approach to its neighbours to the east and on the southern shore of the Mediterranean. I will, of course, leave it to the Commission to illustrate the potential of this initiative in greater detail; my own intention here is just to make some brief points.</p>
<p class="contents">On 11 March, the Commission adopted the communication to the Council and the European Parliament entitled ‘Wider Europe – Neighbourhood: a new framework for relations with our eastern and southern neighbours’, which describes the new series of neighbourhood policies that the enlarged European Union should adopt with the countries sharing its direct land and sea borders.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the new concept of a ‘ring of friends’ by which the Union offers, essentially, to share ‘everything but the institutions’. The communication also describes the possible measures that could be made available to neighbouring countries as incentives to adopt and apply the necessary reforms that would enable them to benefit from access to the European Union's internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">The new neighbourhood policy will be implemented through national and/or regional Action Plans adopted by the Council on the basis of a Commission proposal. These plans should contain specific objectives and benchmarks, in addition to an implementation timetable for the progressive application of the measures for participation in the internal market. This will enable the Union to assess the practical implementation of these measures periodically. To do this, it will apply an ongoing monitoring mechanism to verify whether the conditions are being fulfilled and to assess the progress made by each individual country towards achieving the objectives set by the new policy, as well as the effectiveness of the Community instruments. In the future, these Action Plans could become the main policy instruments for the Union’s external relations with these countries, and could eventually replace the common strategies adopted thus far.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the work carried out by the Commission and the Council, as the rapporteur has reminded us clearly, these last few months of 2003 will be devoted to the preparation of the Action Plans. In January and February 2004, a series of exploratory consultations will be held with the interested countries, on the basis of which by the end of spring 2004 the Commission will finalise the draft Action Plans for submission to the Council for Ukraine, Moldova, Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan, and Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">The Action Plans that will be put to consultation with the third countries will include five elements: enhanced political cooperation, internal market, JHA cooperation, communication and environment networks and measures to facilitate people-to-people contacts.</p>
<p class="contents">One final point I would like to mention is that the forthcoming Ministerial Conference of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership in Naples on 2 and 3 December will provide an important opportunity to take forward and develop the consultations with our southern neighbours. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has already informed Parliament in detail about the strategy and individual elements of the neighbourhood concept. I do not want to repeat that today but rather to report to you on what has happened in the meantime. Our neighbours have welcomed this initiative, all of them in fact: our East European neighbours, Russia, Ukraine, Moldova and our Mediterranean neighbours. We are already in more or less intensive contact with all of them with a view to achieving this initiative’s objective.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim is to exhaust the potential for cooperation as much as possible while stopping short of membership, specifically in the field of economic cooperation, which we interpret very widely. I must make clear to you that the Commission’s ideas for the long term extend far beyond the idea of a free trade area. We envisage being able to incorporate individual countries fully into our system of economic integration, including the four freedoms: movement of capital, movement of goods, movement of services and movement of persons. That will not happen with every country simultaneously. For some it will take longer than others, but I am confident that ultimately we really will have this large common economic area with more than a billion people and the European Union at the centre.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not just about economics, it is about the environment, it is about cooperation in domestic and legal policy for joint defence against dangers and threats and it is of course in return also about developing political, economic and social reforms in the countries with which we operate this strategy. We are also expecting something from these countries. We are not in a position to be only giving all the time, but we would like in return political and economic reforms, democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and protection for minorities, so that the whole area around us can achieve the same level of political and economic stability, and one day also prosperity, as the European Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I will say very precisely why. Because we would be greatly deceiving ourselves if we believed that things can go well for us in the European Union in the long term if they do not go well for our neighbours. It is therefore in our own interests to ensure that our neighbours can open up. As I said, responses have been positive. In Russia I spoke about it with the president, the foreign minister and many members of the government, the same in Ukraine, I have spoken with a number of foreign ministers from the Mediterranean countries and I will be visiting all of those countries before the middle of next year. The Commission will be presenting concrete action plans for a whole number of countries to the Council by the middle of next year; compared with previous strategies, these will have the advantage of being joint action plans, negotiated documents, which we intend to implement jointly. In that regard it has therefore begun quite well.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also already working on the development of a financial instrument with which we shall also be able to underpin this neighbourhood strategy financially after 2006. We shall after all have to be able to provide financial support for cross-border cooperation between our new Members and our new neighbours on the one hand and among the new neighbours on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful to Mrs Napoletano for her report. We are on the same wavelength. I do still have concerns about one point, Mrs Napoletano, and I would ask you to think again whether it is really wise to say that Turkey and the western Balkan countries should be included in this initiative. With regard to Turkey, I would like to say that Turkey would consider it an extraordinarily negative signal. It would regard it as a downgrading if we were to say that a country which we are currently preparing for commencement of accession negotiations is now included in an initiative expressly intended for countries to which we have not extended any prospect of membership. I must make that quite clear. The countries included in this initiative are not considered prospective members, at least not for the foreseeable future, and in Turkey’s case that would provoke an extraordinarily negative reaction and, Mrs Napoletano, would even endanger the reform process in Turkey. I know you well enough to know that you certainly do not want our policy to halt the positive human rights developments in Turkey. So please think this point over again.</p>
<p class="contents">As to how we should proceed, we agree that it is important that we should make clear to the public and to our neighbours what we can and what we cannot do. We can ensure that enlargement does not create any new borders in Europe. It would not help us at all to re-erect the iron curtain just a few hundred kilometres further east. Neither would it help us, when the Mediterranean countries of Malta and Cyprus have joined the Union, to cut ourselves off from the countries of the southern Mediterranean. We must offer as much cooperation as we can manage in the foreseeable future. But we must also make clear, especially to Russia and Ukraine, that no doors are being closed here, that no unalterable decisions are being taken, but rather that a process is being set in motion which at some point will reach its goal. Then it will be possible without more ado to set ourselves new objectives and reach out towards new horizons.</p>
<p class="contents">At any rate, I think it is very good – and I think we can be proud of it – that we now have an idea, perhaps for the very first time, of the political shape we want to give to Europe and its neighbourhood in the years ahead, that for the first time we have a clear strategic vision of what Europe is to look like and how it is to interact with its neighbours. That at any rate is a great step forward. I am extremely grateful to Parliament for being willing to go the way the Commission has proposed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many points are made, but essentially this is simply about applying the original idea behind the European Communities in a new context, namely identifying common interests to enable the Union and its neighbours to enjoy stability, respect human rights and to face future challenges together.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Verheugen, you have just mentioned strategic visions and that is my first point. We will also have to discuss again whether all of the visions in this paper are actually feasible and that is why we must not neglect to consider what is realistic and what will really happen in practice. I should like to make it clear that there are a whole series of questions that the Committee on Budgets obviously wishes to clarify. Before we initiate programmes, I think that we should consider how well the existing programmes, such as TACIS and MEDA, have worked. I might for example remind you that we still have considerable outstanding commitments amounting to billions in Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean. This also prompts my question about how practicable the ideas are that have been put forward so far.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication explicitly mentions increased financial assistance, but we first need to know how it is envisaged to implement these programmes in practice, and I mean in each individual country, not in general. I wish to make it clear that we support the proposal as part of this initiative to set up a New Neighbourhood Instrument to promote cross-border measures, which are proving problematic because of the different financing instruments that are currently used. In addition, we have said that we think it would be appropriate if at least the CARDS part of funding under such a Neighbourhood Instrument could be financed for example under Heading 7. On the basis of past experience, I think it is also important to explain in detail how the Action Plans recommended for each country differ from the Country Strategy Papers that we have today and in what respect they constitute greater added value.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make one final comment on the European constitution because we discussed it this morning: clearly, at all times in the procedure we must also ensure that Parliament’s right to shape and decide on legislative and budgetary matters is respected when drafting these definitive strategies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This also made it possible for the report to be adopted unanimously in the committee with just a few abstentions. The enlarged EU needs to consider the practical implications of the new problems that will arise in connection with its eastern neighbours because of the new and longer external border. We must also devote the same attention to the southern shore of the Mediterranean. But devoting the same attention does not mean applying the same models of policies and instruments to both the East and the South, because the challenges are very different. The States of North Africa are in general characterised by a lack of democracy, economic and structural problems, high levels of corruption, significant social tensions, high population growth and the danger of increasing Islamic fundamentalism. As a direct consequence of this situation, together with the pitiful living conditions endured by the majority of the people there, we are forced to confront increasing illegal immigration and the danger of terrorist attacks. A further consequence is that the potential for cooperation cannot be fully exploited. We have of course already seen this with the resources that we enter in the budget for the Barcelona Process and the MEDA Programme, which remain unutilised.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to extend the political dialogue with this region, amongst other things by including a parliamentary dimension, something with which we in Europe are of course already familiar in the Council of Europe and the OSCE. My group therefore supports the proposal in this report to set up a parliamentary assembly of Mediterranean countries. I am convinced that this has the potential to engender a new quality of political debate, which will deal with problems and situations of conflict openly and in a different way from the usual government negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">To the east of the new external border, it is true that at first sight the problems appear to be similar: corruption, social tension and illegal trafficking in human beings. The essential difference is, however, that these societies are avowedly in a continuing process of transformation; they see themselves as being in a transitional phase. The path of most of these eastern neighbours will, if they so wish, lead to the EU, regardless of whether we have already officially acknowledged as much by conferring candidate status on them. Contrary to North Africa, this does however give us an opportunity to exert greater influence to develop the rule of law and democracy, foster economic cooperation, extend the infrastructure by building trans-European networks and foster cross-border cooperation, which facilitates the everyday lives of people living on both sides of the border.</p>
<p class="contents">I was rather surprised that the President-in-Office mentioned unprompted the four market freedoms yet again. I would expect this from the Commission, because it is of course in the Commission communication itself, but I had thought that the discussion in the Council would have moved on by now. Sharing everything but the institutions essentially means that we are practically offering membership of the internal market without membership contributions. In any case, I really cannot imagine – even as part of a very ambitious vision – our allowing freedom of movement for workers from North Africa. At least not in my lifetime. I would therefore ask the Council and the Commission not to awaken false hopes. Let us not run before we can walk! I therefore call on the Commission to implement its programme step by step and perhaps concern itself less with visions than with what it is actually possible to achieve in a manageable and realistic timeframe.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wiersma (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I too should like to start by congratulating Mrs Napoletano on the expert manner in which she has managed to marry the overall picture with the detail. In the next few years, we in the European Union will have our hands full with the further enlargement through the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, the integration of the new members from next year onwards, the development of new cohesion policy in the field of foreign and security policy and <span class="italic">bona fide</span> social market economy. The speed of the actual integration will largely determine the discussion about where the EU borders will ultimately be.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore appropriate for this not to be the main theme of the present report and of the Commission’s communication. What is important now is to formulate policy for relations with our new neighbours for the next couple of years, and one thing should be paramount in this. We must prevent a ring of instability from being formed around the enlarged European Union; we should, instead, create a circle of friends. We do not want any new division. This is why we must, from the outset, make Russia central to the new policy of good neighbourliness not only because of that country’s not always equally positive impact on Minsk, Kiev and Chisinau, but also on account of the energy policy and, of course, because Russia is a nuclear power and a member of the UN Security Council. </p>
<p class="contents">When we set out the detail of the new policy of good neighbourliness, we should, as a guideline, adopt the values for which Europe stands – democracy, human rights and a functioning market economy, but this is not just about values. It is important for the EU to extend the area where the same economic rules apply, where the campaigns against international crime and against terrorism are combined, where immigration issues are addressed and where borders are protected whilst remaining open.</p>
<p class="contents">This enlarged Europe must be a security community. The Commission’s proposals form a sound basis for formulating concrete policy with two core elements; more cross-border cooperation, and our neighbours’ participation in the important areas of EU policy, starting with trade. Action plans form a good method of implementing this. It is understandable that countries such as Moldavia and the Ukraine should ask why the Commission’s plans avoid the issue of their possible EU membership. My response to that would be that the EU now has its hands full with what is presently on the agenda, besides which such a membership application is not really in order at this moment. Naturally, those countries have the right theoretically to apply for membership, in accordance with Article 49 of the current treaties, or Article 2 of the proposed constitution. In principle, we should, of course, welcome the EU aspirations of many in those countries, for those are mostly the reformers. What I would like to recommend to my friends in both countries, however, is to make optimum use of the opportunities which new EU policy is about to offer, and to work towards a level at which a credible discussion can be held about an association which can lead to possible membership. We ourselves cannot, of course, give any guarantees, because the efforts will need to come from the countries themselves. We should also, above all, be careful about setting any dates. However, we should also ensure that the European Union does not labour under the illusion that Europe is becoming safer by slamming the door permanently shut. In short, we should not raise any false expectations but we should not turn our backs on the East either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Europe has changed. The map of Europe is growing and this means that we have new neighbours and we are faced with the need to create a policy for this enlarged Europe, the composition of which coincides with the Council of Europe, and also a policy of neighbourhood, and I will refer specifically to the policy which must be created in relation to the countries of the southern side of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">This report does not talk about the free movement of people in the Mediterranean, but it is clear that we must establish cooperative relations with the countries of the south of the Mediterranean, which differ from us naturally in terms of demography and the level of income per capita, based on systems of cross-border cooperation, which can be summed up in four ideas: knowledge of our neighbours, understanding them, trusting them and then, when we trust each other, we will be able to establish cooperation and work together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, there is a general question which I think has also been touched on by other Members.</p>
<p class="contents">Can we reduce all the countries which surround us to the east and south to a common denominator? Can we take the same approach to Russia, which is a major world power, as we take to countries such as Moldova, Armenia, Georgia or Azerbaijan, or as we take to the countries of northern Africa where, possibly, the main question we should raise is that of democratisation? It is a serious question, just as the question of where Europe stops is a serious question. Because I think Mr Verheugen was right to point out that, if we put the Western Balkans and Turkey in this category, these countries will obviously feel undervalued.</p>
<p class="contents">But I see that, in the proposal made by the Commissioner for external relations on the Ukraine, we are discussing the possibility of its future integration. Why not Armenia? Why not Georgia? And why not even Russia, which is also in the area of the European Union and some governments have proposed as much?</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I fear this uniformity. I think that we should find some common rules but, more importantly, that we should formulate global policies for the large entities around us. I repeat that the countries of north Africa need to make a special effort on issues of democracy. We have tolerated the violation of democracy and we have often supported it – remember events in Algeria and Egypt – due to our own strategic objectives and due to the wish for there to be stable regimes, whatever they may be. As regards Egypt in particular, I want to say that there are a great many European citizens shut up in its gaols today and who are paying this price with their lives. So I believe that we need to launch the issue of democracy for these countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This initiative is sensible and necessary, but it has been ill-conceived. Commissioner, you know my views on this. The wider Europe strategy is a mixture of the Barcelona Process and our plans for our eastern neighbours. The result is a collection of instruments that in any case already exist, but there is no strategy – I would reiterate this – there is no big new idea, and that is what we need to structure our cooperation with our various neighbours, each of which has its own particular situation. The neighbours that want to join the European Union themselves have been treated in just the same way as the countries of North Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">No consideration has been given to the real problems that 2004 will bring: the problems at the border, the fact that people are really worried about a new wall being erected, and the fact that there is already good cross-border cooperation there that is not being taken into account. These regions are facing very many problems that stem from the last two world wars. Individual groups are making huge efforts to restore understanding and then an initiative comes along that leaves them dumbfounded.</p>
<p class="contents">None of what is really needed in this region is included in this initiative. I welcome the fact, Commissioner, that you have acknowledged this failure, and the differentiation approach in the Commission document gives grounds for hope. The New Neighbourhood Instrument also contains very good ideas. I think it would be very useful if it could be in place before 2004 so that we can achieve what we need to achieve, which is to give hope to the people on the external border that they are not being forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, general action plans are not enough here. Above all, the Neighbourhood Instrument must be earmarked for cross-border cooperation, because that means something to the people on the ground. In addition, a condition for inclusion in the neighbourhood concept as a whole must be to recognise and apply the democratic rule of law and to recognise human and minority rights. All of the measures must take this into account. I would refer here once more to Parliament’s criticism of Russia. The Chechnya problem is not a secondary issue. It is the central problem in our relations with Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If both our new eastern and southern neighbours can make progress in the field of economic development, security and human rights, this will ultimately be to our benefit. Unfortunately, the proposed policy is somewhat vague in a number of essential, concrete points.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, there is the issue of the common external borders and potential immigration problems. The rapporteur hopes that the new Schengen borders will not constitute any barriers to trade, cultural exchange or regional cooperation. This is a legitimate concern, but we must, above all, ensure that the concept as a whole does not spark off another immigration wave. Given high unemployment and high social costs, that is probably the last thing we need. If we see that, last week, the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, declared in the Burkina Faso Parliament that a wider Europe entails that we, ‘from Moscow to Rabat’ – I am quoting him – will be sharing everything, apart from our institutions, then there is cause for concern.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem is the position of Turkey, for during the discussion of the report in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, it transpired that the Commission does not envisage Turkey featuring in the policy of good neighbourliness, because it is an EU candidate. That is, however, in conflict with the report, which clearly specifies that subsequent EU membership of the participating countries is not in any way ruled out. It should, by now, be apparent to everyone that Turkey’s chances of meeting the accession criteria next year are as good as non-existent. Turkey is not a European country, but it is a friendly country and a military ally. It is therefore of the utmost importance for our relations with Turkey to remain optimal and for that country to be included in the new policy of good neighbourliness from day one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The role of the countries which are about to join the European Union is now crucial in promoting an effective neighbourhood policy with the countries that will remain outside our new borders. Many of these countries also aspire to join the Union; not straight away, as Commissioner Verheugen has said, but the door is still open. This neighbourhood policy certainly depends on us and on Brussels, but it also depends greatly on them.</p>
<p class="contents">As a rapporteur, I have paid close attention to Poland and I have seen how successive governments on the right and left have for years been using great initiative in addressing problems in their relations with neighbouring countries, particularly Ukraine, in the run-up to enlargement. Many Members of this House have already mentioned problems such as cross-border traffic – local traffic that drives a considerable, albeit hidden and underground, economy – and the efforts that Poland has always made to keep Ukraine on its side, on our side, on the side of the West. A short time ago, I was talking to some Polish colleagues who have been pursuing this policy in the Warsaw parliament. In my view, Poland is an example of what the new countries should and will have to do so that those countries that remain outside Europe’s new borders will not feel excluded, as Mrs Napoletano has said.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to mention Moldova, perhaps the poorest country in Europe. As the report points out, we are pursuing a rather inconsistent policy towards it. We should help this country more, both economically and above all politically, to protect it from a growing and worrying Russian influence that is filtering in through the Transdniestrian enclave. This is an appeal that we have heard from many friends that our group has in that country, and one that we very much hope will be answered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am also delighted that Commissioner Verheugen has taken over the wider Europe dossier, because I am convinced that he will oversee it just as successfully as he did enlargement itself.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner touched on a key issue, namely how we should treat the candidate countries in this strategy, the countries that have a prospect of membership. I understand his fears. Nevertheless, I am convinced that the wording that we have chosen is right, and we can certainly continue to work on this.</p>
<p class="contents">This House is divided into three distinct camps on this issue. There are those who say that this is our golden opportunity to bid a permanent, or at least prolonged, farewell to Turkey and perhaps also the Balkan countries as candidates and to push them into a different category. And there is the Commissioner’s proposal to leave them out of this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Napoletano’s report, that we adopted by a majority in the committee – we will of course see what the result of the vote is here in the House tomorrow – rules out neither one nor the other. I understand what the Commissioner said, but we do not know what will be decided in 2004. If, for example, we do not open negotiations with Turkey, then it would be in a different, perhaps even worse position than other countries, with whom we would be reinforcing the wider Europe concept of building good relations with our neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Balkans, which, like Turkey, I know very well, we have countries with whom we are not going to be able to talk about membership for years to come. If, obviously on the basis of the Commission’s work, we can together give Croatia a clear signal that we can negotiate – and I hope we can – then we are actually saying to all of the Balkan countries: there is nothing stopping you joining the European Union if you meet the same conditions as Croatia.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, I think it would be very sensible – and this also supports Mrs Napoletano – for us to involve them in this initiative. It may be possible to create a special status precisely for those countries that have definite membership prospects, so as to make it clear to them that the one does not exclude the other. I fully support Mrs Napoletano’s report, as it stands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the other hand, the report has become too broad in scope and too detailed. The basic problem with it is the way it confuses concepts, which is due to the fact that the Commission has combined the Wider Europe policy and relations with our neighbours in the same initiative. In practice the Wider Europe policy covers relations with our eastern neighbours which are in Europe. Our southern neighbours on the other hand are the non-European countries of the Mediterranean region and the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has endeavoured to clarify concepts with its Amendments 15 and 16. The Union would have a Wider Europe policy which would be supplemented by our policies known as the Northern and Southern Dimension. The new Neighbourhood Policy and the new Neighbourhood Instrument would be implemented in respect of all our neighbours, in the east, south and north. I hope these amendments will be adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, we need to have good relations with our neighbours because it is in the interest of our foreign policy to do so. Secondly, how can this be arranged so that it is commensurate with the interests and capacities of the European Union? These two aspects need to be considered together. We must realise, after all, that to a large extent everyone has their own <span class="italic">clientèle</span> here. How can we develop an automatic procedure to bring these countries – or a number of these countries – almost directly into the European Union?</p>
<p class="contents">If we continue, covertly, to operate the <span class="italic">clientèle</span> system, then we will be well on the way to destroying the European Union, because the European Union cannot cope with this. We are currently undergoing the arduous process of producing a constitution, which may just be capable of setting out a reasonable way to organise the internal affairs of a Union of 25 or 27 countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Verheugen, what will we do with Turkey if it does not meet the conditions for opening negotiations in 2004? Surely in that case we will have to make a second offer, alongside full membership, at least for a certain period of time. That is why I think it is absolutely essential for the wider Europe concept to be improved in respect of our neighbouring countries in Europe, making it a ‘European Economic Area plus’. This would create a second multilateral ring of countries with whom we maintain close relations, but where full membership is not the only option. This consequence of a multilateral order has not so far been elucidated sufficiently clearly by the Commission. We must ensure that this also includes those countries whose future may lie in the Union, but which will not be able to become members of the European Union in the next ten years, for whatever reason, and we must ensure that they are not left out. This applies to some of the countries of the western Balkans, just as it does to Moldova, Ukraine or, for example, Turkey, if a decision of the kind that I have just described were to be made next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously this also means that we need another strategy, but one that is equally weighty – I do not wish the Members from southern Europe to misunderstand us – for the Barcelona Process and the Mediterranean countries. The objective in this case is not to provide a possible opening to membership, but to forge a close neighbourly relationship of a different nature. In any case, the discussions so far both in this House and in the Commission have lacked the necessary systematic approach that will make this a viable policy in practice.</p>

It is and must be in the interests of the EU to have balanced neighbourhood relations along all its external borders.</p>
<p class="contents">A major challenge for us is that we do not build a fortress around us whilst strengthening shared values and the workings of the internal market. That is why the approach outlined in the communication on Wider Europe, with its emphasis on interdependence, is especially welcome. We must not limit growth in prosperity just to the area within the Union’s borders. Promoting democracy, good governance, human rights and sustainable development in its neighbouring countries works to everyone’s benefit. On a practical level, border region cooperation will open up new opportunities for investment and innovation on both sides and will reinforce direct cooperation between people. This will increase regional prosperity and stability.</p>
<p class="contents">We should follow the example set by forms of cooperation that work, such as that which exists between Finland and Russia, and for neighbourhood policy to actually get some wind in its sails we have to set aside adequate resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, as the PPE-DE Group's shadow rapporteur for the Ukrainian section, I now believe that sufficient differentiation has been achieved in Mrs Napoletano's report to produce a politically coherent document which provides a constructive approach through action plans for the challenges which lie ahead over the next five years as we digest the economic and political consequences of a Europe of 25 countries and as the EU borders move eastward.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome the recognition of Ukraine's potential for eventual membership and the mention of Article 49. This could equally apply to Moldova, which is desperate to be given a helping hand by the EU to sort out the Transnistria question <span class="italic">and</span> be granted access to the stabilisation and association process. Russia will be key here and I welcome the recent summit which aims to develop our relations with the strategic partner country through a series of four common spaces.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I strongly condemn human rights abuses in Chechnya, I believe we have a vested interest in a stable Russia under the firm leadership of President Putin and a common cause in fighting international terrorism. However, with due respect for the rule of law, it is a pity that criminal law is being used to rein in the power of the oligarchs, whereas a financial settlement to redress the questionable privatisation of the early 90s would have been far preferable.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome extending the remit of the EIB to the Western NIS. Belarus remains a problem, but we must engage in limited but constructive engagements in areas of mutual concern. I was delighted by the fact that my budget amendment to increase funding to the victims of Chernobyl was passed by this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I agree with Mr Gahler that European public opinion would not support freedom of movement for the peoples of north Africa for the foreseeable future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The excellent report by Mrs Napoletano shapes an interesting political strategy framework for the actual area encircling the European Union. This strategy allows both planning and objectives; at the same time, however, it maintains the flexibility needed for each area around us, based on its peculiarities.</p>
<p class="contents">Our basic priorities are predicated on good relations, peace and economic and political cooperation. We entertain no thoughts whatsoever of new walls or new divisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission document proposes the economic element. The report by Mrs Napoletano proposes the political element, which means initiatives for peace in the Middle East, the Caucasus, the Balkans and elsewhere. However, as the European Parliament, we too can take initiatives by stepping up our efforts. Within this framework, I believe and I propose that, as it has done in order to cooperate with other regions, the European Parliament should appoint a joint parliamentary committee with the countries of the Black Sea Cooperation, which already has a parliamentary conference, intergovernmental cooperation, a development bank, a permanent secretariat and, most importantly of all, to which 13 countries belong. They include members and candidate members of the European Union, the countries of the Caucasus, the Balkans, Russia, Ukraine, Moldova and, generally speaking, countries with a particular political interest in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In a year or so, Bulgaria and Romania will join, and membership negotiations are being entered into with Turkey and Croatia.</p>
<p class="contents">This has given rise to increased interest in the EU in the world around us. We can expect new applications for membership and new requests for close cooperation in the future. I think we should be proud of this interest in participating in European cooperation. It also means that we can support, and make demands upon, surrounding countries so that they respect human freedoms and rights, comply with the principles of the state governed by law and observe basic economic principles of free trade.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally do not understand the talk of European borders now needing to be defined. The EU must, in the future, be open to new members from our part of the world, irrespective of whether or not they follow old school maps’ demarcation of the European continent. With modern technology and telecommunications, the Bosphorus, Gibraltar and the Caucasus are becoming evermore imaginary frontiers, while, in other parts of the world, freedom, human rights and democracy – and, naturally, their opposite, oppression – are becoming evermore real for us all.</p>
<p class="contents">Moldova is a small and poor country in the EU’s future border area. I believe that a proposed stabilisation pact comprising Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova would not be a successful solution. Moldova belongs historically and culturally to South-Eastern Europe. It is my hope that the Commission will try to establish a form of cooperation with Moldova that takes account of this and opens the way to future Moldovan membership of the EU once Romania and Bulgaria have joined. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today our great Europe needs to have the vision of a neighbourhood policy, in the East and in the South, and I am grateful to Mrs Napoletano for her report, which provides many ideas. We have a whole arsenal of instruments with which to put flesh on the bones of this neighbourhood policy: economic, political and technological. We should also use the other institutions, the Council of Europe and the OSCE, which have a contribution to make to this neighbourhood policy. I believe that a strategy of neighbourhood agreements for individual countries or groups of countries might be helpful, like the Schuman declaration of 1951, only then it was for coal and steel. It is a model that we can still use today for sectoral agreements with our neighbours. A technological agreement with North Africa on solar hydrogen, for example, would be of huge importance for both us and them.

Firstly, differentiation, which is of course a key component of the Commission proposal. Our approach is based entirely on differentiation, which means that each country is treated individually. It is not a multilateral project, but a bilateral one, tailor-made for everyone, and that is why Russia is not treated in the same way as Libya; that would simply be impossible and quite frankly it would be foolish even to attempt to do so. This also means that the scope and substance of the common ground will vary quite considerably, at least at the outset. At some point in the distant future it may be possible for all of the trains to call at the same station, but for a long time there will be differentiation. Obviously, the idea of our concluding a free movement of workers agreement with the countries of North Africa in the foreseeable future is just as inconceivable to me as it is to Mr Gahler. But no one has mentioned this possibility either.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is this: several speakers complained of a lack of conceptual clarity and consistency. I am rather surprised by this. I think that the concept is actually quite clear. We want to have a policy that is designed for all those countries that will be our next-door neighbours after enlargement, whether through shared land or sea borders. As Romano Prodi rightly said, these countries stretch from Russia to Morocco. Obviously it would be an easy matter to draft an overall strategy for all European countries and all neighbouring countries outside Europe, who are not Members of the European Union, by quite simply combining the strategies and policies that are already in place – in fact I could do this over the coming weekend if you wished. But it would do nothing to change the fact that we would have to apply different instruments in the western Balkans and Turkey, for example, from the ones that we need to apply in say Libya or Syria, because our objectives in respect of the western Balkans and Turkey are quite different. Mr Brok’s attempt is honourable, and I will not hold it against him either – I know exactly what he wanted. Mr Brok will certainly agree with me when I say that writing an alternative to accession for Turkey in a formal Council or Commission document at this stage would amount to announcing the end of the common strategic approach. You can certainly demand this, Mr Brok, but the Commission is unable to comply.</p>

There is talk of a ‘Common Space’, but with no common construction. We are, indeed, a long way from such a space, listening to Mr Prodi talk about political <span class="italic">rapprochement</span> and progressive integration into the economic and social structures of the European Union. The question may be asked as to whether the word ‘neighbourhood’ has not replaced that of ‘partnership’. The EU’s objective is the integration, pure and simple, of these countries into the sizeable European market, but without any financial compensation in terms of the aid from which the candidate countries for accession benefited, even if the conditions were drastic and unjust.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect is that the Commission’s entire communication is characterised by a very security-minded approach to relations. This is far from the hope of an EU open to the world. Freedom of movement for goods and capital, but not for people, is not only inhumane but also totally illusory and cynical.</p>
<p class="contents">If the EU wishes to respond to the expectations that continue to be placed upon it by many peoples and to establish a notion of the world radically different from that of the United States, there is every reason for forging new links with our neighbours, particularly our Mediterranean ones. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
