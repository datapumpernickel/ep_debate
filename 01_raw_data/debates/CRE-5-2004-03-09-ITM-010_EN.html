We are able to complete the programme and thereby guarantee that young people and youth organisations will be able to implement their programmes. This has been a very intensive period and we have again been under pressure of time. I would like that to be different for new programmes in the future, so that we have a bit more time available for more precise elucidation of the individual positions and more opportunities for discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">What this is primarily about is supporting youth groups, something that must be of particular concern to us if we want to build up confidence in Europe or in the European Union, for then it is young people who best understand Europe and who are least likely to have problems when it comes to abandoning their prejudices. Because that has to be encouraged, they also have to be got more involved in the European process. There are various ways in which this can be done: one central office is the Youth Forum, which maintains contacts in the various countries and does many difficult, necessary and useful things alongside young people, enabling them to live in democratic association within Europe and beyond it.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are debating three reports; although this is a joint debate, they cannot all be considered in the same way, as their substance has to do with different responsibilities, which need to be taken into account appropriately. It has been proposed that the action programmes be harmonised as regards the long-fought-for share of cofinance, the principle of degressivity, and their duration. It will, no doubt, be very difficult in practical terms to have them running until 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had lengthy talks about the 20% equal share in cofinance, which will not quite work, as several organisations, especially in the educational sphere, get such minimal support that further cutbacks would mean that support would effectively lapse. For youth organisations, then, the figure 20% is just about acceptable, as finding sponsors is a recurrent problem. Businesses are unable to devote themselves to young people on top of the economic situation. Organisations in many other areas of activity find it significantly easier to find sponsors than do those dealing with young people, which is why the latter need our particular support.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like degressivity, according to which two and a half per cent of the previous year’s grant is to be retained from the third year onwards, to benefit the groups and youth organisations that have not been covered by that date. This will become particularly important in the aftermath of enlargement. After 1 May, there will be more young people for us to reach. We have to invest more and we have to give them strong support.</p>
<p class="contents">Those youth organisations whose aim is to advance international dialogue among young people and to present information on relevant topics to as large a young public as possible are also conduits for the European Union’s views. What matters is not just promoting young people’s interests, but also communicating material that relates to what they are interested in. Whilst we have to take their interests into account, they also themselves have to make their own contribution and thereby further reflect the whole range of European policy to their fullest extent. The future of the European Union is in the hands of young people, and we should not forget that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pack (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, today’s debate on these three much-needed programmes finds us seeking a common legal base for the areas of culture, education and youth. We have had a concertation procedure – I am grateful for the very fine support we got from the Committee on Budgets in that – and now we have some fairly substantial financial resources at our disposal. We could, of course, do with more – these are, after all, areas in which we are dealing with the public, and in particular with young people – but we can be satisfied with what we have. As far as my own area is concerned, I can tell you that EUR 77 million for the action programme for educational institutions is not a trifling amount, but, again, we could do with more.</p>
<p class="contents">Within all three of these areas there are institutions and associations that are, putting it in the broadest possible terms, educational and cultural ambassadors for Europe and which promote awareness of Europe’s common cultural heritage. For years, often with the help of this House, all these organisations have been doing their work. Without them, Europe’s soul would atrophy even more than it is apparently slowly doing now. I am especially glad that Mrs Iivari has been able to gain acceptance for the idea that cultural institutions should be able to retain their subsidies, at least for a transitional period of two years. Among other things, this is an acknowledgement of these organisations’ work. They can then prepare themselves for the applications they will have to make in response to future invitations to tender.</p>
<p class="contents">It is at this point that I would like to stress that we MEPs are of course closer to the public than are those who sit in the Commission in Brussels, and so it is a fact that we are more aware of what the public needs.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three points I would now like to make. As for the first, I would like to take this opportunity to shed more light on the Financial Regulation. Under no circumstances must the lawyers’ mania for regulation be allowed to obstruct our striving for greater transparency and efficiency in our political work on the ground, and I know that the Commission suffers from it just as much as Parliament. The Council, having absolutely no interest in such things, does not, but the problem is that we have the impossible task of defending these things on the ground. Let me just say, with reference to this, that this Financial Regulation and the Commission have now – to take just one example – wrecked the network of Europe Houses that has existed for 50 years. There is a place for that in this debate. I also want to point out that in respect of neither 2003 nor 2004 has the Commission been able to pay to this network the sums of money that this House allocated to it. It is refusing to do so. It is not Mrs Reding who is to be blamed for this, but others; the point simply has to be made that it is the Commission’s fault.</p>
<p class="contents">It may be that the Financial Regulation that we now have was necessary. The only thing is that it cannot stay the way it is. We have to recognise that a rigorous, not to say fundamentalist, interpretation of this Financial Regulation gives rise to a bureaucracy that distances the public even further from the EU. How are members of the public meant to submit applications if they have to get a consultant to do it for them? It is scarcely credible that all these things should have become so complicated. We must not allow ourselves to be taken hostage by a sort of budgetary imperialism. We should make a real attempt at changing something, and, in the new parliamentary term, join with the Committee on Budgets in finding a new approach.</p>
<p class="contents">We are neither an assembly of managers nor a board of directors seeking the maximum in bureaucratic efficiency. Rather than being either of those things, we are a political assembly, and our principal task is to respond to the European public’s desires and needs. It is for that reason that I believe we have to make it our business to ensure that money is spent properly, but we must not allow ourselves to be tied into a corset that nobody will find it easy to get out of.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that we expect more from the soul of Europe, and so future budgets need to take more account of education and culture.</p>
<p class="contents">The third, Commissioner, has to do with the new generation of educational and cultural programmes that you want to speak about today. My expectation of this new generation of programmes is that they should include manageable instruments, by which I mean action at Community level that is capable of being practically implemented, equipped with operational and financial resources in line with what the public want. Everything we do must focus on the public, and let me once again stress that they must not be used as a justification for bureaucratic machinery. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A decision on the issue must really be taken now, so that the organisations that are entitled to funding receive their grants starting this year. I wish to sincerely thank all those whose cooperation in conciliation led to our success at the end of last year. Terence Wynn, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and many others helped enormously. My own collaboration with the Commission and the Council has gone well at the various stages of the process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal for an action programme to promote bodies active in the field of culture became necessary when we switched to an activity-based budget. The cultural organisations, which were formerly financed out of Budget Line A signifying administrative expenditure, need a legal basis for their funding to continue. With the compromise arrived at in conciliation, financing will now be based on a period of three years. During the first two years there will be compliance with the decision made by the Committee on Budgets last autumn regarding beneficiaries, which is to say earmarking; the third year will see a switch over to open application. The legal basis now coming into existence will also permit the financing of the work of the European Bureau of Lesser-Used Languages and the Mercator network, as well as concentration camp sites as historical memorials. The programme’s total budget is EUR 19 million.</p>
<p class="contents">When the Commission proposal was being discussed it was evident, for example in the view of all the institutions’ legal services, that the earlier procedure, in which Parliament mentions organisations to receive grants by name, does not accord with the new Financial Regulation. I myself am also in favour of the open application method as a matter of principle. Parliament is a legislative body and it is not for us to name individual beneficiaries. It does not meet the requirements of transparency and good administrative practice. Parliament lays down guidelines and evaluates decisions made by the Commission on the basis of reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Having worked closely with European cultural networks for almost five years, I am convinced of the European added value they produce. It is immensely important that experts and creative people who work in or for museums, cultural administration, art colleges, schools, the theatre and music have an opportunity for cooperation. I believe that cultural networks have an important contribution to make to the success of European enlargement. They are not only important heralds of the diversity of our common European cultural heritage and civilisation but also creators of new ideas. I believe that now that we are finalising a legal basis for funding for three years we can get off to a good start by making sure of the survival of European-wide cultural networks. I am very pleased that the importance of European cultural and educational cooperation is being highlighted in the Commission proposal as a new financial framework in the building of Europe’s future. My warmest thanks and congratulations go to Commissioner Reding for that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Reding,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, new obligations under the Financial Regulation adopted in 2002 are the reason for our debate today. This new Financial Regulation now provides a clear legal framework for the subsidies we give to a large number of leading European organisations in the fields of culture, youth and education.</p>
<p class="contents">There will now have to be a legal base for all funding decisions. That is of course a step forward and I am pleased about it, while noting, as Mrs Pack has said, that there are some perverse effects and I very much hope we shall find solutions in talks with the budgetary services of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The changes that have been made led the Commission to present proposals for a new legal base in spring 2003. Those proposals concerned in particular the fields of culture, youth and education. They sought to ensure a smooth transition between the old system and the new, and we have tried to ensure the necessary continuity while being irreproachable in terms of the proper use of public funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Today I am grateful to the European Parliament and to Mr Rocard and his committee in particular for recognising the urgency of the matter and allowing the Commission’s proposals to be examined quickly. It seems to me that the most important matters have now been settled and I am therefore pleased that we are moving towards a compromise, which shows the European institutions’ determination to find a solution as quickly as possible when that is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">For want of a legal base, we have in fact been in a legal vacuum since 1 January 2004 with regard to organisations whose know-how and creativeness are well known, organisations which the citizens need if they are really to be able to operate in a European way. The part played by those bodies is irreplaceable: they help to make Europe loved and to give Europe a soul, as some Members have so rightly said.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore all shown common sense in finding solutions that will enable us to put an end to uncertainty. I believe everything is now in place to close this file and I would like to point out that the Presidency has sent three letters to the chairman of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport informing him that the Council is open to reaching an agreement at second reading on the basis of the common positions so amended.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s position on the amendments contained in the various recommendations is as follows: so far as the proposal in the field of education and training is concerned, the Commission is able to agree to the three amendments voted by the Committee on Culture at second reading because they bring major improvements to the way the programme is implemented. So far as culture is concerned, the five amendments seeking to make the text compatible with the Financial Regulation and to take account of budget conciliation also meet with the Commission’s agreement. So far as youth is concerned, the proposed amendment introducing a transitional clause into the legal base in order to extend the period of eligibility to 1 January 2004 to take account of expenditure made during the period of legal vacuum also has the Commission’s agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore fully approves Parliament’s amendments, Mr President. As you see, there is no more ambiguity and I will therefore end by thanking the rapporteurs, Mrs Iivari, Mrs Pack and Mrs Prets, for the quality of their work and above all for the spirit in which they undertook it. Thanks to you, ladies, we will be able to continue our very important work with European organisations that bring the Europe of citizenship to life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One may be a qualified teacher, but what can you do without resources, without money, especially at European level? The Council of Ministers occasionally shows greater generosity towards European projects, but it is difficult for it to do so because, as we know, with subsidiarity education normally remains a national matter.</p>
<p class="contents">However that may be, if I am speaking on my own behalf and not as a Member of the European Parliament, if I am speaking as a former history teacher, I recognise that while money is indeed important for education there is something even more important. As Mrs Reding would say, education is also about training and the mind. Everyone here today, including those in the public gallery, was once a child and went to school and we can all remember good teachers. We forget the bad teachers and remember the good ones. What is a good teacher? It is someone who loves his subject, who also loves his pupils and also, of necessity, their families.</p>
<p class="contents">This report by rapporteurs Pack, Prets and Iivari is very important and I pay tribute to their work. It is not the end of the story, however. The end of the story would be that the generations that come after us should perhaps be able to achieve something that goes beyond what our regional and national systems can give. From our point of view as Members of Parliament, members of an EU institution, there is room for culture and education at European level. I hope that this report will be well received by the Council of Ministers and that teachers and pupils will thus be able to expand their minds a little. Culture and education are neither regional nor national nor European, they are all three at once. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to thank the three rapporteurs most warmly for having done a good job so quickly. I see it as giving cultural, educational and youth organisations the important message that this House has powerful advocates to plead their causes. If I may now speak on the area in which I have been heavily involved, with the White Paper on Youth, the new youth programme and the old one, I have to say that, as a result of their increasing contacts through the recent consultation processes, youth organisations and the European Youth Forum have had their expectations raised very high. I believe that young people are very satisfied with the good legal basis for financially supporting over 80 youth organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Compared with other policy areas – cultural policy, say, or education – the youth programme is so poorly endowed that we end up allocating less than one per cent of the overall EU Budget to this area, and that, in the long term, ladies and gentlemen, is no longer acceptable. The public want to see the European Union reflecting their own interests. This is an area into which we must breathe life.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, the geographical dimension, which we must always have at the back of our minds when supporting youth organisations, is about more than the enlarged EU. It has to be clear to us that the European Youth Forum, as an umbrella organisation for youth, also works with the countries belonging to the Council of Europe, where it performs an important role as a political intermediary. Youth associations, let me say, are always a bit ahead of the other organisations. Young people think further ahead; they perhaps have a clearer view of their own future than do people like us who are immersed in day-today living and in the business of politics.</p>
<p class="contents">This explains the cooperation with the CIS, and the programme’s importance in terms of peaceful political development in the Mediterranean is not to be underestimated either. With regard to the elections on 10-13 June, too, I can only say that we have to persuade young people that Europe is the right place in which to take their political ideas further. Today, then, is a good day for us to adopt these three programmes, after which we can have a bit more clout in the Budget negotiations and, where forthcoming youth programmes are concerned, look further into the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The purpose of these is to provide institutions and organisations in this area with financial support. The European Parliament’s budget has been used, in accordance with the A-30 lines, to support certain institutions, and NGOs that function on a voluntary basis in particular, which have promoted European activity and strengthened European identity. Over the years grants for organisations have become established to the extent that their allocation has been something that former recipients of aid have taken for granted. Selecting which organisations and institutions should receive financial support seems to have been a remarkably arbitrary process. New operators have said that inclusion has been very difficult, as the selection criteria have been vague. The choice seems to have been influenced more by the fact that the organisations selected have had strong advocates on the relevant parliamentary committees than by the quality of their operation being superior to that of others. This detail received attention when the Financial Regulation was being reviewed, with appropriations earmarked in the budget headings finally being cut or cancelled.</p>
<p class="contents">The legal package now under discussion will create a legal basis for grants to organisations active in the fields of education, culture and youth work. The aim must be for the forms of financial assistance from the European Union to be transparent and properly justified. This means that grants to organisations that are repeated and taken for granted should be few in number or they should not exist at all. Organisations and institutions have to demonstrate clearly that they are centres of excellence and better than others in the field. Funding must be based on applications assessed impartially and fairly. Financing has to be channelled in a way that clearly defines those targets the achievement of which the EU supports, and any recipient of aid must produce a credible report on the use of funds. I wish to thank the rapporteurs, Ulpu Iivari, Doris Pack and Christa Prets for their excellent reports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the ten years I have been in Parliament I have had responsibility either as the budget rapporteur or the shadow budget rapporteur for the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, often working very closely with Mrs Iivari. I wish to concentrate mainly on the culture report. She and I are broadly in agreement on the principles. Perhaps we would differ to a certain extent in that I have always thought the parliamentary procedure for supporting activities is very open and transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">I also attended the conciliation meeting just before Christmas, when we hammered out the new legal base. I want to pay tribute both to the Commissioner and to the Commission staff for their support, as also to the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, who was extremely supportive.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just make three key points. Spending on cultural activity is important. I totally agree with the Commissioner: Europe has to be, and is, about more than economics and trade. The activities of organisations such as the European Youth Orchestra, 'Swinging Europe', the European Forum for the Arts and Heritage – I could carry on – all help people to understand not just culture but also the cultural dimension of Europe and, through that, the European Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that the Culture 2000 programme is grossly under-funded. It is also restricted by its own terms, and many organisations that need help at a European level and have been turning to Parliament will now be able to use this new legal base. We cannot expect the Member States to fund cultural activities of a European dimension – they will concentrate on the national dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">Culture funding is too small – that has been said before. Nearly 50% of our money goes on agriculture – I make it less than 0.5% on culture. But culture is an important wealth creator: 17% of UK GDP comes from the creative industries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have to ensure that organisations that receive funding support get the information in good time, so that money is spent efficiently as well as effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Youth Forum and Jeunesse fulfil an important role in empowering and engaging young people in civil society, which is so important. They also provide young people with an environment to learn democratic decision-making, intercultural understanding and self-motivated learning. Likewise the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages and Mercator have both played, and will continue to play, an important role in safeguarding and promoting minority languages in the European Union. Their presence and work is especially needed now that 10 new countries will join the Union and further enhance the number of existing minority languages. There are 40 million minority-language speakers now. Six million other people speaking minority languages will join.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial that the speakers of these languages enjoy the same rights and possibilities that have been available to everyone else. I welcome also the measures to increase transparency in the decisions to allocate grants to organisations and also the user-friendliness of the grant application process which at the moment is far too cumbersome. Nevertheless I regret that in the case of youth NGOs the principle of degressivity remains in the common position, which will mean that the reduction of their funds from the third year onwards will make things rather difficult for them. Guaranteeing a regular budget for these NGOs would be the best way to support their activities and increase their effectiveness in future. I very much hope that these excellent reports will be endorsed by a substantial majority in Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These programmes, which naturally the European Commission, Parliament and Council must be involved in, must have, firstly, the relevant legal basis, and that is moving in the right direction and, secondly, an adequate budget. And that is what we in the European institutions must do next in relation to European youth, education and culture.</p>
<p class="contents">I have often said in this House, and I will not tire of doing so, and today I am going to say it again, that the future of Europe lies in its youth. It cannot be any other way. And the future of Europe is going to depend very much on the education received by these young people. Although in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity education is not our responsibility, we can make a great and very positive contribution to the creation of a more united, knowledgeable, cohesive, cultured and educated Europe; this is what we all want. In the end this will benefit all Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore ask that, when we have finished the battle over the legal basis, amongst all of us we begin the battle to increase the budgets for youth, culture and education until they receive the sums they truly deserve, because that will benefit all of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
