I should like to thank Mrs Thors and Mr Turmes for their excellent work within their respective committees, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and the Committee on Industry External Trade, Research and Energy.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim is to find the right balance between two elements. On the one hand, there is competitiveness, environmental protection and consumer protection, within the context of sustainable development. On the other, the various environmental issues related to products. It is important to guard against passing problems from one area to the other. There must be an integrated approach to the issue. All the Community institutions must work together too. That is the way to ensure the co-legislators can agree to mandating the Commission with regard to the adoption of measures to be applied to specific products.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to highlight the main features of this proposal. As its title indicates, the proposal is aimed at improving the environmental behaviour, what could be termed the Eco-design, of energy-using products. The free movement of products meeting the requirements, the protection of the interests of consumers and the competitiveness of our economy are essential, however.</p>
<p class="contents">We appreciate that the correct implementation of these proposals could prove extremely beneficial to all parties. There are a number of reasons why this could be the case. Industry will be motivated to improve the environmental characteristics of products with a significant capacity for self-regulation. Thanks to the large market in investment and design improvement, fragmentation of the market will be avoided and investment will pay off. Further, the measures will be aimed at swift compensation for the consumers and will take account of the nature of the market in the enlarged Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This is probably the first time that a proposal provides a consistent global legislative framework thus avoiding thematic legislation. The latter can sometimes prove contradictory. Integrated product policy aims to avoid risks of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">Energy consumption is one of the main ways in which products interact with the environment. I am glad this has been emphasised in the discussions in the various committees charged with considering the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the institutional dimension of this issue, we propose moving from codecision to comitology to deal with specific products. This is because we feel it is a flexible way of handling technical matters. I have in mind for example rapidly-changing technologies and arrangements for consulting stakeholders. I could also mention the development of self-regulatory alternatives for a range of products that is, in our view, too wide to be dealt with through codecision. It would be too slow and therefore less efficient to attempt to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall comment in detail later on the amendments the House is to table. At this point, however, I should like to say how very constructive I feel the debates in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy proved. Particular congratulations are due to Mrs Thors, to Mr Turmes and to all the rapporteurs, for trying to reach agreement at first reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Thors (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Madam President, Commissioners, it seems to be ladies’ night here this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of eco-design is to integrate technical possibilities when they are at their greatest. More than 80% of environmental damage is determined at the manufacturing stage of a product. We learnt this whilst considering this Directive. We also know that the EU has adopted many rules to eradicate dangerous substances. We have rules on waste management with quantitative targets for recovery and reuse. It was a relatively natural course of action, then, for the committee to lay a certain emphasis on energy consumption, in particular, in its consideration of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a point of this, as strong criticism seems to have been levelled at our work, stressing the energy aspect. This is against a background in which energy consumption has continued to increase substantially in most parts of Europe, and many Member States are having difficulty meeting the Kyoto objectives. New tools for saving energy are important, therefore. Latest reports in my home country indicate that it is set to exceed the CO2 emissions quota for the 2005-2007 period by 14%.</p>
<p class="contents">Criticism has also been levelled at the ‘top-runner’ approach that we have used here. I believe, however, that there is a great deal of misunderstanding about what we mean by this. We want the leading and best technology as a yardstick for future implementing measures. This forms a framework for decisions, but does not exclude anyone from the market. On the contrary, I think that we have a system that leaves scope for continuous improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is also criticised for not having heeded the three pillars of sustainable development. It is said that we have given priority to the environment at the expense of social and economic issues. That criticism is wrong, and I think that this is self-evident if one studies what we say about the life-cycle approach and our support for small- and medium-sized enterprises. We are aware of the economic issues, the social issues and the possibilities, but also the risks.</p>
<p class="contents">When all is said and done, early attention to environmental issues, as the Commissioner also said, is more economical than many other methods of environmental governance, for instance subsidies, and also labelling, unfortunately. It has become apparent that we obtain very little value for money from subsidies at the intervention stage.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out that, just as we did when we were considering the Green Paper on Integrated Product Policy, we have given our support here to measures applicable to SMEs. We also call on the Commission to establish a database in order to facilitate the incorporation of the life-cycle approach and eco-design into the activities of all enterprises. This is an innovative concept. The scope is broad, but in actual fact what we have here is an organised regulatory framework for how to proceed, how to choose what is important and how to set requirements in the future: the prototype for good governance, in other words.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been no objections here in Parliament to the fact that the European Parliament will not in future be determining how much energy a product should consume. On the contrary, we are saying that this will be determined where there is the expertise. In my opinion, what we are proposing is an important simplification.</p>
<p class="contents">Self-regulation also has a role to play, in Parliament’s view, but only if it produces better, faster results than would the regulated procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, although I did not quite catch what the Commissioner said at the end, I do not think that this Parliament will at any rate be able to reach agreement with the Council at this reading, and that means we lose a fair amount of time. We had wanted to make faster progress, and we want the Directive to define a work plan, including for the products that are responsible for 40% of carbon dioxide emissions. We want to proceed quickly, as it is our opinion that much time has been lost.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank my fellow Members for their constructive cooperation on the preparation of this report. I should like to express my thanks for your understanding when I took over from Mrs Ries, who became Belgian State Secretary for European Affairs. I should also like to thank the Commission for its goodwill in wishing to reach a speedy agreement with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that we have been very united, and that has been a great strength. Our views still differ on a number of small points, for instance with regard to the legal basis and conformity assessment, but we shall not let the details obscure the fact that we have been united. Parliament wants rapid progress and wants to implement the necessary measures promptly. I hope that the Council, and Parliament with the new Members elected after us, will be able to reach swift agreement on this so that there is no further delay to these important measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This offers the single largest potential in respect of climate change, and also the most immediate potential because turnover times for such appliances are sometimes two to three years and at most ten to fifteen years, which is much quicker than for energy infrastructures. It also represents the cheapest potential, because the additional money spent on upgrading a design is more than compensated for by reduced electricity costs during its life cycle.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the European Union is lagging behind other economies, such as Australia, the US and Japan. Even China now performs better on standard-setting than the EU. We are pleased, therefore, that the EU Commission has come forward with this proposal and that Parliament was able to strengthen the proposal. A good eco-design directive is important not only for Europe but also for the world. There will soon be between 500 and 700 million new middle-class citizens in India, China and other such countries, so the single biggest challenge for the world economy is to be able to offer efficient demand-side products, such as appliances and computers. Otherwise we can simply forget about climate change. This also constitutes a huge opportunity for European industry because it will open up an enormous market. Unfortunately, sections of European industry have been lobbying for a weak directive. Why? These are the same industries that want to delocalise production to India, China and similar countries. This shows that the same industrialists who do not care about the global environment also do not care about creating added value and jobs in Europe. I hope the Council will not give in to these lobbyists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liese (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, cutting the amount of energy used by appliances is to everyone’s benefit. It benefits the environment, enabling us to meet our Kyoto targets faster and more cheaply, and it benefits the consumer, because he saves on his electricity and energy bills. It is also an opportunity for industry to put innovative products on the market, especially if we have uniform standards here all across Europe. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats therefore greatly welcomes the European Commission’s proposal and we expressly thank Commissioner de Palacio, for her commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the other groups, however, we would like a few changes to the Commission’s proposal. We want greater clarity about what the Commission will actually do with these powers in the next few years. For that reason, we would like a list of products that will be subject to implementing measures in the first few years if there are no voluntary agreements to achieve the same objective faster. We want the text to contain fewer vague legal terms, and above all we want very strict supervision of the market; that is a priority for the PPE-DE Group. We cannot have a situation, with this or other matters, where honest people eventually lose out, where a person who only applies the EC mark when he really keeps to the rules is punished because others stick the mark on without complying with anything. That is why there must be extremely severe penalties. We must have better controls and the requirements must be such that they actually can be controlled.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be ambitious, because only then will there be no motivation for individual Member States to go beyond the minimum standards. That is why we are being flexible in the matter in voting for the two legal bases tomorrow if the aim is ambitious, and the Council’s reaction discourages me a little here. I am very disappointed that the Irish Presidency and the Council as a whole are being so hesitant. It will encourage individual countries to go it alone. I do not think that is a good thing. We need common European standards, and I must personally say that in my ten years’ work in the European Parliament I have seldom seen the Council behave so destructively or a presidency handle a matter so badly.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal to the Council and above all to the Irish presidency, which unfortunately is not represented here today, but perhaps someone can pass the message on, to be guided by Parliament’s amendments, at least when working on the common position in June. If they do not do that, if the Council simply ignores these amendments, then we will have a rag bag of national rules, we will miss the Kyoto targets and consumers will continue to waste money unnecessarily on power and energy. Then the Irish presidency will have failed on this point. Its last chance is to really follow Parliament and I strongly appeal to it to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has taken on a very difficult and highly complex dossier at relatively short notice. Coordination in the European Parliament has not suffered at all as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already heard a large number of good arguments this evening for why it is so important for our environment and for the creation of incentives for industry that we should adopt this directive quickly. I therefore share my fellow Members’ disappointment that no agreement was reached with the Council at first reading. I understand that it is of course a very difficult dossier for the Member States, too, but we in the European Parliament have shown that, despite starting from very different positions, it is possible to come closer on very important issues.</p>
<p class="contents">One point on which we have not been able to agree and where tomorrow’s vote will show what the European Parliament’s position is, is the question of the legal basis. For me, it is quite clear from the title of this directive that environmental protection is one of its priorities. That is why I do not find it satisfactory to take only Article 95, the internal market article, as the legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want a good environment and energy policy, it makes no sense to put Member States that are more advanced or have stricter requirements in a particular matter on a leash and shackle them. I know that the debate between those present has already been closed, but I would like to underline once again here that I and my group think it is very important to have two legal bases if there is to be a better environment and energy policy in the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can hardly think of legislation more likely to cause concern to some manufacturers than that which indicates in such detail how they will make their products and what minimum standards of energy they must achieve, with lots of detailed specifications still to come, appliance-by-appliance, determined by the comitology procedure and very much out of the public gaze.</p>
<p class="contents">How do we justify interference in the private market on such a scale – interference and the setting of standards that go far beyond health and safety requirements? I believe that the potential benefits of energy-saving, of making more efficient products and of reducing carbon dioxide emissions speak for themselves. I am concerned that in an attempt to reconcile the different requirements of Member States – between hot countries and cold countries – the Commission may come up with compromises that set standards well below the best that can be achieved. I urge the Commission to be ambitious.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a positive move. In selling it to citizens and consumers alike, there is a simple message: by cutting energy use we can help them save money and we can all contribute to do our bit to save the planet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have talked in broad terms of the importance of this report and the importance of the global effects it might have. But let us look at one small issue and how this report could affect it: let us take a look at ink-jet printer cartridges, probably one of the most widely used products in the world. The reality is that all the large manufacturers are using every trick in the book to prevent consumers getting a fair deal, at the same time undermining the need to improve energy efficiency, which is a crucial element in protecting the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The manufacturers need this legislation to make them do the right thing. There is big money at stake here. On average a refill cartridge can be sold for about half the price of a new product, and the consumer should have the change to reap the benefits. We need amendments in this report to ensure that those cartridges are refilled.</p>
<p class="contents">Research carried out by organisations such as the Consumers' Association has highlighted the kinds of tactics adopted by some of these big-name companies. For example, the installation of microchips which suggest that cartridges are empty and even in some cases stop printers working, when in fact they have plenty of ink left. This is a waste of resources and a waste of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Surveys demonstrate quite clearly a variety of different costs of different printer operating systems, all brought about by operators using these methods which oblige the consumer to buy printer cartridges over and over again, instead of reusing and refilling.</p>
<p class="contents">If we can build into the new eco-design legislation a requirement that cartridges must be refillable and recyclable, it will be a major step forward in both protecting the rights of the consumer and benefiting the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Congratulations are also due to Mr Turmes, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. I should like to thank both honourable Members for their work and contributions to the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I certainly believe that what we are concerned with here is a major initiative. It could have a real impact on the aim of decoupling growth from increased energy consumption. Significant savings in energy consumption can be made. I agree with the honourable Members who pointed out that presenting an overview of the whole process is the best way to avoid deluding ourselves. After all, there is no point in economising in part of the process of creating a product or in part of its useful life if the end result is a negative overall balance.</p>
<p class="contents">A detailed list of the Commission’s position on the various amendments will be forwarded to the Presidency<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Nonetheless, I should like to say a few words on some of the issues raised and discussed in the course of the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall deal first with the question of Council approval. I would like to make it clear to the House that I had hoped this text would be agreed with the Council, and I did my best to ensure agreement, as this would have enabled the text to be adopted at first reading. The fact is that when it came down to it, the Irish Presidency encountered serious obstacles to achieving our objective the first time round. Nonetheless, I feel it is very likely that this text will be adopted at second reading, should it prove impossible to adopt it at first reading. As many honourable Members have pointed out, the matter is urgent. It is essential to put this new Community regulation in place once and for all. In addition, comitology procedure must be launched. The procedure needs to be sufficiently flexible to adapt to subsequent change and technological development. It must also be able to provide an appropriate response on more specific matters.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of comitology and lack of control by Parliament, I should like to remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that we are party to global generic agreements concerning good legislation and the institutions’ capacity to forge links between themselves. I believe these agreements provide sufficient assurance that there will be no deviation or real difficulties regarding the implementation of these measures.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the legal basis, Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has confirmed that Article 95 of the Treaty is the only appropriate legal basis for this proposal. I endorse this view, and hope you will too.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the key issues I wished to mention. I must emphasise the urgency of adopting this measure. I very much hope that by the time we meet again in June, the Council’s common position will be as close as possible to the proposal put forward by Parliament itself. Adoption of the text at second reading should then be fairly straightforward, always supposing it is not adopted at first reading. I hope adoption will be possible as soon as the new Parliament assembles. The text certainly needs to be adopted before the end of this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
