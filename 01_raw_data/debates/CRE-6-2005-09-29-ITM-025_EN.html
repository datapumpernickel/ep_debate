<p class="contents">The day before, a Hungarian girl from Subotica/Szabadka made a shocking discovery. Ready for school, 13-year old Klementina Sötét opened the front door on that Wednesday morning, 15 September 2004, only to find what she thought was blood on the door. Klementina recoiled in horror and ran back inside. Upon closer inspection, the word ‘dead’ was written on the door in red, Cyrillic letters, and a 35 cm knife had been stuck in the middle of the door. The words ‘Hungarians, you will die’ were written on the freshly painted walls of the house of the Sötét family. As far as I know, the Sötét family is currently living in a refugee camp in Hungary, as they could no longer bear the anti-Hungarian atmosphere in Vojvodina.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now a year down the line, but, sadly, not much further down the line metaphorically speaking. In its report last month, the Hungarian Human Rights Foundation reported that since an EP fact-finding mission has been based in Vojvodina since the end of January, no fewer than 32 new incidents have taken place, with minorities specifically targeted. That is depressing for sure, particularly for the Hungarian minority who live there. For this House, though, this is an extra reason to take up their cause openly, and not just in the defensive sense of prevention and penalisation of ethnic expressions of hatred in Vojvodina.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is just as much in favour of a positive interpretation of the rights of national minorities. That is why I stand by the questions I put to the Council and Commission a year ago: What is the situation on language teaching and other cultural facilities (including newspapers, magazines and other media) for the Hungarian minority in Vojvodina? And how much money is the Serbian Government earmarking for public facilities for this specific ethnic group?</p>
<p class="contents">It has already been announced that this House will be conducting hearings on the political situation in Vojvodina, and I am looking forward to them. This is a splendid initiative by our Delegation for South Eastern Europe under the inspiring leadership of Mrs Pack, who chairs it. That way, the Serbian authorities will also find out that the European Parliament will not agree to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between Brussels and Belgrade until such time as Hungarians and other minorities in Vojvodina can live in a truly democratic, constitutional state. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When we were in Vojvodina at the start of this year we spoke with politicians and other people affected and also put forward proposals for how such regrettable events might be prevented and healed. My written enquiries to government offices in Belgrade six months after our visit produced only evasive answers.</p>
<p class="contents">Something needs to be done both in the educational system and about the composition of the police and judiciary, however, if the situation is to improve. One factor in the increasing incidence of atrocities may be large-scale immigration of Serbs from Kosovo and Croatian Krajina into parts of Vojvodina formerly dominated by national minorities. All politicians in Vojvodina and Belgrade should therefore be anxious to condemn this, to urge their offices to show the utmost vigilance and to use the forthcoming talks with Serbia and Montenegro to ensure European funding is used to help the national minorities in particular to get their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, the European Parliament has increased resources for Serbia and Montenegro by EUR 8 million. I would like to point out, however, Mr President, Commissioner, that the Hungarian Government also has a definite obligation to join with its neighbours, Serbia and Montenegro, in addressing these problems. Let me say once again that I want to revive this Vojvodina, which is a model for the coexistence of national minorities; that is in Serbia’s interests and it is in the interests of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a result of that, there was a slight temporary improvement. The Serbian leaders do not deny or play down the incidents anymore, but express their regret and distance themselves from the incidents. Meanwhile some of the culprits have been arrested, but have not been sentenced yet. Unfortunately however, the events of recent weeks and months are alarming again. There are more and more incidents against ethnic minorities and assault attempts against leaders of Hungarian organisations. All these indicate that there have been no real changes in Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">The promises made by the Serbian Government have not been kept. It was promised that there would be more Hungarian policemen in Vojvodina. This has not happened. It was promised that there would be a swift and efficient administration of justice in these cases. This has not happened. It was also promised that two committees would be set up to investigate these incidents and reduce the tension between ethnic groups. This has not happened either. The grace period is almost up. The Serbian leadership must understand that there will be severe consequences if they are unable to guarantee the safety of their citizens, or to safeguard order and fundamental rights. Just like Mrs Doris Pack said, there must be consequences. Both in terms of the financial assistance granted to Serbia and in terms of signing the stabilisation agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">With my fellow Member, Csaba Tabajdi, we proposed to increase the support granted to Serbia in the next year. Mrs Pack has also referred to this. However, this trust on our side is not unlimited and not unconditional. If there are no real changes in Vojvodina next year, we will have to propose consequences reflected both in the EU assistance granted and in the stabilisation agreement, as our common objective is to ensure that Vojvodina becomes once again a province of ethnic cooperation and ethnic peace.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When in 1918, Hungary was treated as being on the losing side in the First World War, it had to relinquish not only areas mainly populated by other nations, but also essentially Hungarian areas such as the northern part of Vojvodina. Since its transfer to Serbia in 1918, Vojvodina has become more and more Serbian, and other groups have either moved away or have been driven out. Since 1989, the autonomy of the large Hungarian minority has also been greatly curtailed.</p>
<p class="contents">After a string of violent conflicts in the states of former Yugoslavia between 1992 and 2001, everyone had hoped for the peaceful co-existence of the survivors. Sadly in Vojvodina, where bridges were bombed but no ethnic war was waged, non-Serbs were once again bullied by their neighbours. Serb refugees from Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo have now moved into the houses of those who can no longer hold their own in Vojvodina.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not even so much a case of violence being deliberately organised by the state; it is clear that ordinary citizens are engaging in violence and intimidation wherever there is a predominant sense that many of their own people are excluded by state boundaries and that many others who used to be considered as occupiers, have stayed behind in their own country.</p>
<p class="contents">In Serbian public opinion, many consider the Serb residents of the north and east of Bosnia and of the north of Kosovo to have been administratively cut off, and wrongly so, from the motherland. By way of compensation, attempts are being made to completely Serbianise the areas that are recognised as Serbian territory. Anyone who opposes this notion is regarded as an enemy and associated with former Turkish, German, Hungarian occupations.</p>
<p class="contents">With the proposed resolution, we are confirming the anxiety that was expressed a year ago. We should, however, not forget that both Serbs and Hungarians will need to be better protected by clear and widely supported agreements on linguistic rights, autonomy and administrative boundaries. That is the only way to prevent future outbursts of ethnic hatred in and around Serbia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, we do not intend to isolate Serbia but it has to keep to its undertakings. Serbia and Montenegro cannot come closer to Europe without that. The fact-finding mission led by Mrs Pack was very positive, but only managed to bring a temporary improvement as the situation has not actually been settled. Therefore it is crucial that in the spirit of today’s resolution the European Parliament – as well as the Commission and the Council – continuously checks and monitors the violation of minority rights, and it is even more important that we do not just accept resolutions but see some actual improvement at last.</p>

This is not about disputes between two distant nations or ethnic groups but about an extremely serious series of attacks against native national communities, especially against Hungarian people. Additionally, these communities are integral parts of European Union nations, such as the Hungarian or Slovak nation, or of nations awaiting EU accession, such as the Romanian or Croatian people. The European agreements also recognise the importance of protecting these ethnic groups, which means that the principle of European solidarity expressly applies to them. It is an offence against the EU itself if in some countries people cannot use one of its official languages on the streets or with their visitors or parents in prisons without being physically insulted. On the other hand, these communities intend to attain their goals with peaceful political means. However, past experience has shown that in the Balkans this method is not as effective and impressive as the use of weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union wants to avoid the failures resulting from its behaviour in the early 90s, it cannot encourage the punishment of the unprotected. As mentioned in the resolution, Vojvodina has lost its autonomy, and failed to regain it during the five years following the fall of Milosevic, although the autonomy had operated successfully before 1989. This means that a considerable part of the preconditions for a normal rule of law is missing. Therefore there is a great discrepancy between the reports of official bodies about the continuously aggravating situation and incidents and the reports made to civil organisations by the people affected. As far as human rights are concerned, we have learned that the manner in which the people suffering the attacks judge their situation and react to insults is more important than the manner in which these incidents are reported by the official bodies which have completely lost the trust of the minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the resolution and taking into account the political responsibility of the European Union that I had pointed out in February this year, not only the European Parliament but also the Commission and the Council must react and make clear to the Serbian leadership that this situation cannot continue. With regard to this, I had suggested that the High Commissioner for Foreign Policy should look into the incidents taking place in Vojvodina as well as the causes of those incidents; also, the English Presidency should see the reality at last, and the Commission should call the Serbians to account for the lack of preconditions for a rule of law – and not only on paper but also in reality. The responsibility of EU bodies is also considerable because we have been made to believe that we are going in the right direction just because certain favours have been granted in exceptional and individual cases, which in themselves are not a bad thing. No, I believe that instead – after analysing the motivations of each of these serious incidents – we should force Serbia to provide a future for minorities living within the Serbian community. Despite the one-sided and good-intentioned messages, it would be an invitation for further crimes if we increased the amount of support provided from the EU budget, opened our agricultural markets and started accession talks against our principles. We should not allow ourselves to be blinded by institutions existing only on paper and polished reports – instead, we should wipe the blood of our very nations from our faces and prohibit further bloodshed. Reconciliation after aggression has always resulted in tragedy, especially in the Balkans.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The clear violations of the rights of the Hungarian minority are largely due to the activities of the influx of Serbs displaced from other parts of the former Yugoslavia. Oppression breeds oppression. The Hungarian people are an ethnic minority with a fine history and splendid traditions. Sadly, they have become the main scapegoat, although there are others.</p>
<p class="contents">Our approach to Serbia must change if justified appeals like the one we are making today are to have any impact, and not be merely a sop to our consciences. At the risk of making myself unpopular I will now say that Belgrade should be presented with a clear and detailed programme aimed at gradual integration. I mean gradual integration, not in the immediate future but not in the far distance either. Such a programme should be tabled and the access of Serbia and Montenegro or the access of Serbia alone to subsequent stages of integration should then be made conditional on full respect for human rights, including the rights of minorities. This is the only strategic solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A tremendous amount of money is going to Serbia. The minorities who are oppressed there include not only Hungarians and Croats, but also, sadly, Czechs, Germans, Slovaks, Poles and many other nationalities besides, who for centuries formed that prosperous miniature Europe that Mr Meijer described so impressively just now.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore all in the same boat, so to speak, and as Europeans it is our duty to help the many minorities in that country. At present, this flourishing miniature Europe is being systematically destroyed by a nationalistic policy that begins by undermining autonomy, thereby striking not only at the minorities but also at Vojvodina’s long established Serb community, which has always been in favour of reform. Weakening Vojvodina’s reform-minded European Serbs is what these measures are actually intended to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is a deliberate policy of settling immigrants in the minorities’ communities in order to destroy those communities by quickly getting a new Radical Party mayor elected and suddenly outvoting the established population.</p>
<p class="contents">The teacher training colleges – for which we have given money – are not being established, with the flimsy excuse that the region is unable to set up any accounts.</p>
<p class="contents">All these things are unacceptable. They are trying to drive the young generation of minorities out of the country, to force the administration into line with central government and to create a nationalistic atmosphere in which the minorities take flight.

They will have their impact on and consequences for the Council, the Commission and the targeted groups. That is why we proposed this successful initiative a year ago here in Parliament, to pass a resolution concerning Vojvodina in order to call the attention of European institutions to the atrocities and intimidation suffered by Hungarian people and to request that the Serbian bodies do not tolerate and therefore do not encourage such acts.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to be regretted that one year on we still have not made any progress. The intimidation is continuing, the harassment and severe mistreatment of Hungarian children has become an everyday act. There is graffiti abusing native Hungarians. This is happening despite all the promises made as a result of official letters, parliamentary visits and ad hoc missions. Therefore we have to propose again to return to this issue. We have to be consistent, and the Commission and the Council must also be consistent. We cannot accept the fact that a neighbour state of the European Union, the Belgrade Government – receiving millions of euro especially for the promotion of tolerance – tolerates this aggression and encourages an atmosphere of fear by never finding the offenders guilty, while being especially austere – I would say cruel – when it comes to punishing Hungarian youngsters.

The Commission has the authority to investigate thoroughly any ethnic incident and effectively promote good inter-ethnic relations. We appreciate that the authorities have condemned the ethnic incidents that have occurred and we concede that these incidents do not amount to any form of gross violation, nor are they backed by the Belgrade authorities. Nevertheless, we are convinced that the authorities have often been late and negligent in investigating reported incidents. The fact that the perpetrators of violent acts and harassment are neither identified nor brought to justice creates a climate of impunity, which unfortunately can foster further incidents and increase the feeling of frustration and insecurity among the minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the law enforcement agencies and the judiciary are often failing in their duties. Let me stress that this is a sign of a much wider problem. There is an urgent need in Serbia to reform the police, to make it professional and accountable, and to reform the judiciary, which needs to become efficient and truly independent from undue political pressure. These reforms are key for the protection of the rights, not just of minorities, but of all citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with the recommendations issued by the European Parliament after the fact-finding mission of last January, we have urged the authorities to take concrete measures in the field of police and judicial reform. This includes the need for more adequate representation of the minority communities in these institutions. Nobody needs a police or judiciary based on ethnicity, but it is certainly true that a better and more qualified presence of personnel coming from the minority communities could improve their functioning, by facilitating communication with citizens in their mother tongue. It would also increase the trust placed by citizens in the State.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at the incidents that have been reported, very often they involve youngsters. This shows that there is an urgent need for the authorities to take measures in the field of education, as recommended by the European Parliament. Schools can play a key role in preserving the cultural richness of a region like Vojvodina and in helping young people take full advantage of that richness, rather than withdrawing into nationalist isolation.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that often the youngsters involved in or supporting these incidents are the children of people displaced because of the wars of the last decade. The influx of displaced persons has sometimes changed the ethnic composition of the regions. There is no simple solution to this issue and we should seek to prevent people who belong to the Serbian community but are often themselves in a very precarious situation, including from a socio-economic point of view, from turning their frustration into violence.</p>
<p class="contents">The authorities still have much to do. It is also important for cooperation between Serbia and Montenegro and its neighbouring countries to be intensified in the context of their bilateral agreements. This is particularly true of the agreement between Serbia and Montenegro and Hungary.</p>
<p class="contents">We appreciate the initiative of holding a European Parliament hearing on the situation of the minorities in Vojvodina on 13 October. This will offer an excellent opportunity to discuss the issue directly with both the authorities and the representatives of the minority communities.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, the Commission is continuing to monitor respect for the rights of the various ethnic communities in Vojvodina, as well as in the rest of Serbia and Montenegro. In the feasibility report issued last April the Commission concluded that Serbia and Montenegro were adequately meeting the criteria – including the political ones – for the opening of stabilisation and association agreement negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Commission drew the authorities' attention to a number of issues, including respect for human and minority rights. Respect for these rights is indeed an integral part of the political criteria for the stabilisation and association process and it is an essential element of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. The way a country treats ethnic minorities and the quality of the relationship among them are important indicators of democratic maturity. A country aspiring to come closer to the European Union needs to show such maturity.</p>
<p class="contents">During the stabilisation and association negotiations process, the Commission will continue to monitor respect for human and minority rights, as well as the other requirements related to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. In this regard, let me stress that we would be failing in our duty if we looked at the situation of only one minority in one region of Serbia, however important it may be. We need to pay due attention to all minorities and in particular the most vulnerable ones, such as the Roma.</p>
<p class="contents">The progress report on Serbia and Montenegro due to be published next month by the Commission will also review respect for human and minority rights. At the same time, the Commission will continue to support Vojvodina with financial assistance, although there is no specific programme targeting the province as such.</p>
<p class="contents">Vojvodina has benefited as much as the rest of Serbia from EU assistance. Let me mention just a few examples. A contribution of EUR 40 million was made to the reconstruction of the Sloboda Bridge, which will be opened in October. The support given to small and medium-sized enterprises amounts to EUR 8 million worth of credit. In addition, the two neighbourhood programmes with Hungary and Romania were launched in January 2005. I am confident that strengthening the relations between the EU and Serbia and Montenegro, through the conclusion of the Stability and Association Agreement, will help consolidate democracy and the rule of law, which will also be to the benefit of the ethnic minorities. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
