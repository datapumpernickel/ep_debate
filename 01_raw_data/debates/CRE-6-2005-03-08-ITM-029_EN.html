<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kyprianou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, human tissues and cells have become an important part of healthcare. Their therapeutic use continues to increase, not only in terms of the frequency of use of tissues and cells, but also in the range of ways in which they can be used.</p>
<p class="contents">Tissues and cells are often acquired through cross-border exchanges. Over the past decade, the interchange of these human substances, both within Europe and between Europe and third countries, has increased. The fact that the exchange of tissues and cells can result in the transmission of disease has focused attention on the need for increased safety measures. The European institutions responded to this concern by adopting a directive in March 2004 establishing quality and safety requirements for human tissues and cells. The directive ensures that an increasing number of patients in Europe treated with human tissues and cells can trust that these substances are safe and of good quality. That constitutes yet another step forward in fulfilling the mandate in Article 152 of the Treaty, which is to set high standards of quality and safety for substances of human origin.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive has to be transposed by 7 April 2006 in all Member States. On that date, it must, therefore, be applied in all Member States, including the United Kingdom, and will also be part of the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span> to be implemented by Romania under the enlargement process.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to underline a key point. Article 152, upon which the directive is based, aims to regulate public health issues. As was made clear during the debate in Parliament leading up to the adoption of the directive, although fundamental ethical principles can be raised and endorsed, it is not possible to have binding Community regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of voluntary unpaid donations of tissues and cells, this was debated at length during the codecision procedure on the tissues and cells directive. I know it was an important issue for the European Parliament and I believe that a good compromise solution was reached. Article 12 of the directive states that Member States shall endeavour to ensure voluntary and unpaid donations of tissues and cells. Donors may receive compensation but this is strictly limited to making good expenses and inconveniences related to the donation. In that case, Member States define the conditions under which compensation should be granted. Both the Council and Parliament accepted this solution. It goes to the limit of what the Commission believes to be legally acceptable, given the provisions of Article 152 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not mean, however, that the directive is unclear on the conditions of exchange of tissues and cells. On the contrary, Article 12 conveys a very clear message as to the voluntary and unpaid character that such exchanges should have. This, of course, refers back to values that go beyond safety issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, the Commission considers that paying substantial fees to obtain human egg cells would go against the philosophy of the tissues and cells directive. It could open the door to a trade where people in need could be drawn into acts that should instead be motivated by altruistic principles. Both the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine of the Council of Europe prohibit turning the human body and its parts into a source of financial gain.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will monitor carefully the implementation of the tissues and cells directive in the current and future Member States. We will do so with regard to its banning provisions and also with regard to the overall spirit of the directive, such as the principle of voluntary unpaid donation, clearly expressed in Article 12.</p>
<p class="contents">To ensure proper interpretation in the candidate countries, the Commission organised a peer review in Romania and Bulgaria in 2004. This review analysed the situation in the two countries and identified future actions to be taken to ensure compliance with EU requirements in this field. This process led to a number of recommendations. The competent authorities of the two countries are willing to incorporate the principles of the directive into national legislation. This will be followed up this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is conscious of the importance of encouraging the voluntary and unpaid donation of tissues and cells of high quality and safety. That, in my opinion, is the best way to avoid illicit trade. In this respect, the Commission also considers it very important to encourage Member States to incorporate the principle of voluntary and unpaid donation into their national legislation. Tissue and cell donation programmes should be founded on that basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sums are being mentioned that are higher than half a year’s salary for Romanian women. If that is true, then that is in contravention of the European Directive establishing quality and safety requirements for human tissues and cells, as the Commissioner pointed out earlier. After all, the directive provides only for the reimbursement of costs and compensation for any inconvenience, which the amounts quoted would considerably exceed.</p>
<p class="contents">Last Thursday, I issued a press release on this subject, and on Monday, I found an <span class="italic">e</span>-mail in my office here from the Romanian embassy and a report from the British Government. Romania informs, and I quote: ‘The Global Art Clinic which was performing illegal’ – I repeat, illegal – ‘fertilisation and collection of egg cells was shut down by the Government. The situation is currently investigated by the Prosecutor's Office’. The British Government reports that their organisation responsible for this, the HFEA (Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority), launched a full enquiry and was unable to prove that anything untoward is happening there. The ban that applied during the enquiry has been lifted and the organisation has meanwhile reported an increase in the applications for egg cell imports.</p>
<p class="contents">Egg cell donation is not without risks, and women have to sign a declaration that they are aware of these. Why would women donate with so many risks if they do not receive any remuneration? When you open the Global Art Clinic’s website, you go from one surprise to the next. It is a postal order company for babies. You can get sperm flown in, with which an egg cell from a Romanian woman is fertilised. You can select according to age, education, length, hair colour and such like. The embryo is then sent by courier to the future parents to be implanted.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask the Commission the following questions. Firstly, the reports from Romania and the United Kingdom are conflicting. Is the Commission aware of what is happening there, on what scale, the level of remuneration involved and whether what is happening contravenes European legislation?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, according to the Global Art Clinic’s website, its largest market is the US, Israel and the United Kingdom. Can the Commission find out whether there are also customers from other Member States or EU candidate countries and whether such practices exist in other candidate countries against payment?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the directive on the use of human tissues and cells must be transposed into national legislation by April 2006 at the latest. What is the Commission doing to ensure that remunerations do not exceed the remuneration of expenses incurred and any compensation for the inconvenience?</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, could the Commission give an overview of the relevant regulations, including amounts, in the different Member States and candidate countries? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We would like to point out that Article 3 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights prohibits making the human body and its parts as such a source of financial gain. The removal of egg cells is not an insignificant procedure and requires major treatment that involves a great deal of pain. Also, when a woman is forced by poverty to sell her eggs, she becomes easy prey for organised criminal networks.</p>
<p class="contents">Egg donation, like organ donation as a whole, needs to be tightly controlled and monitored in order to protect people in fragile situations and prevent human beings from being exploited for their eggs. I regret that the Greek initiative framework decision concerning the prevention and control of trafficking in human organs and tissues has not yet been adopted by the Council. This framework decision prohibits commercial transactions associated with organs and tissues of human origin and also clearly defines the offences so that trafficking in human organs can be punished. The differences between national legislation create a favourable environment for criminal networks that exploit these differences.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore ask the Commission what the existing measures are and what measures are envisaged to prevent a new form of exploitation of the female body. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am delighted about this on this International Women’s Day.</p>
<p class="contents">So what exactly are we talking about? Previous speakers have already mentioned that we are talking about the existence of a clinic in Bucharest, Romania, which specialises in the donation of egg cells to European Union citizens, in particular British citizens, in return for financial payment: an average of 150 pounds sterling. This is the crux of the problem, because, Commissioner, this evening you will hear this amount referred to as payment and as fair compensation. This is not just a subtle difference, but in truth it is a philosophical conflict on this very sensitive issue of donation and that donation being free of charge. This also applies to organs and to the two directives previously adopted by the Union concerning the quality and safety of blood and that of tissues and cells respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">So, in the case of this Romanian clinic, is there or is there not payment and therefore trade in egg cells? The British national authority, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, following a detailed enquiry into this matter, concluded that there was no proof of payment.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore asking here today for the Commission to clarify this issue. Does it, Mr Kyprianou, have new facts in its possession from Romania or other Member States of the European Union?</p>
<p class="contents">While I am on this subject, I think that it is important, before the entry into force of this directive concerning tissues and cells, for the Commission to present us with a report on the national legislation, on the donation of gametes and the payment systems in this area established by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">On these matters of research and ethics, the ALDE Group is very clear: it is not Europe’s job to harmonise ethics; subsidiarity must prevail and the countries that take a conservative position on this cannot prevent Europe from doing research on stem cells in order to respond to the hopes of millions of patients in genetic and cell therapy. This is why, following our internal debate this evening, we will vote against paragraph 11.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, priority needs to be given to the common interests of donors and patients, in terms of access to these specific treatments, but also, of course, quality and safety at both ends of the chain.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the way to ensure safety and quality in gamete donation specifically, as in blood donation, is not only through it being free of charge but also through ensuring availability. You just mentioned, Commissioner, the need for the Member States to include the issue of voluntary and free donation in their legislation. This type of medical tourism would perhaps be avoided if the Member States of the European Union also agreed to deal transparently with the issue of the principle and the amount of this compensation. I am referring, as you did, to the compromise that was reached following epic debates, which is in Article 12 of the directive: paragraph 5, a crucial point of our resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Many Member States are perfectly aware of this and have already opened up the debate on this issue, like in Great Britain. In a nutshell, Commissioner, the objective of this text is for us to fight unfailingly for solidarity and quality, and against shortages, trafficking, and all trafficking that women in particular can be victims of. To conclude, I will refer to the first point in our resolution and the fundamental texts of the European Union. The human body is inalienable and cannot be a source of profit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that it will become clear whether the Commission is serious about the values laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, such as human dignity, or whether it turns a blind eye to violations. Does the Commission sit back and hide behind the Member States, or does it actually expose the contradictions? How is it that the Commission is unable to explain to us today why, on the one hand, the British Government is maintaining that this trade did not take place, that no payments were made beyond mere compensation, and why, on the other hand, the Romanian Government has shut this clinic down? You have not given us any explanation for this today.</p>
<p class="contents">Are we to understand from this that you do not take this point seriously, that you have let yourself be lulled into complacency by these soothing assurances, or are you prepared to really look into these items of evidence? They are innumerable – derived from the Internet, from journalists, from other documentation – and make clear that payments were made. Mr Kyprianou, common sense should make you ask yourself what reason there could be for these Romanian women to supply egg cells to British clinics, of all places, free of charge: something that after all entails a serious health risk to themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">What I should like is for the Commission to take this debate more seriously, for it not to hide behind assurances or behind the resolution. We are familiar with the draft Directives. As guardian of the Treaties, it is your duty to ensure that there are no ethical cluster bombs of this nature lying around in the European Union. You have to ensure that they are shown the red card. I do not just mean by Parliament, as we plan to do with our resolution; it is also your duty, as the European Commission, to send out a crystal-clear signal that trade of this nature is prohibited, and that the Commission will do everything – absolutely everything – to put an end to this violation of human dignity. The Commission must also give a real demonstration that it is serious about this, that it is carrying out its own investigations and perhaps even engaging its common sense and contacting the Government of Romania: which is after all a candidate country. It must also make clear to the European public that trafficking in human beings and trading in human body parts are prohibited in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us not be lulled into a false sense of security, because different messages come from different governments.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen the many-faceted wealth of invention that exists when it comes to exploiting women’s bodies. Many hours ago, today’s debate concerned the Fourth World Conference on Women. Many Members of the European Parliament, the Commissioner responsible and the Council’s representatives condemned the trafficking in women that was then being debated. Now, many hours later, the debate again concerns plans further to exploit women’s bodies through the egg cell trade. A proposal as cynical as that concerned with buying and selling egg cells should not be possible in a civilised and humane society.</p>
<p class="contents">If this were to be permitted, heaven knows what would be the future of such a market for buying and selling. What other organs would it be possible to buy and sell in a market? Now, I am not of course talking about voluntary, unpaid donations of human cells and tissue. That is something quite different from this buyers’ and sellers’ market.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commission will take this seriously and that a unified Parliament agrees with these calls upon the Commission to take all possible measures to prevent what I see as a breach of the law.

Financial gain is of course a further reason why egg cells are sold and embryos manipulated. This is a violation not only of moral principles, but even of the provisions of the 1996 European Convention on Human Rights, which states that neither the human body nor any of its parts may be used as a source of profit. Any trade in cells or human organs would turn human beings into objects, and women’s wombs into incubators. This is an affront to the dignity of individuals, women and mothers.</p>
<p class="contents">Gametes must not and cannot be compared to other tissues or blood. Seen in purely medical terms, large doses of hormones have to be administered in order to obtain egg cells. This can result in neurohormonal dissociation, genetic disorders in the egg cell nuclei, pathological changes and complications with ovary function and structure, especially if the procedure is repeated several times. Such complications frequently involve cancerous changes, which pose a threat not only to a woman’s health, but also to her life.</p>
<p class="contents">The manipulation of gametes or embryos is also unacceptable on ethical grounds. This is because of the major problem of genetic inheritance. The natural order is violated, and consequently acts as a source of chaos, unhappiness and suffering for many people, including those in future generations who will be brought to life in test tubes. A further motive for those directing this very modern tragedy in which human beings are turned into objects is that they wish to destroy the meaning of marriage and the family and to separate biological, genetic and legal parenthood. Action must be taken to stop this. Many thanks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, any trade in human egg cells that may be going on from Romania to the United Kingdom is utterly reprehensible and must be condemned. I trust the Commission will be more forthcoming as to whether or not it believes such a trade is actually going on.</p>
<p class="contents">The harvesting of egg cells poses serious risks to the health of the women involved, owing to hyper-stimulation of the ovaries. It is therefore offensive and utterly wrong that women in economic need in poor countries are being offered financial incentives to become paid donors. I would support any moves to stamp out this disgraceful trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The understandable desire of childless couples to have children must not override the human dignity and health of the donors being exploited. As the UN General Assembly said today when adopting its declaration against the cloning of human beings, measures need to be taken to prevent the exploitation of women in the application of life sciences.

<p class="contents">UK policy does not allow any financial inducements for egg donation. Clinics can give donors compensation of GBP 15 – about EUR 20 – plus expenses for donations. Those rules apply both to donors in the United Kingdom and to donors supplying anyone in the United Kingdom. That is the first clarification.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, I should like to clear up the issue raised in the original question about payments of GBP 1 000. There is currently a debate in the UK about the shortage of egg and sperm donations, particularly now that we are discussing a new law giving children born of such donations the right to know their parents. We believe there will be a shortage of eggs and sperm. So people are talking about how to correct that shortage and some people have talked about GBP 1 000, but that has not been agreed and it is not UK policy.</p>
<p class="contents">There is indeed a clinic in Romania that supplies the UK market. Concerns were raised with the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority in the UK, which is independent. It investigated those concerns, went to Romania, spoke to women and looked at the issues. It found that there were some concerns about consent forms. Those forms have now been changed. It found no evidence of any payments that were not authorised. However, it is continuing to scrutinise what is happening in Romania. At one point it actually stopped the egg cells coming into the UK. It is monitoring the situation all the time.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some questions to be raised in this regard. I do not think we want a market in human eggs and other human tissues. I support the EU directive's reference to voluntary and altruistic donations. Yet we should consider how we are going to deal with people who donate across international borders. We have the capacity to regulate this in our EU countries. That is not the case in other countries that do not have that regulatory capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commissioner will work with the WHO on these issues and look at them again to ensure that we find answers to the concerns of Members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation can now be rectified through egg donation.</p>
<p class="contents">Two main ethical questions arise. Firstly, is it justifiable for the egg-donor woman to be subjected to the necessary medical preparation treatment, which is not entirely without risk? Secondly, is it justifiable for the woman to have this done and be compensated for it? A properly controlled and regulated system, under which healthy, consenting women, fully counselled and screened, donate their eggs, is both ethical and desirable. Such a system could function with an absolute minimum of acceptable risk to all involved. It could provide high-level medical service and much happiness for many couples, while at the same time ensuring much-needed financial assistance to young women, many of whom will use this help in order to care better for their existing families.</p>
<p class="contents">The principal concern is the risk of exploitation. The surest way to make this happen is, of course, to drive the egg-donation service underground. So let us not shy away from the realities of modern human needs. Let us not bury the opportunities that medical advances offer to our citizens. Let us not destroy the family dreams of thousands of loving couples and deny them the happiness of childbearing.

A great shortage of eggs will arise. This is something we are unable to talk clearly about. I am rather uneasy about the fact that we talk indiscriminately in terms of eggs, semen and embryos. I was not fully aware that embryos could be procured in the same way as semen. That is what the British say in their answer. They mention them in the same breath. I think the most worrying thing is that the Commission clearly believes that, through rules alone, it has solved the many problems that follow hard on the heels of human trafficking. We need very tough controls, and we need to see those who break the rules tracked down. I also want to raise the issue mentioned a moment ago concerning what we are to do about cross-border trafficking. This should, of course, be controlled too. It is, of course, not enough simply to say that it is permitted in the other country. Trafficking in women may also be permitted in the other country, but we still want to see it banned.

It was polite of Mrs McAvan to try and persuade us that these things are not going on but, as a doctor, I know what is going on and it needs to be banned because this is also in keeping with the views of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I received an e-mail today from Mrs Záborská, which she sent to all Members about a resolution by the General Assembly of the United Nations – resolution 59516 – on this specific subject, but which Mrs Záborská did not mention in her speech.</p>
<p class="contents">If this is the case, then we also need to allow the trade in other organs, for a fee, such as when obtaining kidneys. We know the brutal haggling which goes on over kidney transplants, especially in the Far East and in the Middle East. We know of a great many such occurrences. However, I also wish to comment on the side effects for healthy women who use this method not for their own purposes – for the purpose of fertilisation – but in order to become donors. The side effects, which are significant, have been reported by other Members. Deaths have also been reported, without yet having been scientifically substantiated, but I believe that this is a serious reason for women to think twice before taking such a decision.

I should like to express my thanks for this fundamental clarification.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I agree with those who have said that the Commission should investigate the case even more closely. The statements by Britain and Romania contradict each other, and, when we come to the vote, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will be proposing a motion further calling, in writing, for the Commission to clarify this contradiction.</p>
<p class="contents">In my personal opinion, the account by the British authorities – which Mrs McAvan read out so nicely – is just not credible. We have all seen the note from the British Embassy, which contains precisely what she just read out. She has every right – maybe even a duty – to defend the British Government in the run-up to an election, but credible is not a word that can be used to describe the terms in which she did so. We have media coverage from Romania and, in the next few days, televised interviews with women who did this for money are to be broadcast on European channels. I should like to see how you continue to defend the British Government’s account then. There may be some people in the United Kingdom who consider GBP 1 000 acceptable. This GBP 1 000 appears in a document of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority in the UK without further comment, and against this we must be on our guard. What we are seeing here is just the tip of the iceberg, and there is a colossal problem. If we can make out the tip of the iceberg, we should not be continuing to obscure the issue or prevent at least those who we are able to catch being called to account.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to address Mrs Ries, whom I hold in high regard as a Member of this House. We agree on many issues, but I cannot understand why the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is planning to vote against paragraph 11. Firstly, this is a joint resolution and, secondly, all it says is: <span class="italic">‘Calls on the Member States to take measures to prevent the exploitation of women in the application of life science’</span>. I am sure that this House is agreed on its opposition to the exploitation of women, especially on International Women’s Day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Here, I think, it is important to stress the difference between trade and donation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, even in relation to donation, we need to emphasise, sincerely and frankly, the need for a high level of vigilance. Voluntary donation often conceals the motivation to make a profit of a certain type and therefore to exploit the situation. It is no accident that reference was made a short time ago to the shortage of eggs and sperm in countries where the anonymity of donors is no longer assured. We can see, therefore, that donation is often not the result of altruism but is a front for certain types of profiteering. I therefore believe we need to be extremely careful, vigilant and clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would stress that when we are discussing cells, it is important that the difference between cells in general and egg cells should be understood. Here, it is important to ensure that Member States have the freedom to legislate, since the donation of eggs is not permitted in every country and this is an issue over which the Member States have jurisdiction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Any other position on this matter would open up the floodgates to corrupt practices.</p>
<p class="contents">Trade in organs and tissues goes on in various parts of the world, but its victims are inevitably the poorest of the poor, forced by poverty into selling valuable assets. Although Europe has always opposed trade of this kind, it has always supported and continues to support voluntary and unconstrained donations, for example of blood. It also agrees to the donation of egg cells if the donation is genuine, or in other words a voluntary, unselfish and free act. European legislation defends the poorest of the poor, and prevents human beings being commercialised. It works on the principle that not everything may be bought or sold, even if the seller agrees to an exchange of money.</p>
<p class="contents">How can it be explained that Romanian clinics offer a wide range of egg cells for free? Are Romanian women fundamentally different to women in other countries? Are they more inclined to make sacrifices for the benefit of anonymous recipients? Or is it possible that the explanation is to be found in their economic situation, or in other words in the fact that they are illegally paid? Investigations must be carried out into whether these women are given hormone treatment beforehand, and if they are aware that such treatment can have an effect on their health.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the initiative by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority to pay women GBP 1000 in compensation not an attempt to subvert the principles of European legislation? If this is the case, does it not expose women who are already at a disadvantage as a result of difficult financial situations and poverty to even greater exploitation and humiliation? Are they not at risk of being treated like factories full of parts that can be traded, or like bodies subject to the laws of the market that produce tissues needed by others to order and for a certain price? The European Commission and the Commissioner should look into all these matters in order to be able to provide answers to the many questions raised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kyprianou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> I found the debate very interesting, but perhaps did not make myself clear in my opening speech, and would like to clarify my position.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that I take this matter extremely seriously and am very concerned at the whole situation. I do not recall saying anything that could possibly be interpreted otherwise. The Commission is indeed worried about the situation, but one has to take into consideration the possibilities, competences and rights that it has under the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Those of you who followed my hearing know that I am not very happy with the competences we have under the Treaty in relation to health. However, that is the law and the reality and we must comply with it. Under the Treaty we can deal only with the issues of safety and quality. That is why the directive stops short of dealing with the issue of payment, and simply expresses the spirit and philosophy of non-payment that should be implemented and followed by the Member States. However, it is not a binding rule. The Commission has limits on how much it can do in this respect. For example, it cannot initiate infringement proceedings against a Member State, because the principle of subsidiarity applies and this is a matter for the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat that this does not mean that because we do not have legal competence we cannot adopt political positions or take political initiatives. We intend to do this primarily through the report we will produce on the implementation of this directive, which will cover the measures taken by Member States to promote unpaid and voluntary donations. In this respect we will do whatever we can to promote this aspect of the philosophy of the directive, relating to unpaid and voluntary donations, and at the same time report and point out where it is not being followed and payments are taking place.</p>
<p class="contents">While I understand the points of view expressed by some Members, I must make it clear that we have to comply with the directive and its philosophy of unpaid and voluntary donations, which is what guides the law that the Commission has to follow.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the specific case is concerned, I once again remind you that we do not have legal competence and that it is not a question of direct investigation by the Commission. We received a report from the UK authority and its independent agency and have no reason to doubt the results of that investigation. In fact the trade was stopped some time ago and there was no proof of payments having taken place. We will nevertheless follow up on this matter and pursue it with the Romanian authorities to see what evidence they may have, although the UK investigation took place in Romania as well and, here too, no proof was found as to payments.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though the directive states that ‘Member States shall endeavour to ensure voluntary and unpaid donations’, that does not mean that Member States cannot go beyond that and legislate, as I suggested in my speech, on such unpaid voluntary donations in a national context and even ban payments, provided that this can be justified on ethical, public morality grounds. Given the realities of the Treaty, greater responsibility lies with the Member States than the European Community in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not feel that the problem has been solved, because it is true that since there is demand, there will always be a potential for trade and payments. Perhaps this case did involve payments, although nothing has been proved, and there will always be a potential for this. That is why we must find ways to promote voluntary, unpaid donations so that demand is covered and there is no room for illicit trade or payments, with all the risks that this entails.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that, within the scope of our competences, we will follow this matter very closely. If we find there has been any violation of either the letter or the spirit of the directive we will report it and make it public. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
