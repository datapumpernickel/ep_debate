We also believe that we should postpone the debates, because we are debating two fundamental issues which are being followed with interest in diplomatic circles, by the countries in question and by non-governmental organisations, at a time when the chamber is practically empty. But if it is not possible to change the date of the debates, let us hold it now, in a clandestine manner – that will be the responsibility of those who do not want to seek an agreement in this regard. I do not accept the pressure that the Council is applying when it tells us that we must debate it badly now because the Council is meeting next week.</p>

All of us in this House have, for whatever reason, agreed on a timetable, and one of the stumbling blocks was that the Council will be discussing this topic next week and that we would like to make our contribution in good time, rather than when everything has been done and dusted. That I regard as unworthy of this House. If, then, we postpone the debate and the vote, we are not taking our work as a Parliament seriously. Moreover, I do not think that the final vote will be affected since the nominal lists have already been drawn up, so why do we not just go ahead and have the debate and the vote today?</p>
<p class="contents">I share your view that the timetable leaves something to be desired. I would have preferred to vote this morning in plenary, but there was no majority support within the groups for this view. Had we done so, we would have at least achieved the majorities with all MEPs attending. Given that the vote has already been rescheduled three times, it is now, in my view, too late.

<p class="contents">I recognise, ladies and gentlemen, that a debate of such importance deserved a larger audience. I must, however, make two observations. Firstly, as a general rule, our debates rarely fill the House, be it a Thursday afternoon, a Monday, a Tuesday or a Wednesday.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maria Martens (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission proposes a long-term strategy for achieving the Millennium Development Goals in Africa by 2015. This can only be applauded. We need a very ambitious plan to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and, above all, to get sub-Saharan Africa on track. The question is now whether the proposed strategy will help achieve this in the best possible way. The strategy clearly outlines the problems, and I share its cautious optimism as regards the development of the African Union and NEPAD.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy has certainly come up with excellent ideas as to how problems may be solved, one example being the extremely important emphasis on the principle of ownership. After all, if Africans cannot take their fate into their own hands and take responsibility for further development, any strategy is doomed to fail.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is the world’s largest donor. For years, Europe has given money and aid, and yet there is more poverty than there was before. A new strategy is therefore needed. Unfortunately, the document cannot really convince me yet that it really represents a U-turn. Why not? There is certainly nothing wrong with its analysis or the goals, but the proposed ways and means leave a lot to be desired.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner is right in saying that we must provide more and better aid more quickly. We cannot do this by giving more money alone, even if we are talking about a few billion extra. It is great that Europe wants to free up more funds, and the Commission wants to remind the Member States of their financial commitments, but we need more than that. I am thinking first and foremost of what we can do in our own policy, about the three Cs of coordination, coherence and complementarity. If they do not improve, then chances of more effective aid will quickly dwindle. Much will ultimately depend on the political will of the Member States. I hope that the Commission will find an effective strategy to promote those.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission acknowledges the fact that major differences exist between the African countries. The different situations and problems are described accurately, but clear, appropriate instruments that address those differences are lacking. In our view, a clear distinction should be drawn between aid to stable countries and aid to countries that are unstable socially and economically due to bad governance, corruption and mismanagement.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst it is possible, as the Commission proposes, for stable countries to be helped under certain conditions, even via budgetary support and sectoral aid, unstable countries also deserve our support. We cannot turn our backs on those people. In those unstable countries, we should not call for aid to be granted via the governments, but for aid via social organisations, which must specifically involve religious communities, as these reach out to many people, after all, and can benefit health, education and other basic provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Commission proposes that our efforts for Africa be, from now on, grouped together under three strands. The first strand is promoting security and good governance, which is important. The second strand is that of economy and trade, and guaranteeing a better investment climate, which is also important. Only the third leg of the action plan concerns poverty reduction via the Millennium Development Goals, such as promoting basic health care, improving education, protecting the environment and creating jobs for as many people as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that the latter, the Millennium Development Goals, should be central. Poverty reduction is critical in order to achieve structural stability so as to, in turn, allow further development. That is why, in our view, all policies must first and foremost be an instrument geared towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. That is why we feel that major infrastructural works in Africa or exchanges between twin towns and universities in the European Union and Africa are premature. They are valuable projects but would be more suitable at a later stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to thank everyone who has contributed to this report, whether inside or outside this House, for their contributions to the thought process. I can look back on a pleasant and constructive working relationship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is Rule 170(4), which states that: ‘Before or during a vote a political group or at least thirty-seven Members may move that the vote be adjourned. Such a motion shall be put to the vote immediately.’ That means, in practical terms, that we shall proceed to the vote at the end of this afternoon’s debates.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Louis Michel, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. (FR)</span> Mr President, Mrs Martens, ladies and gentlemen, Africa is the continent that poses the greatest development challenges. Progressive desertification, the shortage of water, famine and HIV/AIDS have reached critical levels there.</p>
<p class="contents">Africa is the continent where there are more donors than anywhere else. It is therefore the continent where the need for coordination and complementarity is the most urgent. Countries such as Tanzania or Mozambique each have to manage some 500 individual projects funded by European donors in the social infrastructure sector alone, even though the amounts devoted to each of these projects are relatively small.</p>
<p class="contents">Africa is also the continent that offers us the greatest opportunity today. The birth of the African Union and the adoption of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development, the reinforced role of Africa’s Regional Economic Communities and the emergence of a new generation of leaders at national level have changed the way Africa is governed. New glimmers of hope for peace are being seen in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in Somalia, Burundi and Liberia. This continent, which is the ecological lung of the world, has unrivalled wealth when it comes to natural resources.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a future demographic power. By 2025, the population of Africa will have grown to more than 1.3 billion, almost as large as that of China or India, and greater than the combined populations of the European Union and the United States. It will also have the advantage of a younger population, since at that time almost 800 million Africans will be under the age of 15.</p>
<p class="contents">More than ever, this Africa deserves Europe’s full attention. That is why the Commission has proposed a new Strategy for Africa, which was adopted on 12 October and presented in this House the very same day, a strategy intended to provide the European Union with a single, comprehensive and long-term framework for its relations with Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Mrs Martens, ladies and gentlemen, the Strategy for Africa is based on three main themes: one Africa, one Europe and one objective.</p>
<p class="contents">One Africa: while Africa has many faces, different histories and diverse needs, it has now collectively embarked on a path of political, economic and cultural integration of the entire continent, crystallised in the integration efforts promoted by its Regional Economic Communities, the launching of the African Union and NEPAD. In short, this is integration that deserves our unconditional support.</p>
<p class="contents">One Europe: Europe has also changed. The enlargement of the European Union to include ten new members has taken the number of potential individual partners to 26: the 25 Member States plus the European Community. This development has increased the European Union’s potential political and economic impact, but the enlarged membership also poses new challenges in terms of aid coordination and complementarity. The European Union Strategy for Africa will therefore make aid effectiveness and donor coordination central priorities in the years ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">One objective: Europe’s policy on security, for example, has for a long time coexisted – not always happily, I might add – with its development policy. Recent experience – and I am thinking in particular of the Peace Facility for Africa – shows how intimately security and development are linked and how important it is for European policies in these areas to be closely coordinated. In the European Union Strategy for Africa, the common objective is, therefore, to promote the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in Africa. Our overall strategy comprises a series of specific proposals, as you know, and I am glad to see that we largely agree on these points, some of which appear in Mrs Martens’s report, such as strengthening the Peace Facility for Africa, and strengthening the role of national parliaments and civil society organisations in planning, prioritising and – let us not forget – scrutinising development cooperation policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusion of Economic Partnership Agreements as a development-centred tool for liberalisation has the potential to promote economic growth in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to creating an attractive climate for reliable and predictable investment, to foster this we have, as you know, proposed setting up a permanent European forum bringing together African and European entrepreneurs, and building infrastructure in the widest sense of the word, including water, energy, ICT and transport, as provided for in the Europe-Africa Partnership on Infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget either the launch of a new European Union Programme for Action to confront HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria; the emphasis placed on higher education alongside the efforts being made in basic education, and the increase in budget support. The Commission and the Member States will indeed have to endeavour to make the transition from aid projects to sectoral approaches and to direct budget support on that basis. No doubt we will be returning to this during the course of this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, increased coordination of European aid and the implementation of a roadmap on coherence, coordination and complementarity seek to ensure that the European Union cooperates more effectively on development.</p>
<p class="contents">These, then, are the main themes of the Africa strategy. I am delighted to see that Parliament finds its concerns reflected in our three basic concepts and in the specific proposals. Mrs Martens’ report and the motion tabled are ambitious. I am delighted; I thank you for this and I congratulate you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Some of the debate in the Committee on Foreign Affairs on its opinion on this report was very lively, but it did eventually adopt it unanimously. It is unfortunate that there was later majority support for a Conservative motion that there be no demand for a debate on the role of colonialism, which I believe would be important in the African context.</p>
<p class="contents">Among other things, our opinion states that fundamental human rights should be respected when dealing with refugees and illegal immigrants on the EU’s African borders, which I recently visited with a delegation. There one sees concrete evidence of the means currently adopted by the EU to combat poverty, in the shape of fences and walls, and that is highly problematic.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, we call for a debate on the social responsibilities of governments and businesses as an integral part of the new Africa strategy, to which the Commission certainly needs to make some improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">Our opinion also addresses the need for the proposed cuts in measures to combat HIV/Aids, malaria and tuberculosis to be reversed, and stresses the importance of promoting peace and conflict resolution in Africa, with consequent specific reference to the control of weapons exports, which we debated yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">This prompts me to mention that I have taken note of the speech made by Commissioner Michel to the Parliamentary Assembly of the WEU on 21 September, in which he said that EUR 250 million for African troops was to be taken from the development budget. That I regard as the wrong way to go about it, and I warn the EU against conflating its security or military policies with its policy on development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Her report reflects reality and lays down the prospects of the development strategy for Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Africa, where most of the less developed countries are found, is due both to endogenous and to extraneous factors. Addressing the endogenous factors is the responsibility of the African governments themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the overcoming of extraneous factors concerns us and not only because the European Union is by far the biggest donor of humanitarian aid. It does not concern us only in the sense of increasing aid to 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product by 2015. It concerns us in the sense that development aid will, as the report emphasises, go hand in hand with its improved quality, effectiveness, transparency and visibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenge to the European Union consists, in my opinion, among other things:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, in overcoming the fragmentation of humanitarian intervention and in constructing a cohesive approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in linking the Union's policy with the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, in establishing effective coordination of humanitarian aid between the Member States and the Commission and between the Union's bilateral policies and its development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Action by the Union should obey a clear timetable, specific targets and the need to link objectives and means. This need is indicated, among other things, by the report, which I endorse.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner condensed the challenge of Africa in his phrase: 'One Africa, one Europe, one objective'. 'One Africa' is the responsibility of Africa itself, 'one Europe' is the responsibility of Europe and 'one objective' is our common objective. We support this eminent initiative of yours and will respond convincingly to the challenge of Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It received widespread support and our vote in the Committee on Development.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not have time now to comment on the main body of the report, with whose resolution we Socialists will agree provided that it is not altered by means of amendments in plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">For a long time we have been arguing that Europe has an ethical and political responsibility to make a decisive contribution to development in Africa, but in recent times it should be clear to everybody that that development has also become absolutely essential in order to maintain both stability on the international scene and stability and prosperity in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we agree with Mrs Martens that to do everything possible to help Africa out of its dramatic situation of under-development must become a genuine priority within the European Union’s policies.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, it is essential that we see our role as one of accompanying the African leaders in the implementation of their own decisions. We are therefore concerned about the fact that the Commission’s Communication, to which Mrs Martens’ report refers, does not make more reference to the African Union and to the strategic plan that the Heads of State in that sister institution have defined as strategic priorities for the development of their continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps we are making the mistake of defining priorities off our own backs that do not coincide with those of the people mainly affected, partners to whom we have a commitment in terms of achieving the objectives that we have been discussing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Alongside the input we have received from the Council concerning Tony Blair’s Africa Commission and the UN Summit, the Commission’s proposal contains a good many constructive features relating to the environment, good governance and the fight against poverty. We have also noted that women and equality have been included as part of the picture and that importance is attached to women’s importance as driving forces in the development of society.</p>
<p class="contents">I must, however, use the short period I have in which to speak in order to highlight an alarming aspect of the proposal, namely the unduly centralised way in which EU aid to Africa is planned, using for example a Donor Atlas, as if we in Europe could sit and plan how aid is to be coordinated in the individual African countries. This practice is in direct conflict with those principles of aid effectiveness and good donor behaviour that the EU helped adopt at the Paris High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in March of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the African countries that should have the crucial role in coordinating aid, proceeding on the basis of their own strategies for combating poverty. If we do not provide aid in that way, we shall be in danger of seeing a veritable invasion of white elephants in Africa, and that would mean a return to a very bad strategy. We must stand by what we have said so far. Quite a few of the amendments in the Martens report take account of these centralist measures on the part of the Commission, and I hope that Parliament will ensure that the recipient countries, and not the Commission, continue to play a pivotal role where aid is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Up to now, every government has, in its dealings with Africa, pursued its own interests, formulated its own strategies for development cooperation and created its own structures to implement them.</p>
<p class="contents">Coherence and improved coordination of aid are, as I see it, very important if we want to make a real contribution to combating famine, preventing violent conflicts and keeping states from disintegrating. Clear distinctions need to be drawn between the African states in terms of their social, cultural, economic, political and environmental development, and any European development strategy needs to take account not only of this but also of African people’s prospects and of the conditions and processes in their own countries. Any development strategy for Africa needs to be influenced by the knowledge of Africa’s regional organisations, elected parliaments, the organisations of civil society and trade unions concerning the processes and approaches involved in finding solutions to the maladministration of their own countries and to removing it. Only then will the criterion of ‘ownership’, on which so much stress is laid in the report, make any sort of sense.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the African Union responded with outrage to the questions he was asked about the tragedy of the refugees in Melilla, and he had every right to do so, saying, as he did, among other things, that these people were not lazy, and that the EU’s, and the USA’s, agricultural subsidies had to be seen as questionable. The Committee on International Trade, in its opinion, emphasised the importance of, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, the abolition of export subsidies as a means of enabling Africa to become an equal partner in world trade, but the Commission’s development strategy, makes no clear commitment to this. This strategy will make aid more efficient only if it is understood as a guideline for cooperation with the various partner countries. Any such framework for the EU’s development cooperation must take account of the diversity present within Africa and make use of Africans’ experience and know-how. Only in that way can this strategy make a real contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I cannot help but point out, however, that it makes no direct reference to certain issues that are of absolutely key importance, both for Africa and for other very poor countries. We will not help these countries merely by setting up funds, or by cooperating with the same old organisations. We need to draw attention to the fundamental goals, the most important of which is education, education and education. Further goals include hygiene and health, and support for the local economy. I would repeat that it must be the local economy that receives our support, since this is what will help people on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this report would be a very welcome development, if it were not for the unfortunate fact that it has fallen victim to something that crops up all too often in this House. An ideological slant has been put on it, which is entirely uncalled for in a debate such as this on aid for developing countries. Once again, ideological references to reproductive health and reproductive rights have been included, even though they are completely out of place. We really cannot allow every text we adopt to be peppered with various extraneous references of an ideological and feminist bent, for they are indeed feminist. They are entirely uncalled for in this instance.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore call on the House to lend its backing to the amendments tabled by Mr Szymański. Amendments 1 and 3 highlight the fundamental goals to which I referred, namely food, clean water, better sanitary conditions, vaccinations and mother and child care. Amendments 2 and 4 seek to delete the reference to reproductive rights, and to replace it with a reference to basic health care. We really should not put an ideological slant on every debate held in this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As things stand at present, the prospects are very poor and I find myself wondering what we can offer if this round proves a failure.</p>
<p class="contents">This week, I asked Commissioner Mandelson what he thought of the idea of a free trade area covering Europe, the USA, Canada and Australia. What would become of the countries of Africa? Would they then have to organise themselves, or would they have to conclude bilateral agreements with these great world markets? Whom would that benefit, and to whom would that be disadvantageous? It is in difficult times like these that we have to ensure that these multilateral talks are beneficial to these countries, and that requires the facilitation of trade, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, this is where we have to take ‘free SMEs’ as our watchword, with free markets for small businesses; cooperation between family businesses in Africa, in Europe and throughout the world, needs to be promoted as the basis for prosperity. What is needed to do that is a fair system of public invitations to tender, proper competition law and, finally, if these businesses are to be willing to become active in these countries, their investments have to be protected.</p>
<p class="contents">That does, therefore, raise the question of how we can turn development aid into helping people to help themselves, into helping our small and medium-sized enterprises? What sets Europe apart is that we are in a position to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and this is where there is much for the European Investment Bank, among other bodies, to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every 30 seconds a child in Africa dies of malaria, and yet there are a number of actions that could put a complete stop to that. Bed nets are a low-tech method of protection from mosquitoes, but very few families have them. Great progress has recently been made in Spain on a vaccine against malaria, but at the moment Bill Gates and other private foundations are putting a great deal more money into this than international bodies. It is clear that much more can be done and that more funding would make a huge difference, so what excuse can we possibly have not to provide it?</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns an area in which the European Union actually has been spending money, and needs to continue to do so without counting the cost too closely. This is our support for democratic elections in Africa. I was in Ethiopia in May, and just recently in the Congo observing the electoral registration process. Such action does not come cheap. The total bill was EUR 242 million, with 80% of that provided by the European Union. However, this is the first step on a very long road for a country facing enormous difficulties in terms of lack of communications and lack of infrastructure. Only by putting in the funding to enable the democratic process to get off the ground can we hope to start to see some progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Nobody can pretend that democracy is the answer to everything, but without fair and free democratic elections many other things are simply impossible. So when we look at what we are spending where, we should think very carefully about refusing a budget to actions that are proven to make a difference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU’s fundamental desire to provide aid of this nature was enshrined as long ago as 1950 in one of the opening paragraphs of the Schuman declaration. Ever since, it has been a familiar refrain in the EU, which has been accompanied by efforts undertaken, since the Year of Africa, by the world’s developed countries to address the same questions, namely decolonisation, immigration to Europe, the need to build and maintain infrastructure, to build wells, to introduce irrigation, education, efficient farming based on agricultural production, to reduce nomadic pastoralism and to implement the forest planting plan as a key factor in the fight against the increasing desertification of the Sahel.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to such measures, the resolution before us builds on experience gained in other less-developed parts of the world by promoting the development of micro-loans based on the empowerment of women, the further development of education and health in conjunction with the UN and, as soon as possible, the achievement of the target of 0.7% of GNI earmarked by all developed countries for development aid to the world’s poorest countries; and this is something that we believe to be appropriate. Conversely, the temporary liberalisation of economically underdeveloped countries, in particular with regard to services of public interest, and the privatisation of state enterprises, have always proved detrimental. How can we recommend such measures? This reservation notwithstanding, I support the resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its analysis not only highlights the continent’s potential, but also sets out the way things actually are. Alongside the various positive developments in some African countries – South Africa, of course, but also Botswana, Ghana and, it is to be hoped, in Mauritania too – there is a much longer list of countries suffering from conflicts, whether internally or with their neighbours, widespread poverty, and the illnesses to which reference has already been made: HIV/Aids, malaria, tuberculosis – the great scourges of Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">If we ask ourselves why it is that Africa has lagged so far behind other continents, we must, of course, look not only at Africa but also at Europe and the other continents. Looking at Africa, we see that there are in many places governments or elites that obviously rather misunderstood what was happening at the time of decolonisation and started to see themselves as replacements for the former colonists and to treat their own people in the same way as the European colonial powers had evidently done before. They obviously had no conception of what development means or of how independence should be used.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, though, that we have to recognise, if we are honest, that it is Europe and the other continents that bear the greatest responsibility. We need only consider how European powers continue to interfere in Africa, whether directly, using political or military power, or by arranging things so that they can develop their own raw materials for their own companies and retain access to them. This is what I think makes it really necessary that the Commission should, by its approach, more firmly constrain the Member States to pursue a coherent policy towards Africa, which will enable us to abandon these contradictions and secure that continent a better future than it would have otherwise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, there can be no question that the continent poses a political, economic and social challenge to Europe as a whole. We are not shirking our responsibility, since the EU has increased the aid it provides to Africa by 0.14% of GDP, and half of this money has been earmarked for the sub-Saharan countries.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two extremes we must avoid when taking action to help Africa. One such extreme is the attempt to replace policy making with charity, the end result of which is to turn Africa into a bottomless pit and to help it to do almost everything, by which I also mean taking decisions on its future. The other extreme is to take the entirely opposite approach, or in other words to leave Africa to its own devices. We are delighted that the African Union is playing an ever greater role. I hope that as this body assumes greater importance, institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organisation will become more democratic, for example by ensuring that more developing countries are represented within them. This is a point I should like to emphasise most strongly.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Louis Michel, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">. </span></span><span class="italic"> (FR)</span> Mr President, Mrs Martens, ladies and gentlemen, obviously I should like first of all to welcome most of the interventions, because they really are very much in line with the convictions underlying my communication on Africa. With the exception of perhaps one or two points, I can wholeheartedly agree with all of the comments that I have heard.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I should like to say that I obviously agree that there is a need to improve the coordination, convergence and coherence of actions, and that this forms an essential part of the communication and the political line that I am trying to develop. As you will be aware – and I think that Parliament will be able to offer very effective help here – in this connection I have made a proposal, currently being debated by the Council, to quickly implement an action plan, an action plan that does not consist only of words, no, an action plan comprising genuine and tangible commitments, such as, for example, a joint country strategy paper for the Member States and the Commission. We could debate this together. It will not be compulsory for the Member States, but I believe that it would nonetheless be a significant step forward if, instead of having 26 documents or 26 different strategies, one per country, we had just one. It would be worthwhile. That is what I have proposed in the action plan. A second aspect would also be to have joint programming. This would be a further strand of this action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">For the time being, I have to admit that the Council is hesitating and that we are doing all we can to actually push this small measure through. It is difficult to achieve, despite the fact that it would obviously only be on a voluntary basis, as development – as I have had occasion to say in the past – is an area of shared competence; there is therefore nothing to fear in terms of Member States’ sovereignty, but it would constitute quite significant progress.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the three pillars are concerned, obviously the Millennium Development Goals are the priority. I see that everyone agrees on this point. But I think that it is difficult to isolate this third pillar from the first two, because we cannot achieve the Millennium Development Goals without peace and security and Africa itself shows that we cannot achieve them if we disregard growth and interconnectivity. It is clear that without infrastructure, without measures to open up the regions of Africa and without genuinely transcontinental infrastructure enabling production to be economically liberalised – I am thinking in particular of sub-Saharan Africa – the task will be extremely difficult. If we do not combine the third and second pillars then development will be reduced purely and simply to a large-scale charitable operation, which no one here wants, with the inevitable result that the developing countries will be dependent on us, the donors, which we do not want either.</p>
<p class="contents">To respond to Mr Pflügler, who made sure to raise the issue of human rights, I obviously agree with him that this is absolutely crucial. One brief comment, however: I think that if, under well-defined conditions, we were able to increase the proportion of budgetary support, we would be in a better position to negotiate substantial improvements in human rights, but this is a debate to which we will no doubt have the opportunity to return.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as business is concerned, as I have said, I am working on this at the moment – I announced as much and I will shortly be presenting the communication in question – and I have put forward the idea of having an ethical and social label for companies working in developing countries. I have also proposed setting up a permanent Europe-Africa business forum.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the fact that I apparently proposed a reduction in the AIDS budget, I am not at all sure where that information came from, but it must be a misunderstanding. What is true is that, when I went to London to the Global Fund Replenishment Conference, I unfortunately only had EUR 90 million available to offer.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I should like nonetheless to remind you – I am not after all going to take the blame every day – that Europe provides more than 60% of the donations to this Global Fund. This is not insignificant. The contribution of all of the Member States and the Commission represents a little over 60% of the Global Fund. I therefore did not propose reducing our contribution to the fund; I simply placed in it the money that I had for this financial year, for 2006, all of the money that I had left for 2006. I cannot do anything for 2007, because we do not have the financial perspective. Besides, I have to confess that the whole business is rather comical: the UK Presidency was pushing me to go further, but it was easy for me to reply, ‘I would be happy to do so, but you will have to help me out here.’</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the African troops, I should like to clarify matters a little. I think that in principle you are right that the money required to fund the Peace Facility should come from a source other than the development budget. I think that we agree on the principle. But if we do not have a financial perspective, and if the evaluation that is going to be made of the effectiveness and the positive impact of the Peace Facility – an evaluation which will obviously prove to be very interesting and very positive – concludes that we need to allocate more funds to this Peace Facility when there is no financial perspective, I wonder whether one solution might perhaps be to use certain uncommitted funds, to convert resources that are already committed, resources that we know full well will not be used for some time, as a means of provisionally replenishing the Peace Facility.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like all the same to remind you that there is still around EUR 35 million in the Peace Facility. But you should be aware that our work is not finished in Sudan (Darfur, and so on). No doubt we will also need a stronger Peace Facility in the DRC at some point; at least this cannot be ruled out. As for Somalia, I had a meeting with the Prime Minister of that country yesterday and he too needs the Peace Facility to be stepped up in his country as a means of guaranteeing security. I can therefore safely assume that this facility is going to need a lot more money. I fear that we will not be able to leave Sudan in the immediate future.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have to say that this Peace Facility is an extremely useful, indeed indispensable, tool, if we want Africans in principle also to take ownership of issues such as conflict prevention, peace-keeping, post-conflict situations, and so on, so as quite simply to create the conditions for a return to stability. In conclusion, I assume so. I have to be pragmatic. It is very easy to say, ‘The principle please, nothing but the principle’. The result? There will not be another euro to put in the Peace Facility, and we will find ourselves totally powerless to pursue the policies that we have to pursue. I hope that as soon as possible we will have the financial perspective and the Stability Instrument, which should, under normal circumstances, finance the Peace Facility and enable the problem to be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one thing that I did not fully understand with regard to coordination amongst the African countries. Mrs Auken, I am in favour of also encouraging coordination between the African countries. Coordination is required at every level: at national level, because it is our aid and because it has to fit in with the government’s poverty reduction strategy; at regional level and at international level, with the other donors. I sincerely believe, therefore, that coordination is also an important factor, over and above coordination between our own Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it was Mr Libicki who highlighted the need for aid at local level. I agree wholeheartedly. Moreover, that is precisely why we have set aside significant sums to support decentralisation. I have had a meeting with Ousmane Sy, the former Minister of the Interior in Mali, to whom we have, by the way, recently awarded a prize in Belgium, to discuss this: he is preparing a study on decentralisation for the Commission, for me in this case, with particular reference to the DRC. He has considerable expertise on this subject. I have also personally chaired working meetings in Rwanda on decentralisation and I have seen evidence of the positive impact that this has had on the ground. I therefore share this point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I do not think that we are adopting an ideological stance by referring to reproductive health. I would say that this is not about ideology but about humanism, and humanism, I believe, is part of the common heritage of all democrats.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the WTO meeting in Hong Kong, Mr Rübig, as you well know, we are very mindful of this issue and we are still hoping that we will be able to reach a positive agreement in Hong Kong. As far as your proposal for the EIB is concerned, I can tell you – and this is important because it is along exactly the same lines as you suggested – that we are working with Mr Philippe Maystadt on a proper strategy. At the very beginning of next year – I met Mr Maystadt on Monday and we will be having another meeting in December – we will probably be signing a memorandum of understanding between the EIB and the Commission so as, firstly, to pool resources, but also to ensure that the decisions taken by the EIB that relate to development take better account of the development aspect and of the risk associated with that.</p>
<p class="contents">I think I have already responded to Mr Schapira in my answer to another question: the European Union – the Commission and the Member States together – contributes more than 60% of the Global Fund. Mrs Hall believes that we should put in more funding. I would say that we are obviously heavily involved in preparing for and monitoring elections, whether it be in the DRC or elsewhere, and you yourself wanted to highlight the fact that we have made a difference in the DRC, so far. This does not mean that everything is going to be easily resolved and that the situation does not remain fragile, but I see that so far, the latest figure – I receive figures every day – for voters who have registered in the DRC is 21 761 000. I have to tell you that we had set a target of 15 million: we are well above that and it is all the same encouraging to see that the population has responded in such great numbers.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as malaria is concerned, be assured that, as part of the Sixth Framework Programme for Research, the Commission is funding the necessary research to find a vaccine for malaria. We are very much involved here too, as you are concerned that we should be.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Gahler said that the countries of Europe often continue to act like neo-colonial powers, by for example controlling natural resources. I have nothing to reply on this point. Let me simply tell you that my entire strategy seeks to move us away from these habits or reflexes, whether conscious or not, of paternalism and neo-colonialism. To conclude, I should like to say that the very foundation, the philosophy, underlying what we have proposed, is the principle of ownership. Moreover, I hope, Mr President – and I will conclude with this – that the translation of the word ‘ownership’ has been corrected in the French version: it had been translated into French using the word for ‘property’, which is not really the same thing as ‘ownership’. Ownership is therefore at the very heart of this new relationship that we want to establish with our African friends.</p>
<p class="contents">There you have it, Mr President; I think I have been as comprehensive as I can. In any case, I should like to thank all of those Members who have supported us so actively. In particular I should like to thank Mrs Martens, who has drafted an absolutely outstanding report. I hope that all of this will help us in Monday’s Council meeting to make progress on our common cause, which is our concern for Africa and the need to open up to this continent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully support the request to provide this strategy with adequate instruments and resources together with precise deadlines in order to be able to assess its progress. I also agree that it is a priority to coordinate the policies of the various Member States so as to prevent actions from being duplicated. It is important, however, that the EU finally assumes its due role at international level as a leader in the fight against poverty. Africa, the region which concentrates the highest number of people living below the poverty line, the worst kinds of transmissible diseases, infant and maternal mortality and a lack of education and health structures, represents the principal challenge to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Europe’s cooperation actions therefore need to be supported by a firm policy of international diplomacy that consistently promotes suitable economic and social policies within international organisations, primarily the UN, the IMF and the WTO. This policy should also promote dialogue with all the recipient countries so that these countries can eventually play an active role in establishing their own strategies and in managing the programmes, with the full participation of civil society as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Regrettably, the EU does not, however, have an overall view of development issues. In the present situation, the EU hands out resources with one hand, only to take them back with the other. That is not a credible way to act.</p>
<p class="contents">The first proposal should concern the EU’s need to carry out radical overhauls of its agricultural, fisheries and trade policies. Unfortunately, there is no political will in this Chamber to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">The British Presidency and the Commission have stated that development issues in Africa are a policy area to be given priority. Despite that, the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament all defend the EU’s fisheries agreements. These agreements are principally aimed at guaranteeing the EU’s short–term economic interests, and they generate extremely limited resources for those who need them, namely poor fishermen in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, as a matter of urgency, prevent the fragmentation and duplication of aid. I do not, however, think that the EU’s role should be that of leading the world on this issue.
