The Zanu-PF regime is an appalling example of the repression of an impoverished and starving people. Morgan Tsvangirai – the leader of the opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change – has been put on trial under spurious charges of treason.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic situation in that country has sharply worsened, with the GDP falling 40% over the last 4 years, and with inflation already at 600% and forecast to reach 1000% before the end of 2004. There is 70% unemployment and over 6 million people are in need of food aid. There have already been some reports of children dying from malnutrition, particularly in the Bulawayo area. There has been a disastrous land reform programme – which no reference to the evils of colonialism can possibly justify – that has dismantled commercial agriculture without replacing it with any other way of producing food efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">Daily News</span> – Zimbabwe's only independent daily newspaper – is still closed, despite the courts ordering its reopening, and now the news editor and chief reporter of the <span class="italic">Zimbabwe Independent</span> have been arrested under the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="contents">What we want is a renewal of the sanctions against Zimbabwe, which are up for renewal by the EU on 20 February 2004. Equally, we want a further widening and strengthening of sanctions against the regime, with the introduction of additional measures to make international action against the regime more effective, in particular the stringent enforcement of the visa ban. There will be a meeting of the EU-African Union Foreign Ministerial Troika on 1 April, and we hope that the EU will put it high on the agenda. We welcome the intervention by Archbishop Desmond Tutu following the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Nigeria, but would call on other African leaders to equally intervene and put pressure on Mugabe to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">We need the donor community to make available food aid that can be distributed through non-governmental channels; and we want the EU Member States on the UN Security Council to galvanise the international community into taking coordinated and effective action against this intolerable regime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also wish to note the reasons why we support this compromise motion for a resolution, which once again, like the others that we have tabled in the course of this parliamentary term, condemns the regime and which calls for sanctions to be re-imposed and for diplomatic pressure to be exerted on Mugabe that will lead to the democratic transformation of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to take this opportunity to ask the Commission to provide more practical support for representatives of civil society. I recently asked the Commission about this matter and I was satisfied with the answer Commissioner Nielson gave. He said that the Commission intends to continue providing assistance to representatives of civil society in order to support projects and/or activities in the field of human rights and democratisation and to help them to promote internal dialogue, an approach that we support and which, incidentally, is reproduced both in our own motion for a resolution and in the compromise text. We would like this support to be more specific, however: what specific actions are being undertaken, with whom, with what means and how actively? I believe that closer cooperation between the Commission and Parliament to mount political pressure could perhaps achieve more effective results. We need to achieve more effective results not only because of the growing tragedy in Zimbabwe, but also because this could be a focus for instability and could set a bad example. We were worried to hear news recently of similar actions or rather news that similar actions were being planned in Namibia too, even though this is not the official position maintained by that country’s government. There is also news – which led to some fellow Members tabling a written motion for a resolution – of an abnormally high murder rate of farmers in the Boer areas of South Africa. This is one aspect of the persecution of farmers in Zimbabwe that should also concern us because it could spread throughout southern Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Zimbabwe has for a long time been a completely lawless country, economically impoverished and badly affected by AIDS. It has a dictatorial, mad old leader who has completely lost contact with reality and with his own people. Precisely when one imagines that things could not be worse, new reports come in that the situation in the country has deteriorated further. The human suffering and famine are becoming worse and worse, and there is an acute need for humanitarian aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Mugabe must go. That is the only chance for the people of Zimbabwe. Now, the surrounding world must respond with vigorous countermeasures. Everything has failed so far, but the sanctions must be intensified. The whole of the international community must be crystal-clear in its condemnation of Mugabe’s regime and tell him that our patience is exhausted. No contacts, no exchanges and no sporting events, together with renewed and more stringent sanctions, are what we require. We must seek a broad coalition, which includes the SADC countries, in order to take measures and put pressure on the regime. South Africa’s silent diplomacy, as it is termed, has shown itself to be completely ineffective, but South Africa must nonetheless be prevailed upon to use its contacts to put pressure on Mugabe.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we in the EU must support the opposition. There is a small number of incredibly courageous people who – at danger to their own lives and, in some cases, at the loss of their lives – are trying to fight for democracy and human dignity in that country. I hope that the Commission is able to guarantee that the EU will continue to support these courageous people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the chaos and the oppression of the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe has led to no satisfactory response from Zimbabwe's neighbours, who seem deaf to the cries of anguish from the oppressed people of that country. Not only have southern African countries been unwilling to exert pressure on Mr Mugabe, they have also allowed him to dictate the terms of Africa's relationship with Europe, and that is worse.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union's relationship with both the African Union and the Southern African Development Community has been damaged by African states' insistence that banned Zimbabweans should be included in meetings in Europe. The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly has also been severely disrupted. This not only undermines the founding principles of NEPAD and the ACP-EU relationship, but also means that major problems burdening Africa – external debt, AIDS, food security, conflict prevention, good governance and human rights – cannot be properly addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Conditions in Zimbabwe are now spiralling out of control. There are terrible shortages, and oppression is increasingly widespread and brutal. A once prosperous country has been ruined and destroyed. African states' refusal to take the initiative on Zimbabwe means that it is even more critical that EU sanctions against the ZANU-PF regime be strengthened. This House has already called for them to be extended on six separate occasions. To date, the Council has failed to heed these calls. The EU travel ban against the Mugabe regime has regularly been breached in its first year and subsequently weakened to facilitate the entry of banned Zimbabweans into Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution before us today calls for renewal of EU measures when they expire on 20 February and the introduction of tough new sanctions. It calls for the right of residence in Europe of those subject to the travel ban to be rescinded, for members of their families to be barred from employment and educational institutions in the European Union, for high-profile economic links with Zimbabwe that have given the regime international prestige to be curtailed, for those providing financial backing to the ZANU-PF regime to be identified, and for measures to be imposed against them. Yet again this House calls on the Council to respond to its clearly expressed wish: real, effective actions against the ZANU-PF regime in Zimbabwe now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Well, Buch’s essay is an open letter to the current President of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, an old acquaintance of the author. Buch derides Mbeki’s stance on President Aristide’s regime in Haiti and President Mugabe’s in Zimbabwe. Let me quote: ‘Why did you not speak up for human rights to be respected in Haiti, and why do your protests against the ongoing violation of human rights in Zimbabwe sound so muted?’</p>
<p class="contents">Just like Buch, this resolution explicitly addresses South Africa’s attitude to the ever-worsening situation in Zimbabwe. Council and Commission, let your voices be heard! Buch, forthrightly, asks Mbeki, ‘Or do you want to leave South Africa the option of the road already taken by Mugabe – the white minority as scapegoat for your own failures?’ It is this clear stance that I demand of the European Union in the forthcoming consultation with the African Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not in any way do we dispute the description of the misery in Zimbabwe, and we can endorse the rigorous condemnation of the Mugabe regime, but we have problems with pointing the finger at the surrounding countries and saying that it is they who have to remove Mugabe from power. We certainly want to see Mugabe out of office. We know that there is a well-organised and courageous opposition, but we are demanding things of the countries of Southern Africa that we ourselves are unable to do. What are our own sanctions actually achieving? Nothing so far – and I have to tell you that the surrounding countries are particularly susceptible to pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the case that the violence is threatening to spread to South Africa, it is true that there is talk of land reform and that people who have nothing but weapons are now marching on the white-owned farms to take the law into their own hands – not only in Zimbabwe, but also in South Africa. The land reform in Zimbabwe is a disgrace. It has done nothing to put an end to people’s misery; far from it, it has made a few rich people even richer. We are perfectly well aware of that but, rather than pointing the finger at one side only, we must look for effective measures. Even the elephants are fleeing Zimbabwe in the knowledge that the national parks are being plundered, that the wild animals living in them are bereft of any protection and are being slaughtered, not only by poachers but also by people who hunt these animals out of their own desperation. As people flee Zimbabwe, they are arriving in the neighbouring countries. I therefore urge that we resume dialogue with vigour and examine ways in which we can help the well-intentioned regimes in Southern Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Zimbabwe was our one cause for pride, our favourite example of what development cooperation and genuine partnership achieves. It was proof that Africa was flourishing.</p>
<p class="contents">What destroyed Zimbabwe? I am not now going to repeat that pitiful and seemingly endless list of factors the resolution mentions. That would be too much. Destruction has permeated Zimbabwe’s entire social structure, from healthcare and education to the trade union movement and agriculture. Africa’s formerly productive model country is in a state of chaos and its economic structures are in tatters. In inciting people to occupy land illegally, instead of implementing controlled land reform within a reasonable timeframe, Mugabe flouted the law of the land and so devastated the functioning core of society. That is what this issue is about. When the basis of the legal system is destroyed the structures break up one by one.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that President Mugabe, former fighter for independence and national hero, degenerated to the level of dictator to keep watch over his own country is a tragedy of our time. I was a member of Parliament’s delegation of election observers in Zimbabwe a few years ago and we were simply amazed when during the elections someone had the nerve to declare that the government would remain in power whatever the result was.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite intimidation, people voted. In Zimbabwe that could mean not only taking risks but also walking for miles to a polling station and queuing for hours. That was a sight to behold for someone used to a system where voting is easy.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish everyone who is scornful of voting and representational democracy could just see queues like that even once. Let us in the EU give our unambiguous support to those who, despite oppression, have the courage to fight for law and rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are no positive developments within it to speak of and few from outside it to report. The only positive aspect that comes to my mind is that the Commonwealth, at least, has not changed its stance on Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council, too, though, when the situation first got worse three or four years ago, took a very ambivalent approach for a very long time. As the main criticism in debates on matters of topical and urgent importance is often directed at the Council, I would like representatives from it not only to be present on such occasions, but also to make statements on the accusations levelled at it.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the travel ban is concerned, the Council always hides behind what it claims to be obligations under international diplomatic agreements, when – as usually happens – ministers from Zimbabwe are again allowed in. Nowhere is it stated that a criminal regime must be accorded all diplomatic honours. Of course one can take diplomatic reprisals against those who fail to abide by any human rights convention. Of course you can also seize these people’s bank accounts and freeze the money until such time as circumstances change.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor, in my view, has the Council really made plain to South Africa the seriousness of our insistence that it too should bring this necessary pressure to bear. I do not believe that we can sit by and wait for this problem to resolve itself. We can of course try to avert our gaze, but the situation will become ever more pressing. Other Members have already referred to the situation that people face, to the many millions of them who are already in South Africa illegally, and I see this as a situation in which pressure is needed, and must be brought to bear from every quarter. There is no reason why our own governments should look away when these things are going on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the light of the dire political situation in that country, and as no sign of a commitment from the government of Zimbabwe to take tangible measures to remedy the situation has been forthcoming, there can be no justification for lifting or easing European Union measures against Zimbabwe. The Commission will therefore consider extending those measures for a further year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission remains fully committed to, and has even stepped up, its provision of direct assistance to the population of Zimbabwe in the form of food aid to cover essential needs. This month an extra EUR 20 million was pledged for food aid operations owing to evidence of continuing significant requirements and the absence of other donors in the critical period up to the harvest in May. This brings our total funding for food and humanitarian aid for the current season to EUR 85 million.</p>
<p class="contents">We continue to be very active in providing support to projects in social sectors and in the field of democratisation, respect for human rights and the rule of law. This sort of support was specifically excluded from the measures taken against Zimbabwe in order to protect the population and to promote progress.</p>
<p class="contents">To be more specific, and in response to Mr Ribeiro e Castro, I would remind the House that Zimbabwe is a focal country in the context of 2002-2004 European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights funding. That initiative should be viewed as a catalytic instrument for achieving significant results in protecting civil society and ensuring that critical voices can continue to make themselves heard within society.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission continues to provide assistance for capacity building for human rights and democracy NGOs that carry out basic human rights work and for civil society actors by enhancing their capacities to promote internal dialogue. In the last two years – 2002-2003 – almost EUR 2.5 million was allocated to specific projects under the EIDHR.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission continues to explore all possible avenues to influence the government of Zimbabwe and is pursuing an enhanced dialogue with its neighbouring countries, and notably the Southern African Development Community and the government of South Africa. It will support any peer pressure that the international community, and African heads of state in particular, can bring to bear on the government of Zimbabwe to improve the political, economic and humanitarian situation in that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
