<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miguélez Ramos (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (ES)</span> Mr� President, the regulation before us today is designed to strengthen the dialogue with the fishing industry and groups affected by the common fisheries policy. The Commission wants to ensure that it duly receives information on the needs of the industry. It also wants to promote the dissemination to this industry of the Community regulations and decisions adopted as part of the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, the Committee on Fisheries supports this proposal for a regulation. In order to make proposals and carry out its responsibilities, the European Commission needs to be informed of the current state of affairs within the industry through dialogue with those involved.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal for a regulation has been preceded by the reform of the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture, the consultation body created in 1971 and involving all the professional sectors. Briefly, this reform has updated this body by including other parties which have been playing an increasingly prominent part in recent years in the management of the rational exploitation of marine resources, such as non-governmental organisations devoted to development, environmental groups, consumers and also scientists.</p>
<p class="contents">This reform has also involved a more prominent role being granted to the sectors hitherto underrepresented, such as the aquaculture sector and those engaged in marketing. The number of members of the plenary committee has also been reduced and specialist working groups have been established.</p>
<p class="contents">The essence of this reform of the Advisory Committee is the priority given to organisations which are most representative at Community level, with the aim of ensuring that the committee is not merely a spokesperson for national interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Fisheries of this House, and myself in particular as rapporteur, have been highly critical of the fact that the Commission did not consult us on the reform of this committee. This means that we now have to be content with giving an opinion on this proposal for a regulation which I would venture to qualify as being of minor importance.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to its objectives and mechanisms and the legislative provisions applying to the industry, we fully support the Commission proposal to promote the dissemination of information on the common fisheries policy. We would be delighted if the Commission finally decided to make an effort to improve information. The Commissioner himself, when he last appeared before the committee, acknowledged that this was absolutely essential. Mr� Fischler said that we have a marketing problem and that the information on, and defence of, our model must be improved. This involves both information provided to the fishing industry, which, in many cases, lacks awareness or understanding of its own situation, and information provided by the industry.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the Committee on Fisheries, I have frequently been surprised by this deep lack of understanding, among the general public, of a common fisheries policy which is of enormous importance to many Member States and to the EU as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the information provided to the fishing industry, we would ask the Commission to take note of the circumstances in which many fishermen are living. Not everyone has access to the new technologies which is why information campaigns must use all the media available to us, including the most traditional. In this respect, I must highlight the work of the written press, which is increasingly concerned about the future of fishing in Europe, and also that of radio and television which are democratic media available to everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I must draw the Commission’s attention to the representative nature of the organisations within the Advisory Committee. Dialogue between the Commission and those involved in the industry is essential. Yet if this dialogue is to be fruitful, those involved must be genuinely representative of the various sectors affected by the common fisheries policy. However, neither the Commission proposal nor the rules governing the Advisory Committee contain mechanisms to ensure that this is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, in such a fragmented industry, which is scattered over wide areas and which has little history of forming associations, it is difficult to ensure that the Commission’s partners in the dialogue at Community level are reliable representatives of the sector concerned. With a view to enhancing their representativeness, it would perhaps be desirable for the Commission to take initiatives to boost the membership of existing trade organisations as an accompanying measure alongside those it is already undertaking. The representatives of the industry chosen as partners for the dialogue with the Commission, namely the members of the Advisory Committee, must represent the common interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We in the European Parliament have, for years now, been conducting an intensive dialogue with the fishing industry. We also accompany delegations to Europe’s fishing regions in order to ask the relevant questions on the spot. In that way, we can gain a better insight into the problems of those who have to live and work with the European regulations on a daily basis. This week, I was a guest at the Green Week, the agricultural show in Berlin, where I engaged in a dialogue of this kind with representatives from the German fisheries sector. The subject is extremely topical and highly explosive, especially as we are on the threshold of the reform of the European common fisheries policy in the year 2002. </p>
<p class="contents">Basically, the policy has to ensure that all interests are properly taken into account and, above all, that the result is the sustainable exploitation of fishing resources. </p>
<p class="contents">Communication between the fisheries sector and the institutions of the Community must be a two-way process. Industry must articulate its requirements and communicate them to the Commission. On the other hand, the Commission has to prepare and make known the relevant stipulations and decisions. What is being sought is a dialogue, not a monologue. This is something which the Commission has acknowledged, and only by being aware – as, more than anyone else, the people affected are aware – of the problem areas, the difficulties and the possible ways of solving these, will it be possible to make appropriate decisions in the future. </p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve this goal, the Commission has taken two steps. By means of the proposed regulation in question, the Commission is aiming – quite rightly – to strengthen the European professional associations. Dialogue can, of course, only be carried on if, without compromising their independence, the relevant discussion partners in the fisheries sector are also given financial support to enable them to participate at all in the discussions in Brussels. Approximately EUR 400 000 have this year been set aside for that purpose. The success of the dialogue will, of course, depend entirely upon how clearly the Commission is able, by means of educational initiatives, to explain the complex technical aspects on the spot in the regions. </p>
<p class="contents">I therefore vigorously support the Commission’s present initiative. At the same time, I must, however, point out a major reservation. In fact, this concerns the second step which Mrs Miguélez has also explained to us here. It is about the reform of the important Advisory Committee on Fisheries. This is the basis for the dialogue. Why was the European Parliament not consulted when what was at issue was the form and organisation of the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture and the tasks to be carried out by this very important interface and coordinating point for the much sought after dialogue? This is a failure that we shall continue to criticise. </p>
<p class="contents">Further small reservations I have concern the difficulty of finding genuine representatives of the various sectors of the fisheries industry, given its fragmented structure with its geographical diversity and weak structure in terms of professional associations. Here, it is a question of at last creating practical conditions. However, this also presupposes our perhaps giving some consideration to a new organisational structure for the fisheries sector. Of course, that is always assuming that the fishermen concerned have confidence, on the one hand, in the policy and, on the other hand, in the European common fisheries policy in particular. </p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore ask of you that we in future make the most strenuous efforts in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the complaints lodged by the Dutch MEPs was that this proposal does not sufficiently take into account the agreements reached in the Netherlands between the government and the fisheries sector to facilitate observance of the fishing quota on a voluntary basis. When there is a possibility to conclude voluntary agreements upon proper consultation between the government and social organisations which have the same effect as legislation, the Dutch Labour Party has a preference for such agreements over unnecessary interference from above. This, of course, also applies at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, therefore, also very pleased with the report of Mrs Miguélez Ramos. Although we had strong differences of opinion regarding the Cunha report, I fully back her proposals to give reinforcement to the Advisory Committee on Fisheries. I congratulate her on her report. I would only make one comment. The Advisory Committee can only function properly if it represents the different sectors involved in the fisheries policy and if all the Union’s fishing nations are represented in the committee. This is not yet the case. </p>
<p class="contents">Our Group will therefore vote in favour of Amendment No 3. In this way, it hopes to bring some pressure to bear on this issue. I also call upon the European Commission to ensure that the Advisory Committee is, and continues to be, representative in the sense that I have just described.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I can inform you that my Group will be voting in favour of the resolution tabled by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, since this resolution makes a major contribution to the European Union’s fisheries policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hudghton (Greens/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, anything which is designed to encourage and foster closer dialogue is to be welcomed and closer dialogue with the fishing and aquaculture industry is something that must be encouraged. But not only the industry; we must widen the dialogue to include associations which are active in the environmental and development fields and allow for an increased role of specialised research bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">A two-way flow of communication must be encouraged, not just one-way communication. My party has always advocated greater consultation with the industry. Indeed, a key advantage of a regionally-based approach to the CFP would be the involvement of those directly affected, the fishermen themselves, in the decisions which affect them, thereby furthering the goal of conserving fish stocks through sustainable fishing and offering long-term viability for the fishing-dependent communities within Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to any reform of the Advisory Committee as part of the current Europe-wide assessment of the CFP, we have another opportunity for Europe to find better ways to involve fishermen in the execution of fisheries responsibilities, by expanding the principle of regionalisation. Involving the industry and other interested parties in the localities would provide a system which more adequately reflects the needs of the fishing industry and promotes, rather than hampers, compliance with the CFP.</p>
<p class="contents">Ensuring that we have proper consultation with civil society too, in particular fisheries and environmental NGOs, will ensure that the Community fisheries policy adequately reflects the aims of conservation and sustainable development in the fisheries sector. But NGO involvement needs to be meaningful, not just token, and we need to work hard to ensure that is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Integrating those engaged in fishing-related industries into the decision-making processes and supporting the fishermen are prerequisites for the success of any future fisheries policy and an essential element of the CFP. Yesterday, we had some controversy over parts of the Cunha report, particularly the suggestion of quota penalties.

The Commission has mainly chosen as its partners organisations which are represented in the Community. We do not want the Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture to act as a mouthpiece to protect national interests. It does, however, at least from the point of view of Finland and the Baltic Sea. Membership of EUROPÊCHE, which is represented in the Community, is too costly for Finnish fishermen. They cannot become involved in the organisation, as they cannot afford the membership fees. Their interests are therefore not protected in those organisations the Commission has chosen to be its partners. The fishermen cannot afford to be represented in the EU, but the fish breeders can. They are the capitalists of the fishing industry. That casts a strange light on the EU fisheries policy in our country. We just listen to the voice of the fish breeders, the capitalists, but not that of the proletariat, the professionals that catch the fish freely in the open seas, in other words, the fishermen. Besides, we in the Nordic countries also fish in internal waters, which the EU does not take into account.</p>
<p class="contents">This representation in supranational organisations is a problematic issue, as the EU does not focus sufficient attention on it. The supranational organisation, EUROPÊCHE, is ineffectual. It is unrepresentative, and its decisions are not binding on member organisations, but it is the size of Member States and money that decide issues, and what are called supranational interests are, in fact, national interests. It is the Commission’s important task to apply this regulation in such a way that the organisations that are represented in the Community acquire a better level of representation, and that the voice of those fishermen who cannot afford to join EU-level organisations that might represent their interests is heard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group can do no other than express their agreement with the intentions of a proposal for a regulation which aims at strengthening dialogue with workers in the fishing sector. We must say, however, at the same time, that some of the methods used to organise this dialogue have confused us considerably. </p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the necessary strengthening of dialogue. The common fisheries policy is applicable to all European Union operators, but it must deal with a wide range of situations, with variations in fishing grounds, the home ports of vessels, traditions, the gear used, organisation of the market at local level, etc. This is true to such an extent, indeed, that some thinkers have wondered whether well-coordinated national policies would not be preferable to a single common policy. Whatever the case, since today there is just one policy in force and the situations of fishing sector workers are so varied, it is all the more important to establish very close liaison with them in order to better take their needs into consideration and to overcome the harmful effects of some regulations, or even avoid the failure, pure and simple, to implement this regulation, a phenomenon occasionally observed, unfortunately, due to the regulation’s total lack of regard for real conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the members of our Group will be voting in favour of the three amendments tabled today, whose purpose is to improve the operation of the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture, to bring it closer to the workers of the sector and to the requirements of national states, and finally to request that the Commission presents an annual report to Council and to the European Parliament on the debates of that body. The fact is that all the Community institutions, not just the Commission, have an interest in this debate in order to be able to contribute to orientation of the common fisheries policy in line, naturally, with the interests of our fishing fleets.</p>
<p class="contents">All the same, we find some aspects of the reform extremely disturbing, as the Commission is introducing a wide range of pressure groups into the Advisory Committee, generally groups with connections in Brussels, which are dedicated to extremely noble causes – development, environment, consumer issues, etc. And at the same time, alongside the fishermen, using Community financing, the Commission would like to increase the importance of European professional bodies which, for the time being, exist only on paper. It looks as if the Commission is seeking to import masses of miscellaneous participants to provide a counterbalance to the national bodies which are themselves properly structured, well established and truly representative. It is as if the Commission were trying to get out of a discussion with some negotiators that are hard to handle and to create a completely new conciliation structure that would be more kindly disposed towards the Commission, and which would reflect its own pleasant image of itself and its plans, and that is exactly what it expects.</p>
<p class="contents">On an even more worrying note, in the end one wonders how many other sectors have already been organised in this way and whether a vast network of associations or organisations with no truly representative nature, financed chiefly by Community subsidies and participating in largely artificial consultation, has not already been constructed in Brussels. The case we are examining today leads us to think that this hypothesis may well be the correct one. In such conditions, the Brussels institutions should not be surprised to find themselves losing touch with public opinion. Member States would do well to take this matter seriously if they do not shortly wish to see the national democracies they represent ousted by insubstantial pressure groups.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the sector which is of immediate concern to us, the fisheries sector, we consider it absolutely essential to ensure that the various members of the Advisory Committee are truly representative. All the Member States involved in fishing activities must be represented, as must the workers involved in those activities. These are the parties we should be relying on, not artificial organisations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important that the Commission knows what is happening at grassroots level. We do not need a Commission which imposes rules from its ivory tower. Consultation with the sectors is necessary to avoid issuing rules which cannot be implemented in practice. A dialogue is also necessary in order to gain a clear insight into the different interests, so that balanced decisions can be taken. </p>
<p class="contents">With the present draft regulation, the Commission aims to give reinforcement to the European trade organisations. There is certainly something to be said for that. It is in the interest of both the fisheries sector and the Commission to have one European umbrella organisation in place. As regards the fisheries sector, it is an important platform for heightening the Commission’s awareness of common interests and the Commission will have a better idea where it is at if the sector uses one and the same mouthpiece. </p>
<p class="contents">We should not, however, lose sight of the fact that the fisheries sector is pre-eminently a sector with tremendous national contrasts. Talk to any ordinary fisherperson and you will find out that, in their experience, there are no European fishing people. The European fleet consists of fishing people who are Belgian, Danish, Dutch, etc. and, to a large extent, they are each other’s competitors. The average fisherperson, therefore, has more confidence in his/her national interest group than in a European one where the office mainly consists of representatives from other Member States. We should not lose sight of this reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we should not see a European organisation as a replacement but rather an addition to national organisations. The European Commission should keep the lines of communication open with these national organisations as well. </p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the amendment which my Group has submitted concerning the Advisory Committee. Admittedly, the Commission has not asked us for an opinion regarding the composition of this committee, but the Commission will hopefully excuse me for giving it an unprompted opinion nevertheless. </p>
<p class="contents">On 16 July 1999, the Commission and industry agreed on a compromise regarding the new Advisory Committee. They came to the agreement that all EU Member States, insofar as they are fishing nations, should be represented in this committee. Conflicts of interest, as already stated, make it impossible for various members of the trade organisations to give their mandate to someone of a different nationality. </p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the Advisory Committee has convened in its new form. Unfortunately, however, I have to note that little is left of the agreed balance. In the committee, some nationalities are heavily over-represented, whilst a number of other Member States are conspicuous by their absence. To the former chairman of the Advisory Committee, under whose directorship the compromise came about, this was even reason to refuse to chair the first meeting of the committee. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission might well argue that representativeness is more than just fair distribution across the Member States. This is true of course. There should also be a fair distribution across the sectors. What I would like to ascertain from the Commission, however, is the following: “Why did you fail to act upon the compromise of 16 July which clearly states that there should also be a balanced distribution in terms of nationalities?” </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to address the Commission with an urgent recommendation. Do reconsider the composition of the new Advisory Committee. If you want to establish a proper dialogue with the sectors involved, if you attach importance to creating a basis for your policy, make sure there is a representative consultative body. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is absurd that the Commission did not consult Parliament or the Council on reforming the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and yet it is consulting us on this proposal for a regulation to strengthen the dialogue between the Commission and the fishing industry.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that the Commission did not consult us on the primary regulations but is doing so on the accompanying aspects. It did not consult us on the regulations establishing the dialogue but is doing so on how to strengthen this dialogue now it has been established. Yet the Commission’s reforms of such an important body as the Advisory Committee, which is the only body to involve the fishing industry in decisions affecting it, have prompted serious criticisms and doubts in Parliament, in the Council and in the industry itself. These criticisms involve the fact that a large part of the industry actually involved in fishing is not sufficiently represented on this new committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, in short, the financial resources in the proposal are welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">It only remains for me to congratulate Mrs� Miguélez Ramos on her report and, in particular, to defend the amendment which imposes the obligation to present Parliament with an annual report on the substance and conclusions of the debates of the working groups created by this regulation. I must also applaud the request contained in the opinion by Mr� Gallagher, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, for detailed reports on the distribution of funds among the various Member States and organisations which may benefit by this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I support this report and congratulate the rapporteur on her work. The Socialist Group welcomes the Commission reform of the Advisory Committee on Fisheries to create a more fruitful two-way dialogue between the Commission and the industry. We welcome the inclusion in the Advisory Committee of new sectors of the industry and the greater diversity of professional sectors involved, particularly those in aquaculture and marketing.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the reduction in the number of members in the Plenary Committee in the interest of greater efficiency. We all know the danger of proliferating numbers at the expense of efficiency. The Commission seems to have taken that into account. We welcome the increased role of the research organisations and the establishment of the four working groups on: firstly, access to fisheries resources and their management; secondly, aquaculture, fish, molluscs and shellfish; thirdly, marketing and trade policy; fourthly, economic and structural sectoral analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">We like the priority for Community-level organisations to try and avoid nationalising the debate, but we recognise that there need to be some national inputs at the appropriate levels.</p>
<p class="contents">We will give this report our support, while promising to maintain a close watch to ensure that the structural changes that promise much actually deliver in practice; and that the new Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture acts as an effective sounding board for all sectors and all sides of the industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the other hand, I represent – on the west of Scotland particularly – a very large number of fisherpersons and their families and fragile communities whose existence is dependent upon the continuation of a successful fishing industry in the European Community and upon a proper sensitivity of the Community to those fragile and often remote regions of the Community which depend most upon it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a very laudable thing to say that the Advisory Committee on Fisheries should not simply be a gathering place for national interests, especially if national interests are interpreted exclusively in terms of the interests of the Member States, taken according to the principles of proportional equality in which the Member States are represented in the organs of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another kind of equality which would be proportional to the effort engaged in the industry and indeed, proportional to the amount of sea waters and seaboard that different regions of this great Community bring into it.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask Members to carry out a little experiment. Imagine expelling Scotland from the Community. How much fishing industry would you have left? Now contemplate this question: how effectively is the voice of the Scottish fishing industry represented in the institutions of the Community, as we have them just now? The answer is: not very effectively at all! Therefore, it would indeed be a good thing if this report were to achieve a much more satisfactory representation of the fishing people, of the environmental interest and of the other civil society interests.</p>

The strengthening of dialogue between the Commission and the industry affected by the common fisheries policy is very important and has many social repercussions.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the rapporteur, I must underline how curious it is that the Commission is consulting Parliament on aspects which we might regard as being secondary in the organisation of this dialogue. Yet it did not ask this House about the composition, organisation and functions of the Advisory Committee on Fisheries which is the key body in this dialogue.</p>

First of all, the principle of subsidiarity is observed, the countries are sufficiently involved, and secondly, sufficient consideration is given to organisations or the social mainstream. In this sense, I am pleased that a reinforced Advisory Committee is to be set up which can possibly exert more influence on the fisheries policy. So far, so good.</p>
<p class="contents">I am less impressed, however, with the actual implementation. I have to note that the proposal is lacking in two areas at least. To start with, not all Member States are represented, which is very poor indeed. After all, this Parliament also believes in the subsidiarity of Member States. This means that Member States with a major fisheries sector cannot be left out. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if the social mainstream and organisations are to be involved in the fisheries policy, this should be done in a balanced and proper way, recognising just how important geographic distribution is. On this score, the proposal is simply inadequate. </p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that, together with other Members, Mr Van Dam, among others, I would still ask that an Advisory Committee be set up which has an important role to play, but which must represent the entire sector Europe-wide. In practical terms, this means that all fishing nations of the Union have to be represented in the committee. </p>
<p class="contents">In the former Advisory Committee, agreement was reached on this between the sector and the Commission. In my view, also from a Christian Democratic viewpoint, the fact that this was overlooked in the present proposals submitted by the trade organisations is most unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps I should say the nails, as there are two fundamental issues here, which various speakers have already commented on and which this Parliament cannot fail to note.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that we are surprised, or rather amazed, that Parliament should now be heard on procedural aspects of the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture, when it was not heard at the time the Council’s membership was discussed. Last year, as we all know, the Commission approved, on its own initiative, Decision 478/99, which created this Advisory Committee. It did not listen to Parliament on a subject as important as the representativeness of fishing organisations and their importance to formulating and managing the common policy. I find it incomprehensible that Parliament should not have been heard. It is a real mystery. Sometimes people’s reasons defy reason itself. I do not know if there is some reason of which I am not aware for Parliament not being heard.</p>
<p class="contents">My second observation is that we have many doubts as to how representative these bodies actually are. For example, a country such as my own, Portugal, which is a large fishing nation in European Union terms, the fifth-largest in terms of the size of its fleet, is not appropriately represented here. I am astonished. I find it a total mystery.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude the second issue, or to hit the second nail on the head, and bearing in mind these shortcomings in the Advisory Committee and in its representativeness, it is crucial that financial aid for other organisations which are not part of the Advisory Committee be earmarked and set aside. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is useful to make this effort to promote better dialogue between the European Union and those involved in fisheries. In the part of the European Union I come from, a peripheral region, we have always had particular difficulty in selling the idea of a common fisheries policy to fishermen.</p>
<p class="contents">Since Mr MacCormick has brought up the subject – and I have referred to it before – the position is difficult for Ireland because if you took Ireland out of the European Union, you would take a lot of fish with you. Traditionally, Irish fishermen did not catch those fish, because as some people will know, there was a period in our history when it was forbidden by law to put fish into Irish vessels. That situation largely continued until the beginning of this century, and so people were still fishing in outdated curraghs 20 years before we joined the European Union. In any case, it is a fact of life that something like EUR 700 million worth of fish – and perhaps even more because the price of fish has changed – comes out of Irish waters. As a result of the reduction in the structural funds allocated to Ireland, because of its economic growth, the value of fish taken out of what would be Irish waters if there was no European Union will be greater in a couple of years time than the total amount of structural funds coming to Ireland. That makes this proposal even more difficult to sell.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not aware that the same is true in any other country of the European Union. Scotland, as part of the United Kingdom, takes its natural share along with the United Kingdom, but Ireland is the one country which does not. This is the only natural resource which I know all Member States concede as common property of the European Union. That does not mean that we do not need to proceed with this dialogue. The extension of the 20-mile limit, which Parliament has agreed to, might be part of the solution and might help to satisfy local fishermen, giving them more control over their lives. I do not want renationalisation, but regionalisation would certainly help the problems of Scotland and Ireland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, I would like to start by saying that the frequent legislative changes in the area of the common fisheries policy illustrate the fact that things are really happening in this sector. This is something which was not quite so readily reflected in the way the previous Advisory Committee on Fisheries operated and so this legislative proposal has been drafted. The purpose of this proposal is to create a more effective and genuine relationship between the Commission and the Advisory Committee on Fisheries. </p>
<p class="contents">It took the Commission three years to draft this proposal. In 1997, a survey was carried out by an independent office, from which two main ideas emerged. The first was that the common fisheries policy now extends beyond the fishing industry and concerns the whole of society. This is something we must take into account. The second was that the Advisory Committee’s mode of operation did not meet the requirements for handling complex issues. </p>
<p class="contents">The legislative proposal therefore falls into three categories. The first is the reform of the Advisory Committee, which now consists of 20 members instead of 45, with participation from fisheries organisations making up 60%, industrial and commercial enterprises within the sector 25%, and environmental organisations 15%. The Commission has thus endeavoured to consult not only professionals and entrepreneurs, but also society as a whole. The second part of the legislative proposal concerns measures to aid the representative organisations of those involved with the common fisheries policy and, in particular, European professional fishing organisations. The third part concerns improving communication between the DG for Fisheries and these groups. </p>
<p class="contents">The legislative proposal touches upon the latter two points, but I would like to reiterate that there were lengthy deliberations over the final proposal as regards the actual composition of the committee. On 26 October, the Council examined this proposal for the first time and is now awaiting the opinion of Parliament so that it can get on with its work. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to commend Mrs Ramos in particular on the exceptional quality of her report, as well as Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries for its excellent cooperation and contribution to this text. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment on the amendments and to express the Commission’s view on the matter. Three amendments have been tabled by the parliamentary committee. The first concerns Parliament’s desire to exercise tight control over payments to professional organisations so that they closely correspond to the purposes set out in the legislative proposal. The Commission agrees and accepts this proposal. </p>
<p class="contents">As regards the second amendment, the Commission obviously agrees with Parliament’s view as regards access to information concerning the work of the committee and the numerous debates it holds. However, drawing up an annual report of all this activity would be an extremely arduous task for the already overburdened directorate for community fishing and would not necessarily lend any added value. </p>
<p class="contents">The third amendment encompasses the second and refers to the representativeness of the Advisory Committee, that is the participation of all nationalities. We agree that, within the Committee, the whole sector must be safeguarded and represented on an equal basis, but we are uncertain as to the extent to which – and this is something which came up both in the survey and in discussions – this balance should be based on nationality. The Commission proposed to assist European organisations, which are entirely free to regulate national representation or representation of certain groups wherever they see fit. </p>
<p class="contents">In closing, I would like to say that the Commission adopts Amendment No 1 which calls on the Community to tighten its financial control, but it considers it advisable, for the aforementioned reasons, to reject Amendments Nos 2 and 3. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am telling you this to explain why I am interested in fishing and why I voted for this measure.

Perhaps Parliament failed to do so because it was tamely bowing to opposition expressed during the debate by Commissioner Diamantopoulou. This result is incomprehensible, given that, in the same debate, there was widespread criticism of the Commission for not having consulted Parliament when membership of the Advisory Committee for Fisheries was being reformed. Amendment No 3 was the only one which covered this issue, and it had the vital aim of guaranteeing that this advisory structure is genuinely representative and that it moves beyond its unbalanced and largely notional character. It is unfortunate that even in a matter as simple as this, the common fisheries policy is still poorly served.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
