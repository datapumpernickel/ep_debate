<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Rothley </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 3 December the European Parliament adopted by a qualified majority a draft Statute that was moderate, balanced, clearly reasonable, simple and practical and certainly also had a certain intellectual charm. By a qualified majority! To date we have not had any response from the Council to the draft. The Council can accept or reject it, but if it rejects it it must give its reasons so that we can verify whether they are legitimate. Instead the Council has put forward its own draft which is not acceptable to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, it has established a permanent inequality by giving Member States the right to subject the incomes of Members of Parliament to national taxation. The three Scandinavian Member States and the United Kingdom have now made use of this option, and France may do the same. It may no longer be on the agenda for the German Presidency, however, as it can no longer approve it.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we not only have the new draft from the Council, but attempts are also being made in this House to adopt a different text tomorrow, with a motion from the Liberal Group. How politically stupid does one have to be to change a text that Parliament has adopted by a qualified majority before we have even negotiated with the Council on it? The Council will probably say: if we wait for another three or four months Parliament might adopt another new text and another one again another three months after that. I have to say that the potential for self‐destruction in this Parliament is enormous! Every new text is simply weakening Parliament"s position.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, how can you expect your colleagues to vote on a constitution that is supposed to solve all their existential problems without having had the chance to discuss them in committee and without the groups even having had the chance to discuss them! Do you expect us to be able to vote on such a text? That is ridiculous.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wijsenbeek, we discussed my original text in this House very thoroughly and in great detail, and the result was a qualified majority. This was a huge step forward, and now you want to turn it around! I do not know what your reasons are, but they are not very important. The European Parliament should not decide on a constitutional text in haste. And Parliament would be well advised only to adopt such a text if there is a broad consensus on it in the House.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, there will be no Statute this week. The Council is not aware of any forthcoming negotiations. When are they to take place? They will never take place! How can we expect governments that have already said that they will use the opt‐out clause to agree tomorrow to allow us equality? This is nonsense. We really are clutching at straws here. There will be no Statute this week. It is as simple as that.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that it makes more sense to follow the recommendation of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights and to say that we confirm Parliament"s resolution of 3 December 1998. We are of course prepared to negotiate with the Council, and we should have concluded the negotiations by the end of October. The Statute can enter into force on 1 November, 1 December or 1 January. So why not? There is absolutely no problem with this. But today – and I will conclude here – we must say a clear no to all attempts to change Parliament"s text of 3 December 1998.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Medina Ortega </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, a great many accusations could be levelled against Members of the European Parliament, but they could never be accused of putting their own interests first, because on the occasion of a debate on their own rights, privileges, interests and immunities, the House is practically deserted, as you can see. Our own interests are clearly not a matter of great priority for us as Members of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say however that I do not share the apocalyptic vision presented by my colleague and good friend Willi Rothley on what has happened to relations between Parliament and the Council. According to Article 190(5) of the Treaty, ‘the European Parliament shall, after seeking an opinion from the Commission and with the approval of the Council acting unanimously, lay down the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the duties of its Members".</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Council – and the governments – have demonstrated their goodwill towards Parliament. Firstly, they agreed to something we felt it would be difficult to achieve: the inclusion of this very article in the Treaty of Amsterdam. We in Parliament had requested it, but we expected the Council – or the governments – to disagree. Secondly, Parliament"s proposal on the matter received a prompt reply. In other words, the Council studied the matter very quickly and presented us with its opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption procedure referred to in Article 190 is not the assent procedure. The assent procedure is used in connection with international treaties, because once the text of the treaty has been agreed, it cannot be changed by Parliament. Parliament cannot amend an international treaty, and that is why we have the assent procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are dealing with here is an adoption procedure. The Council has to give its unanimous approval to what Parliament presents. Parliament then makes the final decision. I do feel however that the Council has shown goodwill in this case. The Council has put forward an alternative text which it would be prepared to accept. In so doing, the Council has suggested a way of ensuring unanimity amongst its members.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we have the impression that the Council is not totally entrenched in its position. Some of the proposals in the Council"s text are unreasonable, such as the references to national taxation. It would obviously be incompatible with Community rules for Member States to obtain additional funds by taxing Members of the European Parliament. It would amount to a kind of additional Cohesion Fund. Nevertheless, the Liberal Group have tabled an amendment that many Members are prepared to support. It is based on the text presented by the Council with the opposite aim in mind. In our view, the text of the amendment stands a good chance of being approved by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In essence, what is at issue is a principle established by the case‐law of the Court of Justice: the principle of loyal collaboration between the institutions. Parliament makes a proposal which requires Council authorisation. The Council lays down the conditions for authorisation and Parliament has the chance to study and discuss them again. There is therefore no need to overreact. I believe that the stability and definition of the legal basis are of great importance for Parliament and its Members. Parliament and the Council should therefore continue to work together to this end. We should not entertain the thought of confrontation without any compromise solution.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Palacio Vallelersundi </span> <span class="bold"> (PPE). – </span><span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, Parliament and the Council are of one mind. We agree that uniform arrangements for Members of the European Parliament are necessary, that they must be in place soon and that they must be suitable, although we do have certain reservations as to their suitability. Nevertheless, I share Mr Medina Ortega"s view that it should be possible to resolve our difficulties in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first place, I should like to make it quite clear that there is no difference of opinion in Parliament regarding the basic salary for Members of the European Parliament, a matter which has provoked much interest amongst the general public. Parliament and the Council are agreed on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Where we differ is on the interpretation of the Treaty, on how we understand European law. I shall quote a few examples. Firstly, we cannot accept different arrangements for Members from different Member States. Parliament is no longer simply an assembly composed of representatives from national governments without any power to act for itself. This change must be appreciated by everyone, and the Statute appreciates it. Parliament has been representing the people of Europe for a good many years now. We are therefore seeking a uniform statute which takes account of the present situation, as provided for in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Medina referred to the law of treaties. Reserve is a standard cutting tool used in public international law. Reserve is also the tool chosen by the Council to rush through what amounts to de‐communitarisation, differentiation and discrimination between Members of the European Parliament. We are fundamentally opposed to the method chosen. Clearly, we are required to reach an agreement, so if the method has to be retained, it should be subject to a time restriction and covered by transitional arrangements with a clearly defined time limit. This is the only way to a solution, because I think this is the most important point. Of course we would like to see a statute in place but not if that meant sacrificing its very essence: equal treatment for all Members of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also uphold Parliament"s rights. It is not a case of defending them against attack, but of upholding them for the benefit of all, because the Treaty requires a particular interinstitutional balance and none other. Given that the Treaty lays down an extremely unusual procedure insofar as it is for Parliament to devise a text and for the Council to approve it, we ought not suddenly and surreptitiously to disrupt that balance. Let us agree to start with what we have before us, discuss matters and reach an agreement as soon as possible. Nevertheless, it is essential for each party to be quite clear as to its role under the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the only difficulty we have at present. There are areas where the actual role of Member of Parliament is unacceptable to us. I could quote the clear example of the pension scheme, which is neither logical nor acceptable. Parliament has now come of age and the Statute should therefore allow it room for manoeuvre on clearly defined issues such as its own rights. This is the idea behind the basic text and the annexes. Provision would therefore be made for all the necessary arrangements relating to the implementation of this Statute in a different way from that laid down in Article 190(5). This article is cumbersome and calls for unanimity in the Council. It could almost be said that a number of mechanisms are unreasonable and lacking in proportion. Greater flexibility is called for so that specific points can be changed to suit the real situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I have every confidence that a solution will soon be found. As I conclude my final speech of this parliamentary term, replying to Mr Rothley on behalf of the European People"s Party, I am put in mind of a splendid speech made in the Spanish constituent assembly which drafted our 1812 constitution. One member of that assembly said to another that he would defend his own arguments steadfastly and passionately whilst remaining loyal to his opponent. Mr Rothley is worthy of the same treatment. Thank you, Mr Rothley, for your work on this report and on all the others for which you have been rapporteur before this House.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Thors </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, I have to say that Mr Rothley has been consistent. Throughout the whole procedure, he has endeavoured to put a stop to it. If the Liberals had not forced the pace of the discussions in the Legal Affairs Committee, there would have been no report on 3 December. Mr Rothley did not think there would be. If we had not driven it home in all the capital cities of the Member States that we should speed up the deliberations in the Council, then I do not think this would have materialised. But the position adopted by Mr Rothley has been consistent.</p>
<p class="contents">I am quite sure that if we do not reach a decision now, reform will be brushed aside in the future, and we shall not achieve what we would like to do, namely to get rid of the lack of clarity surrounding pay and allowances before the June elections.</p>
<p class="contents">My sense of legal justice is deeply offended by the way in which the law is being used as a shield by so many people against what they do not want to face, or in order to avoid saying what is really at issue. There is an old expression: the end justifies the means.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is rather strange that after many rounds of negotiations with the Council, it is then suddenly announced, just before the finishing post, that it is not possible to alter Parliament's position. That is illogical and we cannot accept it. We Liberals have been prepared to accept, for the most part, the position of the Council. My view is that we would then have a unique legitimacy. Unlike many other parliaments, we would have rules governing our salaries which are laid down in conjunction with another democratic body. We would be able to combine the best of the Member States' traditions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital that we now have a system where the rules governing what is acceptable in terms of expenses are clear, and we must have greater transparency when dealing with resources.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the Liberals are the first to have tabled an amendment which aims to ensure a compromise, and which I hope can be adopted by the House tomorrow and accepted by the Council. Most of the points in the amendment refer to aspects that have already been approved by Parliament. Finally, I should like to put a question to the rapporteur: what is there in our compromise proposal that he is unable to approve?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Sierra González </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, it is difficult to contain certain feelings of indignation when discussing the Statute for Members and all it involves. This indignation is due to the atmosphere in which the debates have been held, under pressure from the claims made by some in the media which resulted in the debate becoming rather unbalanced.</p>
<p class="contents">As we are all aware, these circumstances combined to create unnecessary tension. This was not at all helpful as we sought to achieve our aim: establishing a unified legal status for all Members.</p>
<p class="contents">At this juncture we find that the pressures which had a negative influence on discussion of the report have been considerably aggravated by the imminence of the elections. Nevertheless, we must keep two points very much in mind. The first is formal in nature: as the rapporteur stated, the Council has infringed Article 190(5) of the Treaty. Secondly, the Statute must be adopted during this parliamentary term. Further, its adoption must entail collaboration between both institutions, Parliament and the Council. It is certainly not acceptable for the Council to present a proposal to Parliament expecting it to be approved. Such an approach calls Parliament"s independence into question. Nevertheless, Parliament and the Council must find a way of cooperating with a view to adopting the Statute.</p>
<p class="contents">Outright rejection of the Council"s proposal does not seem wise if we are to move ahead with the Statute according to the agreed timetable. Therefore, although I agree with the rapporteur"s criticisms of the form and content of the proposal, I am in favour of urgent collaboration and negotiation between Parliament and the Council so that work on the Statute can be concluded and the Statute adopted.</p>

Why? The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights is saying that the Council must not put forward its own proposal and has to support Parliament"s proposal. But how is it possible, I would then ask Mr Rothley, that you have spent three months negotiating with this selfsame Council in the knowledge that the Council, which has to reach a decision by unanimity, would very probably put forward amendments? I find that a particularly feeble argument.</p>
<p class="contents">The gist of what those opposed to this are saying is really that Parliament should defy the Council and not allow it to walk all over us. You know my group. We are usually in favour, but not now, not on this matter. The danger is that Parliament will lose sight of everything except procedural mistakes and problems over the implementation of certain parts. Those exist, it is true. But supporting the Rothley report will mean that the European Parliament shows itself to be both touchy and short‐sighted. There is no solution which pleases everyone completely, but I think that we should settle for half a loaf rather than no bread. That means giving and taking. My group is willing to do that. Together with the Liberal Group, we have tabled an amendment which makes changes to the Council proposal. It contains things which I do not agree with, in all honesty – and that goes for the majority of my group as well. But we are very keen to do absolutely everything possible to reach a solution this week and to adopt a statute this week.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not manage it, if we do not get a statute this week or in the very near future, I wish all Members of the House good luck as they confront a public opinion which will justifiably wonder whether there is anyone at all in the European Parliament who has the slightest sense of responsibility.</p>

And that is exactly what happened to the European Parliament when it gave responsibility for this issue to Mr Rothley, whose intellectual honesty I would never question but whose strategy – as you know – I find very unsound.</p>
<p class="contents">We wanted to have our voice heard and we are now in fact having to square up to a Council which, needless to say, within the space of 48 hours, is presenting us with its own version, the way it, the Council, wants to deal with Members of this House, including allowances, mission expenses and so on. Before we know where we are, the Council will also be deciding on the level of pay to which we are entitled, whether or not we should sign up and at what level. And that is all because this suicidal – and I do mean suicidal – strategy of seeking to fit in with the Council's approach was adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">We ought to have demanded the right to give ourselves a statute – that ought to have been the strategy! – a statute with a capital ‘S", covering incompatibility, Members' privileges and status, but not our financial arrangements, which are an internal matter. But we went for a different strategy: we decided that the Rothley line was the one to follow, and here we are today with Mr Rothley himself complaining that the whole thing is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">But the damage has been done and clearly, yet again, the Council has us cornered. All of us, from the Greens to the Liberals and the rest, fretting over three newspaper articles, will tomorrow be compelled to accept the Council text. I hope that we do not accept it; I hope, ladies and gentlemen, that although we all want a statute, we reiterate tomorrow what we said on 3 December. I do not see why what was acceptable on 3 December, when some of those principles were affirmed, should not be voted for tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us perhaps proceed to the vote, but let us give the text on the Members' Statute real substance, or the opportunity will be lost to us.</p>

The secretaries‐general will now meet tomorrow morning to organise the voting.</p>
<p class="contents">My starting‐point in the Europe of Nations group is that we will vote in favour of the Council"s draft Statute, even though in principle we are strong opponents of turning Members of Parliament into EU officials. A common statute turns us into the EU's representatives in the Member States instead of the countries' representatives in the EU. In principle, we want to be paid the same as members of the national parliaments and to pay tax like the members of the public who vote for us. If we nonetheless feel able to vote for the Council's proposal, it is because in practice a majority of those here in Parliament want to continue claiming EUR 1 000 for a journey costing EUR 400, for example, and we give higher priority to cleaning up travel payments than to our objection in principle to common salaries and conditions of employment, and here we would particularly emphasise the fact there will be the possibility of taxing EU salaries nationally.</p>
<p class="contents">In the circumstances, the proposal which the Council has arrived at is a good one, and we recommend the Council to reach corresponding rules for the appointment of the new Commission and new civil servants in the institutions. The counter‐argument that there should be equal pay for equal work is not feasible when it comes to international cooperation. The Council's members would then have the same salary, staff at the EU countries' embassies would have a uniform salary and experts would have the same, regardless of whether they represent agricultural organisations from a poor or a rich country. Equal pay is a nice principle, but the countries are not yet the same, and at the moment it is more important to get rid of Parliament's wastefulness.</p>

I agree with some of the rapporteur"s criticisms. But nevertheless, we shall be throwing the baby out with the bath water if we approve this report tomorrow. We must after all have the courage to speak the truth. The imperfect Statute which the Council has submitted, and it can certainly be improved, is at any rate better, a great deal better, than what we have at present. More to the point, it is precisely because Parliament has never succeeded in putting its own house in order that we were firstly, and rightly, held to account by public opinion and secondly, equally rightly, that we are being treated like children by the Council of Ministers. It is totally inappropriate to invoke the subsidiarity principle in this report for our own ends, when we never apply that same subsidiarity principle when the interests of the people in our Member States are at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, I entirely agree with the minority opinion of Mr Fabre‐Aubrespy which is appended to the report. I would add that I am against the Europeanisation of our mandate, because I am in this Chamber to represent Flanders and not some kind of European superstate, because I am opposed to the tax advantages inherent in that Euro‐statute, and I therefore remain in favour of a national tax regime which taxes us in exactly the same way as our voters. There is still a good deal wrong with this Statute, I believe. Unless the amendments make major and fundamental changes to the Rothley report, we shall in principle be voting against tomorrow.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Barzanti </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, there are four basic reasons why the text as adjusted by the Council is not acceptable, in my view. In the first place, it seriously prejudices and curtails Parliament's autonomy, just when the Treaty of Amsterdam accords us prime responsibility – albeit within the framework of an appropriate interinstitutional agreement in which the Commission and the Council participate in full – for drawing up our Members' Statute, along with clear rules governing their material conditions of work. What we have here is not the kind of cooperation the Treaty requires, not comments on the text, but a whole new text, and we are being asked to take it or leave it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the text does not achieve the fundamental objective of equal treatment based on what are effectively equivalent allowances: the possibility of double taxation, at European and national level, is an outrage.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it rigidly determines a range of figures, rejecting a system of equal, flexible and evolving parameters, thereby penalising future Members of this House in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly and lastly, it lays down in detail administrative procedures which cover even secretarial expenditure, and the effect is to create detailed and unduly bureaucratic rules; this impinges on Parliament's own area of responsibility for adopting measures which the House should be drawing up independently, through its own internal bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore agree with the position taken by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights that the discussion should be continued in a constructive way and a text rapidly established which is satisfactory to all.</p>
<p class="contents">We all agree on the objectives that we wish to achieve. But it would be absurd to approve, in the form of a miracle amendment, a statute that has neither been properly discussed nor examined in great enough detail.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind the House that, along with the Statute, there are other crucial issues on the agenda. Ineligibility and incompatibility, for instance, the limit on the number of times Members may stand for re‐election, reducing the number of Members and resolving conflicts of interest. We have to take a stand against attempts to conceal what is effectively lobbyism, against the growing trend towards professional parliamentarians which is increasingly detracting from the function of democratic representation. Max Weber pointed out in a classic of its kind many years ago that even independent people will in general want to live for politics, stressing that, were this not the case, all parliaments would be left with no more than paid party officials representing specific interests.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, however we may vote, we each have a proper sense of our own dignity and take pride in the fact that a statute will be helpful and useful if it enables every representative of the people to enjoy real independence and freedom.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lehne </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what the Council has presented us with in the last week is in my view a double distortion of the content of the Treaty of Amsterdam. Article 190(5) states quite clearly that Parliament lays down a statute and the Council approves it. If a codecision procedure in the sense of Article 189(b) had been intended, the founding fathers of the Amsterdam Treaty would have written that the Article 189(b) procedure applied. But they did not do so. They expressly stated, with good reason, that the Article 190(5) procedure applies, in which Parliament lays down a specific text and the Council approves it.</p>
<p class="contents">But what the Council has now done is to present us with a completely new text. The only element that is the same is Article 1(1). The other 14 pages are different. With the best will in the world this cannot be described as an assent procedure. Added to this is the fact that the Council has doubly violated the spirit and meaning of the Treaty because it has violated the Treaty"s intention to establish equal treatment of MEPs by introducing a special tax to align MEPs" incomes with the national parliaments, and it restores this inequality by the back door, as it were. This is a double violation of the provisions of the Treaty. In my opinion we cannot as a result approve the Council"s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I consider it unacceptable for a freely elected Member of Parliament, a freely elected Parliament, to be treated like an employee of the Council and to have to engage in collective bargaining with it. This is particularly unacceptable as we adopted a very even and well‐balanced paper on this in the December part‐session, making MEPs" parliamentary allowances in future lower than those of the Members of Parliament of the three largest EU Member States in terms of population. For the Germans this means giving up almost DM 1 500 per month, to put it in concrete terms. I consider this to be very balanced.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, many of the provisions in the Council draft are impractical and unusable. Without going into detail, as time is short, I shall say quite bluntly that I feel some of the points, particularly those on medical cover and the calculation of pension rights, are malicious. The text presented here by the Liberals as an amendment is in my view already inadmissible because it changes the whole text and therefore contravenes Rule 125 of the Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force on 1 May, and Parliament has gained significantly more power as a result. If we were to approve the Council proposal and the Liberal amendment and not the paper drafted in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights under Mr Rothley, then we would be depriving ourselves of power again on a crucial issue that affects us directly. I cannot imagine that the House will do this at tomorrow"s vote. Therefore we support the Rothley report.</p>

It would destroy Parliament's reputation and spoil the pleasure of our work.</p>
<p class="contents">To my protesting colleagues in the large groups, I would say: you have held this up for long enough with all your explanations and legal hair‐splitting, which I have sat on two committees and listened to. Now try to be a bit constructive! To the Council of Ministers, I would say: stop wasting time on trivialities. The proposal which the Council of Ministers put forward was far too concerned with wanting to ‘make it better'. We Liberals are able to accept the Council's proposal, but we are proposing some modifications so that we can achieve majority support for it here in Parliament. If it still goes wrong, the voters will have to give their verdict in June.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in spite of everything I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, for accepting my proposal to allow countries with high rates of income tax to impose an additional tax on top of the EU tax.

This is because some people were more concerned about responding to pressure from the press than about moving towards greater transparency regardless of external pressures, some of which hardly seem appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">I must firstly set the scene. Following the extensive internal debate in April 1997, we indicated at a press conference the need to reform the allowance system and to have a common approach guaranteeing maximum transparency and greater control of all expenses. We said that in some cases travel allowances should be used to compensate for other expenses and that only journeys actually made should be reimbursed, with an amount corresponding to what these really cost. The distance and time of journeys were to be taken into account using a scale for the subsistence allowance applied through a new and appropriate instrument. Members were not to have equal remuneration but this would be linked to the salaries of members of parliament in their Member States of origin. These guidelines were defined by Mr Miranda in the Péry group and by myself in the Martin group, in which we participated in the best spirit of cooperation and in which at least some, if not all, of these guidelines were accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">And now we have reached this point. The Council document is a compromise which, on the one hand contains unacceptable basic conditions, and on the other hand concentrates on inappropriate details which are contradictory and also unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we escape from this impasse? If Parliament, on the eve of the elections, does not accept the Council"s proposal, some will say that we rejected a laboriously constructed statute which had a moralising aim. However, if we accept this, other people – and sometimes the same ones – will say that we approved a statute from which we will gain huge benefits. As the saying goes, you are ‘damned if you do and damned if you don"t".</p>
<p class="contents">More than representing merely a step towards federalism with a single salary, a Community tax, Members being treated in the same way as officials and other agents of the Community and a pension fund, I would say as a Quaestor that the Council"s proposal is at the very least alarming. To make this compulsory would result in an excessively controlling bureaucracy of which Article 9(6) is an almost ridiculous example.</p>
<p class="contents">Our only regret is that we have come to this point and so, as we would do in any case, we will vote in line with the position we accepted previously.</p>

There was a majority in favour of that last December, and the Council has taken things forward on that basis. That is not to say that I welcome the Council"s proposal. Getting rid of the once‐only chance to choose for Members who are re‐elected may perhaps make for greater clarity, but it seriously undermines the basis of the system.</p>
<p class="contents">The possibility of national taxation on top of European tax is a logical consequence of subsidiarity. But the European tax of up to 40 % does not allow the offsetting of items such as relief on mortgage interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The average of the 15 current Member States is a socially acceptable level of remuneration. The fact that many European officials receive more suggests above all that the pay scales for officials should be reviewed. Unfortunately, the rules on the end‐of‐service allowance are not at all generous. For example, a Member who has served two full terms will cease to receive any income after ten months. The Member States are responsible for providing an adequate transitional arrangement.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, the Council proposal deserves the benefit of the doubt. Parliament would be showing itself in a very poor light if it rejected this chance of a serious and responsible system of remuneration.</p>

I do not wish to dwell on details as we will discuss these in any case in due course. Today we are concerned with the fundamental issues. We are concerned with the European Parliament and the self‐image of the only legitimate, freely and directly elected body of the European Union. The Members of this Parliament are subject only to their consciences and to the will of the people of Europe. We do not need anyone to tell us what to do, not a group chairman, nor a Conference of Presidents, and certainly not the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Europe are concerned with much more urgent problems than a statute for MEPs. If we are to be able to solve the really significant problems as a Parliament we must not allow ourselves to become puppets on such a minor issue as this Statute. This is exactly what the Council is trying to do. It is simply not fulfilling its Treaty obligations and is ignoring the decision approved by Parliament on 3 December 1998 by an overwhelming majority. Instead of this we are being given a mass of detailed rules that are incomplete, inconsistent, amateurish and highly dangerous for democracy. I have to say that I am extremely concerned about this.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not allowed ourselves to be restricted by financial dependency or to be given a binding mandate. If we do not succeed in safeguarding individual MEPs" freedom of decision we cannot claim to be able to accomplish anything for the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">So let us continue along the right path that has been outlined for us by our rapporteur Willy Rothley, a path which Parliament has already agreed on. It is only by doing this that we can retain our standing with the electorate and continue to hope for their trust.</p>

If we do not take this chance of reversing an illegal situation of discrimination on grounds of nationality, which is at odds with Article 6 of the Treaty and which we ourselves have allowed to persist here for years, we shall not get the chance again, but we can discuss it here openly and honestly with the Council. Consequently, the Liberal Group has put forward a proposal on the basis of Mr Rothley"s proposals, brought into line in some respects with the Council"s proposal, and I hope that we shall get a majority vote in favour of it tomorrow.</p>

Because the fact is that I am struck by one thing, Mr Rothley, namely that when we voted on your text, some people were completely and utterly opposed to it. Today, they are in favour of putting it on ice. So I think we must not be naive here.</p>
<p class="contents">It may be that your legal reasons and arguments are valid, but I have the feeling that some of your supporters have a hidden agenda and do not really want some of these privileges to be called into question, because so many strange arguments are being used. They say that what the Council is suggesting creates inequality. Let us be honest, we have inequality here today. Today there are MEPs who are earning four times more or four times less. Even our European Parliament text contained inequalities, because we worked out a transitional arrangement for the salary for a parliamentary term, and we worked out the same thing for the supplementary pension. There too, there were two systems. So the question is this: is the Council proposal a fair basis on which to negotiate in the immediate future and reach agreement before the new term starts, or is it not?</p>
<p class="contents">There are some in the Socialist Group who think it is, and that we should negotiate on that basis: not just because of the media, not just because of public opinion, not just because of the voters, but because we need to set things to rights in our own House and to prove, when we speak for the peoples of Europe, for our democratic voters, that we do have some small degree of affinity with ordinary people and that we are putting a stop to a number of practices as quickly as possible.</p>

It is an issue that can no longer be pushed aside. Regretfully, it has to be said that the Council was slow in dealing with this matter. Parliament approved it more than six months ago, and the criticism voiced here that Parliament has had too little time to become acquainted with the document that the Council drafted, is to some extent justified. But it is vital that the Statute should be approved before the new Parliament commences its term of office.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to have talks with the Council, and I agree that these talks will be worthwhile in order to achieve results and settle a few fairly minor details that are seen as problematic. The agreement, however, should contain a solution for harmonised rates of pay and scope for national taxation, so that the extra tax generated can benefit each Member State. We should also abandon the system of flat rate travel expenses and adhere to one of <span class="italic">bona fide</span> costs incurred, but one that includes expenses incurred through travel in one"s home country. I believe this is also a matter of fairness. MEPs must also be prepared to have their overheads and office costs expense claims checked to ensure that resources have been used according to what has been agreed, as the Council proposes.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case. I cannot approve the position that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights has adopted, as it only means postponing the issue. A solution has to be reached now.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Oreja, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (ES)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have followed this afternoon"s debate in the House with great interest. For my part I shall merely stress the importance of reaching agreement on the Statute for Members at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, we have participated in the relevant procedures agreed at the Vienna European Council last December. In March, we provisionally issued the ruling called for in Article 190(5) of the Treaty. The ruling was formally confirmed by the Commission and forwarded to Parliament when the Treaty came into force.</p>
<p class="contents">We appreciate that a number of exceptions or a transitional period may prove unavoidable for reasons of political expediency. We are prepared to accept these in the interests of an agreement provided that the number of exceptions is kept as low as possible and that they serve to pave the way to a single and uniform statute. Above all, they must lead to the implementation of a system of equal payment for all Members of the European Parliament as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are certainly opposed to is any solution involving a review of the European Communities" protocol on privileges and immunities. This issue has been taken into account. We have also made every effort to guarantee that the cost to the Community budget of implementation of the Statute is taken into consideration in the financial perspective. I believe that the text of the Interinstitutional Agreement reflects the progress made in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We trust that a solution acceptable to Parliament and to the Council will be reached in the near future. Nevertheless, we understand that Parliament has to decide if the Council"s present position is acceptable in full or in part and we hope agreement will soon be possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Before concluding I must convey to Mr Rothley how much I have valued his work over the years. I have no wish to express an opinion on Mr Rothley"s views on the issue before us today. I do however want to say that as a Commissioner and in previous years as a Member of this House, I have always valued the power of his arguments and the strength of his convictions, whether or not I have agreed with them.</p>
