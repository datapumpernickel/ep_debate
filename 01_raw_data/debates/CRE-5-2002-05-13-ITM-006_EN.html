<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bouwman (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> The next item is a directive that is known as the insolvency directive, but it naturally concerns a directive on the protection of employees, the social protection of employees in this case, when the employer becomes insolvent and when there are insufficient financial resources, or none at all, to pay outstanding wages. The insolvency directive offers employees valuable protection when their employer is in financial difficulty. The existing directive is Directive 987 of 1980.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the insolvency directive prevents employees from having to do battle with creditors for outstanding payments. Instead, they can avail themselves of the provisions afforded in this insolvency directive. It is a revision of a directive, which, in this case, means that two very important changes have been made, the substance of which we are satisfied with in any case.</p>
<p class="contents">The changes mean that part-time workers, employees on fixed-term contracts and temporary workers will fall within the scope of this new directive. This is based on directives that have been in existence for these employees for some time and that have been brought about in a social dialogue. They cater for a new category of employees and it is important that we pay attention to this, certainly against the background of what is developing in the field of more flexible labour and the need for this, given the processes such as those in the framework of Lisbon, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to situations in which businesses carry out activities in various countries, it is made clear where and in what way the directive is applied and in what state. The significance of this is obviously considerable, because, slowly but surely, we can see the impact this has on employees, not only in Spain, such as last year in the company Telefonica, but also in German firms, such as Holzman and Kirch. In 2001, the number of unemployed in Europe rocketed on account of insolvency cases alone. In total, 1.4 million people faced these problems due to bankruptcy sustained by their employers. Needless to say, this is linked to many other factors.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of the European Parliament’s amendments were already adopted at first reading – we are now discussing the second reading. This was particularly true of those concerning limiting the possibility of excluding categories of employees and of no longer applying thresholds in the form of a minimum duration of the contract of employment, whereby remuneration in accordance with the directive would not apply until expiry of the contract. In addition, it was already acknowledged that the chapter on the organisation and financing, Article 5 in the old directive, would be accepted. Subsequently, in consultation, the Council added that agreement was also reached on the <span class="italic">de facto</span> situation of insolvency and it was also agreed that an employee can lay claim to unpaid wages from a fund, insofar as this is provided for in national legislation. Eventually, further to this second reading by the Council, and its common position in particular, agreements were also reached about whether or not ceilings should be set per se.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of ever-changing labour market developments, it is important for us to have enquired about all kinds of new categories of employees which have been referred to in discussions for some time and in respect of which we would, in fact, like a definition of the terms employer, employee, self-employed, self-employed without staff, etc. Accordingly, we had asked for this directive to be applied to a number of self-employed that had not been mentioned before, such as self-employed without staff, employees with a training contract, home workers, etc. We wanted to avoid conciliation if in this respect, we received the assurance from both the Commission and the Council that this entire process, which relates to the legalisation of this situation, would be accelerated. Eventually, it was agreed that the Commission will carry out a study into what are referred to as ‘new forms of work and labour relations’ in the Member States and the candidate countries alike. This is a huge step forward in my view. In addition, we agreed that, if this study is published, which will be the case any time between now and six months’ time, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the European Commission will be jointly organising a hearing to discuss the study and subsequently to examine whether, and to what extent, directives, framework directives and suchlike need to be drawn up in order to settle these issues. I would like to repeat that I have clearly indicated that we refer to the need for new and extensive European labour legislation, certainly against the background of a more flexible labour market. I would like to make one brief comment on Amendment No 6 that we have withdrawn, for the very simple reason that, in the light of the Council’s common position, it is not central.</p>
<p class="contents">I would once again like to thank the Council, the Commission and my fellow MEPs for the cooperation that has helped us avoid ending up in the follow-up procedure – the conciliation, and managed to reach sound agreements nevertheless. I look forward to statements by the Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Therefore, with the salary protection system, as well as the mechanisms to facilitate, in a privileged fashion, the payment of salaries from the real assets of the debtor employee, the legislator creates a specific guarantee of the payment of salaries under the responsibility of the public system, often structured around a public administration body, in cases of employer insolvency. This was the main objective of Directive 80/987/EEC: to guarantee within the Community a minimum level of protection in the event of employer insolvency.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the application of this directive met with very many difficulties, both in relation to the definition of the concept of insolvency for the purposes of the directive, the need to set limits in relation to the time period and amount of responsibility and the increasingly frequent consequences of transnationality – as the rapporteur has said – and globalisation, as well as the need to adapt this directive to other previous directives and the need to simplify the rules relating to the payment of salaries owed, and all of these are difficulties which the modification is intended to overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The modifications of the text of the common position strengthen the objective of worker protection, laid down in the directive, and I believe that they represent considerable progress. We still need to define, with the necessary clarity, certain concepts which need to be more precise – possibly due to the fact that social reality is almost always a step ahead of legal reality - such as the concept of the worker, so that it includes all real forms of employment, the problems resulting from productive decentralisation or externalisation, the concept of the role of salary or work dependence in relation to economic dependence, and also that of the proper use of the guarantee institution.</p>
<p class="contents">However, on the whole, we should be pleased that we have reached this point. I believe that the concern of the Commission, Parliament and the Council during the Spanish Presidency demonstrate that it is possible and feasible to create ‘more Europe’ and furthermore shows the candidate countries the direction they must take in order to achieve a more social Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that I should end by congratulating the rapporteur, despite the fact that, strictly speaking, not all the desirable objectives have been met in theory. Nevertheless, surely the possible is the enemy of the ideal and, now that we are so close to the 52nd anniversary of the date on which we can say that Europe began to be built, perhaps we should say that Europe is being built slowly, step by step, but we should also stress, Commissioner, that the social dimension is finally taking the place it deserves in this Europe we want to see. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hughes (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly on the excellent way in which he has handled this piece of work. It was adopted unanimously in committee and, thanks to his adept handling of the matter, it seems set to be finalised through an informal conciliation under the Spanish presidency. That, as he has said, depends upon a clear commitment from the Commission that a declaration will be included in that informal conciliation to cover the situation of economically dependent or subordinate workers – not a very elegant description, but we all know which workers are meant.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know the problem: full-time permanent workers, the core staff in many enterprises around the European Union, are becoming less and less numerous, with concentric circles of less formal employment relationships surrounding that core. The current directive will extend insolvency protection to part-time and fixed-term contract workers, but what about temporary agency workers? What about self-employed workers who are in a position similar to employees but who do not have an employment contract? What about workers working zero-hour contracts which are becoming more popular in certain parts of the European Union? This is all part of a broad approach which, for us, is about balancing flexibility for work places, enterprises, and a degree of security for the workers working within and moving between those enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">We, in the PSE Group, firmly believe that only in that way will all working people embrace the process of change. Otherwise a barrier will be put in the way of that process of change. The recent agreement on a directive on working time for long-distance drivers, which will include self-employed workers, shows us a possible way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, as the rapporteur has said, must commit itself to completing the study it has under way, a joint hearing with Parliament and then legislative or other action to follow that hearing. For us as well this is about an overall proactive and socially responsible approach to the management of industrial change. We in the PSE Group have called since the beginning of this mandate for a modernisation of the law governing transfers and insolvency and, indeed, consultation in the form of the European Works Council Directive. We hope that the remaining elements of those changes will be introduced as soon as possible by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I had a recent example in my own constituency where a company called Viasystems registered offshore before declaring insolvency, thereby avoiding the application of certain aspects of insolvency law. The subsequent Phoenix company which arose from the wreckage through a management buy-out shed over 500 jobs. Those people were made redundant, some of them with more than 30 years' pension and other entitlements which they lost completely. Clearly we still have a lot of work to do. This is a step in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Parliament adopted the Bouwman report by a large majority at first reading. The European Parliament responded positively to this initiative by the Commission because it rounds off the three basis reforming directives, the other two of which cover protection for employees from mass redundancies and during corporate restructuring and all of which aim to reduce the insecurity of workers as a result of structural changes. This common objective cannot just be confined to these initiatives. If we want to bring about reform in the European Union and achieve the Lisbon objective of a more dynamic economy, we need to take an equally acute interest in work-generated insecurity and we need to deal with these fears in our reforms, not fly in the face of them. It is the only way to prevent the renationalisation of social policies and prevent far-right movements from gaining a stronghold.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament proposed a series of amendments, many of which were accepted by the Council, such as a definition of the notion of ‘employee’, application to the liberal professions and other categories and protection for wages across the board, irrespective of whether they are basic wages, bonuses or various pay rises. The question was raised of including compensation if the employee is made redundant. The Council's explanation that it does not refuse to include these relative guarantees but considers that they come under insured benefits in that they derive from the contract of employment is of course tantamount to acceptance. However, in my personal opinion, there should be an express reference to the term ‘compensation’, just as there is in the international contract of employment and just as the experts of the International Labour Organisation have recommended. Another positive point is the extended understanding of the term ‘insolvency’ which has been retained.</p>
<p class="contents">The big question which remains unanswered, and which concerns not just the present directive, is if and to what extent the protection offered to workers will cover all those engaged in new forms of work and if we intend to communitise the relevant definitions. The compromise solution of an in-depth study of the question is one we agree with, as long as a specific deadline is attached to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the compromise reached between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. We are still left, however, with the ongoing difficulty of so-called self-employed workers who do not have the protection of social legislation which people covered by this amended directive will have. We all know that many companies use so-called self-employment as a means of avoiding their social responsibilities. That is not acceptable. It is a false flexibility. Those companies and those Member States which support this position with regard to self-employment are impeding the modernisation of our labour relations, the modernisation of our labour market and the development of a single labour market across the European Union. It is my view that it is a false saving and a false protection of flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the agreement to have an in-depth study into the legal, economic and social situation of people who are self-employed in this way. I suggest that it would be worthwhile also to examine the impact that this kind of self-employment is having on the development and modernisation of the single labour market that we aspire to. It seems to me that what is happening is that more and more workers are resisting change precisely because they fear this form of flexibility, because they are then left without the protection of social legislation which generations of workers have fought for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to start by congratulating Mr Bouwman on the commitment, the conviction and the great determination he has shown in dealing with this very difficult directive through the co-decision procedure. I have realised that it would be impossible to have a positive product without the cooperation and the strong support of the members of the Committee of Employment and Social Affairs and I would like to thank all the members of the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this excellent cooperation, not only in the Committee, but also between the three institutions, will soon lead to the final adoption of the insolvency directive, probably without the need for the conciliation procedure. I am pleased to announce that the Commission is willing to accept all the amendments to the common position of 18 February in their entirety. It takes the view that all the amendments which have been tabled supplement and improve the text of the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">With regards to the concerns which have been expressed by Members concerning the new forms of employment, I would like to confirm to Members of this House that the Commission is aware of the problem and is dealing with it in a new way and in a much broader context than in the directive with which we are dealing today.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed the forms of the employment and the way in which work is organised are undergoing rapid and far-reaching changes. New types of employment are emerging. There are new types of worker, half-way between the traditional models of the employee and the self-employed worker.</p>
<p class="contents">Various terms have been used to describe or designate these workers. The terms used most often are economically dependent workers or para-subordinate workers and persons who perform work similar to that of an employee.</p>
<p class="contents">What these workers have in common is that they resemble self-employed workers in the autonomy they have to organise their work and/or the fact that they take an economic risk. At the same time, they are economically dependent in the sense that they depend more or less on just one client firm and are very often highly integrated into the internal organisation of the company.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission raised the problem of these economically dependent workers with the social partners. There was a consultation with the social partners, and they revealed their sensitivity to the problem, but it was obvious that they did not have a concrete approach or a concrete proposal. It was clear that there was a need for further information about the phenomenon in all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I must reassure you that in the existing text we take into account the concrete forms of employment which have already been legislated for – I mean part-time work, temporary employment contracts and fixed contracts. But there are other forms of employment, to which I have already referred, that cannot be covered by this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to take into account your concerns, and after our consultation with the social partners, I confirm that the Commission has launched a study which should provide an overview of the legal, social and economic position of economically dependent people in the 15 Member States. Once this study has been finalised, the Commission will organise a joint hearing with the European Parliament for three reasons: to exchange views and practices, to evaluate the results of the study and to raise the awareness of all concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Consideration could be given to inviting representatives of the accession countries to participate in this joint hearing. After this joint hearing, the question is whether we will go further: is the Commission going to propose concrete Community action? After all this information and the reactions, the Commission will consider the forms of Community action needed. We will propose them to establish a broader framework and then see how it might be done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
