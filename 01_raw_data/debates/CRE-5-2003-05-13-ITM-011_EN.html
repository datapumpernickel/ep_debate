The Commission is greatly concerned about the Turkish authorities’ most recent raid on the offices of the Human Rights Association in Ankara, in the course of which documents and other material were seized. The persecution of associations such as this one is difficult to understand at a time when, as has happened recently, political reforms have taken place and the fundamental rights of free expression of opinion and freedom of association have been extended. The Commission has mentioned similar cases in its regular reports, and it takes the view that such incidents are contrary to the objectives of current efforts at reform. This demonstrates anew how great a gulf there is between political reforms on the one hand and, on the other, the attitude taken by the executive and the judiciary to their implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with this, I would like to emphasise that the implementation of these reforms will be a determining factor in evaluating to what extent the Copenhagen political criteria have been fulfilled. I will be pointing this out to the Turkish foreign minister, Abdullah Gül, when I have talks with him on Thursday in Brussels. I have information to the effect that the Turkish minister of justice has, in the meantime, publicly expressed regret for the what the Turkish authorities did in the offices of the Human Rights Association, acknowledging at the same time the great importance of political reforms being implemented across the board. He also made it clear that any future recurrence of such incidents would not be tolerated.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to expressly draw attention to the fact that the Turkish Human Rights Association enjoys the Commission’s active support, having, in the period from 1992 to 1999, had funds to a total of EUR 309 000 made available to it. Further funding is planned for as part of measures to support fulfilment of the political criteria. Only recently, on 25 March, the Commission submitted a revised communication on an improved pre-accession strategy for Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot do other than re-emphasise at this point how vitally important it is that Turkey should, fully and without exceptions, implement all legal reforms as part of everyday practice. At the end of the day, that is the yardstick by which Turkey’s fitness for accession will be assessed. Human rights organisations must be able to do their work without hindrance, and their activities will continue to be supported by the Commission in future. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This time it is about what is, even by Turkish standards, an unprecedented case of unhesitating disregard for the basic tenets of the rule of law and democratic intergovernmentalism and, what is worse, under the supervision of a high-ranking judicial officer who ostentatiously confirmed a prevalent Turkish practice and state of affairs, within the framework of which Turkey systematically and blatantly infringes even the most fundamental obligations which it is supposed to have undertaken in order to justify and support its application to join the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The raid by an anti-terrorist squad on the Human Rights Association of Turkey in Ankara adds yet another black mark to the long, sad list of Turkish repression of political, religious and minority human rights and freedoms in Turkey and belies, without any excuse whatsoever, the extravagant promises and assurances given by each Turkish Government in succession that they are allegedly taking and applying the institutional and other measures needed in order to comply with the Copenhagen criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Many hastened to extol these proclamations with superfluous optimism and now obviously realise with equal disappointment that, in treating the Turkish system with understanding and tolerance, they have achieved precisely the opposite effect and have basically encouraged and supported everyone in Turkey who opposes moves to bring the country into line with the recognised moral values of internal legal order and international conduct.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the European Union and, more particularly, the European Parliament, as the elected representative body of its people, must severely and unreservedly condemn this new intolerable incident and the more general standard Turkish stance in the field of human rights and international law and make it perfectly clear to the Turkish Government that any thought of accepting Turkey into the bosom of the European family is out of the question under these circumstances, as the exceptional report by Mr Oostlander quite rightly emphasises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We take it for granted that the Turkish Government, in a case such as this, will act in an exemplary way and sort the matter out. It is quite proper that we should be discussing this here this evening, but I think we should avoid making the mistake of playing the game the way the hawks in Turkey expect us to.</p>
<p class="contents">What is actually going on in Turkey at the moment is that the opponents of the EU within the state apparatus, who continue, regrettably, to wield a great deal of power, are full of fear of Turkey ever joining the European Union, when they will no longer be allowed to do those things that have been permitted to them until now. It is these forces within the apparatus of the Turkish state who have a natural interest in exploiting every opportunity and engage in provocative behaviour as often as possible. On the day in question, 6 May, a meeting had actually been planned between non-governmental organisations, the Turkish foreign minister, and the minister responsible for human rights issues. It was on the afternoon of that day that the raid was carried out. This shows that those forces that actually want to use all available means to create a different mood in Turkey, had deliberately chosen this day to mount an operation that we would regard as unacceptable, with the resultant situation inducing us to hold this evening’s debate, in which Turkey would yet again be the subject of much adverse comment, and we would end up doing a favour for those who do not want to see European democracy in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">The one fact of which we have to take note is that Turkey at present has a government that wants to carry out necessary reforms, and is making the effort to do so; it responded to this raid by saying that everything possible would be done to resolve this case. For this reason, I would like to ask my fellow Members of this House to help and support those in Turkey who are really campaigning for democracy and human rights, and, when faced with provocations such as this, to be very careful in what they do and not allow themselves to be provoked and misused by the wrong side. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree, however, with Mr Ceyhun that we must be cautious in our interpretation of it.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner mentioned, we are in fact seeing an express desire for reform in Turkey and a desire to comply with the political criteria, as required if the country is to embark upon negotiations concerning EU membership. We saw this with the amendments to the constitution last August, when the death penalty was abolished in peace-time and a series of other freedoms was established. Further reforms are on the way, moreover. I myself took part in the Turkish National Assembly’s symposium at the end of April when it was discussed what changes there needed to be to the Turkish legal system if it were to comply with the political criteria. What I witnessed was an objective and open debate, in which, for example, legal experts and representatives of the judiciary provided clear and incisive descriptions of the reforms that would guarantee the independence of the courts and the observance of fundamental human rights. If the National Assembly follows the good advice and adopts reforms that guarantee the independence of a legal system that is also in accordance with human rights, Turkey will be another step on the way towards negotiating for accession to the EU, and – just as importantly – the Turkish population will be guaranteed the fundamental and democratic rights I believe they really desire.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact of the matter is, of course, that it is not enough to amend legislation if changes do not also take place in practice. We should then be back to square one, as the Commissioner emphasised, and I think it important that we emphasise this. It is therefore very sad that we continue to receive reports of torture in Turkish prisons and of other infringements of human rights, including violations of freedom of expression. The events of 6 May unfortunately show that there are still forces in Turkish society that either do not understand the need for changes or do not approve of them and who act on that basis. This is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey is a very complex country with many different cultures. It is also a very dynamic country with major resources and a lot of talent, and continued cooperation between the EU and Turkey is in the interests of both Turkey and the EU. Membership of the EU requires, however, that specific principles be observed. We often hear Turkish politicians say that tougher demands are being made upon Turkey than upon other countries where accession to the EU is concerned. This is not the case. The ten countries that are to accede in May 2004 have had to implement difficult reforms for which there was often little grass-roots support and which were also opposed internally. For all countries, democracy is a process, and we need to be on our guard against human rights violations and any imbalance between institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With a representative of the Turkish Public Prosecutor’s office present, the offices of the IHD in Ankara were searched by the authorities and everything in them seized. Yet again it was the largest human rights organisation in Turkey that was on the receiving end of this treatment, and, yet again, it was terrorism that served as the pretext for it.</p>
<p class="contents">What I ask you is this: how much longer are things to go on like this? Is this what Turkey’s reform process adds up to? Can it still seriously be believed that it matters to Turkey whether or not it fulfils the Copenhagen criteria? The Confederal Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left protests emphatically against the Turkish authorities’ actions. The latest raid on the IHD is but the last in a series of hostile acts against this human rights organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us remind ourselves that, since 1991, over ten members of the IHD have been murdered, and that, in May 1998, the organisation’s chairman, Akin Birdal, was gunned down in his office. In the last parliamentary elections, neither he nor other representatives of HADEP were allowed to stand as candidates. According to Amnesty International, in the last couple of years alone, over four hundred separate court actions have been commenced against the IHD, to which must be added the innumerable cases brought against individual members. Mrs Eren Keskin, a lawyer and deputy chairman of the IHD, has just been barred from practising law for a year. Over and over again, the charge is ‘separatist propaganda’. Is this Turkey’s new way of handling human rights?</p>
<p class="contents">It was with a great deal of sympathy that we all watched as the reform process in Turkey was inaugurated. Both in the European Union and among the Turkish people, there were high hopes for a new policy on the part of the Turkish Government, but these hopes have so far been in vain. Turkey must make changes to critical aspects of its policies, not merely to forms of words, but also in practice. Only then will it have a realistic prospect of acceding to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent months have shown that there is no shortage of problem areas. Let us mention first the banning of HADEP, yet another ban imposed on a party that champions in particular the concerns of minorities in Turkey. Turkey still relies on the banning of political parties as a means of silencing the voices of those who take a critical view of the government’s policies. In the meantime, the DEHAP – the alliance of parties as part of which HADEP contested the latest parliamentary elections – is also threatened with a ban. Is that, I ask you, democracy? Is that freedom of opinion?</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the legal action against Mrs Leyla Zana, a former member of the Turkish parliament, whose party, the DEP, was also proscribed. While we must welcome the fact that there is at last a retrial, what does it amount to? So far, it appears to be a repeat of the proceedings in 1994, which the European Court of Human Rights categorised as unfair. The judges are, admittedly, no longer military men, but there is a massive military presence in the courtroom. Even after two days of proceedings, there is no prospect of Mrs Zana being released. Let us remind ourselves that her offence, for which she was sentenced to fifteen years in jail, was a sentence spoken in the Turkish parliament – in Kurdish, her mother tongue.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the authorities’ continuing arbitrary treatment of the Kurds, who, even after formal changes to the law, are far from being treated as having equal rights. Harassment and sweeping accusations of separatism continue to be the order of the day. The use of the Kurdish language, too, is still subject to considerable restrictions. There continues to be no evidence that Turkey is making any effort to set in motion a real process of democratisation, or to involve all elements in Turkish society in seeking solutions to its manifold problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are the conditions in police stations and prisons. Anyone who is put into custody in Turkey can reckon, with a high degree of probability, on being mistreated, especially if he or she is a member of a minority group. Elementary rights, such as the right to have contact with family members and legal counsel, are often granted only on a restricted basis or disregarded altogether. The most prominent example of this is Abdullah Öcalan, who has for months had virtually no contact with the outside world. The list could go on and on. This is where we might bear Cyprus in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said, for all these reasons, that the road Turkey must travel before it joins Europe is still, alas, a long one. The assumption that Turkey can hope for accession negotiations with the EU without fundamental changes to its policies is an illusion. Turkey will have a prospect of accession only if it proves that it takes the Copenhagen criteria seriously. It is up to Turkey to show by its policies what value it really places upon accession to the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One reason why my group also condemns it in the strongest possible terms is that it is totally inconsistent with the reforms that are designed to bring Turkey closer to the EU. But what I find more interesting is the background against which this raid took place. Mr Ceyhun has already spoken about it and I endorse what he had to say. I am convinced that there is a struggle going on not only in public, but also – and in particular – behind the scenes at the moment, between on the one hand the reformers, the new government, the new Parliament, many human rights organisations and other reformers and on the other the conservatives, who are still very strongly represented, in the army, in the bureaucracy, and also in the judiciary.</p>
<p class="contents">Fellow Members, it is no coincidence that on the very day that this human rights association was invited to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs for discussions on Turkey’s new strategy with a view to accession, the conservatives respond by breaking into the association’s offices. Nor is it any coincidence that this happens by way of the state security courts – a bastion of conservatism in the Turkish legal system. That is, as far as I am concerned, also a reason to call on the Turkish Government again to press ahead with the abolition of these state security courts – which has already been announced – because they are once again the source of much misery. If there is a struggle between the conservatives on the one hand and the reformers on the other, then I am convinced that it is the task of Parliament to support the reformers. I therefore contest the analysis of Turkish affairs that is heard in this House from some of our Members, that is that it never was anything, it is nothing and it never will be anything.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not the situation. Look for example at the reactions of Mr Gül, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Mr Cicek, the Minister of Justice. They are ashamed of what happened in this raid and new measures have again been announced to make this impossible in the future. It is the role of our Parliament to be critical if things go wrong in Turkey, that is what we are doing this evening, that is what we shall be doing in the Oostlander report, but it is also the task of the Parliament to support reformers and reforms so that raids of this kind become a thing of the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This debate, on which there is a great degree of consensus, is not about whether Turkey joins the EU, but about what sort of country Turkey is. In the raid that was authorised by the state security corps, in the words of the Human Rights Association, and I quote, ‘all of our private notebooks, all notes, all of our computers, our files and all our reports were taken, all faxes and e-mails sent to the offices were read and some were taken away’.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only is this not good for Turkey, it is also highly destabilising that an agent of the state, namely the state security corps, is acting so clearly against the interests of Turkey. The message it is sending outside is that it is trying to subvert the very democracy that the Turkish Government is trying to build.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it not ironic that immediately after the raid the officials go to meet the foreign minister and the minister for human rights? It is our job as a Parliament to place ourselves firmly behind those people in Turkey who are promoting democracy, to make it quite clear that we support those agents of the state who are saying that this is not the way to run it and that we support people like Abdullah Gul, who clearly was deeply upset by this activity.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact of the matter is that in a modern democratic state, the state security corps and the military have to be subordinate to the civilian power – that is the definition of a modern democratic state. There are many people in Turkey working towards those aims and I believe that this Parliament, in passing this resolution, can give support to those people.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not saying yes or no to Turkey in the EU; we are saying we want to back the people of Turkey in making their country a decent, good sort of place that they will all be proud to live in. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She claimed that this would speed up the democratisation process in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, when will the Turkish powers finally embark on that path instead of continuing to harass democratic militants, as was still the case with the arbitrary requisitioning of the premises of the Turkish Human Rights Association, an association which already suffers frequent threats and intimidation?</p>
<p class="contents">The recent ban last March of the ADEP party is also unacceptable, given that this party clearly rejects any link with armed combat. The Constitutional Court of Ankara is thus adding to the very long list of penalties imposed on those who fight for the recognition of the Kurdish people’s rights. The Turkish powers are keeping rigidly to a way of thinking which not only harms the direct victims of oppression but also Turkish society as a whole and the image of the country abroad. Almost exactly a year ago, on 10 May 2002, the <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> delegation from Parliament considered that the ban on the ADEP would constitute a substantial step backwards for Turkish democracy. Sadly, that is now the case.</p>
<p class="contents">What conclusions can we draw from this?</p>
<p class="contents">We must avoid falling into the trap of the conservatives and other extremists here in Europe, who automatically exclude the Turkish people from the Christian club that the European Union would be. It would be criminal to stigmatise and isolate this nation by closing the doors to the Union in its face. That is why I would like to reiterate here my full support for the activities of those in Turkey who are demonstrating in favour of human rights, sometimes risking their lives. The democratic forces need to know that we are by their side to ensure that the day when it is possible to live and speak freely in Turkey comes as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council and the Commission therefore need to make a greater effort to ensure that the Turkish Government observes the Copenhagen criteria, in other words, that it promotes human rights and the rule of law. This commitment should be shown by commensurate financial support for the activities of associations working for democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, following the reopening of the Leila Zana case and those of three of her colleagues a few days ago, I would like to express my hope that the European Parliament will be able to present Mrs Zana with her prize here in this hemicycle as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unless we are seen to defend the charters and treaties which we have designed ourselves, such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and legislation on human rights, then we run the risk of becoming a laughing stock within the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally have had occasion in the past to condemn the Turkish Government for the imprisonment without trial of many among the Kurdish community, as I have also condemned the 14-year imprisonment sentence imposed on Leyla Zana and three of her colleagues. They all campaigned for the rights of the Kurds and in 1995 Leyla Zana won our own European Parliament Sakharov Prize. A retrial of Leyla Zana was ordered following a ruling of the European Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg, a court the international community established itself, because the original trial of Leyla Zana and her colleagues was deemed not to be equitable.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again we have to raise in this Parliament a further breach of human rights standards in the wake of a search of the Ankara headquarters of the Human Rights Association of Turkey. The Human Rights Association performs internationally recognised work in the realm of human rights in Turkey and provides Members of this Parliament with invaluable data on human rights atrocities. Therefore we regard it as a violation of the defence of human rights when the promotion of these standards is thus impeded. Is it any wonder that some of us once more ask whether Turkey's request for membership of the European Union should be supported?</p>
<p class="contents">For the record, the Human Rights Association has found that 183 people were subjected to torture, ill-treatment and detention in Turkey in the first quarter of this year alone. A Union presidency that prides itself on defending the human rights of minorities and the oppressed everywhere cannot stand by and allow such violations to continue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very well aware of the views of the Ankara public prosecutor. I have heard terms of this kind from his own lips; no wonder, then, that in such a system a raid on the human rights bureau in Ankara should be seen by the perpetrators as normal. That is how life is lived there. The Minister for Justice has expressed regret for the raid, and that is, of course, all very fine and good, but the problem is whether he actually has the power over the public prosecutor to prevent the latter simply carrying on without further ado.</p>
<p class="contents">Is this not once again the so-called deep state, with its generals and pashas, that rumbles through everything, as it did with the attempts of Prime Minister Erdogan to find a solution to the Cyprus problem, the restoration of the ban on HADEP and the continuing detention of Mrs Zana who, as a Sakharov prizewinner, has very special symbolic value for us? Such behaviour amounts to downright defiance of the norms and values of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The views of the deep state on good administration differ markedly from those in the European Union. Successive examples of this can be found in every embassy of Member States. Mr Ceyhun points out that it is the opponents of the European Union in Turkey who are in favour of such damaging acts. I do not believe that there are people in Turkey, and certainly not amongst the pashas and the generals, who do not want to join the European Union. This is because there is status and all kinds of other benefits attached to it. They do want to join, but they want Turkey to join the European Union on their terms. This we must prevent at all costs and make clear to the citizens and to every person of goodwill in Turkey that we do not want that.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that it must also be made clear to the Turkish public where we stand, that there are conditions attached to accession and that whenever there is a violation it will be said over and over again that we do not accept that, so that the deep state knows that in the European Union there is no future for its way of thinking and acting. I hope that Commissioner Verheugen can make this visible in Turkey too, possibly through measures relating to the support for human rights organisations in that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There have been repeated, even more savage raids in the past. I need only remind you of the armed raid on the previous president of the Association, Akin Birdal, who was repeatedly fired on. That attack too was condemned by the then Minister for Justice, and yet the victim was ultimately locked up in gaol for several years. Just so that we understand what condemnations by serving ministers mean!</p>
<p class="contents">So this raid is particularly significant, because it was carried out at a time when the new government of Turkey is trying to stop the democratic mask which Mr Erdogan and his cohorts were wearing before and after the elections from slipping. As far as we are concerned, there can be no doubt that the government of Islamists, by reason of its very ideological base, was and is not in a position to lead Turkey towards democracy. It had to be elected, taking account of the thirsting and the fight of the Turkish people, but under no circumstances has it changed its ideological political orientation. Without doubt, the basic reason for this raid is the intrepid, heroic fight of the Human Rights Association in Turkey and the rights of the Kurdish people. Neither the military establishment that always directs political life in Turkey nor the Islamic party entertain any sympathy for this sort of impropriety. The raid was carried out on the basis of Articles 169 and 312 of the Criminal Code and the anti-terrorism law respectively, which criminalise any support for the hunger strike of political prisoners and their fight against the white cells as an act of terrorism. The ban on the Turkish communist party and the HADEP party was decided in the same spirit.</p>
