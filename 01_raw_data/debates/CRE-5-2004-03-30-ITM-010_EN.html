People are in actual fact afraid. They have, for example, been afraid of what is contained in food, of mad cow disease, of additives and of pesticide residues. Parliament, the Commission and the Council have in actual fact tackled the issue as a whole, and we are now perhaps putting the last pieces of the puzzle in place when it comes to thinking about food safety. We now have sound, comprehensive legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a fear of chemicals of all types. I wish to commend the Commissioner for her work on forming a comprehensive view – which may perhaps constitute a model for the rest of the world – of the use of chemicals in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is these matters that have begun to be tackled. Air pollution and climate change have also been addressed. Right now, the European tabloids and popular press all too often discuss the fear of radiation – most recently from mobile phones and attendant transmitter masts. There is so much that is unknown and to be afraid of.</p>
<p class="contents">I have inherited this report and did not write it myself. I rather think that it is a little too far-reaching and perhaps not sufficiently structured. It is important to take an overall view, so that everything is not divided up into small pieces. It is crucial that we obtain some sort of overall picture of the anxiety and of the problems, of what we can, and cannot, prove and of what we need to know more about. Subsequently, we can determine how best to draw up a strategic battle plan for coping successfully with the problems that undoubtedly exist.</p>
<p class="contents">I have tried to include an aspect that is rather controversial, namely the fact that individuals have to have access to enough information to be able, as far as possible, to make choices concerning lifestyle, food, exercise and detergents – in fact, everything to which we are giving thought and attention – and to take responsibility for their own, and their families’, health. The health problems are now such that it is not only political decisions that apply. Instead, people must have the greatest possible knowledge. In order to be able to make active, informed choices, people must have access to information that is clear and comprehensible and that conveys a message that is relatively simple to understand.</p>
<p class="contents">I have removed any suggestion that allergies are definitely bound up with traffic problems. I believe that this is an inference without proper scientific backing. Someone with respiratory problems or allergies is obviously hit very hard by poor air quality or air pollution. Since there is lung disease in my family, I can point out that, for example, the use of perfume constitutes at least as serious a problem for someone with an allergy. The cause of the spread of childhood allergies in modern times is perhaps also to be sought elsewhere than purely in external environmental factors. There may perhaps be biological factors involved.</p>

<p class="contents">First of all, I should like to thank Parliament for its response to the Commission communication on a European Environment and Health Strategy. In particular, I should like to thank the two rapporteurs, first Mr Ries and then Mrs Paulsen, for their work, and that also goes for the whole of Mrs Paulsen’s time as a Member of the European Parliament and her remarkably good work in this particular area.</p>
<p class="contents">Environment and health is an issue that affects us all. According to the latest Eurobarometer surveys, 89% of European citizens are concerned about the impact of the environment on their health. Nearly ten per cent say that they have a close relative or family member that is suffering from an environment-related illness.</p>
<p class="contents">Our knowledge of which environmental factors actually give rise to certain effects on health is still fairly limited. Diseases are caused by many different factors, often in combination. We do not currently know with absolute certainty the degree to which the environment contributes to diseases. Indeed, one of the main objectives of this Strategy is to increase our knowledge and thus obtain a better basis for tackling the problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic idea is to bring environment, health and research together in order to improve our understanding of, and thus tackle more effectively, the complicated link between environment and disease. I make no secret of the fact that this also entails a challenge as, in our traditional roles, we are not always accustomed to working horizontally across the traditional boundaries between different research disciplines and policy areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently working on an action plan for 2004–2010. We shall present this at the Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health in Budapest in June 2004, which is a pan-European meeting. Experts and interest groups from throughout the enlarged EU have participated in the preparations for this action plan. Regional conferences have been held in Warsaw, Rome and Brussels, where many of the issues addressed by Parliament in its report have been discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to bear in mind that this is a long-term strategy. Completing our knowledge of the part the environment plays in various health problems will take time. Parliament has been expressing concern that the Strategy only concentrates on data collection and research. This is true in a sense, but we need this data in order to determine how best to direct our efforts. This does not mean that we are intending to stay passive in the meanwhile. There are certain areas where we cannot risk waiting until our knowledge is complete, but need to act according to the precautionary principle, and we shall do so.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first cycle, in the period 2004 to 2010, we have selected a number of diseases and priority substances for particular consideration: childhood respiratory diseases, asthma and allergies, neurodevelopment disorders, childhood cancer, and endocrine disrupting effects. It is evident from this that children are a priority target group, and they are also the most vulnerable to environmental risks. Hence, we have made them the focus of our Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The substances selected are heavy metals, dioxins, PCBs and endocrine disrupters. Taking these diseases and substances as our starting point, we hope to develop a programme capable of providing us with the information we need on how the environment affects our health. We then hope to extend this to other environmental threats and related diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report, Parliament points out the risk of duplication of work, of our failing to take account of existing research results or work done by the World Health Organisation, for example. We are fully aware of this risk; indeed, coordinating data from different areas is one of our most important tasks. I should like to emphasise that, when working on this Environment and Health Strategy, we cooperated with and consulted the World Health Organisation from the outset.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I wish to thank Parliament once more for its support on this very important issue which, I assume, is close to all our hearts. Together with the comments from other institutions and from interest groups, this report, and especially the work done by Mrs Paulsen, will help us to develop a good, effective action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

May I remind you that in 1996, the formulation of public health protection as a separate aspect of the fifth programme on the environment and sustainable development being formulated at the time was my proposal and was accepted by all the institutions. Thus, for the first time, the European Union attempted to collect and disseminate widely information and knowledge on the repercussions of the state of the environment on human health.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the sixth environmental action programme includes this specific aspect, in other words environment, health and quality of life, while the first Community action programme in the public health sector, which we adopted in 2002 and for which I had the honour of acting as rapporteur, includes promoting the recording, analysis and evaluation of the determining factors of health which are linked to the environment. This knowledge will obviously result in the adoption and promotion of suitable strategies and measures to protect human health from the adverse effects of a deteriorating and dangerous environment. However, we must note that the penetration of the environmental aspect into health has been hesitant so far on the part of the Union and, consequently, the current proposal for an environment and health strategy cannot but be welcomed as a positive step, which expresses the will of the European Union to develop action in this sector, because the environmental dangers to health today are immense and require a modern, integrated approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Emphasis must be placed on reducing the environmental dangers which have repercussions on human health or cause diseases, at huge economic and social cost. Of course, particular attention must also be paid to the most vulnerable groups of the population: children, the elderly, pregnant women and people with a serious medical history. The action programme proposes measures to improve the air quality in residential and work places, it proposes that studies be carried out in order to detect the hot spots of emissions and exposure to them, it calls for particular attention to be devoted to people living close to sources of pollution and for the stepping up of the policy of prevention, which focuses on stepping up monitoring of the environment for carcinogens and substances which damage the reproductive and nervous systems. Finally, it stresses the importance of education about environmental issues so that initiatives can be taken for raising public awareness and information.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certain that, together with diet, the environment is a significant, determining health factor and, consequently, the Union strategy in this sector must include the constant collection and systematic monitoring of data which link environmental parameters with various diseases. Only by constantly developing scientific knowledge and research into the aspects of certain diseases with environmental parameters shall we be able to develop efficiently the Union strategy and action to protect human health. This strategy will allow the life expectancy of European citizens to be prolonged further. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are now clear indications that 20% of the total number of diseases in industrialised countries are related to environmental factors. Most of these diseases affect children, women of reproductive age and poor and vulnerable groups.</p>
<p class="contents">In the fifteen Member States, 60 000 deaths a year are due to long-term exposure to suspended particles. 10% of children in western Europe have asthma, ten times more than in eastern Europe, due to the different environment. The 10% reduction in ozone is expected to cause 300 000 cases of skin cancer and 4 500 cases of melanoma every year at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">The relevant Communication action plans so far have concentrated on specific environmental factors which are harmful to health without, however, ever having evaluated the risks from the links and interactions between the various pollutants to the human body overall.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the proposed strategy helps to achieve an overall understanding of the threats, of how they affect human health and of what action is required. The Scale initiative, with incremental application in cycles, is based on scientific research to obtain the necessary information, focuses on children as the most vulnerable group, helps to raise awareness of the fact that the deterioration in the environment is harmful to everyone's health, especially children's, uses the legal instruments provided by the Treaty to take the relevant action and, finally, makes provision for permanent and constant evaluation to ensure that action is efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of my group, I should like to say that we support the Commission communication, as it is presented, but we shall not support those amendments which depart from the overall spirit and focus on individual sectors, thereby precluding other, equally important sectors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Media coverage in recent years has only confirmed people's concerns. Today's epidemiological landscape has changed dramatically. It is dominated by cardiovascular diseases, cancers, allergic conditions and respiratory diseases. These diseases have many causes, which are often complex and interact with one another. These causes are often uncertain and some are not yet known. It is recognised, however, that the environment, in the widest sense of the term, plays a leading role.</p>
<p class="contents">Our physical environment is thus one of the major risk factors for the health of our citizens. I will not dwell now on the dangers presented by polluted industrial sites or nuclear power plants. Above all, we must from now on take more account of the immediate environment that causes thousands of cases of cancer. Chemicals, electromagnetic waves or urban and atmospheric traffic pollution: these are the major challenges for public health in Europe. Our behaviour and our way of life encourage an excessively rich diet, and stress and the intensification of work give rise to many health problems. For example, we must take a strong stand against smoking, in particular passive smoking and smoking around children. We must now put in place strong regulations allowing smoking to be banned in the workplace and in public places.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of these challenges, we are concerned by the weakness of the Commission's proposals. The Greens call for a still more specific and more ambitious strategy, which will be able to rise to the health challenges of the twenty-first century. This, may I add, is the direction taken by the amendments we have tabled. We must tackle the problems at their source by putting forward specific actions right now, while accepting the inherent uncertainties of scientific knowledge. The strategy must therefore be firmly based on the precautionary principle and the principle of prevention. In this context, we are calling for a significant strengthening of the strategy of reducing exposure to risks.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greens ask for these various major lines of thinking and action to be taken into account, so that the European Union is able to deal with the fears and expectations of our fellow citizens and, above all, with the revolution in public health that we must carry out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was the third priority of this environmental programme and at the time it was said that it was a very important component in the new challenges that lay ahead of us. In many countries the work done in environmental healthcare and environmental protection has already had a significant impact on achieving high standards of environmental health. We still nevertheless have work to do.</p>
<p class="contents">It must also be one of the major goals in a Union of 25 countries to achieve and maintain standards of healthcare that are as high as possible. The prevention of disease and the general assurance of good health everywhere must play a key role when the strategy starts to be implemented in practice. For some reason this principle was not given due consideration by the committee when the matter was being discussed, but I hope that this issue of prevention will be given top priority in future debates.</p>
<p class="contents">The first phase of the strategy will focus on factors that aim to have a beneficial effect on childhood diseases. This is a good basis and starting point for the aim of offering our citizens an environment in which levels of pollution are not enough to produce harmful effects on people’s health and the environment. To achieve this we naturally need investment in research, but also in training and education, and tangible levels of investment to ensure a better environment in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome this proposed strategy looking at the connection and links between environment and health and I welcome the Commission's proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to focus on the issue of indoor pollution and in particular passive smoking – I know Mr Rod has just touched upon that. It is apt that we discuss this report in the week that the Irish Government introduced a ban on smoking in public places, especially since the Irish Government currently holds the presidency of the EU. The Irish Government should be congratulated on its initiative to protect the health of all its citizens, including those who work in smoky pubs, clubs or restaurants.</p>
<p class="contents">Breathing other people's smoke is dangerous for your health. Tobacco smoke contains over 4000 different chemicals. In the USA the Environmental Protection Agency has classified environmental tobacco smoke as a class A carcinogen along with asbestos, arsenic, benzene and radon gas. Passive smoking is a risk factor in childbirth and infancy, connected to low birth weight and cot death; in children it is a risk factor in asthma, bronchitis and pneumonia; in adults it is a risk factor in heart disease, stroke, lung cancer and nasal cancer. Estimates suggest that in the UK alone 8000 deaths through heart disease are caused by passive smoking each year.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a serious issue and there is no way to escape the fact that passive smoking is bad for your health. I hope more Member States will copy Ireland's excellent example. I thank the rapporteur and the Commissioner for their hard work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
