<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vital Moreira, </span></span>  <span class="italic">author.</span> – <span class="italic">(PT) </span>Madam President, I myself submitted this oral question, as Chair of the Committee on International Trade and as rapporteur for this procedure for consent to an international agreement. It concerns a protocol on assessing the conformity and acceptance of industrial products between the European Union and Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">Two substantive issues have been raised regarding this agreement. One was raised in the Committee on International Trade regarding political consistency or congruency. The European Union condemns without qualification Israeli policy towards the occupied territories and towards the peace process, on the one hand, yet is willing to upgrade the status of EU-Israel trade relations, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem – which is the one under discussion now, not the first one – was raised by the Committee on Foreign Affairs when the Committee on International Trade asked for its opinion on the issue of political consistency. The Committee on Foreign Affairs raised this issue: the agreement does not clearly specify the territorial scope of its implementation. What it literally says is that products imported from Israel covered by this protocol, in particular, pharmaceutical products, will enter the EU internal market without requiring a conformity assessment and acceptance of industrial products within the EU, since they have been certified by the competent Israeli authorities, which is the very subject of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue raised is about knowing whether this can be applied to products not made in Israel’s legal territory, according to the European Union’s understanding that it does not include the occupied territories, or if it excludes all products from these territories. The problem was raised in relation to Article 9 of the protocol, which establishes the existence of authorities on the side of Israel responsible for ensuring this conformity assessment and the acceptance of products exported by Israel to the European Union. They thus benefit from this system of bilateral recognition of reciprocal procedures. Therefore, the issue raised by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which the Committee on International Trade seconded – meaning that the question is being asked by both committee chairs – comprises four or five questions. I, personally, will focus on the first two.</p>
<p class="contents">First, can the Commission ensure, in a legally binding way, that it will not accept, tacitly or otherwise, the territorial jurisdiction of the responsible Israeli authority mentioned in Article 9 of the Protocol including territories under Israeli administration since 1967? The second question, which is related, is can the Commission ensure that no industrial products manufactured in the settlements, in the Israeli occupied territories, in the West Bank settlements or in Eastern Jerusalem will be certified under this protocol?</p>
<p class="contents">A clear response to these two questions is essential because it is about knowing the territorial scope of the agreement and understanding this protocol, whose drafting and negotiation was clearly flawed, because this issue obviously must have come up. It is also obvious that the European Union cannot accept that products originating in the occupied territories might benefit from this arrangement with the Israeli authorities. Either the Commission has a unilateral interpretation that clarifies to Parliament that the protocol is applicable only to Israel’s legal territory as the EU understands it, or we have a problem which may influence the decisions of Members comprising the Committee on International Trade, which is the competent committee in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider it in the committee’s best interests to give a clear, binding response that the EU will first ... I am concluding, Mr President ... that the Commission will ask for the necessary elements to guarantee that the competent Israeli authority does not have jurisdiction beyond legal Israeli territory and that the protocol cannot be interpreted in any way other than being limited to Israel’s legal territory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Foreign Affairs believes that the agreement is sensible and that it should be brought into force once we have positive answers to certain questions. We also consider the provision in the agreement which specifies that essential products should be tested before they are delivered and certified and that this should be followed by mutual recognition to be sensible. This will save a great deal of money and increase the competitiveness of both sides. Therefore, we should support this provision.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said, if certain questions are answered, we will recommend that the Committee on International Trade proposes a vote in plenary on the agreement. Mr Moreira’s questions concern the territorial scope of the agreement and the meaning of Article 9 of the protocol. Does it apply to territories outside the 1967 borders? Are products from the West Bank or East Jerusalem covered by this protocol for the purposes of certification if they come from the settlements? Do products manufactured by Palestinians have the same opportunities for certification and, therefore, are they not being put at a disadvantage in trade terms?</p>
<p class="contents">We would like an answer to these questions. There are doubts as to whether this has been resolved from a legal perspective. Parliament’s Legal Service has said that this could be explained unilaterally by the Commission. That would resolve the matter for us. There is also the question of whether this is technically feasible and whether it really is possible to carry out foolproof checks that this has taken place.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karel De Gucht, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, thank you for the opportunity to clarify outstanding issues regarding the Agreement on conformity assessment and acceptance (ACAA) between Israel and the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start by recalling what an ACAA is about. Its objective is to eliminate barriers to trade, through allowing products covered by the agreement to enter the markets of the parties without additional conformity assessment procedures, resulting in mutual recognition of conformity assessment and inspection results, which will reduce costs and time for economic operators.</p>
<p class="contents">This is typically a response to technical barriers to trade. The Commission considers that the current ACAA text is compliant with the Lisbon Treaty and international law and that no change or renegotiation is necessary. The Commission would like to provide the following assurances to the Parliament:</p>
<p class="contents">First, the ACAA is a Protocol to the EU-Israel association agreement. Therefore, while not defining it, its scope of application is the same as set out in Article 83 of the association agreement. As it results from international obligations of the EU and as confirmed by the European Court of Justice in 2010 in the Brita case, the EU does not recognise Israeli jurisdiction over the territories placed under Israeli administration after 1967. The Commission will observe this position in the implementation of the ACAA.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, when the agreement enters into force, the Commission will have to acknowledge under Article 9 of the ACAA the responsible Israeli authority which will have to deliver conformity certificates. This acknowledgement will not entail any recognition of Israeli jurisdiction over territories placed under Israeli administration after 1967.</p>
<p class="contents">You can also rest assured that, upon receipt of the Israeli notification of its responsible authority, the Commission will expressly state that acknowledgement is granted only on the basis that the territory covered by the responsible authority does not include the territories brought under Israeli administration in 1967.</p>
<p class="contents">Separately, I would like to recall that the ACAAs are not based on the product origin but on mutual trust in the quality of the certification and inspection bodies. ACAAs recognise that certifiers in third countries certify industrial products in the same way as in EU Member States. In practice, the EU will recognise whatever product is certified by Israel, whatever its origin, Israeli or not.</p>
<p class="contents">For practical reasons, and for reasons of compliance with WTO’s non-discrimination rules, these agreements cannot discriminate or exclude on the basis of origin. This is also in line with the EU <span class="italic">acquis</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">These rules also apply under the ACAA to the Israeli Responsible Authority, which could – under certain conditions – certify not only Israeli products but also those from third countries once the ACAA is in force. In the same vein, Israeli and EU Member State Responsible Authorities could also certify products from the occupied territories.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as stated before, this does not and cannot imply any recognition of Israel’s jurisdiction over these territories. According to information received from Israeli authorities and NGOs, there is currently no pharmaceutical production in Israeli settlements. Therefore, Israel cannot discriminate against Palestinian products in the certification process because Israel will have to apply the EU <span class="italic">acquis</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Like any EU Member State, Israel must carry out inspections irrespective of the origin of the product when a request is received. If there were cases of discrimination, the Palestinian manufacturer could lodge a complaint with the Israeli judicial authorities. Of course, the Commission could also use existing means under the association agreement to ensure that Israel implements the ACAA.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the 2005 Technical Arrangement which allows the EU to identify and deny preferential treatment under the association agreement to goods produced in areas beyond Israel’s pre-1967 borders, it must be recalled that preferential treatment in terms of customs tariffs is an entirely different issue to conformity assessment and that the origin of the product fully keeps its relevance when the certified product is to enter the territory of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been cases of abuse, which have been detected and tackled appropriately, but they are few and insignificant in volume of trade. The Commission is presently working on a modification of the system, including the publication of a list of settlement codes, which will increase awareness of EU importers and will allow customs authorities to verify these declarations more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Foreign Affairs Council, on 14 May, held a substantive discussion on the Middle East peace process and agreed, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, that the EU will assess whether existing legislation, in particular, in the area of labelling, is being fully and effectively implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that from my point of view, you have answered the questions which were causing us concern.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would be pleased if we could finally make some progress with this dossier. It is only an additional protocol to an association agreement and it has spent a long time in Parliament. I very much doubt whether the length of time is appropriate given the actual content. We were supposed to be considering this dossier at the same time as a trade agreement with the Palestinian territories. I very much regret the fact that we often have double standards in this House. On the one hand, we have rightly applied considerable pressure and have said that we want the law to be complied with and our political requirements to be met. However, months ago, we adopted the agreement with the Palestinian territories with a broad majority here in Parliament, despite the fact that they are still imposing the death penalty and other similar matters. I want to make it very clear that I would like to see a much more logical approach to voting and debating among the groups.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, Mr De Gucht, and, after the intense debate this afternoon, this is genuinely not meant seriously, there is only one thing which could prevent us voting in favour of this agreement. Therefore, I would like to ask you whether you can assure us that this additional protocol will not lead to Internet service providers being forced to monitor data, the introduction of the ‘three-strikes’ policy through the back door or other restrictions on freedom of speech on the Internet or in Romania. I would be very grateful if you could turn your attention to this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think that you have tried to answer our questions very seriously and I was about to ask you whether the Commission is committed to rejecting, under Article 9 of the Agreement on conformity assessment and acceptance (ACAA), the appointment of an Israeli authority that would not exclude settlements within its jurisdiction. I think that you have answered my question and that you will be very vigilant with regard to the appointment of this authority. I want to believe you on this issue and on others.</p>
<p class="contents">I still have two regrets, or rather one concern and one source of bitterness. The first concern relates to control mechanisms. If we, in Parliament, show our agreement with the ACAA, how will we be kept informed about the various controls that the Commission will surely put in place and how will we be able to verify them? I have no answer on this subject, but this question will undoubtedly be back on the table in good time.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing is a source of bitterness, and of anger. I share Mr Moreira’s opinion and I find that, on this issue, which is, of course, a pharmaceutical issue for the time being, the question of human rights, the question of political context, has not been raised, or at least it has not been raised here. It is a major issue nonetheless. This famous human rights clause, which features in our trade agreements, are we sure that it is being upheld today? I will admit that I have lost this battle and I will accept that. I will not mention it again. I am very aware of the agreements that I have made with Mr Brok on this matter and I will vote as needs be. However, I find it mind-boggling and insane that in this Parliament, people can be concerned about what is happening with regard to the expansion of settlements and, at the same time, not be concerned in the slightest with voting for a trade agreement which will, of course, have many advantages for us, as it will for Israel, but which, I fear, will do nothing for the Palestinians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is in line with our policies across all imports from Israel, as well as exports. It is now both what Israel and Commissioner De Gucht have said, so it should also apply to these products in the wake of this protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about the technical implementation of a protocol to a trade agreement, some context and background are important, as it is undeniable that the political discussions have taken the upper hand in this House when dealing with this dossier. When it comes to Israel or the Middle East peace process, we have to be careful not to be so divisive ourselves that we become part of the problem instead of the solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the EU has a responsibility to lead in protecting and promoting universal human rights worldwide. We believe trade agreements are an important lever and I think we should not shy away from firmly invoking conditionality clauses, especially those on human rights. However, to appropriately address the serious problem of the illegal settlements that the current government of Israel continues to build, this may not be the tool. We either have to use the conditionality at association agreement level or find other ways. To start with, this protocol means we are turning procedures upside down and that will have an adverse effect. If nothing else, the procedural journey that this protocol has made through the EU makes us all less credible, and that is not what we need. Instead, trade and human rights should align in the EU’s external actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The ALDE Group hopes the answer to this oral question will provide clarity so that we can put the protocol to a vote. It is then up to Members of this House to vote according to their conscience, as we always do, even on difficult and politicised issues. However, with or without this protocol, I once again urge the Israeli Government to stop the illegal settlements and to move closer to the EU and the international community. Getting by on a day-by-day basis is not the same as a sustainable two-state solution, which moves further away with every settlement built. That is irresponsible towards Israeli citizens in a dramatically uncertain and changing neighbourhood.</p>

Time and again, we have been postponing and obstructing the ACAA, using different filibusters and trying to do everything we cannot to do what we know is needed. The only consequence is that we are postponing something that would help patients in Europe, that would give more choice in terms of medicines, and that would deliver greater competition and lower prices, even though everybody here knows it is about standards and that there are no medicines produced in the occupied territories. So how could this question even be relevant in this context? Even if there were medicines produced there, you know that these standards should apply to Israeli-produced medicines and to imported medicines, no matter where they come from.</p>
<p class="contents">The Israeli Government has a clear commitment to applying these standards. That is what it is all about. But sadly, this House has managed to hijack this question and make it into another part of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to the detriment of patients throughout Europe. That is a shame. Remember that we had an agreement and a debate on an agreement with Palestine – quite recently actually – and, at that time, we had the courage not to do what we are doing here. We judged it on its own merits and approved it. We should do the same thing right here and right now.</p>

It may be a technical upgrade of the relationship with Israel but there is no doubt there is a highly politicised move at this time. Adopting the ACAA is entirely out of sync with the EU’s ambition for policy coherence between trade, human rights, development and foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, we will vote on a resolution on EU policy in the West Bank and Jerusalem. Let us be coherent about how we tackle the suffering in the occupied territories and the increased trade benefits we give to Israel. We cannot turn a blind eye to the serious escalating human rights violations when we upgrade a trade agreement. More trade and easier trade should never be at the expense of upholding our commitments to human rights. The collective punishment of Gaza is unacceptable and until serious steps are taken by Israel to comply with international law, I strongly oppose this upgrade.</p>

<p class="contents">This clarification would help with the ACAA but, at the moment, even with that clarification, I strongly believe it would be wrong in terms of policy coherence to upgrade our relationship with Israel and I will continue to oppose the ACAA until the situation between Israel and the Palestinians improves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has turned desert into productive agricultural land, led the way on desalination technologies, and is home to a phenomenal number of start-up companies and a vibrant democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">What a contrast to those around. How much the Palestinians could learn and benefit from this if they were given the opportunity by their own leaders, if they recognised the right of Israel to exist, ended terrorism and hostility and moved forward in a positive spirit with negotiation of a two-state solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Those seeking to pick holes in the EU-Israel ACAA protocol should ask themselves a simple question: do we want to bring about peace and prosperity for Palestinians or do we wish to condemn another generation to a life of poverty, hardship and insecurity?</p>

Does the Commission consider that it has the legal authority to reject or geographically restrict the territorial scope of the agreement? What binding assurances can the Commission give Parliament that it will not accept, tacitly or otherwise, that the territorial competence of Israeli authorities covers the Palestinian Territories? There are widespread reports of circumvention of current rules governing control of Israeli settlement goods, so can the Commission clarify whether it intends to review or reinforce this, or how this ACAA should be monitored?</p>
<p class="contents">But, at the same time, as the Commission provides the legal clarifications, I have to ask myself, irrespective of the legal arguments, is it coherent or credible for the EU to consistently and forcefully criticise the Israeli authorities? We had the motion with the oral question last month, we have the resolution that we will be voting on tomorrow, so is it coherent to pass these resolutions, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, to enhance our trade relationship through ratifying ACAA which – while I accept it is not technically an upgrading, given that it is based on the existing association agreement – in practice, does allow access for Israeli pharmaceuticals to one of the most lucrative markets in the world? I think that we have to take all of those issues into consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is time to get on and vote on this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Two years of discussion in committee has been a delaying tactic. As Commissioner De Gucht said, the objective of the ACAA is to eliminate barriers to trade by reducing costs and delays. I am rather astonished that many on the Committee on International Trade want to constrain trade and keep up costs. You are doing consumers and patients no favours on choice and price of medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, if there are Palestinian pharmaceutical products, they will also benefit from easier export to the EU under this protocol. On the question of trade and human rights, I have no hesitation whatsoever in criticising settlements or administrative detention by Israel or the many human rights breaches by the two Palestinian administrations. Trade is not at the expense of human rights. I have to say, as Vice-Chair of the US delegation, that has never stopped me criticising human rights problems like rendition in Guantánamo in the United States and it will not stop me on Israel either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is actually far older than the history of the independent State of Israel. If we believe that the European Union can use this agreement as a means of positively influencing the development of Israeli-Palestinian relations, we are either mistaken or guilty of great arrogance.</p>
<p class="contents">This conflict remains unresolved and highly inflammatory because of policies on both sides, namely, the Palestinian authorities (not ordinary Palestinians, of course), and also Israel. I refer to settlements we do not recognise which are being established on the occupied territories. I have to admit that this is an enormous problem for those who, like myself, wish the state of Israel well, are mindful of the importance of this place, this country, this democracy which is developing exceptionally well in the Middle East, and who are also conscious of the enormous danger it faces.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would expect all those who criticise the Agreement on conformity assessment and acceptance of industrial products (ACAA) to put forward instead a grand, comprehensive plan, which we, as the European Union could – together with the United States – present to both sides to encourage them to talk. Clearly, the ACAA is not such a plan, but our failure to adopt it solely and exclusively to punish the State of Israel will ultimately penalise Europeans. European citizens will not be able to benefit from good, high-quality and inexpensive generic medicines, which are produced in Israel and not in the occupied territories. I therefore call upon everyone to vote in favour of the ACAA. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to product quality control and particularly in terms of the strict requirements concerning drugs, we are not against generic drugs. Quite the contrary, we think they are much more accessible, but we want guarantees. We want quality to be a requirement.

I believe it is a step forward to make Parliament and the International Trade Committee ready for their final decisions on this issue and to give European patients access to high-quality pharmaceutical products.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that this protocol has been under consideration in the European Parliament for more than two years. I hope two years is more than enough to discuss in depth, to scrutinise all possible aspects of this agreement, and to verify benefits and risks to European markets and European citizens. I am sure that it is time to give a green light to the implementation of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been rightly pointed out today by Commissioner De Gucht, this protocol is part of the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement, which came into force in 1995, establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States and the State of Israel. Its Protocol 5 defines measures and rules on mutual assistance between administrative authorities on customs matters.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to mention today that there are instruments in place to detect cases of abuse. These instruments are legally binding and have been used in the past. The Commission proposed additional improvements and measures to be applied in order to strengthen customs procedures and verify conformity requirements and country of origin declarations.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that legal measures are sufficient. They are functional and they are transparent. I believe that the International Trade Committee should move to a vote on the agreement without delay, facilitating a decision on consent to this agreement to be voted on in the plenary session following our summer recess. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I understand our economic interests, I also understand the technical scope of this protocol, but I believe the European Union should undertake a careful review of the origin of the products, because no protocol or agreement can ignore the more general context which prevails today.

Parliament is stuck regarding ideological and political conflicts between those who are for or against Israel which, being matters not falling within the scope of the agreement being debated, unnecessarily hold up negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The opportunity for Israeli businesses to manipulate the protocol agreement in order to export goods to the occupied territories is offset by the possibility of sending back such products at EU borders under the so-called ‘technical agreement’, whereby the customs authorities of Member States may reject declarations of conformity for goods and products whose origins are in serious doubt.</p>
<p class="contents">This is apart from the fact, incidentally, that if the Council had approved the regulation on the designation of origin, we would not be having this problem. I therefore hope the Committee on International Trade (INTA) will vote on this agreement as soon as possible and that the debate in the committee is more about reducing technical barriers to trade and will not continue to get bogged down in manipulating a non-existent problem.

This debate is not a technical debate, it is a political debate, and the heart of the question again – which we come back to time and again on international trade agreements and related aspects here in Parliament – is whether the commitments in words to human rights by the European Parliament and the EU will last when faced with commercial interests of European big business and also, in this case, when faced with a political agenda of support for Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">Fundamental for me is the point that we cannot go ahead with ACAA when there is a continuation of oppression of the Palestinians, an expansion of Israeli settlements and a continuation of the occupation. A number of MEPs argue in favour, because they say that EU patients would have access to a broader range of generic and branded medicines. That is extremely hypocritical in this case, given the conditions that I saw at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza, which does not have 150 out of 450 essential medicines. When I was there, they did not have the necessary surgical gloves. We cannot go ahead with this agreement while those conditions prevail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should stress that its signing does not mark a new phase in relations but rather the implementation of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. In this context, I think that it was unjustified to delay the decision for a very long time. I hope that today’s debate will be the final chapter in this controversy, after which Parliament will finally give its consent. This is why I call on the Commission to provide all the clarifications requested by some of my colleagues, so that we can overcome the current deadlock. I should also mention that the report on Israel’s involvement in EU programmes, for which I am the shadow rapporteur, has also been blocked for a very long time by the Committee on Foreign Affairs. I hope that this situation can be resolved to allow cooperation with Israel to progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This agreement between the EU and Israel was referred to Parliament two years ago and the consent procedure has been postponed ever since due to political considerations that I personally do not subscribe to.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the agreement is good and one which the EU and Israel need because it will facilitate the trade in medicines between the two countries with benefits in terms of health care for our patients. Many patients in the EU do not have access to proper treatment for diseases, especially those suffering from rare diseases. The agreement could change this situation, because Israel is one of the top innovators in the health care sector. Agreeing on the rules concerning the conformity assessment and acceptance of these products will facilitate the entry on the market of innovative treatments which our patients need. I therefore think that it is the right time to stop delaying the procedure and approve this agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore a campaign to get an upgrade for Israel. From both sides, on the part of the Palestinians, but also on the part of large parts of the Arab world, an upgrade and recognition of ACAA will be seen as a reward. Those of us who have been to the area have heard this said very clearly so many times, and it was also said when Palestine’s foreign minister was here, so let us be open about it now. This will be a reward and it will be a case of ‘more for less’, because human rights are going backwards at the moment, and yet we are, in fact, giving Israel a better opportunity. I do not believe that anyone here – in response to those who say that we are only after Israel – would not want an Israel that lived in peace and democracy within recognised borders, borders recognised by both Israel and us, and with whom we would be pleased to trade. However, we do not want to trade with a country that will not actually comply with our fundamental values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It cannot be considered as an upgrade of relations with Israel, as Baroness Ashton declared here in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also stated that no changes are needed to this agreement and, moreover, the high quality of the medicinal products involved and the economic benefits for national health care systems have been confirmed. The Italian health care system, for example, would save millions of euro in patient care costs.</p>
<p class="contents">My conviction is that in fact, opposition to this agreement is of a purely political nature, with the aim of boycotting Israel. Those who oppose this agreement for political reasons should therefore also oppose trade agreements with China, which is occupying Tibet, with Russia, occupying part of Georgia, Armenia, occupying Nagorno-Karabakh, and with any states guilty of serious human rights violations, which amounts to two-thirds of humanity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have been following this debate, Commissioner, since it was in Parliament’s hands, that is, since March 2010. Since then, we have had two and a half years of postponements, delays, questions, ping-pong matches, in other words, obstacles to the agreement, and that includes the latest questions put to you. No medicine is produced in the territories and everyone knows it. These are purely rhetorical questions.</p>
<p class="contents">This parliamentary – we could even say buccaneering – obstruction is not worthy of our Parliament, which, less than an hour ago, was championing transparency on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), as we heard, calling for that same transparency from the Council, as it has done again this morning. Some people here are, in a non-transparent way and behind the scenes, waging a real war of shadows against the Agreement on conformity assessment and acceptance (ACAA). No matter what some people might think of this agreement, I do not believe that it is up to them to stop others from expressing their opinion on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I hope that your very specific and detailed answers will have reassured the Committee on International Trade (INTA) and our Parliament so that they can stop being held hostage on the matter and can finally, in good faith, express their true feelings on this issue, whether they are for or against. It is worth mentioning that this is an agreement which concerns free trade in pharmaceutical products and, therefore, the health of the world’s citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the other hand, I think the political stance of the European Union with respect to Israel is clear: we do not recognise the settlements. We have to apply the existing legislation with respect to the settlements in the way that has been voted upon and the same goes for possible additional legislation with respect to the settlements. That is as a starting point: we do not recognise them.</p>
<p class="contents">What I have been doing is giving you the assurances that in good faith I can give you. They are not watertight, and all we can do is to do everything possible to monitor what we have been deciding so as to make sure that no products from the settlements come on to our markets. That is not only relevant to the ACAA, there are many other provisions and many other DGs that are implicated in this and what I will take upon myself is to have a coordination meeting of the different DGs and services so that we can in the future – probably, hopefully – better monitor what is really happening.</p>
<p class="contents">There were many other questions, for example, on the fact that human rights provisions are not included in the ACAA. The same goes for many other provisions. It is a protocol to an existing association agreement, which means that anything that is provided for in the association agreement, for example, in respect to human rights, also, of course, applies to the protocols to that association agreement. You do not have to repeat them again in the protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">There was also the question of whether we could provide you with the information in respect to monitoring. Whenever the European Parliament asks questions to the Commission, be they oral questions or written questions, we try to respond to them and we will, of course, do so. So if we get questions on the application of this protocol, we will try to give as fair an answer as possible and this does not, Ms De Keyser, only apply to the Trade Directorate-General; it applies to a number of other services like SANCO, TAXUD and others. So if you want us to give information, we will give the information we have. That will not necessarily be completely watertight because it is about putting into practice existing legislation and an existing protocol to an association agreement, but we will do so in good faith and it should be beyond doubt that the position of the European Union with respect to Israel is crystal clear: we do not recognise the settlements and Israel has an obligation of cooperation with respect to the occupied territories, for example, when it comes to this type of protocol. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
