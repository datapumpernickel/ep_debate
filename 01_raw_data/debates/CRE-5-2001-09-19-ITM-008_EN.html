<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Marques (PPE-OF), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission report dealing with the activities of the Cohesion Fund in 1999 proves that, as in previous years, it is continuing to pursue the most immediate objectives for which it was created, which are to provide the so-called cohesion countries, Portugal, Spain, Greece and Ireland, with economic infrastructures in the areas of the environment and transport. In these two areas, for example, the Cohesion Fund has been crucial to the creation of infrastructures that are essential to the development of my region. Only in 1999, it funded the extension of Madeira’s airport and a major solid waste treatment plant.</p>
<p class="contents">We have further grounds to be satisfied with the activity of the Cohesion Fund in 1999. The physical and the financial execution of the projects that have been supported, the distribution of appropriations between the environment and transport, compliance with Community environmental legislation and the distribution of appropriations by beneficiary countries have all continued to respect the Fund’s operational rules. Furthermore, no situation involving fraud or duplication of funding between the Cohesion Fund and any other Community fund was uncovered. Because everything ran to plan in 1999, because this is the last year of the 1993-1999 programming period and because the Commission report provides a broad overview of developments that have taken place during this period, I feel it is more important to focus my speech on the contribution of the Cohesion Fund to achieving economic and social cohesion, of which it is a fundamental instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be pointed out, incidentally, that the principle of solidarity, a real pillar of the project of European integration, has seen better days, specifically as a result of the two duplications of financial resources granted to structural policies in 1986 and 1992, whose aim was to enable the cohesion countries to better cope with the pressures unleashed by the huge internal market and by Economic and Monetary Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In June 1999, however, when the Heads of State and Government had to decide at the Berlin Summit on the Structural Funds to be allocated for the 2000-2006 period under what came to be known as Agenda 2000, there were no further duplications. There was even a visible decrease. It was at that Summit that national self-interest supplanted the European interest of a more cohesive and balanced Europe, which had such tireless champions in Jacques Delors and Helmut Kohl.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, however, the proximity of enlargement and the need to correct the enormous regional imbalances we will see as a consequence make it imperative that we give new impetus to economic and social cohesion policy. We are convinced that the Commission and, in particular, Commissioner Michel Barnier are equal to this challenge. We must also consider the fact that giving new impetus to cohesion policy is necessary, not only to deal with the countries that are expected to join the European Union in the near future, but also, even following enlargement, to maintain the fight against the lack of cohesion that still exists in the current European Union of fifteen countries. As a matter of fact, regional disparities within the current Europe of fifteen could even increase as a result of the pressures produced by the enlargement process, specifically in the relationships between countries on the periphery of the Union and those at its centre. In other words, countries such as Portugal, for example, may become more peripheral and the current centre, which includes London, Paris and such places, may be increased even further because it will become the centre of a Europe that is economically integrated from the west almost to the eastern border. We must remember that excessive regional imbalances constitute an economic and political threat to the European Union. They are an economic threat because, unless we are able to take full and more efficient advantage of the resources of the most depressed regions, the entire European Union will lose out. They are a political threat because the European Union cannot succeed if it is underpinned by stark territorial and social inequalities. Europe must have cohesion or it will not work. Not enabling Europe to work is the great risk that we would run if we went ahead with the totally unacceptable idea of renationalising cohesion policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore feel that the creation of the Cohesion Fund by the Treaty of Maastricht has been fully justified. This is, as a matter of fact, clearly demonstrated by the balance of the first operational period of the Cohesion Fund between 1993 and 1999. The Cohesion Fund, we can now say, has been a major factor for real convergence, and has provided a strong incentive for the beneficiary countries to comply with the nominal convergence criteria laid down at Maastricht. We must, therefore, oppose any attempt to abolish the Cohesion Fund. We must also draw the lessons of this first period of operation to improve the effectiveness of the Cohesion Fund even further. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The major initial regional differences have remained the same or have increased. Proof of this is the fact that the average <span class="italic">per capita </span>income of the 10% of the population that lives in the most prosperous regions of the Union is still 2.6 times higher than that of the 10% of the population living in the least-developed regions. Territorial inequalities that existed within certain States that have Objective 1 regions, such as Italy, Spain and Greece are also still very much in evidence. In contrast with this situation, we have seen a strengthening in recent years of the area between London, Paris and Hamburg. This is a huge central region, which accounts for only a seventh of Europe’s surface area, but for one-third of its population and which enjoys almost one-half of its total income, in a concentration of cities and employment that threatens the sustainable development of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, nothing suggests that these trends are likely to change over the next few years. The budgetary forecasts approved in Agenda 2000 for the present period are extremely restrictive, which means that, whereas in 1999 the percentage of the European Union’s GDP dedicated to cohesion policy reached 0.46%, in 2006 it will not exceed 0.31%, a return to 1994 levels. These figures are extremely worrying. Furthermore, one need only look at the experience of German reunification to understand that, if we do not do everything that we can to remedy the situation, the problem will get worse when the enlargement States join the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Given these circumstances, we must be aware that when we talk about Structural Funds policy, we are not dealing with ‘just another’ EU problem. On the contrary, we are talking about a fundamental issue, in that the direction of political Europe depends to a large extent on positive developments in cohesion policy both with regard to Objective 1 territories in the current EU that still need it and to the new Member States that will require budgetary funds that must not be additional or supplementary funds. Unless this is precisely the decision we take, we will see the unacceptable paradox of the much-needed cohesion policy for the new States being paid for with money taken from the budget that is today earmarked for the least developed countries of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot allow the European Union to take a step backwards in territorial and social development policy. Political Europe would not be what it is today without cohesion policy and it would be hypocritical and irresponsible to call for the one whilst refusing to provide the economic resources to make the other possible. In this context, I think that we cannot delay taking a decision that will ensure an increase in the Union’s budget for the next programming period that is considerably higher than 1.27% of the Community GDP. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This initiative has a political and a symbolic side. It highlights the fact that equality between the sexes is a necessary dimension of our endeavour to achieve economic development with social and regional cohesion. However, our committee is disappointed that this presentation is regionally based and does not contain accurate data which allow us to assess both women's access to Structural Funds and the impact of Community initiatives on promoting equal opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the new regulation which applies to the 2000-2006 programming period, mainstreaming equal opportunities for women and men is a priority aim and the Member States are obliged to conduct an <span class="italic">ex ante</span> evaluation of their programmes from the point of view of gender equality using indicators and statistics. We should take this opportunity to stress that indicators and statistics need to be broken down by gender, something which the European Parliament has called for repeatedly.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should also stress that we are calling on the European Commission to ensure that the principle of gender equality is duly taken into account and that statistics are kept – not just during programming but throughout the whole monitoring and intervention procedure – on the increase in female employment, the provision of quality, viable new jobs and the creation of infrastructures which allow family and working life to be reconciled.</p>
<p class="contents">And, finally, we want to stress the importance of coordinated action between the European Commission and the Member States on informing regional agencies and all entitled beneficiaries of the possibilities of implementing equal opportunities through Structural Fund measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was a fully justified and important instrument, not only of economic and social cohesion, but also of support for the countries which had the greatest difficulties in fulfilling the stability and convergence programmes which lead to the introduction of the single currency. That fund has been an important factor in terms of real convergence and a strong incentive for compliance with the Maastricht criteria. Aid has been directed towards the creation of infrastructure, transport and environmental projects. 99% of the aid envisaged was granted, which is rather a shame, since 100% should have been achieved, although that was almost achieved at the end of the period being analysed, that is, in 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent reform of the Structural Funds is adequate to significantly simplify the planning, implementation and funding of the interventions and the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has asked for the interventions to involve better assistance for national administrations. We feel it will be very important in the future to consider a breakdown by gender, which would permit specific actions aimed at the promotion of women. The financial contribution is lower than that contained in the proposal of the Commission and the European Parliament. It is regrettable that this will hinder the achievement of the employment objectives, particularly in view of the fact that all the Member States and European institutions are committed to decisive action in favour of employment, agreed at the Lisbon Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a positive thing to include amongst the objectives the achievement of equality between men and women in employment programmes, since it is one of the fields in which women clearly participate less than men. It is therefore satisfactory that the Commission has decided, in accordance with Articles 2 and 141 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, in the future to integrate gender into all Community policies and actions with a view to adopting horizontal positive action measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This 11th Annual Report on the Structural Funds relates to a year which is undoubtedly very important for the development of the European Union's cohesion policies. My group supports the rapporteur on some of the proposed measures and options to improve the management of the Structural Funds, such as speeding up the implementation of approved measures, concentrating assistance in areas whose development is lagging behind or improving on-the-spot checks to combat what is still a very high level of fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we also have some criticisms. We should point out that we do not endorse some of the conclusions drawn by the rapporteur, such as the overly negative assessment of the Structural Fund results during the planning period and the failure to meet the regional policy objective of harmonising living conditions, which has supposedly only been achieved in part. I would say to the rapporteur that he has adopted the wrong approach to European structural policy, whose task is solely to reduce disparities and which I believe has generally achieved this goal. In fact, there will always be a discrepancy between living conditions in the rich and poor regions of the EU, and even within Member States. We are daydreaming if we expect harmonisation from the structural policies. We should not confuse achievable goals with a wish list here.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point of criticism is that despite all the significance of 1999, the 11th Report is an annual report and not a storehouse catalogue in which all the concerns and problems faced by the European Union in the past, present and future have to be rolled out yet again. If reports are to achieve anything, they must focus on specific priorities, as we all know from our years of practical experience here in Parliament. This is precisely what this report does not do. As I said, the rapporteur's conclusions are not necessarily wrong, but much of what is included in the report really does not need to be there. That is why we believe that some of the points raised in the report need to be amended by the plenary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The most striking example is the vast sum of resources which were not spent during the 1993-1999 period and must be used before 31 December this year. I feel that it is right and important to send out a clear warning two months or so before the expiry date. We need enthusiastic commitment<span class="bold"> </span>but, instead, there are regions and States who are irresponsibly disregarding the impending danger of wasting these funds. Then there is the fact that it would be useful – so to speak – to learn from the errors and delays which occurred during the 1993-1999 period and avoid repeating them. Mr Mastorakis has already quoted some Greek to you and I am going to quote some Latin: <span class="italic">errare humanum est, perseverare autem diabolicum</span>. This is a well-known saying but many appear to have forgotten it. The statistics for the year 2000, with which Commissioner Barnier is familiar, do nothing to allay our fears. Despite the increasing endeavours of the Commissioner himself, the innovations contained in the reform of the Structural Funds are being incorporated slowly and laboriously.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament must seize this opportunity too to reaffirm its right and responsibility to act. Parliament, which is the body directly elected by the citizens, cannot remain silent if a fundamental instrument for the development of the Communities and their cohesion is not being properly implemented. We must therefore work shoulder to shoulder – Commission, Parliament, Council and regional and local players – to bring about rapid acceleration and to finalise the payments to projects which enhance the competitiveness of regions, particularly those which are most disadvantaged and underdeveloped.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make it clear to everybody that the quality and size of the expenditure, the profitability of the various objectives and the results achieved by the different beneficiaries will be the crucial factors for defining the European Union’s future cohesion strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During the eleven and seven years, respectively, which these Community Funds have been operating, the average per capita income in Spain, Greece and Portugal, which in 1988 stood at 68%, has risen to 79% of the European average in 1999. In other words, it has increased by an average of one point per year. At this rate, it would take 21 more years for the whole of the European Union to achieve an equal level.</p>
<p class="contents">I have serious doubts about the political will to eliminate the differences and the genuine solidarity of the governments of the Union. And I say this because, as Mr Nogueira has pointed out, in 1999 the Funds of the cohesion policy for 92-99 represented 0.46% of GDP, while those from Agenda 2000 until 2006 will only represent 0.31%, that is to say, they will be reduced by 15 points. Furthermore, there are some who do not intend to increase their contributions but nevertheless, through these reduced amounts, expect to show solidarity with the new Eastern States which will be part of the enlarged EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, if we are really committed to equal opportunities, solidarity and a genuine united Europe, we must stop being miserly and we must all give more money, especially the richest amongst us, for the benefit of the poorest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The results achieved, however, are not the same across the board, and it is worth exploring the reasons for this.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, strangely, there are bureaucratic problems and mechanisms which are still poorly defined, particularly as regards the time frames for the disbursement and use of the funds: this applies to the Cohesion Fund, of which all the appropriations for 1999 were not used, and it applies to the Structural Funds, which did not achieve the 100% expenditure target both because the majority of the resources were committed only just before the end of the programming period and because of the slow rate of disbursement of the appropriations available. These factors make the process much more burdensome for those implementing the programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The delays certainly do not contribute to the overall improvement in socio-economic and employment conditions in the regions concerned. In this sense, a crucial moment for both funds is the evaluation, not just an <span class="italic">ex ante</span> analysis but also, most importantly, an <span class="italic">ex post</span> evaluation, which is no use if it is not carried out within the correct time frame, the correct time frame being before the programming of the subsequent operations, which cannot be carried out rationally if the final evaluation of the previous programmes cannot be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the evaluation is necessary in order to verify that the principle of additionality is being respected according to the clear indications of the Court of Auditors, which should be observed.</p>
<p class="contents">Linked to this is the point that it would be beneficial if the Commission were to provide clearer, more comprehensive information of an essentially social and economic rather than accounting nature on the evaluation of projects, highlighting whether the aim of reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions has been achieved; the European Parliament needs to receive this information in due time, not – as has happened this time with regard to the Cohesion Fund – two years late, for that clearly makes it impossible to correct shortcomings and reprogramme operations in useful time. And this is an operation that is becoming still more necessary in view of the now impending enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must demand a more active role for Parliament in the evaluation of the effectiveness of the operations and the goals pursued. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it would be a mistake to think that we do not need to question the current level of the Cohesion Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">The impending accession of a number of new Member States alone would prompt this. I welcome the fact that Mr Marques has outlined the goals, means and conditions of the Cohesion Fund. The fund was set up to help Member States meet the convergence criteria with the EMU in mind. There is no ambiguity in this respect. The Structural Funds, on the other hand, are designed to help meet other goals.</p>
<p class="contents">The accession requires us to evaluate and revise the structural policy, including that of the Cohesion Fund, but in my opinion, not so many changes are required. It is important, however, for the fund only to be used for the purpose it was intended. If that is the case, the existing system has many successful years ahead, even following the accession. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are dealing with Funds which were established at a particular moment when our objectives involved a policy of economic and social cohesion. On the one hand, this policy has clearly been successful but, on the other, we also see that differences remain, as the reports demonstrate. Does this mean that this policy has failed? I would say rather that it means that the policy is not only successful for the cohesion countries, for the poorest regions which are receiving significant aid, but also for other regions, in the wealthy countries, which do not receive the aid. In the end there is widespread movement throughout Europe and, by means of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, those regions of the richer countries end up benefiting from the aid, because technologies are being bought, because investments are being made by those countries in which technological progress is being made. That is perhaps the reason why the differences are being maintained, after the large amounts of aid and the great investments which have been carried out through the Cohesion Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now facing the problems relating to enlargement. Does the Cohesion Fund need to be modified? Will the poorer regions stop receiving it? Are the States which have so far been receiving aid going to stop doing so in favour of the new States? I believe that this is currently the great challenge for the Commissioner and for Parliament. I believe that the aid must be maintained, that we have to be imaginative and must ensure that the Funds continue to reach all the regions. Otherwise, the differences will increase.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make an effort to ensure that the enlargement countries also become economic motors which will allow this policy of economic and social cohesion to eventually lead to a much more just and free Europe. We have seen recent examples of the results of poverty and fanaticism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would even go as far as to say that that evaluation should be positive or even better, given how brilliant the results are. We would like to make some very specific comments in relation to these two reports on the application of the Funds during the years in question. It is the case that the information is good because, firstly, Parliament’s recommendations are complied with. The balance between investments in railways and in road infrastructures, in terms of the environment, has moved into line with the parliamentary recommendation. There is no report on fraud in the application of these Funds and another series of statistical criteria are correctly complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">But we are not the Court of Auditors. What these reports lack is more of a qualitative character: we want to know what qualitative economic and political effect these investments are having; to what extent is the metabolism of these regions being changed; to what extent are the governments correctly applying the investments, directly towards productive investments, as the structural policy demands. That is what is lacking in the reports on the application of the Cohesion Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">And this is true in all respects. Next year we will have to examine the reports on the application of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund in 2000 and 2001. The data will not be good, but I do not want to condemn it in advance because, if the Commission demonstrates that they have been well used in terms of programming, this will be a qualitative element which Parliament will have to take into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, we agree with what the rapporteur, Mr Nogueira Román, says about the lack of a complete quantitative description or detailed explanations of these funds. Europe must have a genuine return on the funding it grants in order, on the one hand, to monitor that the projects are effectively carried out and that public monies are being put to good use and, on the other hand, to optimise the new programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the citizens of my region keep making the same criticisms: too complicated, too much red tape, too slow. I think we do not give enough precedence to the small structural projects where simplicity and speed are of the essence if we want to respond to real needs on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot help wondering about the contradiction between saying we want to give priority to employment, with reference in particular to the Lisbon European Council declarations, while at the same time paying so little attention to the small micro-enterprise and SME projects which, after all and as everyone knows, are the prime job creators. It is vital that all of us, beginning with the Commission, try to work more closely with all our fellow-citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I want to protest about a practice that I personally find unfair and unfounded. What I mean is that the Commission could use a form of blackmail – and I am weighing my words here – by tying the funding to strict respect for the environmental obligations it lays down. I entirely agree about the growing need to respect our environment, but I am equally against this kind of pseudo-ecological diktat. I think that would be a real diversion of these funds which, let me remind you, are supposed to help finance job-creation and wealth-creation projects to combat the economic imbalances between the various European regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Since I know that economic cohesion remains unsatisfactory, let me end by asking what is really behind the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund policy: are these funds designed to be a means of applying pressure or are they designed to provide genuine economic assistance? It is a question worth asking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Marques' report, relating to 1999, it did indeed arrive rather late, in January 2001. I can tell the rapporteur that this was due to the problems of reorganising our Directorate-General. Let me now assure him that the report for the year 2000 has been finalised and that the Commission will most probably adopt it in early October.</p>
<p class="contents">Briefly, there are four lessons to be learned. The first concerns total and complete financial implementation throughout the programming period. It is true that not all the payment appropriations for 1999 were used in full; only 91.6% of available payment appropriations were implemented. The reason why the appropriations were not all used is the large number of applications for payments reaching the Commission in December 1999. But, on a more positive note, not a single case of fraud or double financing between the Cohesion Fund and any other Community source was detected in 1999. I have kept Parliament informed at regular intervals of the progress in implementing the budget and will continue to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the question of balancing investment in transport and investment in the environment, which, like you, I consider important.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I understand and endorse your wish to see the Commission devote more resources to on-the-spot checks. Here again, the reorganisation of our departments and in particular the decentralisation of those activities has caused some problems. Our Directorate-General is now responsible for carrying out on-the-spot checks of Cohesion Fund measures but also of all the actions cofinanced under the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, Mr Marques, coordination between the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds has been given real impetus with the new regulations for the period 2000-2006 and, within the Directorate-General, with the integrated management of the various departments concerned with the Cohesion Fund and the other Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what I wanted to say, very briefly – following the President's advice – in response to the four points made in Mr Marques' report, for which I thank him.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the report by Mr Nogueira Román, while thanking him too for his fine report, I would again like to make four comments. Firstly, regarding the implementation of the funds in 1999, 99% of appropriations for the period 1994-1999 were committed and 75% were paid. That is a figure that, I believe, is broadly satisfactory. As you know, on-site payments can be made up to 31 December this year, in accordance with the regulations. The payment appropriations will, I think, be implemented in full and for the last two years – this was a job that began before my arrival – I have been working with the Member States to ensure that they are taken up as fully as possible. That is a concern that Mr Pittella also raised a moment ago. The delays in the start-up of some programmes in 1994 and 1995 have, therefore, been overcome for most of the actions under the on-going programme. A similar improvement in the rate of execution can be seen in the programme of Community initiatives, although here the delays were a little more serious. It is true, as the rapporteur rightly pointed out, that many outstanding commitments still remained to be paid at the end of 1999. Basically that was because of the accumulation of projects at the end of the programming period. But let me point out that the situation quite clearly improved in 2000, since the commitments remaining to be paid at the end of 1999 were reduced by 47%. In order to keep Parliament more fully informed on the subject, at the end of June 2001 the Commission drew up a full report on the unexpected commitments remaining to be paid for all categories of expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the rapporteur welcomed the fact that the horizontal theme of 1999 was equality between women and men in the Structural Funds programmes. With regard to the Structural Funds for the current period, I can confirm that gender equality has been one of the criteria for accepting plans received from Member States and you can count on Anna Diamantopoulou being very vigilant on this subject; the same applies to Mr Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou and Mrs Avilés Perea, as I noted a moment ago. For the period 1994-1999, however, Member States did not have to provide information on the access of women to the Structural Funds. That means that we have no detailed information on these matters for that programming period.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is additionality, which the rapporteur sees as open to question, as I do at times. On this point I can confirm that the Commission has carefully checked for compliance with this principle during the ex-ante review of new programmes for the period 2000-2006. Regarding the previous period, the Commission will conclude its final check on additionality at the end of 2002. I agree about the need for more stringent penalties in the event that a Member State does not respect the principle of additionality. As honourable Members will know, no provision is made for such penalties under the fund rules for the period 2000-2006. The legislator, chiefly the Council, was firmly opposed to the idea at the time the regulations were adopted. We do, however, have some measures we can take in the event that additionality has not been verified and if necessary I shall take these measures in consultation with my colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of evaluation and monitoring, as you know the mid-term ex-ante or ex-post review was fully integrated into the programming for this new 2000-2006 period. The Commission has just launched the ex-post evaluation for Objectives 1 and 2 for the 1994-1999 period, together with thematic evaluations of the information society, sustainable development and small and medium-sized enterprises. These evaluations, like the mid-term reviews that will be carried out in 2003, will provide answers to any outstanding questions and I will, of course, inform the European Parliament of the results.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, with regard to monitoring, the same vigilance will apply; but here the Commission now has a different role to play. As you know, on-the-spot checks now fall within the remit of each Member State, which is obliged to report back to the Commission at regular intervals. We for our part will and do verify that each Member State has set up a reliable system of on-the-spot checks. Lastly, let me emphasise that the number of these checks also rose in 1999, reaching the figure of 120 compared with 100 in 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me repeat that the Commission is committed to the basic principles of the Structural Funds: concentration, additionality and partnership, and the best possible coordination with the Cohesion Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">In their reports, the rapporteurs urge us to be even more effective and vigilant. Let me assure you that I am confident that we will be able to give you even greater satisfaction when we come to study the results and the evaluation for the year 2000. That is the year when the new programming will start, together with some new rules. I believe we will be able to present more positive results, in response to your demands and to the vigilance that you are showing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
