<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to warmly thank the four rapporteurs for the excellent work they have done, which means that the plenum is being presented with some generally positive reports, which move in the same direction as the Commission’s proposal and support the Commission’s approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Parliament, which, furthermore, has dealt with these reports as a global package, resisting the temptation to divide it up, which would undoubtedly have hindered our common objective of finally creating a genuine European rail area.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this is the second stage of a prolonged process. Following the entry into force on 15 March 2001 of the three directives of the infrastructures package, which will have to be incorporated into the Member States’ legislations from 15 March 2003, we must now complete the legislative framework in order to speed up the creation of a genuine European rail area. The four proposals we are going to debate today fall within the framework of this process.</p>
<p class="contents">I will firstly comment on the proposed amendment to Directive 91/440/EEC, extending access rights to infrastructure and freight services within the Member States, and to speed up the opening up of the market. The rapporteur is Mr Jarzembowski, who has done a wonderful job.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the White Paper on European transport policy provides an alarming description of the development of rail freight transport. Over the last twenty years, the quota corresponding to this sector – within the overall distribution of goods transport in the Union – has been reduced by half, from 15% in 1980 to 8% in 1999. Over this period, the quality of services provided to clients has not improved and in certain Member States it has worsened. This is therefore an extremely pressing issue. I do not believe we can wait until 2008 to open up international goods transport to competition throughout the European network.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also deal with domestic transport. That is why certain modifications are proposed to replace the timetable and methods for opening up laid down in Directive 2001/12/EC, without waiting any longer for the opening up of freight transport, both national and international, to the whole of the network. In practice, this total opening up of access rights in the field of freight would be effective by 2006, which would mean bringing forward this opening up to the whole network by two years.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the second proposed directive relates, of course, to rail safety. I believe that the issue of safety in transport is something which occupies and preoccupies all of us, especially at the moment. I would also like to thank Mr Sterckx for his work.</p>
<p class="contents">We must guarantee that the integration of the European rail network does not mean a reduction in the maximum levels of the safety standards in the various Member States of the Union. But at the same time we must guarantee that the establishment of common rules prevents any possibility that, as a result of safety issues, the market may be harmed or there may be any discrimination in access to the networks. The creation of an internal market in rail services would not be possible without the establishment of common safety rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the opening up of the markets and the end of the monopolies considerably modify such an important factor as the system of responsibilities in the field of safety, and it is therefore necessary to establish a coherent, transparent and clear framework which prevents any doubt in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The safety directive focuses on four areas: the designation of national safety authorities, separate from the operators, with clearly defined responsibilities; the determination of the essential elements of safety systems in relation to the operator of infrastructures and rail companies and the establishment of a mechanism for determining and adopting common safety objectives and methods – a role to be played by the rail Agency; the establishment of a common system for the issuing, content and validity of safety certificates; finally, the introduction, as in other sectors, of the principle of independent technical investigations in the event of accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">We now come to the third proposed directive. If we establish the network, if we guarantee a common level of safety, with clearly defined responsibilities, it is also necessary to establish an interoperable system. Hence the amendment of Directives 96/48/EC and 2001/16/EC on interoperability, whose rapporteur is Mrs Ainardi.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as the modifications which experience suggests we should make, it is essentially a question of guaranteeing coherence in the scope of the network in which opening up of access is carried out and the network in which the interoperability standards must be applied.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a question of sending a very clear message about the need to standardise equipment, with a view to reducing costs. We cannot just remove administrative borders, but we must also remove technological borders in order to create this European rail network.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my gratitude for the work done on an enormously technical and arduous subject, but on which the work of Parliament and the rapporteur have once again been of the highest quality.</p>
<p class="contents">I will finally comment on the fourth proposal, to create a European Railways Agency, on which Mr Savary has done some very considerable work.</p>
<p class="contents">The Agency is the cornerstone, it will complete the circle and will be the instrument which will allow us to make progress in the field of the interoperability of rail safety and therefore to guarantee the integration of the European rail network.</p>
<p class="contents">This Agency will provide technical support for decision making, without autonomous competences, and will provide the Commission with opinions and recommendations. The texts in question will be adopted by the Commission in accordance with a comitology procedure, as is currently the case in relation to interoperability.</p>
<p class="contents">Its main fields of activity will be as follows: the technical drawing up of texts planned for the directive on safety – common safety objectives and common safety methods – and for the directives on interoperability; the creation of a network of national safety and interoperability authorities; technical advice to the Commission and the national authorities on specific cases in the field of safety rules.</p>
<p class="contents">This Agency, which will be made up of some 100 people, will be responsible for promoting the work of the technical approximation of rail systems and will be independent, although it will work in close cooperation with experts in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, to conclude, the texts proposed intend, on the one hand, to ensure that 15 incompatible national systems develop technically towards an integrated and competitive European rail area and, on the other, to speed up the opening up of the market in freight transport, so that operators can provide effective services in any part of the Union. Let us finally opt for a modern railway, worthy of the twenty-first century, which is able to compete effectively with other modes of transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jarzembowski (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this is a good day, even if there are not so many people listening at the moment – and I hope that the press will report on this important debate – because we are finally on the way towards also establishing an internal market in the rail sector. This is an absolutely crucial point, because this is the only internal market that is actually still lacking in the transport sector. That is why, Commissioner, our four reports express our full agreement, in principle, with the Commission's basic ideas. However, being a self-assured Parliament and co-legislator, we have also tabled some substantial amendments to the four Commission proposals. I hope that the Commissioner will support all of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Why have we tabled amendments? By tabling these amendments we are seeking to hasten the revitalisation of the rail sector in the European Union. We must create the necessary framework conditions sooner, because if we do not manage to revitalise the railways, we will not meet our European transport policy objective – laid down in the White Paper – by 2010 either. By 2010 we want to bring the different modes of transport back into balance, which in practice means that we want to carry more freight by rail instead of by road and more passengers by rail instead of by air or road.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve this objective of putting a larger proportion of the overall volume of traffic back onto the railways, we need to create appropriate framework conditions. These must be such that the rail networks really are opened up throughout the Union to existing and new railway undertakings, that is that network access is liberalised. In addition, by adopting European standards we must also physically cross internal borders, meaning that trains must be able to cross borders without stopping or slowing down, so that we can also make the advantages offered by the internal market a reality from the technical point of view. And we need a high level of safety. Since in the future we will not only have the national railway companies in the Member States but also increasing numbers of private railway undertakings, operating across the Union, it is no longer sufficient for the national authorities to be responsible for safety standards. Instead we need common, high European standards of safety for the benefit of passengers and railway staff.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we need a European railway agency to energetically push forward all of these measures and monitor them. We have made progress on interoperability, but too slowly. At a conference, technical experts informed us that it would take 30 years to achieve interoperability, that is for trains to be able to use different networks without stopping. Ladies and gentlemen, if we wait that long there will not be any railways left in Europe that are operated on a commercial basis. However, we want the railways, and so all of us here need to energetically drive these measures forward, and that is why we need a European railway agency.</p>
<p class="contents">In an internal market for railways designed in this way, it will be crucial for modern, forward-looking railway undertakings to attract more freight and more passengers onto rail by providing services that customers want and that run on time. If we continue to have the kind of planning system that we have today, which means that a railway undertaking cannot guarantee when a train travelling from Germany to Italy is going to arrive – there are hour- and even day-long delays – then rail is not going to be able to compete with HGVs. But we want to create the framework conditions to ensure that trains can compete with HGVs.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make four brief comments on my report. The first, Commissioner, is one on which I think we now agree. The Commission wanted to postpone the introduction of the special rail network for freight services in Europe, the so-called Trans-European Rail Freight Network, which the first railway package already states will come into being on 15 March 2003. We are against this and think that we need this special rail network on 15 March of this year so as to gain experience of cross-border freight transport. I hope that the Commission agrees.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we think that the aim set by the Commission of opening up the whole network to freight – both cross-border and national services – by 1 January 2006, as the Commissioner also indicated, should be clearly stated as from now, and not expressed as one-and-a-half years or two years after entry into force. We want everyone to know that on 1 January 2006 they can be prepared for the networks actually to be opened up to freight services.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is our view, Commissioner, that we also need to extend these rights to use rail for freight transport to other transport operators, not only the traditional railway undertakings or the new railway undertakings, but also the shippers and carriers. Because only if all the players in the sector are on board – and that includes the shippers and carriers – will we be able to transfer freight from road to rail. I therefore hope that you will also agree to the independent rights that we want to grant them.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point, Commissioner, relates to something that you did not address just now, but I should in any case like to make this request. You said that the Commission did not want to table proposals to open up the networks to passenger services as well until 2003. We in Parliament are one step ahead of you and have said: no, we do not want there to be so much domestic air traffic in Europe and would prefer passengers to take cross-border passenger train services. We therefore also want the rail market in passenger services to be opened up. We are proposing making it possible for cross-border passenger services to operate from 1 January 2006, like freight services, and national passenger services at a later date, from 1 January 2008. Commissioner, it is precisely if we want to ensure that airspace is used sensibly that we need to attract more passengers onto the railways. I hope that you will support us in this.</p>
<p class="contents">Two final comments on the Sterckx report: I think that this report on safety standards is so magnificent that all I can say is that its main points go to the heart of the matter, in that it makes the provisions more precise and advocates a high level of safety in the interests of passengers and staff. That is why we will be fully supporting this report. Finally, Commissioner, I hope that you agree with us that we should encourage the Greek Presidency actually to adopt the common positions in March so that we can move the procedure forward and perhaps conclude this chapter, on opening up the railways in the European Community, by the end of the year. Even if one or two Member States should have problems, the Community Treaty allows a decision to be taken by a majority in the Council of Ministers, and we should encourage the Greeks to take advantage of this possibility.</p>

It is, however, clear that in a European market such as this, where more players are entering the arena, there must be proper safety arrangements. The safety situation is satisfactory at the moment. Rail is a safe means of transport, it must remain at least as good and we must try to improve safety levels wherever possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive we are now producing is an initial step towards European safety policy. At the moment there are still too many different rules and regulations which make this railway market in Europe too complex in many cases. We must therefore develop a standard procedure for the different Member States in this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, a structure. Who is responsible for what? The railway companies are naturally responsible for what they do, and as a Parliament we are adding the infrastructure managers to this. Every Member State should therefore have a safety body which operates independently and openly and is transparent. Everyone must know how things stand. With regard to the operational side of things, however, I think that the safety bodies must be able to make use of the existing railway companies’ know-how, knowledge and experience.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must have a common approach to safety, a common safety goal. As a Parliament, we think that, once established, this goal must be put before the Council and Parliament again and must not only be assessed by a committee of national experts. We must not only have a common goal but also a common working method, and I am somewhat stricter than you are when it comes to discouraging new national rules. We will have to be as strict as possible in this regard, and the Commission must have the last word.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also – and I am somewhat more ambitious than the Commission in this regard too – establish a European objective, and we must state that our objective is to achieve one single set of European regulations. We do not necessarily have to achieve this tomorrow, but we must at least be able to say what we are aiming for. All players must have a management system, and there must be common safety certificates for staff, for rolling stock and also for the infrastructure manager. As far as staff are concerned, I think that a European driving licence for train drivers is important. We must work on this. Communication is also important; that is something I have added to my report. If you cross language boundaries you must also make sure that you solve language problems. The agency must have its say about how this is to be done. It is an important point, however.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must develop a common method of investigating accidents, investigating incidents, an independent investigative body and criteria that must be respected in these investigations.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we have achieved a balance between making our approach as European as possible with supervisors who are as independent as possible, and achieving a theoretical model that is also workable in practice. So you must not simply dismiss the knowledge that the old monopolies have at their disposal; you must use it to create a workable system. I am convinced that where we are now is an initial phase, that this is an initial step. We will have to discuss safety a few times more and amend and adapt directives over the next 10, 15 and 20 years. The structure we are now setting up will also have to prove its soundness in practice, and we must ensure that we are flexible enough to acknowledge our mistakes and to do something about them if necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that we have achieved a good balance when it comes to the involvement of the staff concerned. It is important for the people who work on the railways to be involved in the things that concern them. Safety is also the work of man, and the people who are responsible for this work must be involved in the decision making. I think that this is in fact clearly stated in the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">With Mrs Ainardi’s report on the technical obstacles and Mr Savary’s report on the Railways Agency, which will be very important in the future as it will have to do a great deal of the work, we are thus taking a significant step towards a European railway environment. Mr Jarzembowski’s report is also a significant step forward. What we need are open, dynamic, commercially-oriented railway companies that think European, not just nationally or locally. The culture of the national monopoly is still very much in evidence and too often prevents Europe’s railways from operating efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Jarzembowski and the Commissioner have also said, we need a dynamic rail industry. When you see how the transport economy has developed, you cannot do without railway companies. I get terror-stricken whenever I hear people from railway companies saying that if we do not adapt quickly we will have no more goods traffic on the railways, and we will be priced out of the market – not by the prices themselves but by bad working practices. Rail is a sustainable means of transport and we must look after it. With our reports and your proposals, Commissioner, I think that we are taking a significant step forward, for we need to progress towards a European transport market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ainardi (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>–<span class="italic"> (FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, given that the European Union has published a White Paper explaining the need to revitalise rail transport, it is essential to ensure interoperability within the European rail system if it is to be developed. This is crucial to the future of European railways in the twenty-first century. Rail is a more sustainable means of transport, entailing fewer external costs than road transport. It is also more environmentally friendly and safer. Despite all this, rail freight has declined over the last twenty years.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my view that there are three main reasons for this decline. Firstly, we have industrial strategies favouring road transport and ‘just-in-time’ management, resulting in a greater number of journeys and greater dispersal and fragmentation. Furthermore, there is distortion of competition between road and rail transport. The level of social regulation relating to road transport is notably low when compared to that for rail. I am thinking, in particular, of the fact that the regulation outlined in the Markov report to be discussed this morning does not address the question of a limit on driving time adequately. Despite the fact that Mr Markov and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs proposed reducing driving time to 45 hours, the limit remains at 56 hours, which is clearly still far too long. Lastly, I share the view that the development of different networks according to national specifications has limited trade and has lead to inadequate cooperation and incompatible standards.</p>
<p class="contents">My report on the high-speed network and the conventional network respectively, therefore seeks to make standards more compatible by bringing the two existing directives into line with each other. The report also includes a series of proposals to speed up harmonisation and to extend its scope. I would like to point out that my report is closely linked to the report on establishing a European Railway Agency. Consequently, a number of decisions on points concerning the Agency are included in my report as they stand in order to ensure that the package is coherent.</p>
<p class="contents">While preparing my report, I met with operators, experts, the Commission, trade unions and public authorities on many occasions. As a result of the meetings, I identified a number of issues to which I would like to draw your attention. Firstly, in order to achieve interoperability, I think it is absolutely essential to take full account of the skills and know-how of the professionals working within the sector. The European Union must ensure the involvement of the sector if it is to harmonise the rail system. For example, during one of the meetings I had with railway staff, they proposed a recording device. I took this on board, as I believed it to be relevant. The introduction of a recording device now has universal support and is included in my report. Secondly, further to all these meetings, it has become clear to me that harmonisation and safety rules are inextricably linked. Harmonisation in this area cannot be carried out at a minimum level. Safety standards vary across the European Union. Lowering safety standards to facilitate access to infrastructure would be counter-productive and even dangerous. Reducing safety would not be in the interests of harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">One question remains unresolved, namely funding. Enormous investment is needed to achieve this new stage of development. No specific budgetary provision is envisaged, though this is certainly called for.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that agreement has been reached on Article 29 of the Sterckx report, which promotes social dialogue. I also consider the agreement reached on the Savary report to be very important. This concerns the participation of staff representatives in drawing up technical specifications on interoperability (TSIs) which are of direct concern to them.</p>
<p class="contents">To ensure consistency between the various reports and the unity of the package, I would like to propose three oral amendments which take account of the agreements reached on the Sterckx and Savary reports. I would also like to propose an amendment on the financial questions. Whilst I am aware that not everyone will share my point of view, I hope you will all understand the importance of the issue. The package as a whole is extremely important, given what is at stake. We bear an enormous responsibility for the future, as we are planning the European rail system for the twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="contents">I would in addition like to express my opinion on the package as a whole. The Jarzembowski report proposes the complete liberalisation of rail freight services by 2003, and of national passenger services by 2008. I must say that I am concerned about the proposals aimed at speeding up liberalisation, following up those proposed by the Commission. The transposition of the first package is only just taking place in Member States, and an assessment of the consequences has therefore yet to be undertaken. I am still concerned at the conclusions of the Barcelona Council, which sensibly called for a report to be drawn up and an assessment to be made before any new proposal is presented.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that we need to revitalise the rail system. It is my view that the harmonisation of standards is a very relevant issue, as is the need for an Agency and strict safety rules. I do not however see why and how it should be deemed necessary to undertake the development of the rail network and opening it up to competition at the same time. The Sterckx report on safety is also very important since, like the Commission, it is concerned in particular about the harmonisation of safety standards. The harmonisation of safety standards should, however, take account of the real situation of the sector, especially as regards implementation time. It would be useless, or even detrimental, to attempt to apply European standards too quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my conviction that both the long-term development and the revitalisation of the sector are at stake. The players in this sector count, be they operators or railway staff. Their skills and knowledge are valuable. The European Union can and must show that it intends to involve them in the development of the rail system.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Savary (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>–<span class="italic"> (FR)</span> I would first like to congratulate the Commissioner and thank all the members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism who have worked so enthusiastically on these documents. I would like to express my appreciation first to the four rapporteurs for their excellent work, and to all the political groups. I think that we have all put a lot into this second package because we feel that we need to develop the European rail network. In the first place, I believe that we must make it clear to those who might have certain concerns or prejudices about the issue, that Europe really does need a railway network. Europe needs a railway network because it will have to deal with serious environmental problems in the years to come. The public will not forgive us for not developing alternatives to road transport. Furthermore, European Union involvement in railways represents an opportunity for the sector, not a constraint or a threat.</p>
<p class="contents">What is clear is that the rail systems inherited from the old nation states are today no longer able to meet current demands. As the Commissioner has reminded us, it is apparent that as regards freight transport in particular, in regions like mine, the cancer of lorries and cars is spreading day by day and people are continually asking us for solutions. I therefore believe that we need to commit ourselves firmly to developing the European rail system.</p>
<p class="contents">At present there are three solutions or approaches to this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The first way involves national tensions or, in other words, undeclared protectionism. It also entails corporatism and national vote-winning measures. I think that this approach, evident in France and Germany, is not the way forward. We should not fear opening up within the European Union. Once again, this represents an opportunity for the rail sector as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a second way of addressing the problem. I think that the incidents involving the<span class="italic"> Prestige </span>and the <span class="italic">Erika</span> should give us cause for reflection. There is a price to be paid for transport. Transport policy cannot solely involve lowering prices through unbridled competition. We must not ignore recent maritime disasters. As a result of these terrible events we are today to set new standards and doubtless increase the cost of transporting dangerous goods by sea. At the same time we are moving in the opposite direction in the rail sector, and saying that policy of dumping at any price and competition at any price is an end in itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the third way of tackling the rail sector is that of opening it up in a controlled way. This involves maintaining the culture and expertise developed by the rail sector while ensuring that networks are opened up. In my opinion, this is the Swiss way. The first way, the French and German way, is too conservative. There are lessons to be learnt regarding the second British and Dutch way. The third, the Swiss way, opening up within a framework of functional integration, should be our enduring model. If we do not adopt this model, we are likely to be severely disappointed.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should of course direct this policy. In particular, it should have control of the implementation of rules and European harmonisation measures incumbent on all Member States. I believe that safety must be an absolute priority, because a safety culture is crucial for the railways. It is therefore essential that we adopt this approach. I would like to thank Commissioner de Palacio for the proposals that formed the basis of these very important reports. As regards the Sterckx report, a crucial document in my opinion, we must be fully aware that safety policy must not amount to a policy for diluting responsibilities. We must not draw up a policy that will entail the levelling-down of safety standards. Rather, we must have a very demanding policy that maintains functional integrity. This means maintaining the functional integration of the railway while ensuring political and judicial independence. As regards the Ainardi report, I would simply hope that the amendments compatible with those relating to the Agency are adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on my report relating to an Agency to harmonise rail safety, the competent committee has already voted on 48 amendments. I thought we could have left it there, but yet another amendment has just been tabled. We hoped this Agency would be an executive Agency of the Commission, steered by the Commission as far as possible. Thus we have an amendment stating that the Commission would preside over the Agency. This falls within the scope of the executive. One would therefore assume that the European Parliament would not be represented. I would like the number of Member States not to be increased but to remain at six. I would like them to adopt an executive posture, rather than what could be termed a parliamentary or legislative one. I trust they will find it in themselves to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we hoped to make the Agency a common organisation for the whole of the European rail industry. I am personally convinced that we will not be able to develop a European rail system if the players in the sector are not agreed on working together to develop it. We have therefore proposed including representatives from the entire rail sector on the administrative board. Clearly, this will allow progress to be made on many issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we hope there will be consultative committees, inquiry bodies and safety authorities. I have to say that personally I would be very worried if Amendment No 49 were carried, as this would destroy the entire proposal. It seems to me that, on the occasion of this significant vote on the Agency, it would be unfortunate to content ourselves with the text adopted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. I will finish on that note. I had intended to comment on the Jarzembowski report but I have run out of time and will do so in private. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rack (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for a long time transport policy was a poor relation in European policy. In plain language, for a long time nothing happened at all. It required a judgment by default from the European Court of Justice for things slowly to start inching forward, step by step. Admittedly, we have seen some movement on air and maritime transport in recent years – this is pleasing, and we are grateful for this, not least to the Commissioner – but the tragic events off the Spanish coast have shown that we are still a long way from where we actually should be.</p>
<p class="contents">It is above all in the sector that is being discussed here and now that we are still a long way from where we should be, namely in the rail sector. Much ought to have been done here in the last few years and it still has not been done, including establishing genuine coordination between the Member States. Mr Jarzembowski has already pointed out that the rail sector is the only one in which the internal market is not a reality. I would perhaps express this in even stronger terms: where rail is concerned we have probably not even started to make it a reality. That is why the necessary balance between the individual modes of transport is still lacking. This has also been mentioned once already today. It cannot be stressed often enough. The results are as bad as you would expect, particularly between road and rail where the gulf is tending to widen in the absence of sensible joint solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The European rail system and its connection to the system in the candidate countries, which will soon be members of this Union, needs to be revitalised and made to work; otherwise a lot more will go wrong on our railways and we will have even more problems than we do now. As an Austrian I am not only referring to transit across the Brenner Pass and the Alps; essentially this applies to all regions of Europe, all of which are sensitive to a greater or lesser degree, not only those that have been under intensive discussion over the last few days.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I should like, <span class="italic">en passant</span>, to apprise you of one fact, which is not without interest, because unfortunately it is never adequately taken into consideration in the discussion: the Austrian railways are the only ones to have increased their share of the freight market in the last few years. All of our other neighbouring countries have continued to let road strengthen its lead over rail.</p>
<p class="contents">Now what is at issue specifically in the Ainardi report, for which I was also responsible as shadow rapporteur? Interoperability should and must be made a reality across the entire network. We cannot concentrate, as we did originally, on individual parts of the network – high-speed lines and so forth – and treat them separately. We have to try actually to find one single structure, obviously with the necessary exemptions for regional railways – if they really are regional railways – for heritage railways and others.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to drafting and adopting these technical specifications we must firstly bear in mind that this is not the job of the European legislator, but that specialists must set to work on these, and European politicians are only called on to monitor progress. What is important here are reasonable costs and a high degree of safety. Both aspects have been addressed often enough here today. I do not need to emphasise this particularly, but I do think that we should take them seriously. Where safety is concerned, I would specifically point out that we have now tabled a proposal to extend the black box system to the railways. This means that we also want to make progress on research, so as to ensure that in the long term we arrive where we need to arrive, at a functioning European transport system.</p>

This is a difficult and complex subject not made any easier by the position that the whole railway industry finds itself in. If you look at rail freight in Europe, for example, the drop in traffic is quite alarming. If nothing is done, then within the next 15 years rail freight will not exist.</p>
<p class="contents">There has to be change in how railways work, both in the passenger and freight sectors. The industry itself has to recognise that its service levels have been unacceptable and Member States must also recognise that investment levels have been in decline for many years. This is nowhere more apparent than in the field of interoperability: 15 different systems, different signalling systems, different power currents and an obsession at national level with working their own system to the detriment of international cooperation and to the detriment of interoperability.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the inability of a train to cross borders without changing locomotives, changing drivers or even changing bogeys that is the problem for our railways. A 40-tonne heavy goods lorry is fully interoperable. A freight train is not. That is the difficulty that faces the industry. It is not an easy problem to overcome. We need to give the railways time to improve their interoperability, but we must also remind them that time is running out and frankly with regard to freight the industry is now drinking in the last chance saloon.</p>
<p class="contents">I, on behalf of my group, have followed the report by Mr Sterckx with regard to safety more closely than the others. It is our belief that in any work in the area of safety those who work in the sector must be involved. In this regard a difference exists between us and the PPE-DE Group. Our main goals are to ensure higher levels of safety whilst fully integrating our European rail system. We must get away from the 15 different systems I mentioned earlier; however, we must ensure that Member States have an input, and in those areas where higher standards exist we must insist that they are maintained. Dilution of safety standards is not an option. That is why, as a group, we have submitted a number of amendments to Mr Sterckx's report.</p>
<p class="contents">All of us here are supporters of railways. Indeed some of us are somewhat fanatical and are often called anoraks by our colleagues. I hope the Commission proposals and Parliament's response are seen by those in the railway industry as an honest attempt to ensure that Europe's railway industry has a future. In order to reach that goal we need politicians, we need governments, we need the Commission, but most of all we also need all sides in the railway industry working together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Development of the railways, however, was far too late in getting started. Now such areas as the promotion of competition in both freight and passenger transport services, increased interoperability and improvements in safety are huge challenges which really do require swift action to be taken. The competitiveness of the railways has seriously decreased. There has been a shift to transportation along congested roads as well as by air, because the railways have not been able to improve their services quickly enough.</p>
<p class="contents">This railway package will enable us to promote the competitiveness of the European railways, and improved competitiveness will mean that companies and the public will have the chance to utilise a more environment-friendly form of transport. At the same time congestion can be relieved and short flights replaced by railway transport services, which will result in a better balance between transport operators. Development of the railways will also clear the way for increased use of intermodal transport, as at the same time attention will be paid to improved interoperability of the ports and railways.</p>
<p class="contents">As shadow rapporteur, I have followed Mr Savary’s drafting of the report closely. Mr Savary has also done good work. A properly established Railway Agency would boost development of the railways and monitor and promote innovation and good practice. Our group believes, however, that the same principle should be followed regarding the composition of the Agency’s administrative board as that which applies to the Maritime Safety Agency. We have tabled an amendment on this for which we hope there is support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Much too much of this travelling is taking place on the motorway or by air. Travelling by rail is more environmentally friendly, but most of our railway networks date back to an era when we stayed within our own state boundaries much more than we do now. Virtually everyone now agrees on the need for modernisation with trains that can travel on the other side of the border with the same carriages, the same crew, the same voltage and the same safety requirements. This can be achieved quickly by improving cooperation between national railway companies or by merging large-scale and cross-border activities into one single European operation.</p>
<p class="contents">Regrettably this increase in scale is now being misused to force all the Member States of the European Union to allow other companies with private capital to access the railway network. Liberalisation means that we will only be able to travel where entrepreneurs can expect to make a profit. The additional costs for planning, supervision, safety and infrastructure are being paid by the government, in other words the taxpayer, and the financial benefits go to international companies. This compulsion to liberalise will make it more difficult to guarantee continuity and safety. Despite the European unity that has been achieved, there is currently less cross-border rail traffic in many places than there was in the time before the EU was created. International night trains are being cancelled, long-distance connections are being severed, railway timetables for ‘abroad’ are no longer being issued, boarding bans are being introduced and there will be no railway facilities for the rapid transportation of perishable goods.</p>
<p class="contents">Even before the compromise of the end of 2000 concerning corridors for goods transportation by other companies comes into effect, attempts are already being made to push through even more far-reaching liberalisation with the aim of putting international goods traffic first, then domestic goods traffic, then international passenger traffic and finally all traffic in the hands of companies that have fewer obligations to society as a whole. In the Netherlands, which wanted to take the lead, liberalisation has resulted in a significant reduction in the quality of train services. Part of the package of four reports that have just been presented will have a detrimental effect on the railway company’s duty of service. If we do not accept that part, the future will look a great deal better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aim of all reforms must be to create a sustainable transport policy in Europe. Liberalisation can sometimes be a means to achieving this, but never an end in itself. The extremely poor situation in respect of maritime transport must indeed be a warning to us. Freight traffic in Europe has become a problem due to the enormous increase in the number of lorries on our roads. I myself regard early liberalisation of goods transport by rail as a sure fire way of quickly reducing the number of lorries on the road, provided that it is given sufficient support.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, we do not view liberalisation as an end in itself, and we are therefore not in favour of liberalising passenger transport. Passenger transport by rail is a public service and must remain so. Transport must also remain affordable for everyone, so it should not only be the profitable lines that are allowed to be leased or sold. The negative consequences of liberalisation are already being felt by travellers. International lines outside of the high-speed network are being cut back. One example is the fast overnight connection between Brussels and Milan which, as my Italian colleagues know, has been scrapped as a result of competition from air travel, a mode of transport in which the environmental costs are not calculated into the ticket price. That there is a problem is, however, demonstrated by the poor rail connection between Brussels and Strasbourg I got a taste of yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has done too little research into the consequences of liberalisation for rail transport. We think that an assessment is urgently needed before we go any further down the road towards liberalisation. We cannot make decisions on accelerating the pace of liberalisation of rail transport until such time as we have a clear picture of the impact this liberalisation will have on working conditions, safety, the environment, the effective improvement of consumer choice and the growth of the sector. With this in mind, we have therefore submitted an amendment to Mr Jarzembowski’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">The three other reports closely reflect the problems and issues of the sector. Firstly that of safety in the Sterckx report. Then coming up with practical ways of cooperating effectively in the Ainardi report. Finally, a Railways Agency to support the entire harmonisation process and to get it on track in the Savary report. The era of containers being transported from the North Sea port to Northern Italy on trains crawling along at 18 km per hour must be consigned to history as soon as possible. The Sterckx, Savary and Ainardi reports place the emphasis on cooperation and consultation between different companies. These companies could naturally have done this themselves, but they seem to only spring into action when competition is imminent. Europe should naturally have organised this internal rail market much earlier. This Railways Agency should have been in place thirteen years ago. The free movement of goods was not organised in a sustainable way in the twentieth century. The twenty-first century must bring the changes we so urgently need.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gollnisch (NI).</span></span>   –<span class="italic"> (FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are indeed some excellent sections in the reports on the development of rail transport we have before us. In particular, Mr Jarzembowski is right to be concerned about the decline of rail transport compared to road and air transport. As regards freight, the Commission has noted that the market share of rail freight transport in Europe has declined from 21% in 1970 to 8% in 1998. During this time, however, the volume of goods requiring transportation has increased considerably and people are travelling ever more frequently.</p>
<p class="contents">These developments have had disastrous consequences. This increase in the flow of goods and people has disastrous repercussions for three spheres. There are consequences for the environment as road and air transport cause more pollution than railways. There are consequences in terms of increased traffic as the road network and air corridors are saturated. There are also consequences in terms of personal safety as it is safer to travel by train than by car, given that many tens of thousands of people die in road traffic accidents in Europe every year. The French suffer more than most from these road accidents. The higher road death toll is not down to the French being more reckless behind the wheel than their European neighbours, as the French Government maintains. The explanation lies in the fact that the major trunk routes used by lorries in France linking Mediterranean countries with Northern and Eastern Europe have now reached full capacity. These lorries sometimes hog the carriageway for several kilometres and cause many accidents and traffic-jams. The suffering endured by thousands of drivers who became stuck in their cars in temperatures of as low as -5° during the night from 4 to 5 January was certainly the result of snowfall, but it was mainly caused by the shortcomings of the motorway maintenance services and lorries stuck in the snow on the road.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think, however, that the proposals presented in the reports of our fellow Members, which the Commission supports, address the situation appropriately. In my opinion, France has no need of a European Railway Agency or more European regulation in order to free up its roads. It needs a government that will assume its responsibilities and tackle the causes of the problem. We should ask ourselves why the French Government has failed to follow the example of the Swiss Government on this matter. The government should build a piggyback rail network and oblige all lorries travelling through France to use it. We should ask ourselves why so many French companies transport their products by lorry and not by train, and why millions of French people use their cars rather than using public transport. One reason is that the SNCF is in the grip of the trade unions and is consequently becoming worse and worse at fulfilling its role as a public service. Another is that French people no longer feel safe when using public transport because of security fears and because they are intimidated by the yobs who go on the rampage on it. A third is that the car is one of the few remaining freedoms in an increasingly regulated society.</p>
<p class="contents">Our leaders are out of touch with reality. They have official cars and dream of recreating life under Mao. Many Maoists have in fact been reincarnated as environmentalists. Our leaders would like to see us using clapped–out public transport or bicycles, as the people did under Mao, whilst they themselves enjoy the means of transport the people have provided for them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Peijs (PPE-DE). – </span></span>  <span class="italic">(NL)</span> The establishment of the European Agency for the harmonisation of safety and for accelerating interoperability as part of the second railways package must contribute to the process of liberalising and modernising rail transport in Europe. This process was set in motion with the introduction of the first railways package, but it has not been completed by a long chalk, despite the fact that the Transport White Paper places so much emphasis on rail being practically the most important means of transport in the future. If rail really wants to play a role in solving the problem of congestion in Europe, however, it is of vital importance that we not only open up international and national goods markets but cross-border passenger traffic as well. We must revitalise and liberalise the entire sector if we really want rail traffic to take over part of the constantly growing demand for transport.</p>
<p class="contents">The sector has suffered years of neglect in the hands of the various governments who controlled the railways – not the big international companies, Mr Meijer. Furthermore, the sector was and still is a bastion of national interests whose main aim is to promote its own interests and not to become involved in cross-border interests. If we view the railway sector in the context of the agreements in the Lisbon Declaration which call upon us to become the most competitive region in the world by 2010, we have to achieve this, otherwise our hearts will be in our boots. Everywhere there are different mains voltages, different railway gauges, big differences in signalling, different languages and safety requirements, locomotives that are not suitable for operating the other side of borders and that are twice as expensive because they have to overcome all these differences.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the rail freight sector only discovered the concept of profit about a year ago. The only thing that was important was volume. Now billions will have to be invested throughout Europe in order to get the infrastructure and rolling stock up to standard. That can only really happen if there is a true sea change and the railway sector discovers the customer and the concepts of punctuality, flexibility and service orientation besides that of profit.</p>
<p class="contents">Interoperability and the harmonisation of safety regulations have often been an uphill battle up until now. Every railway company is sticking to its own practices and systems. It will therefore be important for the Railways Agency to set a good example, play a pioneering role and at the same time act in a supervisory capacity. The Railways Agency’s expertise and clear responsibilities are therefore very important. Another condition that must be met if the Agency is to operate efficiently is that it must remain independent and that it has independent experts chosen for their abilities and not as representatives of a particular organisation at its helm. If we are to avoid reverting to traditional national differences, these experts from the industry must therefore not express the viewpoint of their previous employers. It is therefore essential for the Agency to be able to operate completely independently and transparently. The new predominance of historically big companies will result in few newcomers having access to the Agency. The Railways Agency must also have enough powers to be able to execute its tasks properly. I have submitted an amendment in this regard stating that the Agency should establish the preconditions for the uniform issue of safety certificates independently of the national railway companies within which the national safety bodies have to operate. Naturally, train drivers must receive on-the-spot training to enable them to drive on routes in neighbouring countries, but competences with regard to safety certificates must be clear and unambiguous to all concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, harmonisation of the safety regulations in Europe is very important for an efficient railway sector. Bureaucratic obstacles must be eliminated as far as possible. I am also pleased with the compromise on Article 3 that we were able to reach with the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, concerning the participation of employers’ representatives from the sector in the working parties. On this point I am still of the opinion that it is not desirable to permit worker involvement in purely technical matters. When there are direct consequences for workers’ working conditions, health or safety, however, their voices will naturally be heard and indeed listened to, as the compromise specifies.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, therefore, I hope that the Railways Agency will make a positive contribution to the harmonisation of safety and the process of interoperability in Europe, so that it can make an important contribution towards improving rail transport in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although there are some differences of opinion on the detail, we are in very substantial agreement with the reports and will – at least I assume we will – be adopting them today, because, as Mrs Peijs has just said, it has been possible to reach some important compromises. This package, building on earlier decisions, will actually take us an important step closer to establishing a European railway. The restrictions imposed by the nation-states, and the fears that they still have, will – I hope – soon be consigned to the past.</p>
<p class="contents">I dealt personally with Mr Jarzembowski's and Mrs Ainardi's reports. Mr Jarzembowski's report – and once again Mr Jarzembowski has disappeared off somewhere; he is a real European high-speed train and is never where he actually should be, but be that as it may – proposes extensive liberalisation. Obviously for us Social Democrats – let me be quite open about it – this is a tricky business.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, for various reasons, a large majority of us will go along with these proposals: firstly, because they are part of an overall agreement, as part of which we have also, particularly in the Savary report, obtained a series of provisions guaranteeing workers' rights and opportunities. I have no fears in this regard, Mrs Peijs, but we certainly must focus on the working conditions and health and safety in the sector for the sake of those employed there. Secondly, there are unfortunately a number of countries that are still very restrictive where market opening is concerned. I therefore assume that a more constructive and reasonable compromise proposal will emerge from the conciliation procedure. Thirdly, it is my view that we need to put pressure on the national railway undertakings, be they public or private. Many of these railway undertakings have not read the signs of the times; they have entered into cooperation with each other only to a very limited extent and only in some areas, for example high-speed trains. The railway companies have either not recognised that nowadays transport services at least have to be European – which has of course long been the case for HGVs – or they have not done anything about it. A certain amount of pressure to liberalise and move towards market opening is therefore certainly very important for the national railway companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to Mrs Ainardi's report, this is also a very good piece of work. We regret the fact that, particularly in this report, too little account has been taken of some aspects of social harmonisation, because there are understandably fears on the part of workers that this will lead to a kind of social dumping. I believe that it is particularly important for the workers to be included in the process of reforming the railways. The civil servants and others employed in the railway sector also need to know that the times of national, restricted, controlled railway undertakings are over, and that this is about creating a European railway. Once again, I believe that the essential point here is that, hopefully, today's decision will send out a signal to the railway undertakings, so that they will make it their own business to create a real European railway.</p>

I would also like to mention that the committee of which I am chairman has worked well on this matter, as always. It is no coincidence that, during 2002, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism initiated 34 reports in the transport sector, seven of which focused precisely on the modernisation of the railways. It is quite clear, however, that the committee is concerned by certain delays in the Council and has made this clear in more or less formal terms. I, personally, have even written a letter to the Danish Presidency, and I will reiterate these same points to the Greek Transport Minister, Mr Verelis, who is coming to visit the committee and attend a hearing next week.</p>
<p class="contents">The first railway package is closely related to the second railway package and, just like the carriages of a train, they must move forward, or else there will be a real danger of a kind of rail traffic jam. The second railway package is important, and I would like to say that our approach is not an ideological promotion of the railways, of which we are sometimes accused. I believe that the case of freight transport is extremely significant: the use of the railways is continuing to decline, despite all the good intentions expressed. When I consider specific cases which are particularly important to me such as the trans-Alpine routes, I find this totally unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret to say that there is no genuine European rail network. We are building it with these directives. It is strange that, with all their areas of sovereignty taken away from them, the only one remaining for the States in Europe is a kind of railway sovereignty, which we have got to break up and reshape in a European mould. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I voted against the first rail package also. Its effects have yet to make themselves felt in practice. It has not even been fully implemented. Nevertheless, we have already been presented with a second package, which is just as bad as the last previous one.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the Jarzembowski report is to speed up the development of competition. It attempts to apply road transport standards to rail transport with disastrous consequences. It is actually stated clearly that opening up the rail freight transport market will lead to increased competition which is likely to entail job losses. In short, this report means more liberalisation for fewer jobs. As for the report on safety, its main aim is liberalisation; safety is just an excuse. It is evident that the justification sections often use the safety argument to protect the internal market and exclude new players. The market and safety issues are however clearly incompatible.</p>
<p class="contents">I will vote in favour of the next two reports, even though the funds allocated to achieving interoperability are meagre and insufficient, and even though the Agency will remain confined within the framework, in which it was established, namely liberalisation. We would do well to remember the long list of environmental and human disasters that ensued from the complete liberalisation of the maritime transport sector. The liberalisation of sectors that are currently regulated will spell profits for some, but for the rest it will mean accidents, poor working conditions, redundancy and for the passengers, a lower standard of service. Sadly, we have already seen many examples of this, from the collapse of Sabena and that of Air Lib, to the state of the railways in Britain</p>
<p class="contents">I remain a strong advocate for the provision of a high-quality European public service. I am for cooperation between different rail networks. I fully support the process of harmonising working conditions, safety standards, salaries and social rights. I believe that the people and those employed in the public services should be in control. In short, I am opposed to this second rail package. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Heavy words indeed: the railway industry drinking in the last chance saloon and ceasing to exist after a certain time. Mr Jarzembowski was also talking about a balanced relationship. We endorse that. We also think that it is absolutely necessary to revitalise the railways, for environmental and other reasons. Interoperability must be changed, safety must be improved, we must set up a Railways Agency, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us go back briefly to the core of the matter, however. We actually disagree strongly with regard to the package that Mr Jarzembowski is talking about. We have already had some experience with liberalisation in Europe – in the UK and in the Netherlands as well. I would like to talk about the Dutch example briefly. An article in this morning’s newspaper. Mr Zalm, the Liberal front runner in the elections and a former Dutch minister, is now saying that it was a mistake to split up NS and ProRail. In other words, Railway Directive 91/440/EC, the original separation of infrastructure and operation, is seen as being wrong. The Dutch Minister of Transport, Mr de Boer, also came to this conclusion recently and is asking for an inquiry for this very reason. Back to square one. In other words, we think that liberalisation is an excellent opportunity for goods transport.</p>
<p class="contents">We think, however, that we will have to take a good look at what this liberalisation of passenger transport is going to deliver, because it is not going well. For this reason we are asking most emphatically for an evaluation proposal and we hope that you will support the amendment. How it is possible that the socialists in the UK, who after all have had the same miserable experiences with liberalisation and the other aspects of privatisation of the railways, can still be in favour of Mr Jarzembowski’s proposals is completely beyond my comprehension. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Particularly with the fact that Mr Jarzembowski has included passenger transport in his report and has outlined a plan for it. The further liberalisation of Europe’s oldest mechanised infrastructure, the railways, is an essential stimulus for a sector that is quickly losing ground in the European goods traffic market. I cannot emphasis often enough that liberalisation is somewhat different from independence or uncontrolled privatisation, as was tried in the UK. It is of vital importance – including for the sector itself – that we have more providers on the European railways. Only then can we achieve a healthy railway market through genuine competition. Why not let the NS-cargo/DB-cargo combination compete directly with SNCF. There is nothing wrong with that. It must all be safe, so we, the legislators, must assume our responsibility for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Ainardi’s report is based on interoperability, acknowledging each other, the international recognition of regulations, the recognition of signals and the recognition of safety standards. That is also why it is so important to pay attention to this. That is why the European Railways Agency, proposed the Savary report, is so important.</p>
<p class="contents">From an organisational point of view, I would like the European Railways Agency to be coordinated with the European Maritime Safety Agency so that all these matters are organised independently, transparently, unambiguously and logically for all parties concerned. Foresight is the essence of government. In order to achieve efficiency, perhaps we can combine everything in the European safety agencies for the various modes of transport at some stage in the distant future and in this way integrate the sector fully with other modes. After all, this is all about railway transport being integrated with society, integrated with roads and integrated with water in order to get products and goods from A to B more easily. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my opinion, and since I am in favour of the liberalisation of rail transport, I am not sure that it is right to liberalise the infrastructures, that is, the railway lines. I believe it would be better, as is the case with motorways, to only liberalise the operation of the railways, leaving the rail infrastructures under public ownership. I believe this would be the best formula for sustainable responsibility for the appropriate maintenance of them beyond the restrictions which would be imposed by the objectives of economic and financial viability inherent in any private initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">And, in any event, I believe there must be an early assessment of the effects of liberalisation both in terms of safety, social and environmental repercussions, the effect on the interests of clients and users and on public service as well as the development of intermodality, and also its effect on the companies involved within the transport market.</p>

<p class="contents">It is inherent in the very concept of the internal market that freight and passenger transport should have an appeal that gains them acceptance. The national railway companies' actions in recent years have predominantly been characterised by the fact that they have continued to try to cordon off their markets, while at the same time coming to terms with the consistent and dramatic decline in their figures in the freight transport sector. The only way of putting freight transport back on track at all is to ensure, firstly, that cross-border journeys can operate more smoothly in the future and, secondly, that the market is opened up and competition introduced, so that those who wish to offer attractive freight transport services have the opportunity to do so, and – so far at least –it has usually not been the national rail companies that have done this.</p>
<p class="contents">When I hear people argue that liberalisation would mean job cuts then I only have one thing to say in reply: if the current trend continues there will not be any jobs in the rail freight sector at all, a result of the railways' conscious decision to neglect freight transport because it is not worth their while.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only say that those who are well intentioned towards the railways have to ensure that the rail systems are compatible across Europe, that the highest safety requirements are put in place and, in addition, they must ensure that the railways are customer-friendly, which means that they should be reliable, that they should have attractive services on offer and that they should stick to their timetables.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only hope that we and the Commissioner can push this through together in the Council. Measures in other areas – the Single European Sky to name but one example, when we wanted to have Europe designate airspace blocks in the future, because the national Member States had been failing to do so for decades – were repeatedly blocked by the Council, because they thought that all of this could be resolved bilaterally. I can only say that the Member States should have done it long ago, and now we are going to do it instead!</p>

This document contains two groundbreaking proposals. The first involves the abolition of the Trans-European Rail Freight Network and contemplates the complete liberalisation of international as well as national, regional and local freight networks by 2006. The second involves the opening up and liberalisation of the rail passenger network.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the first proposal, I share the view that we need to make a strong political gesture in support of railways. Though it may not be wise to be forever changing the dates, I personally support Mr Jarzembowski’s proposals for freight, given that the issue is now so worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">I have many more reservations however about international rail passenger services. Unlike freight, I do not consider the liberalisation of passenger services to be an absolute priority. I regularly take the train and have not encountered any particular difficulties at border crossings. I am nevertheless aware that there are significant commercial interests at stake in this sector. I do not support the view that we should restrict ourselves simply to creating a rail market. Rather, I think we should work towards a European transport policy, which is not quite the same thing.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, what has emerged clearly from today’s debate is that, whether or not we open up the rail networks, we cannot restrict our work on a European rail network to liberalisation, competition or opening up networks. If we do, we will have parts of the market that duplicate each other within the same area, and rail will constitute a substitute for road transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Other aspects of the transport strategy therefore need to be implemented. The fixing of price scales has to be considered, as does the reduction of the social and fiscal disparities between different means of transport, especially between road and rail transport. I think that the latter should be a priority if we want to ensure that the opening up of the rail market gives the rail sector an advantage over road. We must create an investment policy, not simply a rail market. Consequently, I personally hope that this debate sends a very strong message from the European Parliament to the Council. For many months trans-European rail network funding policy has been deadlocked in the Council. It has maintained a regressive approach to the matter and does not want to consider fiscal issues, fuel taxation or large European loans. It is my belief that without a major and ambitious policy on rail infrastructure, our attempts at opening up the sector will not put a stop to the dominance of road transport but will only lead to a fight between the various rail companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this is the message I would like to send from the European Parliament to the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Accounting tricks and baseless arguments are being used to persuade us that, as with road transport, which contributes nothing to the infrastructure costs of the road network but is open to the private sector, we should allow the private sector to run down railway infrastructures and services which they have done nothing to create and which were and still are paid for by the taxpayer, in the name of free competition. In the middle of a serious recession in the economy, in energy, in road, air and sea transport and in the environmental sector, big business has seen the potential in the railways for saving energy and cutting costs – and hence making a profit – and has turned its attention to rail transport and is trying to penetrate it ‘‘as an equal partner’’, although in practice there is nothing ‘‘equal’ about it in relation to the nationalised railway companies.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the Commission proposals – and unfortunately these reports go along with them – care nothing for quality, the cost of transport or the safety of users, all of which have been blown out of the water by the philosophy of unbridled competition and the profitability of capital, leaving the way free for private investors to ransack the profitable rail transport sector and dump responsibility for exorbitant infrastructure building and maintenance costs and the unprofitable side of rail transport on the public sector.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will have gathered, we totally oppose proposals for any moderate, calculated liberalisation of the railways because it paves the way for full liberalisation with all the adverse consequences that will have on the travelling public. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have heard things said that actually belong in the past – in a past that is, thankfully, long gone – a time when all that mattered was intervention and the class struggle, when people tried to create confrontation. I believe that this was completely the wrong attitude. History has condemned this approach and life punishes latecomers, as an extremely famous man once said, a man who had his roots in this system and then in the end also brought about its downfall because he knew it so well, I mean President Gorbachev.</p>
<p class="contents">We want better environmental protection, more goods to be transferred from road to rail, a better modal balance and thus better protection for consumers. Better protection for consumers: let me give you an example of something that happened two days ago in my home region, in the cross-border Brenner Pass, where consignments of dangerous goods, which now have to be carried by road because there are no rail services that can handle them, caught fire, with very serious consequences for the environment and for the public. We escaped an environmental disaster by the skin of our teeth. This is our intention: we want to make transport safer, and here I am particularly grateful to my colleague, Mr Jarzembowski, who has been fighting for these initiatives to be taken for years. We hope that these reports – and his in particular – will mean that we can take a substantial step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also grateful to the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs de Palacio, who has a particularly good understanding of this issue and is endeavouring to achieve a modal balance. We hope that we can continue further along this positive route.</p>

That is why we particularly support the reports by Sylviane Ainardi and Gilles Savary. If we want to have a competitive European railway system, we must harmonise technical standards and remove bottlenecks in the international network, and at the same time create high safety standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we will not achieve the interoperability needed by liberalising this sector. In cases where this has happened, private operators have not responded, particularly as regards the high levels of investment required. Nor has the Commission told us where it is going to find the finance needed to achieve this goal. It will not help at all to increase the flow of traffic by stimulating competition between the various operators if all the trains are forced to run on the same tracks, because that will simply lead to greater chaos and congestion.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we are against the total liberalisation of the freight and passenger transport sectors by 2008. We oppose this extreme position just as we oppose the Commission proposal to anticipate the opening up of the market in international freight transport, and we equally cannot accept the Member States being prevented from setting safety standards higher than those stipulated by the EU, simply so as not to create difficulties in opening up this market. We are responsible to Europe's citizens. We must have the courage to fight for a public rail transport service which is of a high standard and safe, which will encourage people to use it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, in some cases, they propose going further and more quickly in the reform of the rail sector. That is why the majority of the proposals are acceptable to the Commission, either in their current form or in principle. I believe that they clearly improve on the Commission’s initial text: they provide it with detail, they improve it and they clarify some of the specific points.</p>
<p class="contents">I will provide Parliament’s Secretariat with a complete list indicating the Commission’s position on each of the amendments, but I would nevertheless like to make a few comments in relation to our discussions and some general assessments of the amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, ladies and gentlemen, I am surprised that some of you are still raising the debate on whether or not the railways should be liberalised. Ladies and gentlemen, to those of you who love the railways so much that they want nothing to be done, all I can say is that over the years we have seen what is taking place: the railways are disappearing. If we do nothing – and I say this to those who are so worried that jobs will be lost with this supposed liberalisation – what will happen is that there will be no jobs, except for those which remain in the railway museums of the different countries of the European Union. That is what we have to realise.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not talking about privatising the rail network. That is an option which may be chosen by some countries, but I would like to point out to the honourable Member that for the only one that had adopted the fixed network, the fixed infrastructure, we have recently authorised a series of very significant State measures in order to renationalise that rail network. The Commission is not adopting any action of this type. We are proposing something different: the network is a natural monopoly, and therefore, the existence of non-public ownership would lead to many difficulties, and there should be a series of public controls of this natural monopoly. We are saying that a natural monopoly, such as a European network, should above all be European, there should be no national concept, but a global European one, which requires common technological, administrative and safety rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we argue that there should be competition between the various operators. Ladies and gentlemen, some of you are concerned that there will be competition between the French operator – or the French operators, France will decide what to do – and the German, British or any other European Union operator. The only alternative to this situation of competition is to create a single European operator, operating for the entire European rail network. Do the honourable Members really believe that this can be done? That this is the way to make the railways more operative, more competitive and more dynamic, and to recover the market quotas and the sections of transport which correspond to them?</p>
<p class="contents">I frankly believe not; that is not the way forward. The way forward is the one we are proposing: the conception and planning of the railways at European level – later I will discuss funding as well; European planning of the railways and for the different operators currently in the countries of the European Union to be able to compete within this network. And, if there are new operators – because the legislation in the different countries authorise this – that they fulfil suitable requirements to be able to operate throughout this rail network, and that they also compete.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about introducing rationality into the rail sector and turning it into a rail sector which is European and appropriate for the twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand, as Mr Caveri, chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, has said, that the Directorate-General for Transport has made them work hard on the railways. As Commissioner responsible for transport, I would like to thank the chairman and the entire committee once again for their understanding, support and cooperation in all our work.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will refer briefly to the amendments tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Jarzembowski’s report, in relation to the opening up of the market, I would stress his support for the Commission’s proposal, with a view to completing the opening up of the market in the transport of goods by rail. The amendments presented deal with coordination in the time between the entry into force of Directive 2001/12/EC, on the first stage of the opening up to competition of goods transport by rail, which must be incorporated into the legislation of the Member States so that, from 15 March 2003, we have a starting gun for the whole of the European Union, with the supplementary stages we propose and, specifically, the incorporation of all the networks of the Union countries into a European network. In this regard, all these amendments are acceptable to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendments which propose extending the opening up to competition of the passenger sector, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Jarzembowski, the Commission believes that, in order to produce positive effects, this opening up, which requires a differentiated pace, requires a more appropriate and stricter framework. This opening up should therefore be considered not only from the point of view of the contracts signed by public administrations – something already regulated by the proposed regulations on public service obligations, which is still awaiting the decision of the Council, since Parliament gave its opinion on them some time ago – but also from the point of view of access rights and the protection of passenger rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Jarzembowski, we cannot accept these amendments, because we are waiting to present a proposal this year specifically for passengers and which will deal in a coherent manner with the problem of opening up competition in the railways for the passenger sector. I would like to thank Mr Jarzembowski for his support for the proposals the Commission will shortly present.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Sterckx’s report on rail safety, we can accept the majority of the amendments, either in their current form or in principle, with some modifications of the text. I am referring essentially to the amendments which strengthen the requirement for transparency in terms of safety and which advocate a more rapid and intensive convergence of the strictest possible safety rules. I believe that that is the important point. However, we cannot accept either Amendment No 18 nor Amendment No 48, because they would be contrary to a clear distribution of responsibilities; we also have difficulties in accepting Amendment No 34, since we believe that it could considerably reduce the European scope of safety certificates.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I must say that we attach the greatest possible importance to the independence of investigating bodies in the event of accidents, and we cannot therefore accept any restriction of this independence. We do not therefore accept Amendment No 56.</p>
<p class="contents">I share Mrs Ainardi’s view of the problem of investments, because all of this is going to require considerable investments on the part of the Member States of the Union. Each of the Member States has an interest in promoting this modernisation of the railways, but there is also a very obvious European interest in promoting the modernisation of the trans-European railway system. This is something that we must bear in mind if we really want to achieve the objective and ambitions of the Lisbon European Council. Therefore, I am going to make an appeal in this regard, with a view to the post-Berlin financial perspectives, that the budgets for rail transport infrastructures be increased, in a plan to create the trans-European rail network, which requires a special effort.</p>
<p class="contents">We accept the proposal of the orange box of recorders, which will be strengthened with the LRTMS. Here also we can accept the majority of the amendments, but not all of them, since some of them are not in line with the principles.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the report by Mr Savary, who, like all the Members and myself, is one of the friends of the railways, the key element which completes the whole circle is precisely the agency. I would like to thank Mr Savary for the improvements he contributes through his proposals. Several amendments deal with the way the agency will have to work with all the countries involved, that is, companies, operators, manufacturers of materials, operators of infrastructures and also users and people working in the rail sector. We support all these amendments, in particular Amendment No 14, which we consider to be very positive.</p>
<p class="contents">We naturally also support various amendments relating to the institutional organisation of the agency which deal, for example, with the new financial regulation, which did not exist when the proposal was originally made. However, there are other amendments which cause us difficulties, for example those which would effectively confer decision-making powers on the agency, when we believe that it must only have the capacity to make technical proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Other amendments are superfluous in view of provisions in force or proposals planned for 2003 and we cannot therefore accept them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude, Mr President, by once again thanking the four rapporteurs and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for the work they have done, and I would like to thank this Parliament for its support.</p>
<p class="contents">Following my conversations with the Greek Presidency, I am sure that under its mandate, and very possibly at the Council in March, we will have a common position from the Council, and I hope it will allow us, if not at first reading, at least at the second, to reach an agreement on this extremely important package. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, we have failed to make significant progress on rail transport. Decisions have chiefly been made at intergovernmental level, with each country trying to defend its own interests, and this has undermined the creation of a European railway market.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation is untenable, because we are reaching saturation point in road transport, which is imposing a very heavy burden on our economic and environmental systems. Political will and an appropriate level of funding are needed to tackle this problem. Furthermore, the problems of rail transport in the peripheral countries, such as Portugal, need to be taken on board in providing solutions at European level if the EU is to function as a whole and to be economically efficient. So the Council must follow the lead of the European Parliament by showing the required political will and by finding the finance needed to create an internal European market in rail transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
