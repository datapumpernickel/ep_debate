It is about the refusal of photographs from Kazakhstan, the region where nuclear tests were carried out. Last night, we found out that Parliament itself turned down a few of those photographs in that exhibition because they are reported to be shocking. Unfortunately, those photographs mirror reality, and although that reality is shocking, as MEPs we should not be patronised, and we have the right – and even the duty – to learn the truth about that reality. Consequently, I would like to submit a protest on behalf of my group and on behalf of many people who attended the Kazakhstan exhibition yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">A second reason for dissatisfaction is the fact that yesterday, a visitor, Mr Tsamaraint Nauchap from the Shuar people in Ecuador, was refused entry. This Ecuadorial Indian came here as an envoy of his people, accompanied by the signs of his dignity, namely a small wooden spear measuring less than two metres. The man was not allowed entry to the House. We were not allowed to talk to him, apparently because he was armed. I considered it to be extremely humiliating for this man to be asked to lay down the signs of his dignity, which are sacred to him. Consequently, he was unable to visit us, and the MEPs who wanted to receive him had to do so outside our Chamber and outside the Parliament building. This is totally outrageous, particularly since it has been confirmed that this is in accordance with a normal code of conduct. I am calling for a review of this rule of conduct. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Scottish, my own country’s national dress involves wearing a dagger in your sock. If the services are informed in advance that this is part of national dress, then entry can be facilitated. I think the problem with the Ecuadorial Indian is that security forces were suddenly faced with this man with a spear and had not be given any warning in advance.

It lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when they wish to enter the European Union, as well as the countries that are exempt from this requirement for visas for stays of up to three months.</p>
<p class="contents">The case of Romania, which is situated somewhere between the above two examples, was a difficult matter. In theory, Romania should be included in the second list as an applicant country with which accession talks have commenced. Unfortunately, however, it appears that a stricter attitude may be needed, since illegal immigrants living in several European countries originate from Romania. The Council found quite a neat solution to this problem. It allows Romania to appear in the list of countries whose nationals are exempt from visa requirements, but Article 8 of the draft regulation specifies that this provision will only come into force when Romania has indicated which “undertakings it is prepared to enter into on illegal immigration and illegal residence, including the repatriation of persons from that country who are illegally resident”.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this condition is crucial. It has, however, been removed following the amendments that the European Parliament has just approved, not because of any particular affection for Romania, which might have been understandable, but in the spirit of encouraging unchecked freedom of movement which is seen all too often. Parliament voted in favour of several other amendments of less importance but I cannot accept them either.</p>

The fact that the visa requirements have been tightened up in recent years has unavoidably led to more cases of trafficking in human beings and to an increase in what is known as illegal immigration to the EU Member States. Those people who have been smuggled in or who have, by some other method, made their way into the European Union have often suffered great tragedies on the way. Once they have arrived in the EU, they have no rights or social protection at all.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a list of more than 130 countries whose citizens require visas to enter the EU. There are not even as many as 50 states which are exempt from the visa requirement. That practice, whereby a visa requirement is the rule rather than the exception, is unworthy of a democratic Europe. The basic rule must be that people are entitled to travel freely into the EU, not the other way around.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must change its attitude to immigration. Within a few years’ time, there will be an acute labour shortage in the EU. That is why it is important for us to accept and welcome people seeking a better future in the EU’s Member States. A more generous visa policy is also a prerequisite for its being possible to pursue a common, humane policy on refugees and asylum. Through a positive policy on immigration, we can put a stop to organised crime and to the human tragedies for which traffickers in human beings are responsible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to stress, however, that this figure had been calculated by the Commission in January and it already appears to have been completely overtaken by events. Since last Monday, we have found ourselves faced with a paradox, where the European Union cannot, or does not want to, provide French farmers with extra funding and is leaving France to cope in total isolation by allowing it to provide exceptional national aid. At a time, then, when the crisis is hitting hard and when European solidarity is needed most, the European Union is falling unceremoniously by the wayside.</p>
<p class="contents">I am admittedly the first to say that the overall European budget should not be increased as it already costs us a fair amount of money and that we must adhere to the 2000-2006 Financial Perspective approved by the Berlin Council in 1999. Even so, this does not mean, however, that nothing can be done. For the time being, the Financial Perspective still leaves us with a margin of EUR 506 million for 2001 under the headings for agriculture. In the short and medium term, there is no reason to leave this sum sitting there, even if the allocated funding for agriculture has all been spent. Instead of increasing the European Union’s total budget, there is another possibility, which is to transfer the expenditure under the Structural Funds heading to the agricultural section of the budget. In recent years, this expenditure has never been totally exhausted and, in any case, it is not always spent on such urgent needs (excluding funding to the applicant countries, of course). Moreover, this would not constitute misappropriation as, first and foremost, the aim of the Structural Funds is to support activity throughout the whole Union, and this would be the case if the funds were helping to combat the devastating consequences of BSE. The problems that we are experiencing would justify this unusual step.</p>
<p class="contents">It is becoming obvious to us all that, over the longer term, Europe’s agricultural policy, which may have had the distinction of helping to develop our agricultural industry in the 1960s, is now having adverse effects – handouts, bureaucracy, price inflation and intensification, which poses a health risk – to such an extent that far-reaching reform is inevitable. We have said for years that we must put in place much stricter rules than we have today to promote respect for nature and health, without increasing the burden on taxpayers. Logically speaking, the consumer should pay the difference by buying products at their actual price, or at a price that is closer to reality. In the same way, if we want to maintain our independence in the food sector, imports will of course, on the one hand, have to be subject to the same safety rules and, on the other, will, in certain cases, have to be subject to taxes to allow production to be continued in European countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This difference of approach does <span class="italic">not</span> reflect different attitudes to agricultural policy. On the contrary, we are in complete agreement about the need for a radical reform including, in the longer term, a greater acceptance of responsibility by the Member States for those costs that arise as a consequence of BSE and other crises. This view is also expressed in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The background to our voting differently is, rather, the fact that I participated in the handling of this matter in the Committee on Budgets and do not see any possibility of influencing agricultural policy by voting ‘no’ today. Nor will the Supplementary Budget lead to the Budget’s being overstepped, but only to those margins which are under the Budget ceiling being reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, this is a decision on which Parliament does not have the right of codecision – which is in itself a matter for discussion that is called into question in the report. A ‘no’ vote today would not, therefore, lead to any real change but only to delays. It would delay making available those resources required for the testing and destruction of cattle in the wake of the BSE crisis, as well as delay extending the mandate of the European Reconstruction Bureau in Kosovo/Serbia to include Montenegro, as referred to in the second part of this Supplementary and Amending Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s report makes clear demands for a change in agricultural policy, entirely along the same lines presented by myself and other Social Democratic and Liberal MEPs in an article in Wednesday’s <span class="italic">Göteborgs-Posten</span>. Those demands will now be pushed hard by Parliament, something which all we Swedish Social Democrats applaud.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not therefore concerned here with substantially different views of agricultural policy. On the contrary, I feel very sympathetic towards the voting intentions of my Swedish Social Democratic colleagues. We differ only in our view of what can be achieved by voting against this practical report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore voted in favour of it. It must be noted, however, that, in the words of Commissioner Fischler himself, ‘the crisis may run deeper than we think’, and that estimates presented by farmers’ organisations of total costs, which may reach EUR three thousand million, indicate that the consequences of the BSE crisis have been underestimated, at budgetary level too.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the farmers should not be the ones to pay for a crisis for which they are not responsible – it is common agricultural policy which is responsible – budgetary constraints cannot be used as an excuse to prevent all the necessary decisions being adopted to contain the BSE crisis and to protect farmers’ interests. The Financial Perspective must be revised.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of a reform of the CAP, which I have maintained has been greatly needed for some time, must not be to make savings in the budget. The purpose of such a reform must be to protect agricultural production, in full respect for food safety, to protect food quality, to promote the specific nature of the various regions and to promote economic and social cohesion. This will guarantee farmers’ incomes through fair prices for production and safe, high-quality produce for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I voted against the amendment that sought to place the issue of cofinancing, in other words, the renationalisation of CAP costs, onto the agenda, because I disagree with the adoption of such a measure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission, until now, has been particularly overcautious in its proposals, which is something that I find deeply deplorable.</p>
<p class="contents">What we must do now is to help farmers – not to produce more, but to produce better. Consumers have lost their confidence in farming and it can only be restored by developing sustainable agriculture.</p>

<p class="contents">We are delighted that the amendment to limit the European Union’s financial participation to 50% was rejected by a large majority. This would have been unacceptable to us, unacceptable to the Irish Government and unacceptable to our farming community.</p>
<p class="contents">From the outset we have considered that “mad cow disease” is a Community problem and should therefore be fully financed by the Community. The initial figure of 70% Community participation and 30% national participation in the Haug report, was adopted by a very large majority. The Fianna Fail MEPs reluctantly voted in favour of this proposal. Community rules, at the present time, do not allow for a higher Community participation. Our choice was therefore limited, however regrettable.</p>
<p class="contents">Fianna Fail’s Group requested a roll-call vote on the final paragraph of the resolution, which refers to codecision for the CAP. We voted against this paragraph. The European Parliament has no power or authority to vote itself codecision powers. This is a matter for the Heads of State and Government – only. It is not on their agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, according to the Treaties, any revision of the CAP will not take place before 2003 – 2004.</p>

Yet, that is not the most important point. What is more important is that today we have been handed the death certificate of the CAP, which some Members will welcome. We do not.</p>
<p class="contents">There were many giveaway signs of Europe’s predictable weak points. At the WTO conference held last year in Seattle, the American delegates and the Cairns delegation had already wanted to dismantle the CAP by withdrawing export refunds and internal funding, whereas they themselves have never before subsidised their agricultural industry so much, providing USD 23 billion for 2001 alone.</p>
<p class="contents">The BSE crisis has been caused by a global free trade policy and a lack of border controls and it seems to have put the nail in the coffin of the CAP, all the more so because Germany which, since Nice, has become the most powerful country in Europe, refuses to make an extra effort to help farmers who are in crisis, the innocent victims of the industrialisation of agriculture. Undeniably, José Bové and his friends are the Americans’ impartial allies in this matter, in as much as they would like to see the CAP destroyed, some of them so that they can take over our markets again and others in the name of the ‘class struggle’ and of ‘Third Worldism’. The Americans will take advantage of our divisions to take over from their only serious competitor on world markets and to dominate the food industry again.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to reiterate that the original CAP was based on the concept of Community preference and financial solidarity and that Europe has become both self-sufficient and a major exporter of high-quality agricultural food products because of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we are again hearing the terms ‘cofinancing’, ‘renationalisation’ and ‘codecision’ used to refer to the agricultural industry – these are words which seemed to have disappeared from our vocabulary since the Berlin Summit in March 1999. This is one of the signs that France no longer has the required levels of authority and commitment within Europe to defend its own interests, as Mr Chirac and Mr Jospin demonstrated at Nice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Tests, market interventions and purchase and destruction orders for non-tested cattle over 30 months are to be cofunded by the EU and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The report commendably emphasises the importance of reforms to the common agricultural policy along the lines of ‘environmentally, economically and socially sustainable farming according to the spirit of Agenda 21’. The Member States’ responsibility for the problems arising out of BSE is also emphasised, as is the fact that alternative methods of funding ought to be considered for when animal diseases break out.</p>
<p class="contents">It is high time that we abandon a form of agricultural production which simply aims for the highest possible yield and does not take sufficient account of quality and the interests of consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Swedish agriculture has not so far been hit by the BSE crisis, something which is clearly to be explained in terms of sound animal husbandry and feeding.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the Member States must take greater responsibility for a problem which is largely due to deficiencies in national legislation. We therefore recommend Amendments 4 and 5, tabled by Mr Mulder, whereby compensation paid to farmers in connection with the BSE crisis would be funded on an equal (50-50) basis by the EU and the Member States. We also support Amendments 1-3, tabled by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, which make clear the need the need for agricultural reforms and for the individual Member States to take more responsibility for cofunding.</p>

A study of the latter reveals a model which guarantees equality of opportunity. It enables transport service providers to make joint use of networks built and maintained mainly with public funds despite competing amongst themselves. Hence the environmental impact of civil engineering projects of this nature is reduced as much as possible. I therefore venture to suggest that we would be well-advised to opt for a similar arrangement for the development of telecommunications. There would be no competition over the construction of superimposed infrastructure networks. Instead, there would be competition to provide the cheapest and most efficient services for the user.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mayor of Bilbao in the eighties I witnessed a battle amongst companies eager to improve and increase their networks. Each company wished to dig its own trenches and install its own aerials so as to have its own channels and exclusive coverage in every street in the city. I opposed this because I believed it made more sense to have a single public aerial, network, channel and trench along which all the telecommunications services provided by private operators could be channelled. Similarly, buses and lorries belonging to different companies all travel along the same motorway. There is no need for each company to build its own.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, if the general feeling is that the final networks should also be privatised, I will not argue against it. However, I do feel that in any case it would be wisest to make legal provision to separate the functions of the owners and managers of the networks from those of their users and providers of telematic services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Due to the constantly increasing demand for frequencies, whether it be from communication networks, radio, traffic, the police, the armed forces and science, a coordinated action in Europe in international competition is simply essential. Harmonisation at EU-level is generally helping to create a continental market that can totally hold its own against US competitors. Furthermore, I would like to mention the increased process of administrative simplification – eight acts were created out of a total of twenty – which is a thoroughly positive development.</p>
<p class="contents">Rules of competition will be the most important instrument used to regulate the market for electronic communications. Until genuine competition can take place on the market, clearer criteria with regard to regulatory intervention and more precise limits and conditions for allocating obligations regarding the granting of access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks are necessary. Therefore, I expressly welcome Mr Brunetta’s report, which proposes reasonable obligations for the operator and stresses that prior regulations should be repealed as soon as the aims pursued have been achieved via market mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">Such interventions will be necessary so long as the former monopoly holders, who still provide the most connections, exist. The meagre resources, controlled by one or a few of the operators, for example the local access network in telecommunications, are currently yet another obstruction to competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would reiterate that the proposed directive, due to come into force on 1 January 2003, seeks to take account of the development of the former Telecom Package 1998, on the one hand, and of technological evolution in this market, on the other. I am very pleased to see that the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) are to be given greater flexibility, allowing them to conduct their own assessment of market positions and to decide when and how a given market needs to be regulated.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mr Paasilinna, I believe that the new approach will allow the framework directive to play a key role in setting the generally applicable regulations. These regulations must provide consistency throughout the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">The difficulty in this constantly changing sector is to find a fair balance between specific rules and Community legislation in the area of competition. It is important to ensure that competition is not so anarchic as to harm the interests of the consumer, but that the spirit of innovation is maintained. The NRAs will therefore have a large part to play in achieving this.</p>
<p class="contents">In our debates, the concept of a ‘Significant Market Player’ emerged as the focus for discussion. It was even thought worthwhile arranging a public hearing on this topic. In the end, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy voted in favour of an amendment to clarify the terminology used. Bearing in mind the stage that we have reached, I believe that it would have been difficult to create a clearer definition. I therefore welcome the fact that this amendment has been adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first report is a regulation on controls applicable to fishing. I am sure that Mrs Jackson, Chairperson of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health, and Consumer Policy, envies Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, who is the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries. Why does she envy him? Because, for all her enthusiasm, Mrs Jackson has yet to have a directive passed on environmental control, which has remained a mere recommendation. Mr Varela, on the other hand, has succeeded in obtaining nothing less than a regulation to enforce controls on fishing. Great credit, therefore, great honour, great respect – but also great envy, I believe, from other committee chairmen – to Mr Varela, as well as my compliments.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the other Varela report, this one about controls applicable to fishing too, when I read this document carefully it made me wonder: since the inspectors who oversee the enforcement of regulated fishing in Europe are paid out of European Union budgetary funds, why should they be national inspectors engaged by individual Member States and not inspectors depending on Community bodies? Control is a very delicate and important matter. If we pay the inspectors, we should also choose them. How many of us would pay for a cinema ticket to have someone else see the film? Maybe some generous soul, but very few. That is why I say, in hope: the controls are good, but the controls and the controllers should be chosen by the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall have to give up spaghetti with tuna, which I used to like very much, but I call on myself and the pensioners who listen to me not to eat any more tuna for a while, until such time as the technical means is found to avoid catching juvenile baby tuna along with adult tuna, because they too have a right to life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is still about tuna. On page 9 of Mr Gallagher’s report, we read that, with regard to tuna fishing, the provisions on inspection and control are too brief and weak. Indeed, it would appear that no Equatorial Guinean authority has carried out any inspection or control activities. So, in practice, this document that regulates access for our fishing boats to Equatorial Guinea recognises that there is no control on how this kind of fishing should be carried out. I therefore hope that these controls on tuna fishing are genuinely put into practice: young tuna are already being caught in other parts of the Atlantic, but in Equatorial Guinea there is absolutely no control at all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Indeed, a small majority of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities again managed to exaggerate the issue by an incredible amount, thus distorting the main aim of this report, whose basic position I support; in other words, to include the dimension of gender and <span class="italic">mainstreaming</span> in the European Union’s Euro-Mediterranean policy, with particular focus on globalisation and its implications for female migration.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not see the link between the demands for establishing a would-be ‘Euro-Mediterranean citizenship’ and this report. We understand citizenship of our Member States and European Union citizenship. Unless I am unaware of the true meaning and the legal significance of the term “citizenship”, I do not understand how we can go as far as inventing a Euro-Mediterranean citizenship, which would lead to establishing a third type of citizenship for citizens of the Member States, one more than citizens of the non-Mediterranean Member States possess. In that case, why not call for a Euro-Baltic or Euro-Nordic citizenship…I could go on.</p>
<p class="contents">What about the states in the southern Mediterranean, which do not belong to Europe and certainly have no desire or vocation to join the European Union? Some statements and demands made about immigration policy are totally ludicrous and unnecessary, as they state the obvious but do not take the facts of the matter into consideration. Others confuse Euro-Mediterranean policy with the policy of cooperation with the APC countries, which is another matter altogether. I believe that the widespread condemnation of employers, who are accused indiscriminately of abusing migrant women, is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, neither the happiness nor the quality of life of women in the Mediterranean area is served by making migrants out of ever more of them and by causing migration towards the EU’s Member States to be seen as a desirable goal, thanks to increasingly lax regulations concerning visas and the treatment of illegal residents.</p>
<p class="contents">To claim that there is a link between responsible regulation of immigration and trafficking in human beings is, in my opinion, as absurd as the demands to set quotas of migratory flows towards the European Union. Our goal instead should be to keep migratory flows within reasonable limits which are also acceptable to the citizens of EU Member States and to do this by operating a policy of development aid and partnership to enable both women and men to remain in their country of origin, where they can benefit from a standard of living, social security benefits and equal rights and opportunities that are similar to those that should be available in our own countries.</p>
<p class="contents">While we are on this subject, we should remember that there are countries bordering the Mediterranean that are not, and never will be, members of the EU and that have a natural wealth that is far greater than ours, but the corrupt dictatorships of these countries deprive their people, women especially, of the most basic human, social and economic rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is by persuading these countries, within the framework of a clearly defined partnership, to change their internal policies rather than drive their citizens towards immigration that we shall be doing the most good, above all, to women and children who are the main victims of certain cultures and religions which, under the hypocritical pretext of protecting them, deprive them of the most basic human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Topics such as immigration and trafficking in human beings deserve to be investigated in more depth and should not be treated in such a cursory fashion.

<p class="contents">The subject of globalisation was not tackled, whereas it should have been at the centre of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Politically speaking, we are in favour of closer relations between the EU and countries bordering the Mediterranean. However, a concept such as Euro-Mediterranean citizenship, which has no legal basis, could lead to legal confusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Our position does not mean that the problem of female migrants and their standard of living in the EU does not give us cause for concern. We should, however, have liked this problem to be approached in a different manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Out of a worldwide population of 6 billion people, 1.5 billion have less than one dollar a day to live on. What is still more serious is that the global population is likely to increase by about 50% by the year 2020, and almost 90% of this increase will take place in developing countries. It is to be feared that the current situation will further deteriorate over the next few years.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, the European Union which, however, continually declares its solidarity with the poorest countries in the world and spends billions on helping them, has a severe lack of long-term vision for these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We must gradually free ourselves from this policy and instead consider development as a multifaceted issue, so that eliminating poverty is a reality rather than just a mythical objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Development aid is not just due to a generosity tinged with paternalism. For several of our European countries that are, in fact, former colonial powers, development aid is a question of strong commitment, which we must certainly possess.</p>
<p class="contents">If, however, this commitment is to be useful to the people concerned, we must rationalise our aid, reorganise our services and depend to a greater extent on local players, and I am thinking particularly of NGOs.</p>

This framework agreement should by now have been replaced by a global agreement on interregional political and economic association, freeing up exchange, and encompassing Chile as well. This is what the Heads of State and Government of both parties called for at the summit held in Rio at the end of June 1999. This new treaty of association has been delayed due to endless partial negotiations held up in turn by our insistence on prior agreement within the WTO framework. On the other hand, there are those who wish the new agreement to be merely an instrument allowing free exchange between both groups of states. I agree that the economic and commercial association sought by Mercosur and the European Union is very important. However, I also feel that the cultural, social and political aspects which must permeate the new association agreement are more valuable. This agreement should currently have top priority in the Union’s foreign policy. We must not forget the history of Latin America nor the links established over the centuries between the various European countries who discovered what was then known as the ‘New World’. As a result, that part of the globe has inherited the same values concerning culture, religion and identity as the Europe we are currently building. It even shares with us that great collection of values and customs classified as ‘Western’. We must therefore strengthen bipartite dialogue at all levels. We should do so on an institutional, economic, social and civic, parliamentary, intergovernmental and executive plane in the expectation that the new full association agreements with Mercosur and Chile will be finalised at the earliest possible opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
