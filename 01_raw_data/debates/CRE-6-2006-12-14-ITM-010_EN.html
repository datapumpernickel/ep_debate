<p class="contents">This Parliament has accepted the Union’s signing up to the Hague Convention in so far as it is intended to exercise democratic control on each sectoral ratification. The Convention we are debating concerns us in more than one respect, particularly because it will lead to the revision of a certain number of directives which we have adopted in the area in question. I am thinking of directives on ‘collateral’, ‘settlement finality’ and ‘winding up of credit institutions’. That said, we could revise these directives without much difficulty, if we did not fear three fundamental obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the ratification of this Convention on the law applicable to certain rights in respect of securities leaves such a wide margin of discretion for parties to choose the applicable law that we greatly fear that all of the instruments that we have carefully and at length put in place at European Union level to combat money laundering may quite simply be bypassed.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force, the FATF, on the need to be able to identify the owners of securities seem to us to be totally incompatible with this Hague Convention in so far as, once again, it allows parties too much freedom to choose the applicable law.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we fear that the coming into force of such a Convention will lead to the bypassing of the provisions that the Union has adopted in order to deal with abuses of the market. Once again, without clear identification, we fear that it may be possible to bypass certain obligations laid down at European Union level. From this point of view, I will now invoke the opinion of the European Central Bank – just the once will not do any harm - in order to ask for the withdrawal of this proposal. As you know, the European Central Bank has expressed some very important reservations in its opinion; it has particularly highlighted the systemic risks and the risk of an exponential growth of litigation which could prejudice a clear arbitration with respect to determining the ranking of securities.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barrot, your Commission has almost made ‘better legislation’ into the leitmotif of its activity: here is a textbook case in which you could put this principle into practice. This is why we call on the Commission to withdraw its proposal to ratify the Hague Convention on the law applicable to certain rights in respect of securities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The United States and Switzerland signed the Convention in July 2006, Europe debates with itself and the Council is divided.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction, in 1998, of the provision on the location of the account in the directive on the finality of settlement and, later, in the directive on the winding up of credit institutions and in the directive on financial collateral arrangements – all this has helped to ensure legal certainty in respect of laws applicable to securities held with an intermediary.</p>
<p class="contents">If it is indeed true that there is no proof that practical problems exist in the internal market, the scope of this instrument is essentially limited to situations in which securities function as guarantees in the banking sector. Determining the location of securities accounts in the dematerialised and virtual world in which we now live necessitates the development of a new common legislation, for example by means of a standardised numbering system for bank accounts.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of the negotiations on the Hague Convention on securities was to create one single, common provision which could be applied at an international level. For this purpose, the Convention proposes to leave it up to the parties to choose the legislation that will regulate the legal ownership of securities. Given that, at the time, all the Member States had accepted this compromise, in 2003 the Commission proposed signing the Convention. At that point, several Member States raised new questions about this project. Then the Council asked the Commission for precise details on four specific legal questions. The response was given in the form of a legal impact assessment of the Convention, carried out by the services of the Commission and communicated to the Council on 3 July 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">In this assessment, the services of the Commission considered that signing up to the Convention represented today the simplest solution to the question of how to have a single regulation at an international level. The impact assessment also proposed alternatives to signing the Convention, in particular extending the ‘location of account’ clause to cover all uses of securities, and not only uses of securities as guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in order to obtain a solution at an international level on this basis, it would be necessary to enter into new negotiations with third countries. At this stage, according to the opinion of my colleague in charge of the internal market, we do not think that an assessment of the economic and financial impact of the Convention, as mentioned in the oral question, would help us to come up with a solution. In fact, the Member States which negotiated the Convention in 2002 and which today are debating within the Council did not deem it necessary to have such a study – neither then nor now.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement and in the desire to legislate more effectively, the Commission would favourably receive any additional external legal or economic impact assessment which might help us to make some progress.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already told you, the issue is at a standstill in the Council, but the Commission remains open to all proposals. This is what I wanted to say about this question on behalf of Mr McCreevy and the Commission, while underlining, obviously, the difficulty of the problem. Of course I remain very attentive to any proposals and suggestions that Parliament might make on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jean-Paul Gauzès, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE-DE Group.</span> - <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Hague Convention on securities held with an intermediary is intended in particular, as we have just heard, to determine which legislation is applicable to property aspects resulting from the registration of securities held with an intermediary. This text is far from having found a consensus within the European Union, and this justifies the pertinent questions posed by Mrs Berès.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the Hague Convention respects the autonomous free will of the investor and his intermediary in allowing them to designate the law to which they will be bound in the case of litigation. This is contrary to the law in force in most European countries, which regards the country of location of the securities account as the relevant factor in deciding which law is applicable. In other words, this means that from now on the choice of law would become purely contractual, and this is quite obviously a source of legal uncertainty in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore – and let us not be naïvely optimistic about this - if we take into account the importance of American credit institutions in this field, it is to be feared that from now on the contractual choice of American law will become the norm. This will not occur without causing a certain number of negative consequences. On the one hand, in terms of activities: there is a great risk that the mastery of American law - which United States institutions obviously possess – would work in their favour and give them a competitive advantage over European institutions. On the other hand, in terms of protecting the investor: if, under most European legal systems, the investor and holder of a security has, in fact, rights with regard to the issuer of the security, under American law he only has rights with regard to the intermediary. Hence there are legitimate concerns in the case of the issuer going bankrupt.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the provisions of the Convention are such that, as Mrs Berès has said, they would completely bypass any instruments used to combat money laundering, because these are based upon the principle of territorial attachment. Declarations of suspicion must be made to the national authority concerned, that is to say to the authorities of the country in which the intermediary is based. There is therefore a potential conflict between the law which would apply to the security, a law which might insist upon rules of financial confidentiality on behalf of the account holder, and the obligation to declare suspicions about the intermediary. The European Central Bank has expressed its concerns, particularly about the risk of incompatibility between the prudential and stability rules of the financial system and the provisions of the law chosen by the parties. Moreover, it seems difficult to reconcile the principles of most European countries, under which there is a direct relation between the investor and the issuer of securities, with the principles of Anglo-Saxon law under which there is no direct relation between the issuer of securities and the investor.</p>
<p class="contents">You said, Mr Barrot, that the process of joining the Hague Convention on securities held with an intermediary was at a standstill: we emphatically want it to stay at a standstill</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On 5 October, the European Council, having heard the opinion of Parliament, adopted a Decision on the European Community’s accession to the Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">The current initiative relates to the Convention on the law applicable to certain rights in respect of securities held with an intermediary, which has been negotiated over three sessions of the diplomatic Conference held in December 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">This Convention is of an open nature, and hence, on 15 December 2003, although the European Community was not a member of the Conference in which it was drawn up, the Commission presented a proposal for a decision on its signature.</p>
<p class="contents">The first objective of this initiative is to emphasise the need to respect the European Parliament’s competences in this field and to guarantee more democratic control of the work relating to the Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s competences, in which the European Parliament acts as co-legislator, in relation to judicial cooperation in civil matters with cross-border repercussions are affected by the scope of the Convention insofar as is necessary to ensure the proper operation of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, according to the opinion of the European Central Bank, it may have consequences in terms of defining and implementing monetary policy, the operation of clearing and payment systems and the effectiveness of the provisions of the Community acquis.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed signature of the Convention is causing considerable worries and serious concerns within the European Union, involving both the form and the content. The key element of the Convention, contained in its Article 4, which is that the law applicable in this field is that of the State whose identity is expressly agreed by the contracting parties, raises immense questions and risks that have yet to be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">Its enormous possible legislative impact requires that Community standards be applied in order to better legislate for a consultation process and a public debate, as happened in the United Sates when legislative changes less extensive than those proposed in the Convention were carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention introduces greater complexity and uncertainty, by introducing the possibility of numerous legislations being applied to a single system of recording, clearing and settlement. In the absence of harmonisation of the fundamental aspects, this may have adverse effects and put the system at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution proposed, far from contributing to the unifying objective of the Conference, increases its incoherence and is incompatible with the Community legislation establishing the criterion of the location of the securities portfolio. This criterion had helped to increase certainty and efficiency within the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Convention, the power of negotiation will determine the law applicable. This opens the way to legislative relocation, to the detriment of investors and financial bodies. Its entry into force may encourage an uncontrolled process of world and regional consolidation of settlement and clearing activities, increasing the risk of concentration outside of the European Union and with damaging effects in the field of prudential supervision, the prevention of the funding of terrorism and the fight against money laundering.</p>
<p class="contents">The formula chosen may have repercussions in terms of the political rights of investors, transparency and good business governance.</p>
<p class="contents">It raises many doubts, and the proposal, Commissioner, should therefore be subject to a more exhaustive impact study or be abandoned and withdrawn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It works adequately in a European context, but we are now concerned with participating fully in a global market, and the Hague Convention is designed to provide legal certainty in modern – global – circumstances, where securities are, more often than not, held indirectly via mostly electronic-based intermediaries. It defines the law as that specifically agreed by the participants, rather than by location of account, and, in these modern electronic conditions and in a system where there could well be multiple intermediaries, this seems a sensible solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has, therefore, concluded that the best solution is to sign up to the Convention. Indeed, it came to this conclusion after being asked by the Council to investigate the legal implications, which it has now done. The Hague Conference on private international law has been working since 1893 to harmonise international private law, and, on 5 July this year, the USA and Switzerland – not just the USA, but also Switzerland – were the first countries to sign the Convention. The Commission has recommended that the EU Member States should also sign it. Many of the other 64 Member States of the Conference are preparing to sign up to it. Instead, the Member States of the European Union seem unwilling to come to terms with reality, and we in Europe have as much, if not more, interest in achieving certainty in this area if we are to participate fully in today’s global financial markets. It will surely be critical in achieving an effective and efficient clearing and settlement system.</p>
<p class="contents">So please, colleagues, let us encourage the Commission and Member States to accede to this Convention. Europe should be in the vanguard of modernising and harmonising the legal context for securities. The Commission is prepared to provide the necessary amendments to Community law, so, surely, we should encourage – indeed, insist – that our Member States reach agreement and proceed to sign, and then ratify, this important Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The term ‘markets’ here implies liquid assets and the capacity for financial instruments to be transferred rapidly, and this under optimum security conditions. The legal framework that regulates these transfers is an essential parameter when it comes to security. Because of globalisation, the chain of actors stretches across an ever increasing number of States, which raises this legitimate question: how does one determine the applicable law? The Hague Convention of 13 December 2002 was supposed to answer this question. If this Convention were to be ratified, then far from solving this problem, it would increase the systemic risks and undermine European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the – supposed - impossibility of defining an objective place in which the securities account is to be located, and, therefore, given the impossibility of determining the applicable law, the Convention gives priority to parties’ freedom of choice in deciding which law will apply to the contracts. This legal principle is opposed to the Community principle, PRIMA, which guarantees the location of securities accounts and was adopted in three directives: that on settlement finality (1998), that on collateral (2002) and, finally, that on the winding-up of credit institutions (2001).</p>
<p class="contents">For a start, let us consider the methods used. It is not normal for Parliament not to have been consulted on the negotiations conducted in the Hague, in particular on the abandonment of the location of account principle. There must be democratic control over negotiations undertaken in the context of the Hague Conference on private international law.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, adopting this Convention would mean that Europe would be running a considerable risk, from investors to issuers. It would have a negative impact on the fight against money laundering, because it would make it potentially easier to bypass both obligations to declare suspicions and mechanisms to fight money laundering. It would have repercussions for delivery regulation systems, for prudential risks and for financial law, and particularly on the aim of preparing a European financial law. It must be added that free contractual choice would, in most cases, mean choosing the law with most influence in this sector, namely American law, which would reduce the competitiveness of European companies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out four things: firstly, the location of account is possible and it works very well in Europe; secondly, the prerogatives of the European Parliament must be respected; thirdly, it is essential to defend general European interests, especially the rights of European investors and the competitiveness of European companies in the financial markets; and fourthly, it is important to favour a framework that enables us to fight money laundering. This is why the Commission should withdraw its proposal to ratify the 36th Hague Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(FR)</span> Mr President, I have listened carefully to the various comments and I am sure that Charlie McCreevy, the Commissioner responsible for the internal market, will read them carefully. May I remind you that the Commission proposed signing the Hague Convention because it believed it was a good solution and that the Convention aimed to clarify which law was applicable, nothing more. The Commission thinks that even today investors can open an account in the United States and that, in that case, too, US law applies.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the Convention changes little because people already have the freedom to choose where their accounts are held, even though for some of you the Convention is a step forward in the matter. All the same, Mr President, after listening to what the various speakers have said I would nevertheless like to say that the Commission does not intend to turn a deaf ear to these comments.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate shows that the Convention is still a source of serious concern. The Commission will therefore remain open to any suggestion relating to this technically complex matter, which is at present blocked in the Council despite the fact that all the Member States initially supported the contents of the 2002 Hague Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">That much I can add. The Commission will of course gladly work with the Council and Parliament to find a solution that will allow a legal framework to be drawn up, and we are, incidentally, aware of the risks that entails. You can count on us to mitigate the negative effects of the solution adopted, if necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
