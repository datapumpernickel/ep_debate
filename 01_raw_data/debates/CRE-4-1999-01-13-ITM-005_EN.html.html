<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hardstaff </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, when I spoke on the Görlach report on rural development late last year, I said that this Parliament should be honest as to whether it is serious about reform of the common agricultural policy. A large number of amendments tabled to the reports we are discussing today sadly demonstrate that some political groups in this House are more interested in short‐term political advantage in the run‐up to the European elections, than in achieving realistic reforms to create an agriculture policy appropriate for a Europe of 20 to 25 countries in the 21st century, operating in a global economy and subject to World Trade Organisation rules.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unrealistic for some political groups to table large numbers of amendments to all the reports calling for increased subsidies year on year, where the Commission is proposing progressive decreases in order to reduce agricultural spending and make EU enlargement possible. Indeed, events of this week and the last month must make the applicant states wonder just what sort of organisation they have applied to join. Either we are serious about building up a genuine Europe, embracing all the countries which were separated from western Europe for 40 years by an accident of history, which we must ensure never happens again, and take steps that we know are necessary to make that possible, or a majority of this Parliament votes for amendments calling for subsidies we know are unsustainable and betray this historic moment of change.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, we need to protect our farmers in the short term against too rapid change, so that they can cope with this transition period. Yes, we should be encouraging the development of renewable non‐food crops, though not tobacco, particularly on voluntary set‐aside land. Yes, we should encourage more extensive livestock rearing by adjusting the way premia are paid. Yes, there should be financial assistance to those farming on the most difficult terrain and to help older farmers to retire. Subsidies should be targeted to where they are most needed and an upper limit put on the size of individual payments, unless higher payments can be proved to benefit the wider rural economy or the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">These reforms are necessary quite apart from the wider context of Agenda 2000. Europe needs competitive, but also sustainable, environmentally‐friendly agriculture producing the high‐quality food our citizens need for a healthy diet, without massive surpluses, without polluting our countryside, and without causing unnecessary animal suffering. We need to support those who preserve on our behalf our rural environment and beautiful countryside, through special environmental payments. New jobs, not directly connected to agriculture, need to be created in rural areas if we are not to suffer rural unemployment, depopulation and villages reduced to dormitories for towns and cities, with all the attendant transport and environmental problems that entails.</p>
<p class="contents">I challenge the groups when they draw up their voting list to look beyond short‐term electoral gain and to vote in such a way as to support and improve implementation of the Commission's reform proposals rather than undermine them.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Olsson </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office, Commissioner, there are different ways of discussing agricultural policy: in principle and with a long‐term perspective, or in terms of what can be achieved today.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle, I would prefer to see a more extensive reform of the CAP than the Commission has proposed. Our agricultural policy has been handed down to us from the 1950s. It is out of tune with our wish for a more efficient global market in line with the objectives agreed during WTO discussions, namely a global market with increased demand and where quality and protection of the environment are given higher priority both at home and abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there have been many changes since the Commission first devised Agenda 2000. In a single year, we have been hit by economic crises, particularly in South‐East Asia and Russia, which knocked the wind out of our export market. It is also interesting to note that the USA has reintroduced significant agricultural support measures.</p>
<p class="contents">There is consequently a question mark over what we should do in our present situation. With hindsight, we know that between 1996 and 1997 the market caused prices to rise. However, the position today is that the market has depressed prices. In my view, it is an absurd situation when prices drop so far that they cannot be compensated for by direct payments.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of ‘renationalisation', I should like to ask the Commissioner for his assurance that compensatory payments and premiums at national level can be organised in a way that will protect farmers from distorted competition in countries whose governments are unsympathetic towards agriculture.</p>

On the other hand, the same measures aim to do away with the inalienable right of farmers and their children to cultivate their land and develop their output, by means of unacceptable and arbitrary quotas, large and savage compensatory fines, so that there too monopoly capital will be able to spread, get its hands on agricultural holdings and throw farmers out of work or, if it allows them to remain and work in the countryside, then to do so as a new type of share‐cropper. Finally, these measures aim to establish economic and trade conditions such that monopoly capital, in negotiating its agreements with the World Trade Organisation, will be able to make concessions in return for benefits from American capital which will be to the cost of farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">By speaking for more than half an hour, the Commissioner tried to make all this sound better than it is. But the whole plan will be upset by the angry and orchestrated response of the farming community. And do not think that such a thing will never happen, that we will not have a repetition of the peasants' revolt. We will have a mass agricultural movement with the manpower to brush aside this unacceptable policy.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Guinebertière </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, CAP reform doubtless constitutes a vital stage in Community life because it must pave the way for the third agricultural millennium. The same can be said of Europe"s economies and cohesion as well as life in Europe"s countryside. CAP must of course evolve, but let us not too hastily overlook its finer points. It has enabled the development of modern agriculture, agricultural exports and European markets to be supplied with safe, high‐quality products. It has also guaranteed farmers" incomes and has been the only fully integrated policy at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">What form does the Commission propose the reform should take? A generalised price reduction in line with the world market, compensation in the form of direct aid, but granted on the basis of the criteria set, and Member States" participation in the allocation of flexibility envelopes. At the same time Member States are set to become the promoters of animal welfare in an increasingly globalised market.</p>
<p class="contents">None of this is acceptable in its current form. The tough negotiations taking place here in both the Council and Parliament are proof enough of this. I am particularly concerned about the COM in beef and veal and about extensive production systems in general. Their role is in fact important in terms of land use and environmental protection and must not be overlooked, but it is above all the interests of farmers and consumers that I should like to protect with this reform.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, we will support Mr Garot"s position as rapporteur and his request for limited price reduction, increased production controls and quality in terms of taste and health. We also support his request for public intervention to be maintained. The difficulty of managing this reform is further complicated by the milk reform and other general measures. Overall, CAP reform should prepare European agriculture for moving closer to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and their agricultural products, as well as preparing Europe for future WTO negotiations. This should not be carried out by setting European prices and immediately aligning them with world prices, but by asserting our European model which respects human life and life on earth.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lambraki </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, today we are in the home stretch for the completion of approval for the part of Agenda 2000 which relates to the common agricultural policy – I would say its most important part, given the importance of the agricultural sector at many levels and its multi‐functional character, let alone the extent to which the agricultural guideline plays a part in the Community's budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed regulations for financing the markets for beef, cereals, dairy products and the direct support systems constitute a substantial package which relates to the rules and procedures for financing the common agricultural policy, while in parallel it concerns three common organisations of markets which absorb most of the agricultural guideline. Of course, the fact that those three COMs relate to the main sectors of farming activity in northern Europe indicates the inequality and the degree of preferential treatment they enjoy compared to markets for products from southern Europe, inequalities which the present review – like its predecessors – has been able or has tried to mitigate. As regards the financing regulations, though the Commission's proposals are not very far removed from the existing framework, they leave a substantial gap.</p>
<p class="contents">The addition of new actions to the EAGGF's field of intervention in the Guarantee Section, especially the measures concerning the development of the countryside and pre‐accession aid to the applicant countries, raises serious questions about whether it will be possible to finance those policies in the future in parallel with expenditure related to the COMs, given the resources available.</p>
<p class="contents">A second but very important problem will be created by the proposal to introduce a cofinancing system for direct income subsidies by the Member States. Commissioner, if cofinancing is adopted under pressure from the Member States who regard themselves as net contributors to the Community's budget, this will clearly be a first step towards renationalising the CAP and will act as a catalyst to exacerbate inequalities and nullify progress towards economic and social cohesion within the framework of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The attempt to renationalise the CAP is at the same time an attempt to call into question the fundamental principle of financial solidarity upon which the European Union's only common policy so far has been based.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the COMs for beef, cereals and dairy products, and granted how difficult it is to formulate common policies which will reconcile and satisfy so many different interests, the Commission's proposals form a good basis and are on the right lines. This is the first time I have said that to the Commission. I believe, however, that there is still much room for improvement and I have two things to say, one general and one particular.</p>
<p class="contents">The general comment concerns the need to increase support for small producers and for producers in mountain and disadvantaged areas. The particular comment concerns the conditions pertaining to the milk market in Greece, because of the distance from other markets and the existence of a large number of islands. Those conditions, along with the real need for fresh milk, have created a large discrepancy in relation to the existing reference amount.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the Commission should take another more realistic look at the request to increase the reference amount for Greece by 150 000 tonnes. The problem is not just a recent one, it began after the 1992 distribution and, unfortunately, though the Commission claims that it is trying to eliminate or mitigate the inequalities between products from different countries and areas, where milk is concerned it is causing this really distressing situation in Greece to continue.</p>

<p class="contents">I want to highlight four priorities with regard to the CAP reform, which were actually contained in the report approved last June.</p>
<p class="contents">The first priority is that it is essential for care to be taken when lowering prices. The proposals of 15 % for beef and veal and 10 % for milk and milk products presented by this House seem more acceptable than those of 30 % and 15 %, respectively, presented by the Commission. The reduction of 0 % approved by Parliament for cereals seems unrealistic.</p>
<p class="contents">The second priority is that it is essential for every effort to be made to achieve the internal rebalancing of the CAP by strengthening its second pillar and particularly by strengthening structural policy, agri‐environmental and agri‐forestry measures, special aid to disadvantaged areas, support for quality products and, in general, economic diversification and rural development. Without this, there can be no European model of agriculture and no fair response from the CAP to the various European agricultural systems, which are patently very different.</p>
<p class="contents">The third priority is that it is necessary to avoid an uninformed decision in terms of the criteria for establishing different types of quota, premium rights or reference surface areas. Very special cases, such as in my own country, Portugal, which is lagging behind structurally and which is highly dependent on imported food, will have to be dealt with selectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth priority is that it is essential to respond to an enormous European deficit in oilseeds and protein plants. Therefore, the difference in aid between cereals and the other oilseeds and protein plants must be maintained together with a specific base surface area for maize.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to say that the option of renationalising 25 % of the CAP financing is a matter for debate which must not be considered within this reform. It is not a prohibited or taboo subject, but the debate must take place on a different level from this one, namely on the level of financing and own resources.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I must say something to the President‐in‐Office, who I would especially like to welcome. I would remind him that yesterday in this House, his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, said that one of the main reasons for reforming the common agricultural policy was to reduce the expenditure of the European Union. Previously when holding the Presidency of the Council, Germany has always defended agriculture. It now seems that the new German Government has changed strategy. We would like clarification on this.</p>

Personally, I think we have to be realistic. Agriculture policy must not become any more of a drain on European resources. So I found it particularly interesting to hear Mr Santer saying this morning in his first speech that he was very sorry that Parliament had not welcomed a partial renationalisation of income support or national budgets. It is an interesting option. It would be a weapon in the battle against fraud, and this system would also make it easier to introduce environmental standards in individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">And I believe this part of the debate must really be conducted on a far broader basis, because I think this is what a majority of Parliament"s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs wants to see.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I agree with Mr Olsson that we ought really to be far more innovative in agriculture policy. Eighty per cent of people live in towns. I do not, I live in the country, but I am well aware that this is so. So there is a need for good animal health, a sound environment and a policy for quality. It is therefore extremely important that attention should be focused on these things.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that any incentives we give should favour the countryside, such as using non‐food products as raw materials for construction and energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would point to the great opportunities which information technology provides for new initiatives in the agriculture sector. We have been too prone to see European agriculture as the producing of food in a way we have been accustomed to for years. At the moment, innovation is the most important thing that we can introduce.</p>

No decision was reached about own resources, nor about the way to divide the cost of enlargement. The important decisions were left for March in Brussels, and there is no Council position on how much of the cost of enlargement is to be borne by Europe's citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the German Presidency's first concern was to inform us that Germany wants a considerable cut in its contribution to the Community budget. Here, it is useful to remember that in Edinburgh the Community budget"s own resources were set at 1.27 % of GDP, with the intention of increasing them over the period 2002 to 2006 to 2.5 % against average Community inflation of 2.2 %. All this simply means that agricultural expenditure will have to decrease steadily if any of the above assumptions are not adhered to, or if, as mentioned in Agenda 2000, agricultural expenditure should become non‐compulsory. Let us also remember that in the last two Community budgets the upper limit of own resources never rose above 1.15 %, while a limit of 0.4 % of GDP has also been set for the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">This cofinancing for agriculture is really tantamount to partial renationalisation, indeed up to a significant level of 24 to 25 % in accordance with the third solution in the Commission's report. We have already accepted some underhand activities vis‐à‐vis cofinancing, such as the 1996 review of the COM in fruit and vegetables, the recent abolition of intervention for oil and the possibility of redeeming unused individual tobacco quotas. The proportion of cofinancing must be related to the level of economic strength of the Member State concerned, and in that case special attention must also be devoted to agricultural products in which the European Union is deficient.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the ‘fair assumptions' on which the rapporteur at least wishes cofinancing to be determined, but we disagree with the choice of Article 43 of the Treaty as the decision‐making procedure to be followed. We favour Article 209, granted that what is involved is a financial amendment which requires unanimity in the Council, and we oppose partial renationalisation and the introduction of a generalised structural mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, as regards the reform of the CAP, we call for equal treatment for Mediterranean products and full compensation for loss of agricultural income by direct aid, especially for small producers and disadvantaged regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the persistent more general imbalances between north and south, which have been mentioned already and are quite evident, I would like to remind you that the Cohesion Fund was no more than compensation for the single market policy which mainly benefits the industrial countries in the north.</p>

In that sense, I think we are rapidly moving towards worsening conditions governing the exercise of agricultural policy, which ought not to abandon agricultural production and the countryside to the dictates of the free market, but should take into account demographic and environmental factors and the danger that large areas of agricultural production may be deserted. I wish to express our complete opposition to any attempt to use financing provisions to renationalise the common agricultural policy in any way, which would be particularly intolerable for countries with the weakest national budgets and financial means, and also to express my opposition to two major imbalances: firstly, between products from the north and the south, and secondly, between large and small producers.</p>

We are very concerned about the extent of the common agricultural policy reform. He says that he intends to carry out a reform for the future yet I do not see how the Commission can claim to be carrying out a reform for the future which involves wasting half the Community budget on a sector in which 1 % of the richest people in Europe receive 40 % of this budget.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not right, Commissioner Fischler. It is not right that a few Members and the Commission are speaking on behalf of farmers. You are talking about a privileged minority who, thanks to the CAP system, will apply for public funds that we should be managing very carefully. This is not happening because we are giving these funds to people who do not need them. It is impossible to reconcile your speech on the protection of the environment, on the protection of employment, and on the protection of safety and quality with payments for production. There are currently no problems with production, Commissioner. Technological developments and biotechnologies guarantee that production will continue to rise. The problems are with the people. Due to this policy, the rural population is already seven times smaller than in 1950. Under this policy, just 2.5 % of the population will still have links with the rural world. What you have to do is propose an end to all the production aid. This aid must be used for research, it must benefit small farmers and it must be used for family‐based companies, employment and quality. This is how the aid must be used rather than for this incredible waste of half the Community budget, which is potentially paid for by those who need it most and distributed among those who do not need it. I am doing you justice, Commissioner. You are less of a lobbyist than the Members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development because the three dossiers presented by that committee are worse than the proposal from the Commission itself. In fact, they want more, not to modulate, not to set a fair ceiling, not to keep people in agriculture, but to produce more for the surpluses. We can then pay ourselves for storage, pay ourselves for not producing, and even pay ourselves again for producing, storing and exporting. This policy cannot continue Commissioner Fischler. Enough is enough!</p>

Therefore, please let me comment on a few aspects that have not been touched upon by my colleagues, although I support much of what has been said here by Mr Goepel, as well as by Mr Funk, Mr Cunha and Mr Colino.</p>
<p class="contents">I will only mention three specific major points and three minor points. As regards the major points, I should like to discuss the innovative aspect of Agenda 2000 regarding rural development. Although it is not an issue under debate today, you said that more than 50 % of the population was over 55 years of age. Therefore, the main objective in agricultural policy, Commissioner, must be to support the population in the rural environment and here there are two major problems: that of young people, and that of supporting women in the rural environment. Without women, there is no solution to this problem and that is the truth of the matter, however much we may resent it. Men follow along behind women and we are left with a rural environment where the number of people is dropping and where we have too many agricultural policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Another major point is the issue of cofinancing. Do not destroy the principle of solidarity. I believe that in cofinancing direct aid – aid that requires Member States to comply with certain measures – we could be heading towards severe discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we must maintain the requirements – and the control of such requirements – for products coming from third countries. These products must meet the same requirements as we lay down for our own products.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the minor points, I cannot forget a few long‐standing problems. I should like to remind you of the matter of past yields, or of the increase in male bovine quotas, which is already over 70 000 and which should once again be increased. We also welcome the increase in milk quotas although we will continue to protest that it is insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we have already established a European agricultural model. Adopt it, fight for it and, along with all the European institutions, fight for those farmers whom you already defend so fiercely.</p>

Everyone, or virtually everyone, recognises that this policy is not equipped for an enlargement which means that the Union is going to consist of more than 20 countries. We are therefore obliged to make some changes, whether we want to or not. We would like to participate in those changes, and we actually think that the Agenda 2000 proposal from the Commission is both elegant and bold. We know the main ideas: general support schemes are to be abolished and European farmers will have to compete on the world market. That is something we shall have to accept as a result of the WTO negotiations, and I also believe it is healthy for agriculture that we are going to have this liberalisation in future and that we are therefore also going to move closer to world market prices. I also believe that, in the slightly longer term, this will make it necessary for us to abolish the whole milk quota system. Some people will have regrets. But I have no regrets. I think it will be a good idea to do this in the longer term. I believe in fact that people should be aware that the process which will be started by Agenda 2000 will lead to more and more liberalisation in the agricultural sector. We Danish Social Democrats are very happy with the Commission's proposal, and we think it is a necessary change both in view of the WTO agreements and also because of the enlargement project and the whole financing situation we are in.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tabled amendments to a number of the proposals which have been put forward in Parliament. We also have some other amendments. We feel that in many ways the Commission's proposal is more realistic than what Parliament has been able to agree on, and I hope that Parliament will understand that it is in fact necessary to fall in line with the approach set out by the Commission. The fact is that a number of the amendments proposed by Parliament – which we have voted against, but which are still on the table – entail an increase in the budget rather than a reduction, which is what the Commission's proposal is about. We therefore have to find a solution which can be implemented, and we also have to respect the time factor. That is why it is crucial for us to be able to deliver our opinion when we vote on this later this month in Brussels, and it is crucial that these things are ready on time. I therefore wish both the President‐in‐Office and the Agriculture Commissioner good luck, and hope that things will be in place in March.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Filippi </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, I agree with those colleagues who are concerned that the very valuable debate being conducted on Agenda 2000 might result in low‐profile conclusions in terms of CAP reform. The difficulties are clear; they emerged during our deliberations in the Agriculture Committee, where we were unable to come up with a uniform view on reforming the major sectors, and they re‐emerged this morning during the speech by the President‐in‐Office, when it was said that a compromise should be sought within the Council of Ministers – and we all know how many obstacles to such a compromise have already arisen.</p>
<p class="contents">It would however be wrong to adopt the interpretation which has tended to surface during this debate, namely that on the one hand we have an innovative, reforming Commission and, on the other, a Parliament which is incapable of following the trail marked out by the Commission. Unfortunately the truth lies elsewhere, as we have said since the outset: the Commission's proposals are interesting and important, but the resources earmarked are inadequate to sustain them from a quantitative and qualitative point of view. On one side we have the ECOFIN Council – yesterday morning the German Foreign Minister repeated what the UK Foreign Secretary said at the start of his term of office, namely that we must curb farm spending – and on the other we have the farmers, concerned that price cuts will adversely affect their budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">We must get out of this impasse and move forward. The appeal I would make at the end of my contribution, therefore, is that the high‐level group announced by the Commissioner this morning, which is to begin its work very shortly, should make a real effort to find a way of protecting farmers' interests, somehow seeking an outcome which is in keeping with the declared objectives – very ambitious ones – of the reform.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Wilson </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I will speak generally and not to any specific report. Whatever policies we agree for European agriculture from the year 2000, they must be easy to understand, easy to administer and easy to inspect. Our reforms must continue to use the common policy as a social tool. We argued during the GATT talks that our policies were helping the economies of poorer rural areas, not supporting production. If we argued this before, we cannot now argue that it is wrong to penalise efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">We must put a ceiling on the aid to larger cereal farms. We must use modulation but we must use it fairly and sensibly. We must ensure the local economies do not suffer unjustly. We must develop efficient and effective complementary national policies but we must ensure the policies remain common to us all and we must retain common financing. We must resist the move to renationalise funding and policy‐making.</p>
<p class="contents">If we agree part‐national financing the required spending must be mandatory. There is merit in the proposal for area payments. This is part of our social responsibility but we must retain benefits for farmers in the hills and other difficult terrain and we must ensure that benefit goes where it is required – not to the large, the rich or powerful. Re‐distribution must ensure fairness. While we should all welcome proposals to increase extensive farming, we must ensure that we can police the system simply and efficiently. We must not build a huge bureaucracy living off the back of small farmers. We must also ensure that health and safety costs, consumer protection costs and abattoir control charges do not escalate to the point where they cannot be afforded. At present in my country of Wales there seem to be more inspectors than sheep.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also ensure that where regional policy objectives apply, they and agriculture policies cooperate rather than compete. All over Europe we are seeing rural areas getting poorer and losing vitality and urban areas getting richer. Rural areas need economic aid as well as houses for holiday‐makers and relatively rich retired people. Agenda 2000 through the CAP must be an integral part of the support required for rural economies.</p>

Nevertheless, I would like to make it clear that I personally consider the level of the cuts in intervention prices contained in the Commission proposal to be unacceptable. I would now like to discuss two points contained in the Graefe zu Baringdorf report.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point concerns the concept of good farming practice, which means that farms that are managed in accordance with the principle of good farming practice will in future receive full financial aid. Of course, this applies only if they also meet the other conditions laid down in this regulation. Where services rendered by farmers with a view to preserving the agricultural environment go beyond good farming practice, special payment should be given, for example within the framework of Regulation 20/78.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States should be able to impose sanctions on the basis of objective criteria if environmental principles are not complied with, and these criteria must also be in accordance with the principle of good farming practice. This method of farming must be recognised EU‐wide and generally accepted. I believe that Member States should develop codes which they can then promote accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I would like to discuss concerns the employment situation in rural areas. We all know that farming families must in future be given more new opportunities for income security. It is up to politicians to create the conditions so that well‐ educated, innovative farmers – and this is how I see the farmers of the future – can ensure that rural areas retain their attraction. An eco‐social agricultural policy must be tailored to the multifunctional world of agriculture and rural areas. The European farming model was agreed at the Luxembourg Council, and this must be the fundamental criterion for the next round of WTO negotiations, as European agriculture is of course considerably different from that of our other partners in the WTO.</p>

The countryside must be viewed in its entirety. There must be diversity in the range of rural occupations, and the countryside has to be developed with respect for nature and recreation. We must safeguard access to areas of recreation. We must have access to woodlands, meadows, beaches and the shores of lakes. The right to roam the countryside must in no case be connected to rights of ownership, and public right of access must be secured.</p>
<p class="contents">Agricultural policy demands reform. Agriculture that is closer to nature must be the norm, not the exception. It has to be said that the views of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and those of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection are reasonably close to one another here.</p>
<p class="contents">Direct subsidies for agriculture must be tied to compliance with environmental standards. The decisions taken under the Treaty of Amsterdam and later at the Cardiff summit on the inclusion of the environment in all EU policy, based on the principle of transparency, must be taken seriously in agricultural policy too. Under this principle, linking environmental standards to the payment of aid cannot be left up to individual Member States. This would not achieve the aim of a more environmentally sustainable agricultural policy and agriculture, whose produce we can rely on as being healthy and safe.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for the environmental view to be taken fully into consideration Member States must work with the Commission to develop a code of practice for environmentally sustainable agriculture. Aid should be paid only to farmers who comply with the agreed rules. Special agricultural environmental aid should be paid only for projects which either protect the natural environment or improve the present state of the agricultural environment. Special attention must be paid to the protection of areas of water. Applying a code of good agricultural practice must be made more effective by being able to claim back our resources.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital that the question of diversity in the European Union is taken into consideration, as agriculture is practised from the north to the south. For example, in Finland organic meat production is not successful as the animals have to be kept outside the whole year round. At this time of the year there might be a metre of snow and the temperature could be thirty degrees below zero.</p>

I do not want to reiterate what has already been said today but I should like to mention to the President‐in‐Office one of the points he mentioned: the WTO. I have long argued within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that it is important that Agenda 2000 and WTO dovetail together. The Americans are no angels when it comes to WTO negotiations and we have to be very careful not to lose out in those negotiations. I am quite sure that he is well aware of that situation and will make sure that we are in a strong position for those WTO negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I was delighted to hear the Commissioner say that 50 % of farmers are over 55. I just qualify as being under 55 – I am not quite sure whether that also applies to the Committee on Agriculture. It is a very poignant point: we <span class="italic">must</span> prepare for the younger generation because if we allow these young people to wither then the vine dies and with it the industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to air one or two things which have already been said. I agree with Mr Wilson that we must have clear decisions, uniform policies and continuity, because agriculture needs continuity. There are three main issues in British agriculture which worry us. We have seen a 40 % fall this last year in our income and yet we talk about such things as national envelopes and a renationalisation of the common agricultural policy, which strikes fear into people's hearts in the United Kingdom because it allows governments to control the spending on agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">One of my colleagues mentioned modulation. One of the problems with modulation is that there is genuine concern that it will not be fair across the board. Modulation is great as long as it is larger than your particular farm. We are totally opposed to that.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, again, do not allow cofinancing to be a renationalisation of the common agricultural policy.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Haug </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that the success of the Agenda 2000 negotiations is closely linked to success in all parts of the Agenda, in other words to a compromise that we must all accept. The reform of the common agricultural policy is a central pillar of the overall structure, but it is only together with the other pillars of reform that it can support the Agenda 2000 structure. This means that the course for a successful financial reform must be set now in the context of the negotiations on the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that proper financial regulations are not possible without appropriate changes in agriculture, the area that accounts for almost 50 % of the European budget. As a financial manager myself, you will forgive me for being particularly annoyed by this.</p>
<p class="contents">President Santer rightly pointed out that the negotiations on the future financing of the budget represent one of the key elements of the Agenda 2000 negotiations. But alongside the financial reforms support must also be given to the necessary agricultural policy reforms. I do not agree with the assessment given by Commissioner Fischler this morning. Cofinancing of agricultural policy measures, as proposed in some amendments, should not be dealt with separately from agricultural reform. On the contrary, in our view it is one of the successful elements of the reform proposed for the agricultural sector, and it is clearly in line with the Commission"s thinking in proposing to redirect the CAP away from price guarantees and towards income support. If is it correct that we can assist rural areas more effectively by means of this redirection, the Commission should not have applied the brakes halfway through; not only should it have thought it through logically to the end but it should also have prescribed reform. This also means that we have to put our faith in the tried and trusted mechanism of the Union and the Member States sharing joint responsibility for structural measures under the agricultural policy too.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Commissioner Fischler, if I had been you I would not have missed out on the dynamic effect of cofinancing. There is no doubt that it increases willingness to discuss the scale and structure of the common agricultural policy objectively and in detail. Awareness of the need for reforms, as proposed by the Commission, will increase rapidly in the Member States if in future the Ministers for Agriculture have to fight with their Ministers for Finance for part of the funding. The proposed cofinancing is not in fact a means of solving net contributor problems but instead will play a crucial role in restoring the balance between market policy and income policy on the one hand and structural policy in rural areas on the other. It is not a form of renationalisation, to reply to a fear that has just been expressed. Like Mrs Boogerd‐Quaak, I hope that the Committee on Budgets will find a majority in favour of cofinancing, as we need to show that almost 50 % of the budget is being used efficiently and is achieving results if we are to allow citizens to have confidence in the way their taxes are being used.</p>

It will be a tough job, and the fear that the special conditions prevailing in peripheral areas will be ignored in the final decisions that are taken is a very legitimate one.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the many problems with the Agenda 2000 agricultural reform is the plan to turn grain policy upside down. The reduction in the administrative intervention price of grain proposed by the Commission is a problem. At the same time the Commission is proposing that only half the reduction in the administrative price should be paid back in compensation. Grain production in the areas that are classed as peripheral in Finland is now very unprofitable, so that any reduction in price would cause production to suffer even further. Special regional conditions, relatively low yields, and high costs must be taken into account in the reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Rural Europe will need viable agriculture in the future to preserve its vitality and diversity. Agricultural development will continue to affect the well‐being of the entire population of the continent. If agriculture were left to waste away it would at the same time lead to the decline of the food and agricultural equipment industries and the commercial sectors connected with them, as well as limiting consumer choice.</p>
<p class="contents">Agriculture has to move in step with the liberalising world market, but we must be able to impose a change in direction and speed. The direction in agriculture must not be downward. Preserving the model of the family‐run farm is dependent on the political will of the European Union. If we can put our trust in the future of European agricultural production and unanimously take the necessary decisions, Europe will have a vital, diverse food and agriculture industry for the next millennium.</p>

But in actual fact, even these tentative efforts are being undermined by the desire for balanced national budget contributions and the lack of any true innovation. The outcome or compromise, as the President‐in‐Office, Mr Funke, deliberately repeated several times this morning, must however take account of a long‐standing culture which is remote from the real interests of consumers and producers.</p>
<p class="contents">High‐level groups, diplomatic mediation, informal contacts and claims that the budget is untouchable, on the one hand, and the desire to renationalise expenditure, on the other, make the gulf between economics and politics plain for all to see. Farm incomes have dwindled. Price reductions have forced European producers to compete in ways which have often been detrimental to both quality and social conditions, quite apart from having led to a decline in health and hygiene standards.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall never forget BSE and what it did to consumer confidence. But the most immoral aspect here is that the type of production which caused BSE has not been rooted out. Production for its own sake, to rake in premiums, the misuse of scientific research, the difficulty of monitoring certification standards on the use of transgenic products at consumer level, the use of antibiotics and growth promoters in plants and animals – all of these have continued. Impenetrable levels of specialisation and sophistication have been reached, and the phenomenon has continued to spread even since the BSE crisis. How should we respond to these questions and these external costs?</p>

As I see it, a great opportunity has been missed to propose a true reform that would redress the balance in this sector of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you are well aware that my country has been asking for increased quotas of one million tonnes, but in your plan we are allocated approximately 220 000 tonnes, which is much lower than our needs. It is clear that there is no real explanation for the fact that a Member State such as Spain, which accounts for 12 % of dairy farms, 11 % of the population and 6 % of consumption, only has 4.67 % of the overall Community milk quota. In contrast, other Member States receive considerable increases in quotas that they neither need nor have ever requested.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor is it acceptable that less favoured areas have been forgotten in the new reallocation of quotas. These areas should have been included, along with the mountain regions. I also do not believe that the ‘virtual cow" system is acceptable in calculating premiums as, once again, it will clearly penalise those countries that have insufficient quotas and whose production is less than the Community average.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Commissioner, I believe too that maintaining the unjust and insufficient fat content referencing quantities, which many dairy farms have, is unacceptable. There is no explanation for the fact that a Spanish livestock farmer can produce milk with an average fat content of only 3.63 % and yet, in contrast, a Danish livestock farmer is allowed to produce milk with a 4.31 % fat content.</p>
<p class="contents">All this, as you know, has serious consequences, not only for profits but also for the quality and viability of farms. Perhaps, Commissioner, an interim solution would be to allow all dairy production with an average fat content reference quantity under 4 % to be exempt and not subject to an additional levy.</p>

However, I have the impression that we are still doing too little both at national and European level to facilitate change and support the farmers through it.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, it is often the traditional farmers" associations who, in their indiscriminate rejection of reform, forget to draw the attention of their members to new opportunities in good time. These new opportunities are contained in the Commission"s agricultural reform package, despite all the tough measures it may contain.</p>
<p class="contents">For the majority of farmers in Europe – and these are the smaller farmers – the package of reforms is a step in the right direction, even if it is often lacking in vigour and is not sufficiently binding in terms of environmental and social criteria for aid. Incidentally, it is the smaller farmers who have so far been most willing to accept change and to approach it positively. But we often neglect them.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of comparison, I would point out the important and necessary measures taken by the Commission and the Member States in order to prepare companies and banks for the euro. Companies and banks are not exactly helpless organisations. Nevertheless, we have helped them. Members of Parliament have now even received euro key‐fobs from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be much more important to launch a campaign to support farmers not only with practical matters such as adapting facilities and adjusting to change, but to lend them what we could perhaps call moral support. It is sometimes easy to understand why farmers feel excluded from European politics and feel that they are always cap‐in‐hand outsiders.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also place much greater importance on farmers" non‐output‐related performance in terms of its image as a service and a job, and we must make the transition from price support to direct aid more palatable.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Virgin </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office, Commissioner, Agenda 2000 already contains many far‐reaching proposals from the Commission for making changes to the agricultural policy. A reduction in prices to world market levels for milk, beef and cereals has been proposed. The price reductions would be partially offset by higher compensatory payments based on area and the number of livestock. In my view, it is important to adhere to the Commission"s principle of basing this compensation on production capacity, for example in the case of milk. In some cases, Parliament is proposing lower price reductions and thus lower fixed compensatory payments. I have to say that I think the Commission's proposals are better and more carefully thought out, and therefore more deserving of our support.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that there will be more pressure on the budget when the compensatory payments are raised, but any extra burden on European consumers and taxpayers would be more than offset by lower food prices. In all probability, the charge on the budget will lessen over time. According to most forecasts, the world market prices for current products are going to rise, enabling the compensatory payments to be gradually phased out.</p>
<p class="contents">The danger in some of Parliament's proposals lies in the fact that they go only half way and would make it harder for European agriculture to operate on the world market and achieve the competitiveness that is essential for our long‐term survival.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposals also contain a number of drawbacks. Countries which cannot grow silage maize should receive fair compensation. In the debate, it has been said that 20 % of farmers would receive 80 % of the support, but in fact most farmers come within the 20 % band. This is where we find the family‐run farms. The rich minority who happen to farm a large area make up a tiny group.</p>

It seems to me a sad loss that no‐one has mentioned that so far. However, sadly, the vision of many of my colleagues in the Agriculture Committee appears to be one of national interests and not the global view that has been expressed by the Commission. The global view must prevail if progress is to be made in this important sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The reductions in support prices envisaged by the Commission are not only desirable but vital in the light of expansion and our WTO commitments, not to mention the legitimate concerns of those who have levelled criticism at the level of support enjoyed by this sector. I have doubts as to whether the proposals will meet the objective of lowering the cost of agricultural products to consumers, but I sincerely hope that the Commission's forecasts are correct.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of measures designed to protect our rural environment and encourage more extensive farming practices are welcome, but I would draw attention to the degree of flexibility proposed for Member States to decide their own priorities, namely the national envelopes for the beef and milk sectors, the application of cross‐compliance requirements and the labour force criteria. Whilst the notion of flexibility is commendable, we must caution against creating an uncompetitive situation which will divide Europe's farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we need reform. Most people in this Chamber would accept that. I hope that my colleagues can be realistic in their voting pattern on 28 January and ensure that at least, at minimum, the Commission's proposals will be accepted.</p>

In addition, part of the review of the financing system should aim to improve the quality of agricultural products. This helps both the producer facing international competition and the consumer as the end user of the products. I also think that the Guidance Section should finance all measures to develop the countryside, including structural, agri‐environmental and agri‐forestry measures, as well as provide compensatory aid for disadvantaged areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The common agricultural policy is a cornerstone of the Union's European integration and an incentive towards development in the agricultural sector. The possibility of cofinancing will in essence lead to renationalisation of the CAP, even in part, and will affect mainly those countries which fall below the Community average in economic terms, such as Greece and other countries in the south, while in parallel it will have negative consequences for the development of Community agriculture. For that reason, I categorically oppose proposals, legislation and amendments which undermine the fundamental nature of the CAP and go against the principles of economic and social cohesion and solidarity. The Union must not condemn the financing of European agriculture to Procrustes" bed in order to satisfy the demands of some countries for a reduction of their contributions to the budget. And on that point it would be useful to examine not just what those countries contribute to the budget, but also the extent to which they benefit from the common market of the European Union's millions of purchasers. I therefore believe that the principles of cohesion and solidarity demand that the agricultural policy should remain an undiluted common policy, and that it must be understood that efforts to renationalise it would set us on the slippery slope towards its gradual abolition, with the result that the cohesion of the European Union's fabric would be eroded.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I disagree with the proposal for pre‐accession financing of agricultural measures in the applicant countries from the Guarantee Section, and I support the entry of a separate category of pre‐accession aid, one that is independent of the guideline for agriculture.</p>

Now that it has arrived, the manner of its presentation hardly makes us reach for the champagne.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us repeat once again that the Commission's proposals severely marginalise the countries south of the Alps, that is, on Europe's southern periphery. There is no in‐depth understanding of the true problems inherent in carrying forward the proposals for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">A second reason for dissatisfaction comes from the work which we have done – or rather, I should say, have not done – in Parliament, in that only one of the five reports under discussion was approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. I dare not imagine what will happen next week, when we begin to discuss the reform of the COM in wine.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said, all things considered, that the scope of these proposals is very broad, in a territorial sense as well as time‐wise. Reference is made to a target date of 2006, but the effect of this attempted reform will probably last even longer. Reference is made to openness towards Eastern Europe, and above all to what is happening in the west, in other words the WTO constraints. What is perhaps missing, Commissioner, is a little more attention to people, to farmers themselves, who are still somewhat unprepared for all these developments. The challenge of so‐called globalisation affects them directly, but insufficient account is perhaps taken of the persisting uncompetitiveness of European agriculture. The transition is a harsh one, and for once we can say that bureaucracy has actually outstripped the pace at which Europe's citizens are adjusting.</p>
<p class="contents">I am reasonably satisfied with the particular attention devoted in this reform to peripheral areas, such as mountainous regions, with the raising of milk quotas by 1 %, and above all the attention paid to young farmers. Farmers are in fact a dying breed, Commissioner, given that 3 % of them are lost every year.</p>

So I would just like to comment briefly on the Graefe zu Baringdorf report, specifically on direct payments and reductions. I think it is right that European agriculture needs more long‐term stable conditions, but it also needs to become more competitive so that, as well as producing foodstuffs, it can also, in accordance with the European agricultural model, cope with the additional major tasks facing the whole of society, such as preserving the agricultural landscape or generally protecting the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposals are logical. Changes made in one area are balanced by changes in another. But they are also very blunt. For example, not enough attention is given to the situation of individual holdings. Compensatory payments, introduced in the 1992 reform, are almost always really only partial compensation for losses incurred by farmers in the past and still today as a result of price reductions. They are necessary if we are to be able to maintain extensive farming. Good farming practice should be a prerequisite here. However, high payments are often made in the case of farms that have substantial land or a high number of livestock, and these often attract criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that reductions are necessary for this reason. Large‐scale holdings find it easier to cut costs than smaller family‐run farms. Reductions are necessary in order to allow the situation to become reasonably fair for family‐run farms. The question is how to we are to carry out these reductions.</p>

They are therefore not acceptable unless they are amended as my group has recommended. In addition, they are incompatible with the decisions made at the 1997 Luxembourg summit.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind you that, following the exploratory debate by the Ministers of Agriculture on the European agriculture model, the EU Agriculture Council on 19 November 1997 unanimously requested that the agricultural reforms should be organised in such a way as to allow the European agriculture model to be maintained. At the Luxembourg summit in December 1997 this demand was taken on board. The Heads of State and Government declared themselves not only against unilaterally dismantling European agriculture but in favour of further developing the existing European agriculture model with its multifunctional role in all regions; this means that the provisions of the reform under discussion today must target solutions that make economic sense and are justifiable in social terms, and also allow farmers to achieve an appropriate income.</p>
<p class="contents">Why did the Commission, in presenting its drafts, pay so little attention to these options that were agreed at a high political level? It is truly incredible. In my small country the proposals in their present form would result in income losses of LUF 650 million, and would of course mean that agriculture would, quite unreasonably, be dependent on public finance. This cannot be allowed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to comment on milk production, which is such an important part of agriculture in Luxembourg. We at least agree that the milk quotas must be retained. However, the proposals as presented by Mr Goepel are the absolute minimum if we wish to prevent milk production from disappearing in many European regions. I fear, Commissioner Fischler, that it is a naive fallacy if you would have us believe that the drastic price reductions you propose, which are so damaging to farmers, would allow consumers to enjoy price reductions in the order of EUR 10 to 17 billion. The collapse of prices in the beef and pigmeat sectors has shown us that this is not the case, and you do not have a monopoly on political wisdom. Listen to us and to the farmers a little, and then we will be able to find a balanced arrangement.</p>

Galicia is one of these regions, with Objective 1 status under the European regional policy, and it has a clear and long‐established history of livestock farming. The error I am referring to is, of course, the inadequate milk quota Spain was allocated when it joined what was then the EEC. Spain, and Galicia in particular, is therefore still calling for a larger milk quota.</p>
<p class="contents">In our amendments, we ask that special consideration be given to allocating an additional quota to certain regions that suffer as a result of this unfair disadvantage. This would rectify the severe imbalance in the economic and social cohesion of some less favoured areas. In order to survive and be competitive, these regions need a specific restructuring programme, cofinanced by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The structural deficiency of the sector in these regions has led us to ask that premiums be allocated not in relation to the average Community milk production, as the Commission suggests, but rather in relation to the actual national or regional average, which is very different to the virtual Community production. And to make it worse, beef and veal, which could partially alleviate the problem, are not included among European premiums that do not cover calves. We ask that they be regulated and included and that the age for the slaughter premium be brought down to a maximum of eight months. This could help rectify the serious and unjust situation experienced by the Galician livestock sector, a sector which could have great potential. We call on our European colleagues to show some understanding and ask them to support our amendments in a spirit of solidarity and justice.</p>

The farming families of Europe need a reliable political framework. The 1992 reform introduced direct payments for farmers as a result of a price reduction. Commissioner, the criteria for direct payments are explained only in vague terms by the Commission and are even left to the discretion of the individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">But what we need in this area is equal treatment for all agricultural holdings in Europe. The level of the direct payments to be made to farmers and the additional conditions to be imposed must not be decided at national level. This is the only way in the end to ensure that market and competition distortions are avoided. Farmers must be given a regular sum on which they can rely, and they must also be able to plan economically and successfully.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission recognises the need to adjust to the world market. This would expose European agriculture to worldwide competition, but it would at the same time be burdened by additional costs resulting from Europe"s high environmental and social standards. But how can we be competitive if conditions are so varied worldwide? Direct payments to agriculture must in my view be considered from the point of view of less favourable<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span> natural production conditions. We must not forget that farming families look after and preserve the agricultural landscape.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge the Commission to use the given criteria as a basis for deciding on any further requirements to be imposed on agricultural production. We must in future regard the principle of good farming practice as our starting point, a principle addressed by both Mrs Schierhuber and Mr Mayer. We must establish a framework for European agriculture in which Europe"s farmers can in future also survive on the world market.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Keppelhoff‐Wiechert </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it seems that everyone wants to have their say today. Seldom have such great expectations been held of an EU presidency as of the German Presidency in the first half of 1999. Bringing Agenda 2000 to a successful conclusion is almost equivalent to squaring the circle.</p>
<p class="contents">You may be able to bring our negative response to the proposals back to the Council in time, Mr Funke. The content of the new agricultural policy must be finalised quickly, by the end of February, and my question is: are the Ministers of Agriculture still involved in any way in determining policy, or will the Heads of State and Government set the financial framework in advance at the summit in March? The time for questions is long past. Specific options are required, and farmers want finally to know where we are headed.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday in the House Mr Fischer, the German Foreign Minister, called for a reduction in agricultural expenditure. However, he also promised support for European farmers. Mr Funke, I am sure you will be able to explain this confusion. You speak in a very straightforward way that I really like; you have not adopted this technocrats" German, and please do not do so. But to achieve the same result with less and less money is, in my view, a very difficult task.</p>
<p class="contents">Financial leeway is becoming limited in the search for solutions and there is not very much room for manoeuvre. Perhaps this reform is the last available. Following enlargement towards the east, the emphasis is increasingly on liberalisation, which our farmers know, but in my view the solutions that must now be negotiated under Agenda 2000 are only an intermediate stage. In 2005, following the accession of the first group of applicant countries from Central and Eastern Europe, agricultural policy will be under the microscope once again.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the farming community, I really cannot endorse the discussion about price reductions. In twenty years of professional involvement in agricultural policy I have never seen consumer prices fall as a result of lower agricultural prices. Mr Funk said the same this morning. We have a German expression: although cereal is becoming cheaper, bread is becoming dearer. I could also say that although milk is becoming cheaper, yogurt is becoming dearer; you can be fairly sure of that.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to lay down Community rules for direct payments, which was my task as shadow rapporteur, I would also like to ask the Commissioner what these regions must commit themselves to paying their farmers if they can expect higher environmental requirements at the Commission"s insistence, as is currently planned. I know what I am talking about; I come from North Rhine‐Westphalia and our farmers may be able to handle increased environmental requirements, but the question is: who will pay?</p>
<p class="contents">My second and final question concerns the sliding scale of direct payments to farmers in accordance with the number of workers, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf proposes. Please simply tell me whether you accept Amendment No 27 or not. Then we will be in agreement.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">McCartin </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr President, when Mr Andriessen became a Commissioner which was many years ago, I was already a Member of Parliament. I said to him that the big challenge before him was to make European agriculture competitive. Since that day there has been no talk about making European agriculture competitive, but I want to thank Mr Fischler for continuing with that theme and at least putting forward the aspiration that European agriculture can take its place in the world and take its share of world markets.</p>
<p class="contents">With the world population increasing by 80 million per year, it ought not to be all doom and gloom. We ought to plan and lay out some sort of strategy by which we can play our part in supplying this market. It was extraordinary to read this morning that Argentina is importing beef at the moment. That is an area of the world which we had thought was a great competitor and a threat. Because of the climatic situation Australia is able to supply them with beef. It gives us some reason to believe that things do not always remain exactly as they are. When the MacSharry reform came in we proposed reducing production and increasing importation of food. Today we propose taking a bigger share of world markets. I welcome that.</p>
<p class="contents">I was a bit disappointed that the President‐in‐Office of Council talked more about animal welfare, environmental considerations and consumer protection than about the livelihood of farmers. While I accept the point he made on those matters, we cannot consider those ideas in isolation from the need to provide farmers with an adequate income. Farmers may complain about the common agricultural policy, but without it we would have a worse situation in Europe. So I would be seriously concerned about any effort to shift the cost or the policymaking of the common agricultural policy back to Member States. Under no circumstances can we permit this to happen. There are so many different countries and climates in the EU and the common agricultural policy has saved us from the tensions that would have arisen in recent years with the great reduction in the number of people on the land. We have a policy that works. Farmers suffer from it at the moment but our best hope is to carry out the necessary readjustments and keep it a common agricultural policy for all Europeans which contains all three elements – financial solidarity in particular.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ebner </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President‐in‐Office, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to concentrate mainly on two areas: milk and beef. With regard to milk and the report by Mr Goepel, which in itself I would like to support fully, I regret that some of the amendments did not meet with approval in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Examples include the important alternative proposals concerning price support and income support for milk producers, particularly in the disadvantaged mountain areas. These must be given greater consideration and distortions of competition must be avoided or offset.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also essential to introduce measures to promote the consumption of milk and milk products, and the necessary funds must be provided for marketing. I would advocate that the individual reference quantity for milk be divided by the number that corresponds to the average milk yield of the region. This would be a fairer method for the mountain areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in my opinion the Member States should be paid in accordance with objective criteria, taking particular account of their respective production structures, especially in the mountain areas, so that they are not so dependent on variations in the market. Fourthly, I also consider publicly‐financed transportation aid to be absolutely necessary and indispensable. As far as the beef situation is concerned, greater consideration should be given to the disadvantaged areas, for example in terms of eligibility for premiums.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, young farmers should receive further additional financial support. Action needs to be taken in this regard, as Commissioner Fischler said earlier today. I hope that the Commission, in particular the very skilled and able Commissioner Fischler, who comes from a mountain area and knows the situation extremely well, and the Council will give my objections the appropriate consideration.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Funke, </span>  <span class="italic">President‐in‐Office of the Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you can imagine, it was very interesting for me to attend this debate, to listen to and digest the various speeches as best I could, this morning and this afternoon, and of course to take this with me to the debate we will be having on this subject in the Agriculture Council. I already indicated in my introductory speech this morning that I place great importance on hearing your opinions and taking part in discussions with you. I am also of the opinion that what you say and think must carry weight in the discussions in Council. So I thank you for your contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to look at a number of points that were raised, without dwelling on them too long, particularly as some of them were addressed to me. Perhaps I might begin by saying that when I compare the various speeches the overall effect seems to me to be equivalent to squaring the circle – to quote Mrs Keppelhoff‐Wiechert – as is so often the case when the subject of farming is discussed anywhere out in the countryside. Farmers are required to provide high‐quality foodstuffs and use environmentally friendly production methods; at the same time, they are supposed to preserve the agricultural landscape, just on the side, and in addition they are supposed to do all of this economically, preferably at what we call world market prices.</p>
<p class="contents">Put in these terms, this is already equivalent to squaring the circle. Nonetheless, we must put it in these terms, as no other terms are possible in pluralistic societies. When considering compensatory payments, which I believe we were this morning and this afternoon, we are told by some that these should be as fair as possible and should take the respective structures into account. I understand and accept all of that. Yet at the same time calls are made – sometimes in the same speech, but at most two or three speeches later – for these to be implemented as simply and with as little bureaucracy as possible. Again, this seems to me to be like squaring the circle, if I am judging it correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to begin by making a point concerning a speech that came towards the end. I believe it was Mr McCartin who said to me that I had talked about animal welfare and environmental considerations but not the issue of competitiveness. Mr McCartin, this morning I was in an excellent position; I had been asked not to improvise because the text of my speech had been given to the interpreters, so I kept to the text. I do not usually do this, I will freely admit, but I can therefore say quite amicably and in all modesty that I know exactly what I said and what requests I made. I quote: ‘Future European agriculture must be competitive in order to hold its ground against international competition."</p>
<p class="contents">I admit that it is possible, of course, not to hear a sentence like that. But because it is such a crucial one, I would like to quote it here once again to show that it was not the case that I completely neglected this aspect of agriculture. It would have been terrible, had I done so.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add the following. We have often been called upon to tell farmers the truth, so in my view we need to make one thing clear over and over again: if we reduce European agriculture – however it may be defined – solely to supplying raw materials for the European market, it will fail. We have a wealthy internal market, with 80 million inhabitants in Germany alone. In total, if we include the applicant countries, we will have a large number of consumers throughout Europe who can mobilise enormous purchasing power.</p>
<p class="contents">When reference is made to the purchasing power of the European internal market – especially when the other countries join – I must on the other hand continually point out that we have a degree of saturation in Europe and even surpluses, at least in some areas of agricultural production. How can we hope to develop an image of the future face of European agriculture if we do not recognise that we must also conquer markets outside Europe? I do not want to expand on this now, but to my mind this has to be part of European agriculture. I want to make it very clear that European agriculture cannot function otherwise.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, if European agriculture produces under very specific requirements – whether crop or livestock production – because society demands it, but the agricultural systems in other competing countries do not do so because their societies react differently to certain production conditions, then both compensatory payments and a minimum level of protection from foreign competitors must be guaranteed. This is part and parcel of the fair trade conditions that we want to see, and it is a crucial point. It also concerns the WTO, which you mentioned, Mr Sturdy. Of course we must also look at this in detail, including in the debates on that specific issue. In any case, Mr Sturdy, I agree with what you said.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the Commission proposals, the question arose – or rather I was asked very specifically, by Mrs Anttila, I believe – as to how I, as President of the Council, proposed to prevent farmers from going bankrupt as a result of the price reductions. Here I must say something about our concept of politics in general. To believe or claim that politics can prevent bankruptcies – by means of any instrument, action or basic conditions – is an assumption that I would warn against.</p>
<p class="contents">Politics will never be capable of this under any conditions. At best we can ask whether, with a view of the proposed solutions, the basic competition conditions are fair or not. We must discuss whether this makes sense for the future of agriculture. But it does not relieve farmers of the business decision; it does not relieve me, as a manager, of the responsibility of taking the necessary decisions in my company to ensure its long‐term existence in the light of the current conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">But we should not ask too much of politics. Indeed, it seems to me that in the past we perhaps too often gave the impression that politics was capable of such things. Perhaps we should no longer give this impression in future. I therefore very much agree that we need reliable basic conditions, that we need to be competitive. I also agree with the view that we must be careful with our money.</p>
<p class="contents">Another element of this squaring of the circle is that, on the one hand, we rightly require agriculture to provide a livelihood for as many people as possible, but on the other hand we must constantly explain to the non‐farming population, and also to the farmers themselves, that the total sum spent on agriculture is not a small one, when we take into account the European budget, the national budgets and part of the regional budgets in federal Member States. Nonetheless, we have a correspondingly high drop‐out rate in farms, and we have not managed to satisfy the farming population either.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a discussion needs to go into more detail in certain areas. This seems to me to be particularly important. Perhaps it is true that we spend a great deal of money, but we do not spend it in such a way that it benefits the people working on the farms. That is putting it very simply, but it is certainly worth thinking about. It is a point some speakers mentioned, and although I do not want to go into detail because of time constraints, it is certainly a point worth noting. Yet the call for greater extensification, increased environmental protection, a move away from purely economic considerations, and at the same time reduced expenditure – and such a call was made, if only indirectly, unless I misunderstood – is again asking us to square the circle. It is important that we realise this is impossible. It is easy to talk about whether to pursue greater extensification or increased environmental protection, but we must realise that it costs money, either because local requirements make compensatory payments necessary or because the environmental protection is organised as part of an agreement; it could be either. One will mean more for one person, the other will mean more for another, but either way it will cost public money. That is an aspect that must not be forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe I have covered the main points that were put to me. Perhaps I placed too much emphasis on certain points, as I am new to this, but that should help you to get to know my point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the view that we should perhaps nationalise the financing of the agricultural policy, which means that we would only receive money from Europe if we had organised national funds in advance or were obliged to organise these funds subsequently, forgive me for saying so, but I think that would be the end of a Community agricultural policy. For this reason I have great doubts as to whether we should choose this path.</p>

The Minister did not give me any information on this subject and he did not answer me, but I asked him if the German Presidency had changed from its traditional position. This question is very relevant, politically speaking, and I would therefore ask and insist that I am given an answer.</p>

I just emphasised in my reply that in my opinion it is of course very important, and indeed it is part of the reason we need agricultural reform, to ask whether the money we spend on agriculture – at European, national and, in federal Member States, regional level – is always spent in such a way, because of the way the system is organised, that it really benefits those on the farms.</p>
<p class="contents">To my mind this is not really a question of the level of funds provided, but a question of distribution. I want to place particular emphasis on this point. We say that for an indefinite period we will allocate 45 %, or, according to some, 50 % – I do not want to argue this point – of the European budget to agriculture, and at the same time we see that agricultural income is going down, not up, at least in some areas of agricultural production. Surely we have to ask ourselves what we think we are doing? We cannot simply accept it and say that the more money we have, the happier everyone is.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we would all, in particular the landowners, be well advised to get involved in this discussion. I do not know what the Foreign Minister said on this point, but if he thinks, as I understand it, that we can reduce expenditure without saying how and in what area it is to be done, then I would be inclined to say that just as I would come to an agreement with the Foreign Minister before expressing an opinion on foreign affairs, so should the Foreign Minister come to an agreement with the Minister for Agriculture before expressing an opinion on agricultural issues. But I do not know what he said on this issue so I cannot comment. I would like to discuss this with him.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to say something that should give cause for thought. I do not have sufficient information to speak for the other Member States of the European Union, but I can speak for Germany and for its Länder: it makes almost no difference – please note that I say ‘almost" – what instruments we use in agricultural policy or what we focus on, we have had an average drop‐out rate of 3 % in farming in the last 50 years since the end of the war. Note: the last 50 years. This drop‐out rate corresponds exactly to the increase in agricultural productivity. Scientists have looked into this and the answers are quite clear. I cannot be quite so clear cut, but I wonder whether we are not going to have to realise that the increase in productivity levels is undoubtedly going to mean structural changes in agriculture, with farms being abandoned, as long as economics is the basis of agricultural policy, I might add. For me it would be inconceivable not to have economics as the basis of agricultural policy. The result would be a great waste of resources if this were not the case. But perhaps we should also discuss this more in public than we have done in the past.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fischler, </span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank all those who contributed to this debate. In my opinion it was very constructive and set an excellent example, as I hope the public will note.</p>
<p class="contents">On the many questions concerning specific amendments, I will repeat what I said this morning, which was that I am prepared to distribute a list clarifying which amendments the Commission considers acceptable. I also realise that I promised to be brief in my final speech, and I would like to keep to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Funke has just given a very clear explanation of what is important in relation to the competitiveness of European agriculture. European agriculture must be competitive in two ways. Firstly, our products must be competitive, and they can only be competitive if we pay greater attention to quality that we have hitherto, if we realise and act upon our consumers" new appreciation for quality, and above all if we take into account the strength of European agriculture, which, as we know, lies in using agricultural raw materials to produce high‐quality end products.</p>
<p class="contents">However, competitiveness in European agriculture also means that services other than the production of agricultural products must be accorded economic value and must be integrated into our market economy system.</p>
<p class="contents">A great deal has been said about the extent to which agricultural policy must also be social policy. We must be realistic here. Agricultural policy should have a social dimension but should not be purely social policy. That would really be a mistake. The question here is surely how we are in future to achieve a reasonable ratio, so that we do not have an imbalance like the present famous 80: 20.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to environmental policy, I would like to remind you once again of the principle on which we in the Commission based our considerations. The issue is not the importance of the environment within the common agricultural policy but the fact that in future we want to emphasise that compensatory payments, as we currently call them, must be linked to the environment. For us it is essential that all farmers who receive public funds from the Community budget at least observe the principles of good farming practice. We must certainly discuss the definition further in terms of production system, climatic region and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we also consider it essential that other services that go beyond this are compensated separately, but these services must be voluntary. We do not want to introduce a command economy in Europe by the back door.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the issue of financing. The Commission has not made any proposals concerning cofinancing, as was suggested several times. It merely described, in the context of its report on own resources, possible ways of achieving a better balance between the contributions of the individual Member States. In our view, it is now primarily up to the Member States themselves to say which of these financing models they would favour. I therefore believe that we firstly need the basics to be clarified before any political agreement can be set out in the relevant legal texts.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, however, as you know, there are also other considerations such as stabilisation models that are very much worthy of examination. We are prepared to look into them. But one point must be clear: regardless of which model we use, we will not be in a position to bring about an agreement between the Member States if we do not have the necessary financing to compensate for changes in pricing policy. As the saying goes, money makes the world go round. We really must make available the funding that is needed and that is recognised as being needed, otherwise we will not achieve proper reform.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you of one further point: do not forget that with regard to payment for services that will in future be part of rural development, cofinancing has already been agreed and is planned to continue. This means that the more we push forward rural development and the more importance we attach to payment for environmental services and similar, the more likely it is that cofinancing will become automatic, but in a form that does not allow cohesion to fall by the wayside.</p>
