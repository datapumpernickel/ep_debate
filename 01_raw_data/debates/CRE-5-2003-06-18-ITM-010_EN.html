<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wijkman (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, no country has been able to reduce poverty without a significant increase in energy use. Access to modern energy varies considerably, however. More than two billion people in the world do not have access to electricity or fuels and are reduced to using firewood and animal droppings for their energy needs.</p>
<p class="contents">To mention just a few examples: cooking with poorly vented stoves has a significant impact upon health; hundreds of millions of women and children spend several hours a day gathering firewood for household needs; lack of electricity means inadequate lighting, limited communications and no access to refrigeration and to a host of labour-saving devices and income-generating opportunities. Modern energy services for these poor countries are therefore a crucial prerequisite for its being possible to eradicate poverty in these countries and for the latter being able to achieve what are termed the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
<p class="contents">Most current forms of energy create environmental problems at local, regional and international levels that threaten both the present and future generations’ health and prosperity. To find new ways of increasing energy services for the poor, at the same time as taking increased account of the environmental effects of energy use is one of our most important challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the primary significance of the energy supply for development and growth, energy issues have, in general, been missing from the international development agenda and from the work done to combat poverty. For example, energy projects have accounted for less than 5% of EU aid since 1990.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year in Johannesburg, something of a breakthrough occurred, and both energy initiatives launched by the Commission are more than welcome. Both the statement we are debating today and the EU’s energy initiatives in Johannesburg underline the crucial importance of energy in the fight against poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">A proper model is provided in terms of the general trend of the measures proposed, that is to say support for capacity-building, reform of the energy sector, management of the demand side, diversification of supply and the development of suitable regulations, financial mechanisms and public-private partnerships.</p>
<p class="contents">Both initiatives suffer, however, from a number of limitations and shortcomings. In view of the huge challenges ahead, the proposals are not ambitious enough. No new financial resources are proposed. No doubt, the majority of the investments on the energy side will have to come from private sources, but there is also a tremendous need for resources in terms of aid. Otherwise, there is little hope of reaching the poor in rural areas. Moreover, the necessary transition to renewable energy and more efficient energy use can only happen with the help of specific financial support to help cover the higher up-front investments. We therefore propose in this report that a special Sustainable Energy Fund be set up, rather as the Commission has now set up a fund, worth EUR 1 billion, for efforts in the area of water.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem is that no clear distinction is made between the requirements in terms of policy development and investments, on the one hand at village level and on the other hand in the modern sector. The village level needs to be clearly specified and prioritised.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the oil imported by developing countries is used for transportation. The Commission’s statement makes hardly any reference to the transport sector. There are examples – especially from Latin America in the form, for example, of the ethanol program in Brazil – of how, through practical efforts, it is in actual fact possible to bring about environmentally friendly development in the transport area.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not have time to discuss further specific proposals and comments. I just want to sum up by saying that the Commission’s proposals are, by and large, encouraging. If they are to be more than empty words, significant resources must, however, be contributed in order to stimulate investments in new and environmentally friendly technology – investments that are often rather expensive initially but that are cheaper over the projects’ total life-cycle. Moreover, efforts at village level, where the majority of the poor live, must be clearly prioritised. It is there that the need for resources in terms of aid is at its greatest.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Parliament will support my report and that the Commission will bear in mind our amendments, above all those concerning the demand for significantly increased financial resources. We must ensure that these sound proposals are more than just empty rhetoric. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unless the energy dimension, and those of development and the environment are addressed appropriately at the same time we will really make very little progress. Furthermore, however, I wish to say that unless we address the issue of energy in developing countries, not only will those countries fail to develop properly; we will also be unable to confront problems such as combating climate change in a responsible and effective way.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason I wish to express my thanks to Mr Wijkman, who is rapporteur for the report we are discussing today. Mr Wijkman’s combination of knowledge and persistence has resulted in a document that provides a useful contribution and boost to the work we still have to do to implement the Johannesburg conclusions in particular, on which we are working in the Commission and specifically in the Directorate-General for Energy.</p>
<p class="contents">I have chosen to interpret the report as support for the proposal made in the Commission Communication and I have no problem with the amendments Mr Wijkman tabled last week.</p>
<p class="contents">When the Directorate-General for Energy and Transport began preparing a document such as this, energy was not on the Johannesburg agenda. We started working on energy and development cooperation before energy appeared on the Johannesburg agenda. Energy then became the hot issue, or one of the hot issues, on the Johannesburg agenda, but we in the Directorate-General for Energy and Transport had already been working on it and I must say that I personally pushed for this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be made very clear: energy and water constitute life itself. Without water and energy, not only can there be no development, even survival is impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I wish to make a few observations on the substance of the report, which I believe might be constructive and could smooth the way for future cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the specific proposals that have been made will need more detailed examination to ensure that coherence is maintained with the overall aim of development cooperation, in other words, eradicating poverty, combined with boosting a form of energy development that is balanced and sustainable.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution correctly notes that the Commission has been very modest in suggesting special and reserved funding for energy investment in developing countries. We are not overlooking the importance of funding; we are convinced, however, that funding must be based on demand. This is a key aspect of the European Union’s energy policy for eradicating poverty and for achieving sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Only if and when our cooperation partners define developing their energy sector and make this a priority will the money begin to flow. What we can do and what we will do is talk to the developing countries, with whom we are already working, to ensure that this happens. In this context of cooperation I can give the commitment that – together with my colleague, Commissioner Nielson – we shall do everything possible to ensure that the expectations we all share are not disappointed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wijkman is quite right to propose that we must at least ensure that unused funds are channelled into useful energy projects instead of remaining unused. I fully share these positions. I also wish to say that the energy chapter is indeed still one of the least-present elements in cooperation and assistance for poverty eradication and for the development of the poorest countries. Nevertheless, I believe it is absolutely crucial – and I say this once again – that we are able to give it a boost.</p>
<p class="contents">Energy has a role in education. Energy is involved in access to some of the new technologies that we must help to disseminate in those countries, precisely in order to prevent a worsening of today’s poverty, which can be expressed simply as the difference in wealth between the developed and developing countries. There is a new divide in relation to the new technologies, which we in the developed countries have and enjoy and to which the developing countries, unfortunately, still do not have access.</p>
<p class="contents">Here again, energy has a role to play and hence the importance of having presented this first Communication. This is the first, but not the last. I can inform you, ladies and gentlemen, that a new one is being prepared. The only difference is that, when the time comes, we will be able to present it with the backing of the conclusions obtained in Johannesburg and of the awareness-raising that has been carried out since then.</p>

An important report has been developed and improved insofar as development cooperation has been updated and extended to a domain that tended until recently to be governed by free market principles.</p>
<p class="contents">From the global perspective in which the Group of the Party of European Socialists approaches the notions of development and cooperation, energy should be seen as a cross-cutting issue in cooperation actions. This is because it is a key aspect of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">The energy currently used in both developing and industrialised countries is polluting and environmentally destructive. Substantial resources will be needed to remedy the situation, however. The renewable and alternative sources of energy we advocate are expensive. The Commission must make available the resources required to finance access to renewable energies for developing countries. It would then be possible to integrate the environmental dimension into the development process, and it would not remain a pious declaration of intent.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Wijkman stated earlier this evening, energy accounts for less than 5% of Community development aid. Public sector involvement in the energy sector is called for. I should emphasise that public investment is also needed, without prejudice to the involvement of private companies in the production and distribution of energy. Access to the latter should be guaranteed by the public sector as an essential service.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, we cannot endorse the Commission’s decision that priority should be given to promotion of the privatisation of the sector. It should be complementary to public action. Private exploitation of energy sources does not help to alleviate poverty. There are some appalling poverty indicators for African countries that export energy resources such as fossil fuels exploited by private companies. Very often these companies are European. It should be stated that these populations do not have access to electricity, lighting or water. They do not benefit from other more sophisticated uses of energy either. Financial support is therefore needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission itself does actually recognise the link between poverty, environmental degradation and energy. The Commissioner referred to this today. Nonetheless, the Commission fails to make bold environmentally-sustainable proposals. We therefore welcome this initiative to work together with developing countries regarding energy. Nonetheless, we regret the lack of a crash programme with additional funding and a proposal that would serve as a legal basis for the action required on this important issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Johannesburg Summit rightly affirmed that access to energy for the poor has become a priority, since it is so very true that the populations’ vital needs in this respect are far from being satisfied and the trend is still away from equality; the main reason for this is the developed countries’ fossil fuel consumption, in particular US consumption, which is excessive and very much out of proportion to that of the developing countries. Life expectancy and development are closely linked to access to energy, to the point that many see it as a real basic human right. That right must be recognised, guaranteed and protected. How can we contribute to the existence and development of an efficient energy sector in the developing countries without policies that encourage close cooperation for the exchange of know-how, the primary objective being to meet the vital needs of the populations? The need for finance is evident. The creation of a Sustainable Energy Fund and much more consistent participation by the European Union could be a first response. In particular, as the report rightly says, the existence of a strong public sector in the energy sector is particularly important in the first phase of development.</p>
<p class="contents">More than that, as the majority of the Committee on Development and Cooperation has said, I remain convinced that the Commission’s options for privatisation of the energy sector are more than dangerous. The Commission’s role is not to promote privatisation in the developing countries. The exploitation and distribution of primary energy, which is essential for development, must be handled by public or private companies committed to public service and general interest goals. Such public control is all the more vital because the trans-national corporations that operate in the developing countries are all too often concerned only with short-term profitability, to the detriment of the needs of the local populations and at the risk of plundering their energy resources. Effective machinery must be deployed to monitor the activities of European undertakings in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">I also support the call on the Commission to review deregulation of the energy sector from a human development perspective and to work towards international trade norms which abide by human rights and peoples' rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, seeing that next September’s WTO Summit in Cancun is not far away, we must refuse to allow the energy sector to be included in the general agreement on trade in services, which would make energy a commodity like any other. The aim of universal access to energy in the service of development will not be achieved by following a model imposed by the liberal thinking of multilateral bodies like the WTO, but by expanding and guaranteeing the public service to meet the needs of the populations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have to say that we do not seem to have read the same document. The two speakers appear to have read a different Commission document from the one I am familiar with. I find this surprising, because nowhere in the Commission’s document does it state that the Commission advocates the privatisation of energy services in developing countries. That is another kettle of fish altogether. Please remember that, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p class="contents">True, we have proposed privatisation. Actually, it was liberalisation, not privatisation, and the two are quite different. Further, the proposal was made in the context of energy systems in the integrated European market. None of this has anything to do, however, with what you attributed to a text but does not actually appear in that text. Ladies and gentlemen, I challenge you to tell me on which page we advocated privatising energy systems in developing countries. Give me the page reference please, ladies and gentlemen. When you come up with the number of the page where we allegedly made that statement, I might be moved to recognise it does not make sense. I can however assure you here and now that it makes no sense whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are today concerned with the millions upon millions of human beings the world over who do not have electricity and are therefore deprived of a whole range of opportunities for their personal development, training and access to technology. These people cannot take advantage of all the opportunities modern society has to offer. I put it to you that there is no time to waste discussing what does not appear in the document presented to the House. We should focus instead on genuine issues of substance. Please do not confuse a debate concerning regulation of energy markets within the European Union with support for development and the role of energy in promoting development in developing countries. These are two quite different issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Money may be private or public. What is actually needed however are funds and resources. I should point out to the House that in the majority of those countries, the most serious problem is the corruption rife amongst the ruling elite, that is, in the public sector. Such then is the nature of the public sector in those countries. So, we would do well to deal sensibly with the issues in hand. I urge you to refrain from commenting on what does not appear in the text, and not to confuse documents. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It may be due to the late hour or to the fact that she is aware more funds are to be invested to see through the crash programme I referred to.</p>
<p class="contents">I am certainly prepared to have a calmer discussion with the Commissioner. What I actually said was that I believe it is all well and good to resort to private funds, but public funds must be invested also, and that the Commission is prioritising private funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not of course have any intention of going through the text article by article and line by line. I am however delighted to learn that the Commissioner is prepared to invest public funds and Union funds to help these developing countries. Of course I am aware that there are many corrupt governments in Africa and indeed elsewhere. What the people of those countries do not need, however, is for European companies to exploit their energy resources. Instead, Europe should support the public services to ensure those populations do have access to electricity and water. Both are central to the quality of life, and I was delighted to hear the Commissioner acknowledge this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First to thank the Commissioner because I think holding debates in which ideas can contend is the way to make progress. That is what happened in the Committee on Development and Cooperation. Not everyone was in agreement with all the points in the report, but that does not prevent me from wanting the debate to continue, because it must exist. I mentioned just now the general agreement on trade in services, for example. The debate on this subject is public, it exists. I want it to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mrs Sauquillo, I also want to thank the Commissioner for what she said about the Commission’s commitment to greater funding. The needs are in fact so great I think we can agree together to be generous in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is important is that there be regulations in each country ensuring that people with small incomes have access to energy, that is to say that we have sound regulations in this area.
