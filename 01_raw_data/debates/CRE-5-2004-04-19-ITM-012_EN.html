<p class="contents">A first-reading agreement on what is termed a 'linking' directive will have been reached within a mere 10 months, confirming the European Union's strong continuing commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and its flexible mechanisms. A first-reading agreement reaffirms the high priority that the European Union gives to taking concrete action to tackle climate change. It will provide an important signal to our partners, in particular developing countries and economies in transition, including Russia, of our continuing support for the Kyoto Protocol and our firm intention to tackle climate change multilaterally. It will assist our partners in their sustainable development through the transfer of environmentally sound technologies and know-how.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise package before Parliament will give an important boost to the Kyoto Protocol and its project mechanisms: Joint Implementation and the Clean Development Mechanism. It will create a demand for credits from JI and CDM projects by allowing around 12 000 companies across Europe to use Joint Implementation and Clean Development Mechanism credits for compliance with their obligations under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. By doing so it will enhance the cost-efficiency of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme in a way that also benefits developing countries and economies in transition.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to emphasise that the agreement being discussed today is fully consistent with the Kyoto Protocol's implementing provisions, which are usually referred to as the Marrakech Accords. As you know, the Kyoto Protocol contains no provisions on how companies can use JI and CDM credits. This directive now clarifies how this will be implemented by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise package before you is very delicately balanced. It addresses Parliament's concerns by providing a careful balance between the quality and quantity of the Joint Implementation and Clean Development Mechanism credits to be used in the EU trading scheme while at the same time keeping it robust and simple.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would now ask you to support this compromise package and, in doing so, take another determined step in strengthening the European Union's response to the challenge of climate change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am indebted to them for the unanimity and support. I would thank the Irish Presidency for its constructive way of negotiating. I also wish to thank the Commission, which has cooperated well, although it is not formally obliged to do so. I am also indebted to Commissioner Wallström. We have reached an agreement at first reading. I will list nine points. In my view, the result is sound.</p>
<p class="contents">Point 1: this linking directive enters into effect as soon as 2005. Companies can start now; they are given legal certainty now.</p>
<p class="contents">Point 2: this linking directive is independent of the coming into force of the Kyoto Protocol, as is the law on emission trading. For us in Europe, Kyoto is starting to take effect now. We will not wait until Russia ratifies Kyoto. One hundred and twenty countries, two-thirds of the world population, have already ratified Kyoto.</p>
<p class="contents">Point 3: energy companies and large firms can now earn emission allowance by investing in the switch from Chinese coal-fired power stations to gas, in making coal-fired power stations more effective, in solar power stations in Indonesia, in wind farms on the coastlines of developing countries or in retrieving spent gas from rubbish tips. There are many more possible ways to reduce CO2 and other greenhouse gases.</p>
<p class="contents">Point 4: we have followed the Kyoto Protocol in deciding that the construction of nuclear power stations is not permitted.</p>
<p class="contents">Point 5: carbon sinks are out of the question because – or so this House sees it – growing trees are only an interim solution. Trees fall over or burn down. Even if trees die a natural death, they expel all the carbon absorbed. Biomass or bio-fuels, however, are very much an option. Governments can also gain experience with sinks.</p>
<p class="contents">Point 6: large hydro-electric power stations are only possible if the criteria of the World Commission on Dams are observed. Although hydropower actually helps in the fight against climate change, ecological and social criteria should also be taken into consideration. On this score too, we are stricter than the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">Point 7: the agreement that the Member States have to make half of their Kyoto efforts in their own countries and half abroad, has been re-confirmed. Agreements only to commit industry to the ceiling make no sense, because this leads to governments, at least some governments, making 50% of their investments abroad, with industry making a further 25% of the countries' investments abroad. Ultimately, only 25% will be invested at home and 75% abroad. By acting in this way, we would put our ecological credibility on the line.</p>
<p class="contents">Point 8: outside Europe, there is a great deal of interest in our system of emission trading and in this linking directive. Fifteen states in the United States and four provinces in Australia intend to set up comparable emission trading systems. The Commission will be examining whether they can plug into our European system. The same applies to Canada and, hopefully in future, also to Japan. In that way, a start is being made on the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol before it enters into effect officially.</p>
<p class="contents">Point 9: we will need to extend the scope of the emission trading system to include aviation and subsequently also road transport. This is preferable to opting in favour of domestic Joint Implementation Projects, as is being suggested by some.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the French Government and French industry have no faith in this linking directive. Neither has Greenpeace. This is old-fashioned dogmatism. I am pleased that all political groups, the Council of Ministers and the Commission have more insight and are prepared to support this compromise. Climate change is deteriorating by the day; we must act in unison. For climate change, it makes no difference where the greenhouse gas is produced. Armed with this linking directive, we will now enter upon the worldwide struggle to solve the climate issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to concentrate on just one thing, namely sinks. I disagree on this point. I have just returned from a trip to South America as part of an official delegation. Surprisingly enough, they have been looking very closely at this Linking Directive, at any rate in some of the ministries, and I was repeatedly told how important it is for them that sinks, in other words forestry, should be included. I can see why. If we included forestry, it would be an extraordinarily great help not least in fighting poverty in those countries, or in creating alternatives to drugs in places where they are cultivated.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention that just under a year ago France concluded an agreement with Colombia which did include forestry; there is therefore a conflict between Parliament and the Council of Ministers that we will not survive in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These sectors were to become involved in the struggle to reduce emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere. This represented a complex first step that was only taken recently. It was certainly necessary if the European Union is to make progress towards meeting its commitments on climate change. It is true, however, that a climate of fear and misgiving developed with regard to practical implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the changes contained in this linking directive are so significant. The present linking directive allows the implementation of clean development projects. It also provides for the recognition of emission reduction certificates. The linking directive sends out an important political signal from the European Union to the developing countries, indicating that, by way of these projects, developing countries are likely to obtain far more substantial aid than they probably do at present for environmentally friendly development. A message is also being sent to the sectors concerned making it clear that the European Union really does intend to implement the means to facilitate involvement in trading in emissions rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe Mr de Roo, the rapporteur, fully appreciated the need to ensure the linking directive was very flexible. He therefore worked admirably with all the political groups. In addition, he conducted excellent negotiations with the Council. I trust all this will bear fruit tomorrow and that a majority of the House will vote in favour at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, it seems some opportunities were not seized or perceived as such. Further, some of the progress has been too faltering. Consequently, the flexible mechanism is not as flexible as it ought to be. The rapporteur is aware of this, as we have discussed it together.</p>
<p class="contents">I have in mind firstly domestic or national projects, implementation of which has been restricted to rail networks. I feel it could have been possible to accept a far wider range of situations without detriment to the spirit of this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I also feel excessive caution was exercised when deliberating on the admissibility and implementation of hydro-electric projects. I believe such projects are needed in these countries, and that they are adequately provided for in the Marrakesh agreements. Further, I agree with Mr Linkohr that sinks are called for in these countries too, and that excessive caution has been exercised in this regard also.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, there are some very positive developments worthy of note. One of these is the solution of the problem of supplementarity. I could also mention the capacity of the Member States to organise themselves, share common objectives and determine the best mix of appropriate policies in order to achieve them.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this is an excellent result, and would like to congratulate the rapporteur once again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is absolutely essential to ensure the workability of the emissions trading system when it starts in January 2005. I want to congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has done. I have seen a lot of rapporteurs and he really has done a very good job. He has secured an agreement with the Council which is a practical compromise and which will reap considerable environmental rewards whilst providing for industry a great deal more certainty than the original proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy that we have been able to retain the cap on the number of credits issued. It is a sensible solution allowing Member States to monitor and control the market and make sure it is not flooded. On specific issues, I believe we have been able to persuade the Council of the need for greater reflection on whether to include domestic projects. The guidelines we have laid down there are useful.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards 'sinks' I feel we have the best possible deal: a prohibition on companies using credits from land-use projects and carbon forest sinks until at least 2008. We will find this is a very difficult thing to calculate and we need time to look at it more closely.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning big hydro and nuclear projects, it seems disappointing if we wanted the allowances for such projects excluded permanently from the scheme, but in reality Parliament has been able to ensure that the projects and the take-up within the European scheme are at least in line with Kyoto and the World Commission on Dams and the Marrakech Accords. It is not really a bad result.</p>
<p class="contents">Our message to EU governments is clear: real, environmental improvement through emissions reductions must be brought about by long-term, sustainable effort at home and not by cheap, ill-advised and potentially detrimental projects in the poorer countries. Member States: we will be watching you! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some Members may vote against it when the time comes, but they will probably come from amongst those who tend to put the interests of industry before those of the environment. I am not really sure whether WWF counts them amongst its friends.</p>
<p class="contents">I took a certain malevolent delight, especially with the election approaching, in our Green rapporteur having been denounced by Greenpeace for his work, but personally I congratulate him. He has done a great job in keeping all sides of this House together. Of course the agreement is weak, but we have to start somewhere. The reality is that we know there was resistance, even amongst some Member States, towards the implementation of these measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that the EU is still trying to lead the world on the whole issue of climate change. However, the real issue is, firstly, that we have to get some sort of agreement up and running and, secondly, that we have to move forward. I am concerned about what will happen if the Kyoto Protocol does not come into force. That is the key question that the Commissioner is seeking to address this week with colleagues. Can we persuade Russia – the crucial element in the equation – to sign up to the Kyoto Protocol and bring it into force? I do not like having to give in to ransom demands. However, for once, it might be a price worth paying. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That was not easy, because the agreements that had already been reached in a number of countries with industry to reduce greenhouse gases had to be incorporated in European policy. Today, or in actual fact, tomorrow after the vote, what I see as a fresh agreement will have been reached and new arrangements will be in place by means of which emission trading will be extended to include third countries. I am proud that we, the European Union, have demonstrated that we are serious about Kyoto and that we not only conclude agreements but also live by them.</p>
<p class="contents">We, in Europe, have adopted defensive policy in the environmental field for too long. With the new CDM – Clean Development Mechanism – instrument and joint implementation, we can once again take the lead on the world stage. Thanks to the development and export of clean technology, we are creating a new market for cleaner production processes. Our European industry stands to benefit from this. However, I expect the transfer of environmentally-friendly techniques also to help developing countries to introduce sustainability and it will also bring them more prosperity. The exchange projects that can now be implemented with the developed countries or with countries in the process of moving towards a market economy, expand the market on which emission is being traded and thus reduce the costs per reduced tonne of greenhouse gas – a high environmental yield at the lowest possible costs.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and also in discussions involving the rapporteur, much has been said about the risks which placing the reductions outside of one’s own Member State can entail. Since we have now agreed at European level that joint implementation and CDM are all too supplementary, we have to settle for the review that has been arranged.</p>
<p class="contents">What matters now is that industry takes what is now available. Mr de Roo has done his level best, on which I should like to congratulate him warmly. He has made sound negotiations possible, for which I should like to thank him. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the Moreira da Silva report, Parliament proposed introducing an upper limit, a cap, for the national allocation plan, and we wanted every country’s national allocation plans to set the same limits. Unfortunately, the Council rejected the amendment at the time. That is one of the reasons why we are now faced with a situation where we have a hotchpotch of national allocation plans which are not really compatible with each other. Many Member States had still not notified a plan by 31 March at all, and some have submitted plans that are far from ambitious. I would like to expressly support you, Commissioner Wallström, in your commitment to encourage the Member States to implement the spirit and content of this directive, and if necessary bring proceedings before the European Court of Justice to oblige them to do so. Even though Parliament’s amendment was not adopted verbatim, the requirements of Annex III do not in fact allow industry to be granted generous increases in emissions. It is therefore very important that you keep your eyes open here. We have also written a letter to that effect to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot allow industry in those Member States that are relatively ambitious to suffer because a few Member States continue to believe they need not do anything at all; something must also be done at home, important as Joint Implementation and the Clean Development Mechanism are.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the de Roo report. I believe the de Roo report is an important step forward in international climate policy. We are strengthening the Kyoto process and we have also shown that there are certain limits here. Unlike Mr Linkohr, however, I believe we were right to stick to the position of not including sinks. You are almost always right, Mr Linkohr, but I believe you have miscalculated here, even if you are a physicist. In emissions trading itself we have an emission factor of zero for biomass, which means you do not need certificates at all if you burn biomass. Biomass burning gains a great deal from that. If we now also pay money for planting trees, we have deceived ourselves and are not protecting the climate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will pose a challenge to humanity for generations to come.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the European Union should continue to show leadership on this issue. We should continue to demonstrate that we are willing to take action at home and internationally, that we believe that a truly global problem also requires a global solution. We will also have to be cost-efficient. To be credible, we will have to look at the most cost-efficient solutions; this is part of that process, and in doing so we will be able to mobilise all the various groups of stakeholders. This will help us to do so. My thanks for this again go both to the rapporteur and to the whole European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment on two points mentioned during the debate. First of all, Russia. As has been mentioned, a team of Commissioners will be going to Russia later this week in order to discuss a number of issues, including many areas of cooperation with Russia. We should not wait for Russia – that is true – but the 120 countries that have ratified are not waiting; they are actually carrying out actions on the issue of climate change already. However, we should of course keep up the pressure on Russia and make it clear to the Russians that they hold the key to the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol, that what they do is important, and that we are counting on them. Therefore we will continue to work on that.</p>
<p class="contents">The other issue is an important one: the argument about sinks and our position on sinks. Again, I am satisfied that our position on sinks is consistent, since in all the negotiations on the Kyoto Protocol we have remained rather sceptical on sinks – at least until such time as we can monitor and control sinks and count them reliably.</p>
<p class="contents">That is one of the arguments, the other being the temporary nature of sinks and emission reductions from them. We have also pursued our line in this proposal and I welcome that. These are the arguments. We still have too many uncertainties, and we have to clarify those; but of course they are in the Kyoto Protocol, and one day I hope that this will also be another opportunity for Brazil and other countries. However, as long as we do not have full knowledge, we should be careful.</p>
<p class="contents">This will be another effective instrument within our climate change policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
