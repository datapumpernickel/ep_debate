<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Edite Estrela (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, gender equality has not been at the forefront of the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy. Yet without the active involvement of women, the Lisbon agenda is bound to fail. Unfortunately, the gender dimension is conspicuous by its absence from European discourse and, more importantly, political action. Most of the documents produced by the European institutions and the Member States come very much from a male perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unacceptable that, in the 21st century, ten years after the Beijing Platform for Action, women still suffer every form of discrimination – be it at work, in the family, in politics or in society at large – and that the reconciliation of family and working life has yet to be achieved, even though family life is acknowledged to be the main factor holding women back in the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">Unemployment stands at 10% for women and 8.3% for men. Women earn lower salaries, even though they have more qualifications; 58% of graduates and 41% of holders of higher degrees are women. Politics, business and society as a whole have yet to realise that reconciling the different areas of women’s lives is a politically and socially relevant question.</p>
<p class="contents">Maternity must not be viewed as a problem for employers and for the economy. Rather than being problematic, in fact, it is actually a service provided to society, which helps to combat low birth rates and the ageing of the population, and to guarantee the sustainability of the social security system. It is therefore crucial that women should not be penalised for motherhood. The truth, however, is that women do not make progress in their careers, do not receive regular productivity bonuses, do not receive a share of company profits, and have to accept less significant and less professionally rewarding jobs. What is more, when a worker of either sex sees that company bosses are more understanding of those who want to leave early to pick up the car than those who want to leave early to pick up the children from school, this says everything about the mentality of those who hold economic power and about the way in which the tasks traditionally assigned to women are undervalued.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be remembered that society is organised along lines drawn by men. It is they who set the timetables without regard for the fact that children need to be picked up from school and that the fridge needs to be stocked to feed the family. This is a problem for everyone, not just for women. Appropriate policies should be put in place to encourage people to share tasks in the home. Fathers should therefore be granted an inalienable right to parental leave following childbirth or the adoption of a child, without losing any employment rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been demonstrated that the sharing of family responsibilities between men and women is the first step towards achieving much-needed reconciliation between home life and working life. With the same rights to a career as men, women must not be forced to do the same work as men outside the home and three times as much in the home. The involvement of women in the political, social and economic spheres is an essential factor in social progress. Gender equality is very much a modern, contemporary issue that needs to be part of the EU’s day-to-day political agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the EU’s key objectives should be equal representation in the political decision-making bodies. Integrating women into the decision-making process is a modern-day necessity and an absolute prerequisite in strengthening democracy. The time has come to abandon the notion that women are capable of working but incapable of making decisions. The road is long and full of obstacles but we must make our way along that road without wasting any more time. Women cannot sit around for more generations waiting for mentalities to change and for the system to regulate itself. They need to be proactive in the fight for the right to be on an equal footing with men, both in the public and private spheres, because nobody voluntarily hands over the power that they have held for centuries.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is for sure: if you have privileges you do not want to lose them; if you are sitting comfortably in the seat of power you will not get up unless you are required to do so. History has shown that men are less inclined to show their traditional chivalry in such circumstances. This report seeks to redress some of these problems. I therefore ask for Parliament’s support for this report and hope that once it is adopted the Commission and the Member States will take account of the proposals and recommendations contained therein. I should like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for the contribution of the policy unit, of the secretariat of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality and of those Members who tabled amendments. Thank you, everyone.</p>

(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report and the motion for a resolution on the future of the Lisbon Strategy from the point of view of the gender perspective. It is a very useful contribution to our common agenda for growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">You are clear and very much to the point in showing what the policy of gender equality can bring to the Lisbon Strategy. The persistence of major disparities between women and men really is a matter of grave concern. It is essential that we continue our efforts and consolidate the integration of the gender dimension, gender mainstreaming, into all policies. The need to tackle the disparities between men and women in employment or education and, in particular, the pay gap and its causes must be at the centre of our concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we tackle the structural inequalities between men and women so that all can participate equally in economic and social life. This will mean implementing Community law better. It is important, however, that we tackle all the factors behind these discrepancies, such as the predominance of women in lower paid sectors, the persistence of stereotypes, especially in education and training, or, as you clearly point out, the difficulty of reconciling professional and private life. The questions of reconciliation between professional and private life are a key aspect of questions of equality. They must cover all possible aspects: the care of children and dependants, the organisation of working time, new forms of working, etc. Men must also be fully involved in reconciliation measures.</p>
<p class="contents">You also underline that we all have a duty of good governance, involving in particular proper coordination between different policies, partnership between institutions and with the competent players, and statistical and analytical monitoring of our policies. The Commission fully shares these points of view, as evidenced by the annual report on equality between women and men that has been presented at the spring summit since 2004. The report identifies all these points as priorities for future action. The Commission’s commitment to equality between men and women will also be reflected in the roadmap for male/female equality that the Commission will be presenting shortly. It will highlight the governance aspect in particular, the importance of which you yourself have also very usefully emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also constantly monitoring equality policy in analyses and studies and by developing specific statistics. Studies are regularly carried out by experts. These studies are published. There was a study on reconciling professional and private life in 2005, for example. Finally, the Commission analyses the gender aspect of Member States’ national reform programmes in order to make an important contribution to the ‘employment’ chapter of the annual monitoring report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It forms part of the work begun with the Lisbon Strategy and, in my view, has highlighted an extraordinarily important factor for men and women in general and for women in particular: the ambitious target of attaining full employment in Europe by 2010. This target has been set because it is only by reaching that position that Europe will succeed in ensuring that its people have access to the welfare state, which is part of its history and culture and constitutes one of its greatest achievements. That is the first point I wished to highlight.</p>
<p class="contents">The second relates to the target of full employment – 70% of people in work in Europe – taking account of the fact that some countries in northern Europe, like the United States, have already exceeded that threshold: there is no doubt that the presence of women in the job market is not only what women want but also what our entire Community needs. Mrs Estrela’s report, which we put forward and which the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality adopted, promotes the contribution of women with a view to fulfilling this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">How? Firstly, by emphasising the statistic that has changed our approach to assessing the data. I very much welcome the fact that, for many countries, having to talk of ‘employment rates’ now rather than the somewhat malleable concept of ‘unemployment rates’ signals an important departure, in the same way as having very accurate and precise statistics on all work-related activities and on the role of women in the job market will signal an important departure.</p>
<p class="contents">The employment figures are still worrying. Clearly, what has happened in Europe over the past four years has not helped us to fulfil the Lisbon objectives. Some factors undoubtedly harm employment levels: the pay gap, which certainly does not make those women who do not need to go to work enthusiastic about doing so; and the need for lifelong training, particularly for older women who, like older men, are among those excluded from the workplace.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I believe that this resolution represents an important contribution to the Lisbon Strategy and that, together with the – as yet non-existent – resources, it will help us to meet the targets that have been set. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The motto ‘equal pay for equal work’ has already been mentioned. We have had that on paper for years, but it has not been put into practice. The reality is an EU average of 15% to something over 30%. Things cannot go on like that. In business, women are largely absent from executive positions. We even have good models outside the European Union – take Norway, for one. In Norway, the government has passed a law requiring 40% of supervisory board members in quoted companies to be women. Have the courage to take such initiatives, Commissioner, and make this part of the road map.</p>
<p class="contents">The demand for independence must not be left only on paper. The social partners must be more active here. I am getting sick and tired of always hearing that it is because of women’s qualifications. As we have already heard, women are now better educated and there are far more women graduates than male graduates, but we have still not broken through the glass ceiling. There must therefore be other reasons why women are not coming through, and I have to say there is a lack of political will here.</p>
<p class="contents">Again and again there has been much talk of good will here in this House and in the Commission. So where is the snag? Why is it that women – even in politics – are still not achieving the breakthrough? Here Mrs Estrela’s report is helping to stir us up again and to ensure that the role of men changes. Reconciling family and working life and gender mainstreaming are not matters for women alone. I am therefore asking you to increase the pressure. I am asking the Commission at long last to present the road map and not merely to describe the facts again but to be really courageous and move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Gender Institute will be an important and courageous step. It will enable us to demonstrate that Europe is taking equality seriously. I am therefore asking you to translate words into action. The Lisbon Model and the Lisbon Strategy can only be successful if women are fully integrated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All three are equally important, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that social inclusion within the Lisbon Strategy relates specifically to women, I would like to congratulate Mrs Estrela on her report, because it offers an excellent opportunity to remind the Council and the Commission of the need, where the gender perspective is concerned, to incorporate a transversal dimension into all of the Union’s policies.</p>
<p class="contents">As the report states explicitly, better coordination is needed between the policy of gender mainstreaming, on the one hand, and the Lisbon Strategy on the other, with a view to taking systematic account of the gender perspective in achieving the ambitious Lisbon objectives, particularly in the broad economic policy guidelines, the employment guidelines, environmental policy − i.e. the REACH Directive − internal market policy − i.e. the Bolkenstein Directive on services − and, finally, the policies on integrating immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, there is also an obvious link between the Beijing Action Strategy and the Lisbon Strategy, and the need to take advantage of the productive potential of male and female European workers is therefore crucial to compliance with both agendas.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as has also been said, we support the amendment presented by Mrs Gröner and Mrs Estrela calling on the Commission to make the reconciliation of family life and employment one of the priorities of the gender equality road map, which is currently under discussion, and, in cooperation with the Member States, the social partners and other actors, to review the suitability and effectiveness of Directive 96/34/EC. That review should focus on how to improve the situation of women and men with a view to reconciling family life and employment for both genders, which would be a key factor in terms of achieving gender equality in all aspects of life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The speaker spoke Irish)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, EU leaders promised to make a decisive impact on the eradication of poverty by 2010, yet more than half way through the ten-year period of the Lisbon Agenda this has not happened. In the light of this, the Lisbon Agenda’s pledge to tackle gender equality must also be viewed with a degree of scepticism. Mrs Estrela’s report put forward practical measures for ensuring gender equality, including employment opportunities for women, and I thank her for her very good work.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of employment opportunities is not about providing women with low-paid jobs or with less favourable working conditions. Such opportunities must have at their core equality for women on a par with their male counterparts. On average there is a pay gap of 15% across the EU, but in a recent survey in my country, Ireland, it emerged that the gender pay gap has grown: it has increased for women in spite of Ireland’s economic growth. Irish women are paid 17% less than Irish men for the same work, so it is clear, as Mrs Estrela says, that growth and jobs alone will not bring gender equality.</p>
<p class="contents">President Barroso told Parliament yesterday of his commitment to the roadmap for gender equality, dealing amongst other matters with employment and with reducing the pay gap. I commend Mrs Estrela’s report to him and to Commissioner Michel as a good basis for progress in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The present emphasis on achieving growth at the expense of social inclusion, of working conditions and of environmental protection will not in any way lead us in the direction of greater gender equality. That needs to be addressed through positive action and not simply lip service. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the aforementioned Strategy, the European Union was to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, and was to overtake the United States of America. One of the long-term aims set was a 70% increase in the employment rate. This is to be achieved by raising the retirement age, thus depriving citizens of the restful retirement they are entitled to. Another aim set is to use human capital to greater advantage by making workers more productive. Europeans themselves are opposed to this, as they wish to have more leisure time and longer holidays.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain Members of the House are very familiar with pressure of this kind. It was a feature of the Soviet Communist era, especially of the 1950’s. People were worked so hard that they would achieve 200% of the target set only to die of exhaustion before being awarded posthumous medals. In the spirit of gender equality, women are now also supposed to go out to work, instead of bringing up their children. The Strategy calls for the provision of day-care facilities for at least 90% of children over three years of age, and for at least 30% of children below three. Sadly, we are all too familiar with the results of a similar experiment that took place during Socialism’s darkest and most misguided period. Society needs to understand that no institution can ever replace a mother when it comes to caring for young children, even up to the age of seven. Only a mother can provide the kind of love that is essential for a child to develop properly.</p>
<p class="contents">It would therefore be more appropriate for the Strategy to provide payments and pension rights for mothers bringing up their children. This would help reduce unemployment. More importantly, it would be the best investment we could make for our future, because children and young people are our future. We are opposed to treating individuals simply as units of labour and to the exploitation of women. Women should enjoy special protection, as it is they who bear and bring up the next generation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully support those ambitions and very much hope they will not be in vain, because many ideas are put forward, plans made and dossiers and reports written on the subject of equality between men and women, but few concrete results are seen.</p>
<p class="contents">Social, pay and professional disparities are always a live issue in France and throughout Europe, too. Whether it is the improvement of childcare services – in particular by increasing the number of facilities available – or the promotion of new forms of working such as teleworking to make it easier to reconcile professional, family and private life, all these measures are much more effective in helping to promote equality between men and women than the systematic forced application of the concept of non-discrimination advocated by certain feminist lobbies that are very active in the European Parliament and which they use at every opportunity and always for highly ideological purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to say that my colleague Mrs Estrela’s report is along these lines. We will all gain from showing pragmatism and common sense.

<p class="contents">However, it is the first time that we have had an integrated and global approach to the matter as in Mrs Estrela's report, which highlights the central position of the gender dimension in achieving the Lisbon objectives. I thank Mrs Estrela for her initiative and her work and the members of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality who took part in this endeavour.</p>
<p class="contents">Other speakers have spoken about discrimination and the problems which women face today on the job market as regards their access and deployment and the particular problems which vulnerable groups face in our society, such as female immigrants and elderly women.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we can see that no social model in the European Union has addressed this matter with any noteworthy success. However, the various experiences are worth studying and researching in depth, so that they can be used in the policy guidelines of the European Union and in efforts by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I should like to ask the European Commission to address the issue of the different concepts and methods used to calculate participation in the job market. We do not all have the same definition of unemployment, seasonal unemployment and long-term unemployment. We therefore need to address these concepts in as uniform a manner as possible, so that we can record the actual situation and give the real dimensions and directions to our task, both in the European Union and in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the Commission should take account of the significant differences in concepts and policies concerning parental leave, use of rights and so forth. We cannot talk about efforts to achieve the Lisbon objectives when there are so many different concepts and approaches in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to emphasise the importance which must be attached to the proposal in the Estrela report for a collective and global approach to the question of women. Mainstreaming, which is a European Union philosophy, must be incorporated into all policies and evaluations both in the European Union and in the Member States' action plans.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to ask you, in the European Commission's evaluations of progress made in achieving the Lisbon objectives and in evaluations of the various funds, to ensure that we always have this mainstreaming dimension. Our committee will be your ally in this endeavour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">How can we continue to aspire to making the European Union’s economy the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 without eradicating the continuing disparities between men and women?</p>
<p class="contents">Half way through the Lisbon Strategy, we can unfortunately only note a failure to achieve these objectives. The gender dimension cannot remain confined to only a few areas of this strategy. It is a horizontal and transverse element that cannot be ignored and cannot be reduced to a mere box-ticking exercise in an impact assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">It means concentrating on the systems and structures that create and maintain inequalities and accentuate differences. Three percentage points more women than men are unemployed. 33% of women work part time involuntarily compared to 6% of men. Only 10% of women achieve high-level positions. The pay gap ranges from 6 to 30% for the same work, despite equal treatment having been a fundamental principle of Community law since 1957.</p>
<p class="contents">If Europe wants to reach its growth and employment targets, it is time to change the way people think. Women’s working hours must remain a choice and not a constraint that makes their position insecure. Women’s access to lifelong learning must be optimised. There must be a real political will to create measures for the family that will allow men and women to reconcile professional, family and social life: more childcare facilities at affordable prices, and more parental leave for men to allow them to give themselves more to bringing up their children.</p>

Alongside the Stability and Growth Pact, this is having a detrimental impact in the social field, affecting women in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Stating that urgent measures must be taken to promote jobs, high-quality jobs and the social inclusion of women in order to achieve the Lisbon objectives is simply not enough. What is needed is to reverse the policies that are jeopardising equal rights and fomenting discrimination against women, especially in the workplace. As such, in addition to increased unemployment among women affected by the restructuring and relocation of multinationals and by industrial sectors affected by the liberalisation of internal trade, such as textiles, clothing, footwear and many others, the new jobs being created are increasingly precarious, badly paid and discriminatory, and fail to respect the rights of female employees.</p>
<p class="contents">Even so, within the scope of the so-called ‘Lisbon Strategy’, there are new proposals for a directive on the table that may exacerbate discrimination against women, worsen the unemployment situation and deepen social exclusion still further. These include the proposal for a directive on the organisation of working time and the notorious Bolkestein Directive on the liberalisation of the services sector. For this reason, it is impossible to go on claiming to be defending women’s rights while systematically undermining those rights, be it via the broad economic policy guidelines, or via policies and measures aimed at creating an internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is crucial that, at the very least, the Community institutions and the Member States take this report on board. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will not be achieved. The Lisbon Strategy is yet another way of damaging European economies through state interference and over-regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is typical of the socialistic approach so beloved of this Parliament. It recognises the problem, which is that the economies of Europe need to be more competitive and that Europe is rapidly losing its competitive position, but then sets about devising measures that are either irrelevant or will actually make the problem worse.</p>
<p class="contents">The report recommends that Member States take measures to ensure that the most disadvantaged women, especially single parents, are guaranteed a minimum income. What could be more calculated to create unemployment than guaranteeing a minimum income for not working? The report states that earnings and working conditions in many Member States, particularly in large commercial chains, are an affront to women’s dignity and are often the cause of miscarriages and disability. Absolutely no evidence is produced for this outrageous statement. I can assure you that any commercial chain in Britain that caused miscarriages and disability would soon find itself in the law courts.</p>
<p class="contents">The way to ensure maximum employment for those people, both men and women, who want to work, is to get off the backs of businesses and deregulate. There should indeed be equal pay for equal work, and to help those parents who wish to stay at home and look after children we should lessen the tax burden on the parents who work, as indeed we should lessen the tax burden on all who wish to work. Such policies will never happen in the socialistic EU, which is another reason why Britain should leave the European Union and take the actions required to ensure economic regeneration and prosperity while it still can. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is why I would like to welcome this report and to express my thanks to the author, who seeks to address in her text the issues of gender equality.</p>
<p class="contents">Are we still trying to identify the goals of the Lisbon Strategy when the process is already into its second half? To me this seems somewhat late in the day. In section I of the report the distinguished MEP refers to the Beijing Platform Fraction. It is deplorable that I was the only EU representative to attend, when the women’s rights conference in Beijing subjected the Beijing Platform and its practical implementation to its tenth assessment. My concern is that this report will turn out to be one of those that describe accurately the situation and status of women in the EU Member States, whether in terms of employment, social situation or health, but whose substance will not be applied in practice. I still entertain the hope that the report will not be put on the shelf, however, and my hope has been strengthened by the Austrian presidency, which includes women’s health among its priorities. Here again we encounter another problem, though, as the health care systems of the Member States are, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, subject to the purview and decision-making powers of the Member States. Since we know that the health sector in the EU member countries is going through an extremely difficult reform, health protection should be coordinated at an EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">For a woman to be able to fill her position in society, be an equal partner in the workplace and a good mother, she must enjoy good health. The protection of female health in an ageing population should be one of the most important goals of the Lisbon Strategy, whether in the form of preventive examinations to detect breast cancer and cervical cancer or research into the causes of premature birth and increasing infertility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report by Mr Wim Kok has convinced us that the Lisbon Strategy requires thorough revision from a gender equality standpoint as well. We must not forget the competencies of women and the special nature of their important role, and this applies in a context broader than the economies of the Member States. Finding a proper work-life balance requires us to take account of the social mission of women in improving the demographic situation in Europe. Under no circumstances should we overlook the formally unrecognised and still unpaid work that women are doing. To this end, we should develop the relevant methodology, along with evaluation techniques and statistical reporting. I am convinced that the social recognition and financial remuneration of this work will significantly enhance the economic situation and social status of women.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you of one of the conclusions and objectives of the European Council formulated in March 2000 – full employment in Europe, in a new emerging society that is better attuned to the personal choices of women and men. It is not enough to ensure that all people are employed. Under the communist regimes there was one hundred percent employment and we know what economic standards were like then. It is not enough for all citizens to be able to use computers and to apply the available information effectively. The primary focus of the Lisbon Strategy is an economic one, but the strategy can succeed only if it contributes to the cultural advancement of Europe as well. European cultural standards cannot be divorced from the issues of equal opportunity and gender equality. Europe will be credible only if the women, men and children inhabiting it do not have to endure extreme poverty and social exclusion, and only if its citizens can in their everyday lives think critically, comprehend social phenomena and communicate well, that is, humanely, with each other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If she chooses to work, she has to be judged according to her performance, not according to her sex.</p>
<p class="contents">Women hold the key to achieving the Lisbon Strategy’s overarching goal of creating more growth and jobs in the European Union. Increasing the participation of women in the labour market must be a top priority for the EU. Higher participation rates for women will help tackle Europe’s demographic challenges, as well as increasing growth and productivity. However, these advances must go hand-in-hand with greater gender equality in the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">Discrimination against women, occupational segregation and pregnancy discrimination exists on a large scale. Moreover, the gender pay gap persists across Europe. It currently stands at 15% for full-time jobs, but is as high as 40% for part-time jobs. The PSE Group believes in targeted actions to help promote the employment of the most vulnerable groups of our societies, namely older women, those belonging to ethnic minorities and women with disabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of a knowledge-based society makes high demands on the educational level of the labour force. Girls are outperforming boys at school and more women than men participate in adult education and training. We must make better use of this potential and there must be a lifelong approach to ensuring gender equality from education through to career development and adequate pensions for women.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to fight for a gender-equal society which is fit for the 21st century and forms an integral part of our European social model. Some progress has been made in recent years, but there is still so much to do. The onus for achieving the overarching goals of the Lisbon Strategy ultimately lies with Member States, which must urgently take up their responsibilities to ensure these ambitious goals are made a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">They relate to the application of the Lisbon Strategy. They promote part-time employment, employment with flexible hours, shift work and fixed term contracts in the home care, social, health and other sectors, thereby resulting in more intensive exploitation of women, less secure employment and, consequently, increased levels of unemployment and uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, it is working women, it is working-class women who are being crushed by the anti-grass roots policy, because wealthy women have no such problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also highlights the standard model and philosophy of the family as a production unit which solves the needs of its members. In our opinion, it is very, very dangerous. The responsibilities of the man are being increased in order to convince working-class families that responsibility for the reproduction of their members lies with them. Thus, you are putting the entire burden on the family, the problem of children and of health and of education and, at the same time, you are putting these sectors in the hands of crude traders, of dealers who buy and sell, and leading the working classes into an impasse.</p>

The recommendations in the report challenge the countries to take urgent measures towards attaining the Lisbon agenda goals of advancing employment, employment quality and the social inclusion of women, bearing in mind the major economic potential to be tapped by higher rates of women’s employment.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to meet the Lisbon objective of 60% employment among women in the Union by the year 2010, we must start implementing the relevant measures in practice. The Member States and the Commission should continue to focus on taking effective measures in support of growth, primarily among Europe’s poorest regions, where the lack of jobs forces people, primarily women, to accept jobs with large retail chains in many Member States involving humiliating working conditions, unacceptable hours and extremely low pay. I know what I am talking about, as I live in the outlying region of Prešov in Slovakia, where the average unemployment rate is around 23% and the average [monthly] pay is about SKK 12,000, which is approximately EUR 300.</p>
<p class="contents">It is extremely important to establish a business-friendly environment, to promote the business spirit of women and ensure the availability of micro-credit to help women start up their own businesses. The position of women in countries with a functioning micro-credit system has changed significantly. Additionally, it is necessary to ensure that women enjoy better access to post-university level education and life-long learning, as well as to new technologies and the Information Society so as to enable them to cope with the competition in the labour market. To ensure that EU enlargement acts as a catalyst for improving gender equality policy in the new member countries, we must also improve the standards for implementing measures in national legislation that are intended to eliminate gender inequality in employment, remuneration and/or political representation.</p>

In the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, we had hoped to obtain more resources for research in the new budget. More and better research and, therefore, more resources for research together constitute the most crucial weapon in the fight for competition and growth in Europe. Unfortunately, the budget negotiations recently struggled through resulted in insufficient priority being given to research. That is a great pity. The strategies in the Lisbon Agenda are the guarantee of Europe’s future. Even though the EU’s research programmes only constitute a small portion of total resources for research in Europe, we must think very carefully when we set our priorities. The very fact that European women are still under-represented in the research world, despite women now being better educated than men, signifies that Europe has huge potential that is not being exploited. That is something that, emphatically, we must do something about.</p>
<p class="contents">Few high-ranking female academics have spouses and children, while their male counterparts, more often than not, do. Young female candidates have difficulty obtaining research posts. Throughout Europe, most newly qualified candidates are, in actual fact, women but, higher up the career ladder, men are still firmly ensconced. Now, in particular, it is important to be aware of the fact that women are more vulnerable than men, for the competition for research funds is tough. We must increase the proportion of top women academics and PhD students in order to meet the challenges we face. Investing in education, research and innovation is our only opportunity for coping successfully in the knowledge-based economy. The unexploited female potential for research is the nuclear power of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We must become better at encouraging young women to choose a research career, and we must at the same time secure better conditions for both women and men in the research world. For example, by far the majority of research posts in Europe are at present temporary and, if we do not remedy that state of affairs soon, public research will end up taking second place behind private research. In the longer term, this may mean that most university teachers will be women, reflecting the situation further down the education ladder in the school system, while men find employment in industrial research, which is better paid and more prestigious and in which only 15% of researchers are at present women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is still an unreasonably wide pay gap between men and women in many Member States. There is still discrimination over promotion. The family still has to fit in with the job. Jobs ought to be geared to the needs of families, however. All areas certainly need to be thought through with an eye to gender mainstreaming, but they must also be thought through with an eye to family mainstreaming. New approaches need to be found here. We agree and do not like saying all that, but women still need greater support to develop their entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
<p class="contents">Women make a contribution to Europe’s economic efficiency and competitiveness. Education and lifelong learning are the keywords. The greatest potential of Europe’s citizens is and remains their knowledge and that must continue to be promoted on a basis of equality.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Estrela, for going into the many issues thoroughly in her report. Mrs Thomsen has referred to the area of ‘women and research’, and I would like to highlight another field, namely domestic employment in the private sphere. There is basically no sensible reason at all for treating a job in the household differently from a job in industry or commerce. If a husband and wife go out to work and someone is engaged to do the housekeeping, that is a job, not a private pleasure. On the other hand, if our families were provided with competent domestic services – both in caring for and raising children and young people and in looking after and nursing the elderly – large areas of social work would be effectively covered and valuable jobs created at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">A recognised, insurable employment also brings in contributions to social security systems and opens the way for many women to leave moonlighting for legal work with social provision for old age and sickness.</p>
<p class="contents">I think these are also reasons why such work is unpopular. Something that costs nothing is not accorded equal status and is not recognised as being worth anything and nobody wants that. We must create awareness in this area instead of further devaluing it with subsistence wages. The Member States must raise prospects: financially and fiscally as well as in the mind. Because a family-friendly society in Europe is the only way we will achieve the Lisbon objectives. The Lisbon Strategy is an opportunity for us to focus on these important areas. We must do this to crank up the process and keep it moving. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Concerns are being expressed not only about the lack of results in the economic field, but also about the lack of progress in combating discrimination. Women continue to fare worse than men on the European labour market. This is clear from the significant pay gap between men and women and from the obstacles the latter are confronted with when seeking employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the percentage of women in employment in Europe rose slightly in 2003, it remains the case that only slightly over half of European women work outside the home. New jobs created for women tend to be insecure and poorly paid, and women’s pension rights are considerably lower than men’s. Currently, 58% of people with higher education qualifications in Europe are women. Nonetheless, they tend to be promoted less frequently and still earn between 15% and 40% less than men for work of equal value.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Lisbon Strategy is to be implemented, priority must be given to specific actions aimed at supporting and promoting employment for women and female entrepreneurship. Changes to an employment policy that discriminates against women are essential, especially in view of the theories propounded recently according to which a woman’s so-called natural role is in the home, and that in the 21st century women’s role in society should be simply to keep house.</p>
<p class="contents">If women withdrew from the labour market men might be able to fill the vacancies created. A number of Polish politicians believe that this would be an effective way to combat unemployment. Is this really the road an innovative and competitive Europe should go down? I very much hope not, and therefore strongly support Mrs Estrela’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The own-initiative report on which we are being called to vote today, whose rapporteur, Mrs Estrela, I honestly congratulate, together with the committee and honourable Members who participated today in the debate – because they truly have enriched the subject with their ideas – will help to realise this objective, while safeguarding the much-debated equal treatment and the qualitative improvement of the opportunity for women to participate in the job market.</p>
<p class="contents">Women in the Union not only account for over half the overall population, but also represent 58% of university graduates and 41% of PhD graduates. They are a resource which must be maintained through lifelong learning and developed in quality jobs and new forms of services, such as part-time employment, teleworking and flexible hours which are chosen of their own free will and will not end up splitting women's personality to the point at which they become schizophrenic.</p>
<p class="contents">Situations such as these arise not only from unequal treatment on pay, but also from a lack of legal protection in professional development, which is affected by family life and, whether we like it or not, it is on this family life that the demographic development of the Union depends.</p>
<p class="contents">Inequality begins in the training period. From this study period onwards there is a difference of treatment which obstructs family development. At the same time, there is no harmonisation of predictions in order to safeguard these times as working times.</p>
<p class="contents">Objectives to meet 90% of the demand for day-care facilities for school-age children and 33% for infants are not enough, unless quality preschool education is provided, which is only the case in a few European countries. These places must be cheap and must not be accompanied by a reduction in women's income. However, women's income is reduced by different treatment of their tax and pensions.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue which was raised and which I too for my part wish to emphasise is the acknowledgment of non-standard work by women. Help must be given not only to mothers of single-parent families, but also to mothers in general bringing up one, two or more children. This is the only way we shall be able to be proud of the fact that we are trying to make Europe the leading world power and to support the development and prosperity which will come from social cohesion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ladies and gentlemen, if, as paragraph 23 of the report states, the aim is to achieve greater coordination between gender equality policies and the Lisbon Strategy in order to take better account of the gender perspective in fulfilling the objectives set out for the European Union in 2000, I would like to draw attention to what is still the very small number of women both in the scientific and technological fields and in important decision-making positions in the business world.</p>
<p class="contents">If, as the Lisbon objectives state, we want Europe to become a dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy, then science, technology and innovation must play a fundamental role in it, yet the participation of women in these fields, at all levels, still far from matches that of men.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a question not only of justice, but also of efficiency. Women make up approximately half of the population, and to use just half of the brains available to us is neither intelligent nor efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">The studies prior to the negotiation of the Seventh Framework Research and Development Programme, which is underway, showed us that Europe needs 750 000 new, properly trained male and female researchers. This is the time to take the necessary measures to ensure, without giving up on excellence, that men and women have equal access to these new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of studies carried out have also stressed the lack of data broken down by gender in scientific and technological fields. This is a further difficulty in terms of implementing effective policies that tackle the roots of the problem. The European Institute for Gender Equality will have to play an important role and deal with this deficiency as a matter of priority. We would call on the Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, to take the action necessary in order to make progress on resolving this problem. To do so is essential if the Lisbon Strategy is to bring the success that all women and men want to see. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that in the area of employment and wages women are still in a markedly worse position than men is something that is quite unbelievable and completely unacceptable for the countries of the European Union in this day and age.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the fact that we are encountering a serious problem in Europe, namely an aging population and a low birth rate, we must deal with the issue of inequality in the workplace in conjunction with these problems. This should be of sufficient concern for us to direct all our efforts, both in the European Union and in our individual Member States, towards determining the causes of this issue and to finding as effective and serious a solution as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We need the genuine cooperation of the whole of society, since responsibility for the present situation cannot simply be lumped onto women, who are no longer prepared to assume total care of children and at the same time to find themselves often financially disadvantaged, first in the short term, and then in the long term when they retire. What we need, therefore, are appropriate legal measures, the consensus of the whole of society, and the readiness of both female and male citizens to take on the responsible yet wonderful job that we call parenthood.</p>
<p class="contents">In this we must enhance society’s positive attitude to life and encourage women not to miss or renounce that most beautiful mission and joy in life that motherhood brings. Motherhood does not necessarily preclude a professional or political career, you just need to choose the appropriate time for each thing. We may even look to the women Members of the European Parliament as a model, since some of us can boast three, five and even nine or ten children. And these very Members did not come to Parliament to rest, but are working very responsibly and effectively, since they know how to work with a feeling for the needs of the individual, and they also have a feeling for the community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Louis Michel, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating the very few men who have been present at this debate and the even smaller number who have spoken. It all goes to show that women are right to say there is still a lot of work to be done. I therefore wanted to truly congratulate those who have taken part in the debate, because it deals with a subject that does not concern women alone, but is the concern of all of society and everyone involved in society. That is the perspective in which the Commission intends working on this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that I share the main ideas that have been expressed in this Assembly and to which I have listened most attentively. I do not, on the other hand, agree with certain speakers who want to keep women in stereotypical roles, I would go so far as to say roles of another age. Working women are not the cause of unemployment. That is an argument we hear all too often in some quarters and it is clearly against such arguments that we need to fight, because they are preventing significant progress being made in some countries.</p>
<p class="contents">That being the case, what is the Commission doing? I would like to point out that, for the most part, the demands that have been made are matters for national policy. It is still up to the Member States to legislate on the major questions that have been raised. I do of course recognise that the Commission has its part to play and I am going to explain the areas where it intends taking action and how.</p>
<p class="contents">The new integrated guidelines clearly restate the necessity of making the gender dimension, gender mainstreaming, part of all employment policies and they reaffirm the need to promote equality between men and women in every action undertaken. The new strategy for employment takes up the target of a 60% employment rate in 2010. In particular, it includes in the guidelines the elimination of gender disparities and the promotion of reconciliation between professional and private life.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also made mainstreaming a fundamental principle of Community action. May I remind you that it is included as such in Article 3 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community. Mainstreaming is implemented through a Community framework strategy for equality between women and men. This strategy seeks to establish a framework for action in which all Community activities, including economic activities and policies and employment policy, can contribute to achieving the objective of eliminating inequality and promoting equality between women and men. The Commission is currently preparing a roadmap for equality between men and women, which will take over from the framework strategy starting in 2007. Like the framework strategy, its aim will be to implement gender mainstreaming effectively in all Community policies, and more particularly the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a word about the pay gap. The pay gap between men and women is a complex phenomenon and discrimination is not its only cause. In fact, it results from a number of factors, such as segregation on the employment market, the persistence of stereotypes, especially in education and training, and the difficulty of reconciling professional and private life. We therefore need to respond to all these underlying factors. I would like to emphasise the particular attention we intend paying to reducing the pay gap in the employment strategy. Two guidelines call explicitly on the Member States and the social partners to work towards this. It should also be noted that the Austrian Presidency has announced its intention of organising a conference on the subject of the pay gap in Brussels at the end of May, and I think it will be quite a special opportunity for making new progress in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">A word on the method of studying and analysing the changing position of women on the employment market from the point of view of awareness of their rights and of the role of men. The Commission is constantly monitoring equality policy and regularly undertakes or commissions analyses and studies of the economic and legal aspects of equality. The annual report on equality between men and women, which the Commission has presented to the spring summit of the Heads of State or Government since 2004, is a very important document for monitoring the question of male-female equality in the European Union. The report sets out the main changes in the respective positions of women and men in education, employment and social life. It identifies the progress made and the challenges still to be taken up. From this point of view, too, the Commission is also analysing the Member States’ national reform programmes under the Lisbon Strategy, and this will be an important contribution to the ‘Employment’ chapter of the annual monitoring report.</p>
<p class="contents">How does the Commission intend improving the statistical methodology to take account of the gender aspect? The gender dimension is of course included in the statistics. This is done by using a statistical methodology and statistical data that take account of the gender aspect. As the draft resolution underlines, the availability of adequate, consistent and comparable statistical indicators is absolutely essential for policy monitoring. Eurostat is collaborating actively with the national statistical institutes in order to put in place a common methodology that will enable reliable and comparable data to be collected at European level. It is in fact important that such data should be collected at that level. The future Institute for Gender Equality should also make a significant contribution to improving the statistical monitoring of equality policy. I would nevertheless like to point out, because I believe it is useful to tell things as they are, that this institute will be primarily a technical instrument and will certainly not be a political body or a supplier of financial resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Such, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is the Commission’s response; it fully shares the concerns expressed in the report and once again congratulates the rapporteur on her excellent work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
