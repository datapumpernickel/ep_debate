<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Dam (EDD), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, the problem of cheap labour from elsewhere versus more costly labour carried out by EU subjects has, in connection with the pending enlargement, been in the news rather a lot in the last few weeks, and with good reason. Labour costs of non-EU-subjects are significantly lower than those of EU workers. According to some members of the Council, this could lead to inevitable tension within the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">That concern is not totally unfounded. At least, if we consider the transport sector. In that sector, certain international carriers make use of drivers from third countries for cross-border transport within Europe. These drivers mainly hail from Eastern Europe and beyond and put much less heavy pressure on the labour costs of a company than do their European colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of reasons why non-EU drivers can be active within the Community transport market. First of all, there are international agreements, such as the CEMT, as well as bilateral agreements which grant Eastern European businesses access to the Community market. Thanks to these agreements, businesses from outside the EU are allowed to carry out international transport within the European Union, in a restricted manner or not, as the case may be. Secondly, non-EU drivers can drive Community vehicles, provided that they have the necessary licences.</p>
<p class="contents">This last aspect, in particular, is the subject of debate in this report. In practice, it appears complex to verify across the EU whether the documents which a non-EU driver produces at an inspection point are the correct ones, in other words, whether this person has been employed legally and whether all social conditions have been fulfilled in the process. This difficulty has led to all kinds of practices in which non-EU drivers work for Community businesses illegally and under social conditions which are considerably worse than those enjoyed by their EU colleagues. This results in distortion of competition between EU businesses and, understandably, protests among EU drivers.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Commission has proposed introducing a uniform driver attestation for all drivers who drive lorries from Community businesses. This attestation – equivalent to the Community licence for international transport within the EU – is then proof that, for the relevant driver, legislation and social conditions which apply to the business in the country where it is established, have been met. The attestation does not detail the content of those conditions, but merely their application in terms of working conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Commission proposal, this attestation should be introduced for all drivers who work for Community businesses. This means that certain routine actions, specifically the use of more than one driver from different Member States for a lorry during one journey, would be rendered more difficult. In addition, the wholesale introduction of this attestation into the EU will entail a considerable administrative burden, because an extensive number of attestations are to be issued in a very short space of time. Bearing in mind that the key goal of this measure is to thwart the use of so-called ‘illegal’ non-EU drivers for lorries of EU businesses, the scope of this proposal appears to be somewhat on the generous side.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why most members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism are of the opinion that the scheme should in the first instance be restricted to drivers from third countries. In that way, the root of the problem is addressed, and the administrative burden, which could delay the implementation of the proposal, is reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, according to that same majority of the Transport Committee, this scheme should – without evaluation – apply to all drivers who drive lorries of EU businesses, two years after the introduction of the attestation for third-country drivers. A major argument in favour of this decision is the assumed irregularity in their working conditions, too.</p>
<p class="contents">If the attestation were also to apply to EU drivers, this would create an entirely transparent situation in which national proof of employment could be replaced by the attestation. It would then be important to resist the increasing pressure on the content of working conditions and not to allow competitive pressure in the sector eventually to end up as a burden upon drivers.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, if we accept this proposal, that does not mean that all problems involving non-EU drivers will be a thing of the past. The existing CEMT and bilateral agreements offer – also for EU businesses – ample scope for using drivers from third countries on international transport within the EU. That is why I would like to end my speech by calling on the Member States to keep sight of this proposal’s cardinal concept in the negotiations surrounding this licensing scheme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should not forget that three-quarters of all freight transport in Europe continues to take place by road and working conditions remain a major problem, because they not only have direct economic effects, they also have an impact in terms of security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The market is distorted by so-called social dumping. In an environment where competition is unregulated – such as we unfortunately have on our roads – only large transportation companies still have a chance of survival in the medium term. In any case it is becoming more and more difficult for small transportation companies as the competitive struggle is tough and sometimes it is at the cost of safety, and at the cost of driving and rest times, but also at the cost of proper employment relationships. It is this that we have dealt with and resolved partially in this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of driver attestation is an initial response, and although it goes some way to solving the problem, it is still only a partial solution. Let us not forget that many hauliers from adjacent third countries exploit the situation and certain authorisations – be it CEMT licences or bilateral authorisations – to operate with poor social conditions and low wages.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore called upon to go further than this report and deal with this issue if we are serious about transport, working conditions and especially if we are serious about road traffic safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has suggested limiting the scope of this regulation to drivers from third countries. The opinion of the Commission – and I think this is very good – was that this should be extended to all drivers. Perhaps the amendments before us are a healthy compromise, because we can include third countries in a first phase and extend it to all drivers in a second phase, as we consider this to be a general and useful measure for all drivers.</p>
<p class="contents">This also makes it possible to divide the administrative burden between two levels. As someone who lives in a border municipality, I know personally that there is quite a lot of checking to be done in this sphere at the internal European level too.</p>
<p class="contents">And soon, when we have the new tachograph and the card, we can also introduce an integrated system of control that could take into account both social and safety aspects. We therefore propose that we should work in these two phases and hope that the countries will recognise, as with all regulations, that any regulation is only efficient if the control mechanisms too are efficient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think he has submitted a very good report. Looking again at the explanatory statement, one realises that it contains a whole lot of arguments and material about what is happening on Europe's roads. What is happening on Europe's roads can either be described as criminal or disgraceful, or both at the same time, and it is often simply unacceptable. The fact that we are not solving all the problems with this dossier has been described in detail by Mr van Dam in his report. However, I think that we are really getting to grips with at least one important matter, that of clamping down on social dumping by a few black sheep in the haulage sector. One must always stress that the great majority, as I believe, do things by the book. Here we are talking about a very few people, but their behaviour has devastating consequences. Driving and rest periods are one thing, and these must be adhered to, there is no question about that; the social conditions of the drivers are the other aspect of this.</p>
<p class="contents">All drivers have a right to be employed in accordance with the conditions that usually apply in the Member States. The attempt to use two drivers from central or eastern Europe to comply with the driving and rest periods, while at the same time gaining competitive advantages by means of wage dumping, must be stopped, because if two drivers together earn less than a driver who is employed on the usual terms, then that is simply out of order. It is a disgrace and must be denounced as such.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good, therefore, that we are starting with third countries first, as we have suggested. We should not wait too long to extend this to the Union, and to the Member States, so that this regulation applies to everyone. I hope that it will not take as long as the ERIKA package, but that we can arrive at a regulation speedily. Eastward expansion is imminent and we need to have decent social conditions, but also fair conditions for competition, on our roads and in the haulage industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can remember that these related to my first parliamentary questions, for I was rather unfamiliar with the mechanism for matters of this kind. During the Christmas recess last year, I was reading something about the illegal deployment of Eastern European drivers, social dumping as it is referred to, and such like. Probably like many others, I then thought that something should simply be done about this. I am grateful for the fact that this issue was addressed reasonably promptly.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not just the trade union associations, but it was also the employers who sounded the alarm. It was a joint effort. I would like to make it clear at this stage that we are keen supporters of the free movement of labour. Needless to say, there is an entire debate, specifically in Germany and Austria, with regard to border traffic, and there are all kinds of problems, but if work is done in the European Union – enlarged or not, as the case may be – it should be carried out under the working conditions and working hour regulations which apply here. It is as simple as that. That means that some countries should also consider whether, slowly but surely, they should start introducing minimum wages and minimum standards, for otherwise these areas would be difficult to verify.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret the fact that we are not focusing our attention initially on third countries. The underlying reasoning for this is explained later on. I would mainly underline the importance of evaluation, for it is not just this construction, but also the move to Luxembourg, along with a whole series of other measures, which have led to this. We should make sure that we are not always lagging behind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur for the work he has done. In my opinion this is one of the occasions when the institutions fortunately show their support for a new measure intended to do away with practices that might endanger the working conditions of professional drivers and safety on our roads.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament, the Commission and the Council all affirm the real need for issuing a uniform document, the driver attestation, which will help the competent authorities in the Member States to ascertain whether a driver is regularly engaged in the haulier’s State of establishment.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a measure may help, of course, to ensure respect for working conditions in the EU and hence guarantee the level of road safety demanded by European citizens, and not just guarantee road safety but also put an end to unfair competition and therefore ensure that the internal market really operates properly.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic difference in position among our three institutions lies in the scope of this new measure. The Commission proposed that all drivers performing international transport operations, regardless of their nationality, should be required to obtain the attestation, so as to preserve equality of treatment for all drivers and specifically to avoid social dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part the Council is concerned about the administrative burden that issuing this document would place on the authorities in the Member States and prefers to apply the Regulation first to third country nationals and leave a broadening of the scope of the Regulation for future consideration. I think this House has made a very constructive suggestion in this respect, and I should like to thank the rapporteur Mr van Dam and the rest of the Committee for this. Thanks to this proposal, I believe we can perhaps meet the need for quick results as regards third-country drivers and at the same time attend to the difficulties that the Member States of the Union have, and the Member States can thus commit themselves straight away to taking on the considerable additional administrative burden that applying the Regulation to European Union drivers as well would mean.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that rapid progress in this matter would substantially increase the value of the measure itself. The Commission has therefore already communicated its agreement in principle with the Council’s point of view, even though it departs somewhat from the Commission’s initial proposal. In fact Parliament’s position in favour of applying the Regulation to drivers from European Union Member States as well after a transitional period is interesting. Above all I am convinced that it is important for the Council and Parliament to adopt this much-needed legislation as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus – I must make this quite clear – I think Parliament’s idea of introducing a transitional stage may provide the basis for an agreement in the Council, and so I should like to accept its basic thrust in order to reach a solution; I can therefore accept Amendment No 6, which I believe may help combine the two problems.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the other suggestions made by Parliament, I want to declare my complete agreement with Parliament’s valuable proposal, formulated in its Amendment No 7, concerning the inclusion of certain additional driver details on the attestation, since in my opinion this will make the attestation itself clearer and more precise and will prevent or at least reduce the possibility of abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot, however, accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 4 since they have no effect on the achievement of the objective of this Regulation. Neither can I accept Amendment No 5, because I feel it could lead to confusion instead of improving the text of the Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank you all for your productive cooperation in this matter. I hope you can accept the position I am now proposing, by which I accept Amendment Nos 6 and 7, and that on this basis we can at the forthcoming Council of Transport Ministers achieve a common position at first reading, if Parliament really does accept the Commission’s position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
