But we need to go beyond slogans and spell out how growth can be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">In my report on the internal market scoreboard, which I am presenting here today, I want to transmit a simple but important message. If we really want to achieve growth, let us truly deliver the internal market to citizens, because it is the single most important European investment for growth. To do this, we need to fix what is not working. Where are we failing to deliver? The Commission’s internal market scoreboard shows us that a number of Member States’ efforts to transpose EU single market legislation have been found wanting. Unless Member States step up their efforts to make sure that EU legislation is correctly transposed and fully implemented, there can be no internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Not all is gloom and doom, of course. Some Member States have shown consistent commitment to the internal market. I am happy to see that my own Member State, Malta, once again has the best record amongst Member States for transposing most EU laws on time. Other Member States, such as Estonia, have shown very positive results on all counts in the ‘internal market health check’.</p>
<p class="contents">These positive results do not form an exception to the rule; rather, they show that, if there is political will, other Member States can perform well too. Unless more is done to ensure EU legislation is transposed and implemented correctly in the shortest time possible, however, our citizens and enterprises will not be able to reap the benefits of the internal market. Member States therefore need more ambitious targets, and need to stick to their commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, the Commission needs to continue to fulfil its role as the EU’s executive with more vigour. Breaches of EU law must be pursued more swiftly by infringement proceedings. To that end, I am also putting forward, by means of an amendment, a proposal to establish fast-track infringement proceedings through an internal market prosecutor with sufficient independence to act objectively on infringements and institute infringement proceedings free from political pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">Building the regulatory framework of the internal market is not, however, the only step towards delivering the internal market for our citizens. That is why my report also focuses on the importance of bringing the internal market directly to our citizens and enterprises. The work of the established network of Commission tools is crucial here, and the success stories of services such as SOLVIT need to be followed up with a commitment to further strengthen these problem-solving services. For citizens are still faced with a complex, and often impersonal, network of services when they have a complaint to make. This makes finding the solution to their problem a problem in itself.</p>
<p class="contents">My report therefore calls for further coordination among the Commission’s network of services and stresses the importance of the Your Europe portal as the single online gateway for all citizens’ problems. But we also need to establish ‘live’ points of contact, for example, by having case officers in the Commission’s representative offices in EU capitals to work directly on citizens’ complaints. Lately, we have been asking our citizens to make a lot of sacrifices to ensure that our economies survive the current climate, but we do have the internal market, which is the best way of delivering growth and the economic prosperity that our citizens expect of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Michel Barnier, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, firstly, I would like to thank Mr Busuttil for the work that he has done personally on this report, with the support and understanding of all the members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) – I am referring to Malcolm Harbour and the coordinator, whom I would also like to thank.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are at a serious time of crisis – the financial crisis which has not ended, and the economic crisis which has many human, social and economic consequences. In this time of crisis, as we can clearly see, Mr President, many citizens are suffering and are affected by unemployment. Many are angry and they are expressing that anger, and the internal market that we are talking about in Mr Busuttil’s report finds itself in a rather paradoxical situation whereby it could, if we are not careful, become the first victim of this anger, of the return to nationalism and, at times, nationalist reflexes, the first victim of protectionism. At the same time, the internal market, the single market, is our best chance, our main asset for getting out of the crisis, if it can function more smoothly. That is why what we have done, with Parliament’s support, since the Monti report, since the Grech report – this act for the single market, an integral part of which is governance, these 50 proposals and soon, Mr President, a dozen new proposals to restart the competitive social market economy – must, in my view, form part of the European growth strategy that the Heads of State or Government will debate this week.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, and I have thought for a long time, that the sound management of public finances, on the one hand, and growth, on the other – in particular, growth with the internal market – are not only compatible but must be managed together.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am pleased that Mr Busuttil has emphasised how much potential the internal market has for growth. We believe that if it were to work better in terms of mobility, exports, trade, investment, social entrepreneurship, services and <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce, we could seek out two, three or four extra growth points within our internal market ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what internal market governance is really about: improving the functioning of this space, which is home to 500 million citizens and consumers and 22 million companies, the vast majority of which are small and medium-sized enterprises. As long as they want to participate in this internal market, these citizens and these small and medium-sized enterprises need more efficient tools closer to home. That is what we want to do with SOLVIT, with the Your Europe portal, with EU Pilot, with the Internal Market Information system (IMI), too, and the European Consumer Centres.</p>
<p class="contents">This governance work starts with the scoreboard, that is, the snapshot of what works and what does not, this scoreboard that we produce with the Commission twice a year. This scoreboard gives us an accurate view of the transposition and implementation of internal market legislation in each Member State. It needs to work more efficiently, with figures that more or less speak for themselves, figures that are an incentive for Member States to keep up their efforts. The Busuttil report highlights this too.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, this internal market scoreboard is not the only string to our bow; it is not the only tool that we have when it comes to following internal market rules for European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">This crisis that I mentioned just a moment ago is challenging us to learn from certain deficiencies in each of our Member States and to find a way to make new efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">That is how committed we are. We are striving for transparency and greater cooperation with you in Parliament and with the Member States in order to review the governance of the single market year on year. We did this for the first time on 27 February.</p>
<p class="contents">This first review paves the way for a communication that we will publish during the next European Council in June – since the Council had invited us anyway – on possible ways of enhancing the proper implementation of internal market legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, two main aspects form the outline of this communication: the implementation of this legislation and growth. We, Parliament and the Commission, cannot draw up new rules if we are not concerned about them being properly implemented on the ground. Legislation which is not implemented is not only useless, it is often counterproductive. It creates imbalances between one country and its neighbours, who themselves are able to implement it correctly. It penalises growth and job creation by limiting opportunities for citizens and companies. That is why we proposed, in the framework of the Single Market Act, to lower the ‘allowable’ deficit in the transposition of those rules in the Member States from 1% to 0.5%. I am pleased that Mr Busuttil has echoed this proposal. We cannot content ourselves with an average European transposition deficit of 1.2% and even a figure of 1.7% in one Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently leading a number of steps, together with the Member States, to improve and rationalise the implementation of internal market legislation. That is also why, honourable Members, I have visited each of the Member States’ capital cities – as I promised to do before Parliament – to meet with the national officials responsible for all internal market legislation (the Services Directive, the Professional Qualifications Directive, the Public Procurement Directive, the <span class="italic">e</span>-Commerce Directive, etc.) in order to have direct contact with them. We have therefore set up a task force of 700 officials who are responsible for this body of legislation within the different Member States in order to work more confidently and efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">I will continue this tour of the capital cities by now going beyond capitals and into each region, since, in economic terms, there are companies, trade unions, non-governmental organisations, local authorities and actors in each region that are important for the single market. I will report on the first conclusions from this tour of capital cities and countries in my communication in June.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, we think that these tools for the internal market, these assistance and information instruments, must truly benefit citizens and companies. We have a certain number of tools that have been developed to offer greater transparency and clarity in terms of information. However, some of these tools have been developed in a slightly disorganised way. Today, we must therefore put things back on track together and make them more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall continue to develop the Your Europe portal with a guide for citizens and companies on how to use Europe. Like you, I would also particularly like to improve in each of the Member States the functioning of SOLVIT, an online problem solving tool and a European network of national administrations which, in my view, is a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the single market this year. It had already been said that this anniversary should not be nostalgic or melancholic, especially at the moment. It should be dynamic and proactive for the growth that citizens expect, with concrete benefits for their daily lives. That is also the spirit of this pact for better governance of the single market, which we are calling on Member States to provide.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone has their part to play – governments, Parliament, the Council and, of course, the Commission – and I insist we must make this 20th anniversary the time for a new dynamic, a new boost for the single market. That is why I also hope that we can talk about this transparently and sincerely, not only among ourselves, but also with the actors in each of our countries, whom I mentioned a moment ago. That will be the spirit of this single market week, when we will again take up the idea of the forum that we successfully put in place in Kraków on your initiative, but by developing it in each of the Member States, during the week of 15 to 20 October 2012, over the course of which we will solemnly mark the 20th anniversary of the single market in Parliament, but we will also debate what is going well and what is not going well in each of the Member States. How can we remove some of the obstacles? How can we avoid fragmentation? How can we together quickly implement these 50 proposals that we have cited in the Single Market Act? How can we draw up new proposals based on those you will draw up yourselves?</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, we have a great deal of work to do on the single market at this time. That will be my priority as far as I am concerned, along with you, and that is also what the citizens expect because there is currently a great demand to restore employment, competitiveness and growth, with all the risks I mentioned earlier about returning to nationalism or protectionism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andreas Schwab, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE Group.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that all of us here are agreed that, as the Commissioner has just said, we must not allow the internal market to become the first victim of the crisis; on the contrary, 20 years after the creation of this single market, we must instead do all we can to ensure that this internal market genuinely abides by the uniform rules that all of us here purport to be working to achieve. I would therefore like to express my great thanks to Mr Busuttil for his work on this report in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, because in principle, the internal market scoreboard provides the European Parliament with a consistent annual barometer which shows the status of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">However, ladies and gentlemen, 20 years after the introduction of the single European market, we must take this opportunity, and the opportunity presented by the festivities that will take place at the end of the year, to ask what has worked well in these 20 years and what could potentially be improved. I feel that Mr Busuttil’s report on the internal market scoreboard shows very clearly where the internal market still has shortcomings.</p>
<p class="contents">In general terms, there is a lack of transparency. There are, in principle, two problems with the transposition of legislation relevant to the internal market. Firstly, there is the failure to transpose the legislation – and in this regard, we have just had mention once again of our nice target of 1%, which is met by only a very few of Europe’s Member States. I believe, however, that this figure conceals how poorly some Member States are implementing the internal market and its <span class="italic">acquis</span>, because there is a second problem, which is not the failure to transpose European law, but the fact that European law is being transposed incorrectly or is not being adequately implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe – and I am firmly convinced of this – that we simply need greater transparency here. It does not help when the Legal Service of the European Commission tells us that infringement proceedings must take place behind closed doors. We need greater openness, firstly, as regards what is going wrong in the individual Member States, in what way things are not being transposed correctly, and secondly, as to why the Member States do not remedy this promptly when the European Commission asks them to do so. I therefore very much welcome Mr Busuttil’s suggestion of creating a category for fast-track proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I know from my eight years in the European Parliament that in the case of many directives and regulations, but particularly in the case of directives, the Members of Parliament and even the Commission often do not know how earlier directives were transposed into national law. The European Parliament has frequently called in the past for a correlation table to be obtained from the Member States when new legislation is passed. I believe we should try to make this a reality by taking the 2004 <span class="italic">acquis</span>, in which we have correlation tables for all the new Member States as at 2004, as a basis for also drawing up a correlation table as at 2004 for the older Member States, possibly financed from our own resources, because this could shed more light on things.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that this debate on internal market governance is only just beginning, and I am therefore pleased to be playing an active part in the debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A fully operational internal market will ensure more jobs and more trade, will enable consumers to be better informed and to have access to more varied, better quality and more reliable goods and services, and will strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises and better prepare them to confront globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States play a key role in this, not just in terms of producing legislation, which has to be appropriate, innovative and inventive, but also during the stage of transposition to domestic legal systems. That is where the problems arise. The Member States sometimes consider the transposition deadline to be far longer than the stipulated two years, which is a major spanner in the works for this market of 500 million people and makes the entry into force of rules governing it impractical. Other Member States transpose directives incorrectly or insufficiently, causing enormous problems with interpreting rules and applying them to the European market.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2011 communication on governance of the internal market compiles the life cycle of governance in a single document. The holistic approach Parliament has been advocating for a long time, particularly in the Grech report, now enables us to have a more complete and wide-ranging vision of the obstacles to the internal market being fully operational.</p>
<p class="contents">Resistance from Member States, inertia and, at times, weak commitment to proper transposition should be actively combated by the European Commission, by Parliament and, let us not forget, by active scrutiny from the national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">SOLVIT, which has a key role in extra-judicial resolution of the problems which arise for members of the public and companies as a result of the internal market not working properly, should be given, as soon as possible, a legal basis that enables its full potential to be exploited and the best possible response to be given to the challenges. It should also complement the Commission’s work on infringement proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">From now on, the annual governance report and the Single Market Forum – which was initially suggested by my colleague, Mr Grech, and whose first meeting in Kraków in October 2011 was a great success – should guide the development of the internal market. This forum, or – as Commissioner Barnier has just called it – Single Market Week, which we hope will take place regularly, is enormously important in evaluating the progress with, and obstacles to, the development of the internal market. This is because, as well as giving us information, the governance report brings together in the same place various actors, legislators, consumers, business owners and other interested parties who will thereby be able to audit the internal market’s performance and to have a better perception of the rights and developments in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by taking the opportunity to express some surprise at a proposal by the rapporteur from the day before the vote in committee, following a fruitful debate lasting more than six months. This proposal advocated the creation of a body independent of the Commission responsible for internal market infringement proceedings and with the authority to launch infringement proceedings following approval by the Commission: a Single Market Prosecutor.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a hugely complex idea, requiring an in-depth debate that has not taken place and clarification of the legal nature that this body would be given, its intrinsic powers and its <span class="italic">modus operandi</span>. We regret that this complex proposal emerged so late, making debate impossible; under the circumstances, we are not very receptive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is further proof of how important it is that Parliament sets the agenda on important matters. Thank you, then, Mr Busuttil, for this very balanced report.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject is more relevant than ever, for alongside the things that we imagined would be the engine of European integration when the internal market was established 20 years ago, we can also see that there are imbalances in the internal market. The imbalances where the balance of payments is concerned are also one reason why the euro area has run into such difficulty. The single European market as a whole is also at risk of losing its legitimacy, its role as an engine, if we do not devote particular attention to what has happened now, on its 20th anniversary.</p>
<p class="contents">The internal market scoreboard could be a useful instrument for indicating where things are going wrong at a very early stage, as a kind of early warning system. It would be a significant first step towards economic policy that is at last coordinated. That is why I also welcome the European Commission’s plans to publish this internal market scoreboard annually. We need to square the circle here. On the one hand, the economies that have nursed their labour markets back to health by making appropriate reforms – those that are more prompt with transposition – must naturally not be punished for their achievement. On the other hand, however, even the best in class will be affected if its neighbour gets into excessive debt in order to buy its products.</p>
<p class="contents">As an initial step, it would be sufficient for the EU’s internal market regulations to finally be transposed in a more timely manner. In reality, what we need here are realistic transposition and implementation targets – as this report also underlines. Then there is the varying speed of transposition. In May 2011, the Member States took, on average, 5.5 months longer than the transposition deadline to transpose EU directives; today, the figure is nearly 8 months. This time period needs to be reduced, for the sake of equal opportunities alone. In short, the Member States must meet their obligations better and must demonstrate greater commitment to and make greater efforts towards implementing European legal provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it can be seen that 20 years of the internal market have resulted in a drastic increase in the differences between the competitiveness of the national economies in the European Union. There has been a radical shift in the balance of payments between the strongest economies and what are now the weakest economies, in favour of the strongest. The low interest rate policy conducted since the launch of the euro has reinforced this trend, acting rather like an accelerant.</p>
<p class="contents">We Europeans have trusted in the healing powers of the internal market, while ignoring the fact that competitiveness has not necessarily improved across the board as a result of this internal market policy. Commissioner Barnier, we need to take action to counter this. The scoreboard provides one way of doing so. The 20th anniversary of the single European market also gives us an opportunity to look into drawing up a plan for more equal balances of payments at national level, and possibly even at regional level in a further step, alongside the completion of the internal market. Only then will we achieve overall economic equilibrium in even the marginal regions of Europe, and particularly in the southern parts of the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe’s sovereign debt crisis shows that the surpluses in the north and the deficits in the south will have a blocking effect on each other unless we can resolve this problem in the medium term. I would therefore urge Europe’s economists to give us new theories that reconcile the internal market with reciprocal balance. The internal market scoreboard could provide a decisive starting point for this, but it must not be allowed to become a paper tiger. Let us use the internal market week as an opportunity to think about these things. Let us also use the 20th anniversary of the internal market as a chance to make all of us in Europe – not just the strong countries of the north, but everyone as a whole – fit for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As everybody knows, we do not always have enthusiastic support for proposals in this Chamber, but this is one area in which we can pledge more than enthusiasm. We are positively excited about the idea of being able to get to the completion of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Businesses and consumers are, of course, the beneficiaries of a fully functioning and operative single market, most particularly so in this time of economic challenge. Whilst we are all looking for markets outside Europe – looking at the challenges of export – we must not neglect the challenges and the opportunities of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, delivering a single market for citizens and business does not stop at the creation of good legislation. There must also be adequate implementation as well as cross-border synergy between various national administrations. Without this, and without this implementation, citizens will not be able to enjoy the benefits of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">My group supports the efforts of the Commission and, most particularly, Mr Barnier, in the field of detailed reporting on progress with transposition in the Member States. We welcome the rapporteur’s call for more determination in the enforcement of single-market legislation and clearer reporting on infringement proceedings being taken. ‘Name and shame’ is often an ugly tool in politics, but it is often a very useful one – as is praising those who do well.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the Commission to establish the Single Market Act as a rolling programme to be continually reviewed and updated in order to ensure completion of the market. This should include prioritisation of measures to complete the digital single market, including investment in high-speed Internet and cross-border payments. We also call on national administrations to sharpen up their thinking and their action. It is important for single-market transposition to be treated with urgency and transparency, so that, as we celebrate this auspicious anniversary, we can truly see the single market as the jewel in Europe’s crown. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with the opinion of the author of this report, Mr Busuttil, that ensuring the benefits of the single market for citizens and businesses will not end with the adoption of this legislation. I do believe, however, that besides improving mechanisms for surveillance over the transposition of directives and assistance for businesses in promoting their rights to enjoy the benefits of the single market through support mechanisms such as the SOLVIT website, the Your Europe portal, Enterprise Europe Network, European Consumer Centres or the European employment service, we should also look at the work of certifying bodies, which open up the way to the common market for each product. In my country, the State Veterinary and Food Administration provides an almost constant stream of public information about revelations regarding food products that have found their way into the sales network and which fail to meet the required level of quality and food security. You all probably remember the dioxin contaminated eggs, pork and poultry meat, which appeared last year in the northern regions of Germany. Recently, we also learned that a company in Poland had re-packaged salt for spreading on roads in small packages and sold it as a cooking salt. In this way, road salt got into bread, meat products and canned fish. A consignment of chicken from the land of the Gallic cockerel, which came onto the market in Slovakia, was nothing short of a scandal. The French poultry contained offal that should not have been in the pack, there were small, broken bones, and the gall bladder had been disgorged throughout the product. There was a similar situation with packets of flakes which caused vomiting. Such products, which have no place in a common market, are appearing with increasing frequency. I therefore believe that as part of the improvement of the single market, we should also pay attention, in the interest of our consumers, to the improvement of oversight mechanisms when introducing products onto our common market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead, I will be focusing on its failings. Currently, the EU’s neoliberal economic policy, the European Monetary Union (EMU), and the internal market are, in principle, putting the free movement of goods before the interests of citizens. As a result, a new Europe has been created, one which is characterised by mass unemployment, poverty and a growing class divide. At the same time, there have been cutbacks in measures to improve the environment and increase equality.</p>
<p class="contents">The report refers to the Kraków Declaration where the internal market is described as ‘the most powerful tool for putting Europe back on the path to sustainable growth’. The internal market cannot itself establish sustainable growth or create more jobs. That would be impossible. To achieve this, we need a completely new economic policy which is green and wide-ranging, allows for investment in the public sector, and puts people before the system.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 33 states that the EU must offer direct human contact with ‘citizens and consumers via the Commission’s representative offices’. This is an excellent idea. We should be actively inviting citizens to visit the representative offices in their thousands, so that they can say what they think about the internal market and the current austerity policy, which has ruined millions of people’s lives and destroyed their future prospects.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic principle and objective of the internal market should be the welfare of people and the environment. It should not be promoting the interests of large companies as it currently does. In addition, the internal market has erected high barriers, which are carefully monitored, between itself and the rest of the world. The internal market scoreboard says nothing about the thousands of poor people from countries in the south who were hoping for a better future in Europe, but who drowned when their boats sank in the Mediterranean. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To exploit its full potential, problems need to be identified and resolved as close to citizens as possible. Agencies such as SOLVIT are an important instrument in this regard. The people who work there are quick and efficient. Unfortunately, they are often understaffed, and here it would be better to invest in personnel rather than setting up another ineffectual EU agency, the benefits of which EU citizens find not very convincing.</p>
<p class="contents">While the internal market can certainly do a lot, it cannot be the ultimate answer to the economic crisis – especially not if the limits of the internal market are ignored. For example, bogus self-employed workers from the East in the building trade, who are kept more or less as wage slaves in Austria and Germany. The <span class="italic">Frankfurter Allgemeine </span>newspaper calls Frankfurt the capital of Bulgarian industry. According to tax investigators, around 10 000 to 17 000 bogus self-employed people are currently working in Frankfurt. The number of unreported cases is likely to be much higher. This undoubtedly has great advantages for the building companies. They would have to pay a domestic worker around EUR 35 per hour, whereas the bogus self-employed generally come in at a reasonable EUR 10. That surely is not what the internal market is there for; in this case, the fundamental freedoms are being exploited to the detriment of both domestic companies and workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope this House will adopt the report by an overwhelming majority so as to further enhance the operation of the single market, which is an absolutely vital part of the policies for EU development.</p>
<p class="contents">That would send out a strong signal to the individual Member States. The latest results from the internal market scoreboard have shown how Member States are increasingly failing to deliver on the transposition of European legislation. That is why I agree with my fellow Member that we need to increase the power and flexibility of infringement proceedings, while rethinking the role SOLVIT should play as an alternative to seeking legal redress.</p>
<p class="contents">In that respect, I share his reservations about the danger that we might run into problems with the principle of subsidiarity if the legal basis for SOLVIT is over-formalised. I therefore think the Commission needs to examine all kinds of solutions very carefully so as to make the portal more operational without running the risk of getting bogged down in legal technicalities.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we must bear in mind the fact that the Treaty of Lisbon has redefined Parliament’s role considerably by giving it substantial powers to structure and review EU legislation. In that regard, the conclusions of the scoreboard need to be properly examined within this Parliament’s regular dialogue with the national parliaments, with a view to a more fruitful collaboration with the national authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was interesting to see how the guests reacted to this. They took it all for granted, and indeed it is good that citizens consider this something that goes without saying. The four fundamental freedoms are the core of the European Union, and I hope that we, as Parliament, will fight all joint attempts to erect new barriers and new borders, such as when the German Government and the former French Government attempted to erect new barriers, because the freedom of movement of our citizens is at least as important to us as the freedom of movement of capital or goods.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, Mr Busuttil has presented a good and helpful report. The internal market scoreboard, SOLVIT and other instruments are useful for establishing whether the governments really want European laws and whether the deficits are actually being reduced, as the Council has in fact agreed. We want the internal market to be simplified for consumers. We want SMEs to have easier access and we want all our citizens to profit from it.</p>
<p class="contents">Interestingly, transposition is not always related to the size of the country. As has already been mentioned, Malta comes out best; Belgium, unfortunately, has not done so well. Mr Busuttil, your motion is also interesting and I have great sympathy for you, but I must point out that there are a few other demands in your report that already incorporate this, such as Article 18 on transparency, or Article 24, in which we call for correlation tables, or even Article 21, which suggests that the European Court of Justice could work more quickly. So perhaps we should work on this first.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I should like to highlight four further aspects. Firstly, the transposition must be correct; that is, it does not have to be gold-plated, but it must not be lax and inadequate. Mr Chatzimarkakis, if I may have your ear for a moment: the two liberal camps in the national German Government are currently dabbling with the Payment Services Directive, and from what I have heard, initial reports are not encouraging.</p>
<p class="contents">Now for my second point, which is that the internal market is also a way of overcoming the crisis, creates jobs and contributes to growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we consider the procedures for the social protection of workers to be too cumbersome, because as far as we are concerned – and this is my only criticism, Commissioner Barnier – social cohesion is dealt with too briefly in this report. We will insist on this, because we have a long tradition of social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to quote your former colleague, Jacques Delors, who said that the internal market works according to three principles: competition which stimulates, cooperation which strengthens and solidarity which unites. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For example, it says that the success of the internal market is a key driver of increased competitiveness and growth, and one of the best means of resolving the economic crisis. These may be interesting comments, but they are solely and exclusively in the interests of big business and the financial sector.</p>
<p class="contents">These comments certainly did not take into account the economic and social development of the outlying countries and their peoples. That is because it is those countries that are, in this time of crisis, experiencing the greatest difficulties resulting from their economic weakening, to which – surprise, surprise – the construction of the internal market has contributed greatly.</p>
<p class="contents">For the more economically vulnerable countries, the internal market – otherwise known as policies that liberalise, privatise and deregulate the economy – has meant that their productive capacity has been destroyed, their exports have declined, and their imports in sectors like energy and food have risen, leaving them extremely dependent on foreign countries.</p>
<p class="contents">What have the consequences of the internal market been for countries like mine, Portugal? Increasing numbers of companies going out of business, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises; the destruction of thousands of jobs; increased levels of poverty, exclusion and inequality; the loss of workers’ rights and the spread of precarious labour relations; the privatisation of the energy and transport sectors, of the postal service, and of banking and insurance; and the liberalisation of essential public services.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that, from the point of view of the internal market, people are not free to have social rights and a dignified life. From the point of view of the internal market and its advocates, there is only the free movement of goods and capital. The workers in the various countries of Europe have been fighting bravely for their freedoms, and their social and economic rights, and have been demanding a change of course away from the current policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I agree with those Members who argue that despite its long history and great many benefits, the internal market, unfortunately, still functions imperfectly. Our ultimate goal is precisely to ensure that this market provides all European citizens with an increasing number of benefits in which every single participant can have a share.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the results of the chart included in the report tabled before us show a positive trend, which is a very important step, this should by no means lead us to complacency. In fact, it is high time that we investigate more thoroughly in what areas we still need to make headway and undertake further efforts. This is where the report helps us, while also pointing out that positive overall indicators must not be used to obscure the details, including any problems that remain to this day.</p>
<p class="contents">To mention just one of these, there is the matter of public procurement, which accounts for about 15-20% of Europe’s GDP. If we are able to open up these markets fully and apply European legislation to them appropriately, governments could make considerable savings in the future. We must see clearly that Europe can only become more competitive if, in addition to following strict budgetary policies, it also pays sufficient attention to generating economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I would like to stress that it is very important to reinforce SOLVIT, which was, in part, initiated by the Commission. It is vital for us to realise the extent of our deficit in transposing legislation. However, this in itself is not enough. We also need to reinforce one-stop-shop administration and create additional information portals and better coordination mechanisms, and it is imperative that we eliminate overlapping instruments. Our task is therefore to enforce legislation, and do so in such a way as to meet citizens’ expectations concerning employment opportunities, growth and security.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that we need these scoreboards not simply to serve as checklists in which to mark tasks as completed, but also to help us understand precisely where we are at any given moment. I congratulate the Member States on their progress so far and, just as the rapporteur did, encourage them to seek closer coordination and to increase transparency further. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are also convinced that the internal market has the potential to make a major contribution to growth in each individual country and in the Union as a whole. For these reasons, and precisely because we agree on this matter, we have to be very careful about certain aspects that, not surprisingly, have already been mentioned in today’s debate.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the first of these aspects is that the real enemy of the internal market today is the crisis. The crisis is calling the value of the internal market into question for many people, and it is eroding the potential added value that the internal market represents. As a result, it has been widely said, including in this Chamber, that we have to focus on growth as our top priority, because without growth our work – our work on the internal market – is clearly made more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis enveloping our countries is, in fact, having a further adverse effect: it is giving some countries an unfounded excuse to implement incorrectly what Parliament, the Commission and the Council decide.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been pointed out, we are faced with two problems. The first concerns the Member States’ transposition backlogs, which cannot be attributed to the complexity of the legislation but are often due to poor political decision making. The second concerns the changes or errors made in transposition. All too often, the transposed version departs either from the text itself or from its intentions. The difference can be quite substantial in some chapters: the average values are recorded – rightly so – but the breakdown of where the largest deviations lie gives one the feeling that sometimes Europe tries to use the resources at its disposal rather too artfully. Consequently, the instruments needed to give substance to the internal market ought be revised and strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people have talked about imposing sanctions where decisions are implemented incorrectly or late; personally, I would also like to emphasise the importance of SOLVIT. I realise that finding the right legal basis for it is tricky, but an instrument that has proved its worth cannot be left in the state it is currently in.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to make a last point to the rapporteur: given that we are facing difficulties at the moment on account of the crisis and external circumstances, I do not understand why the idea of an internal market prosecutor has been floated. This would be a third party who would make us embark on lengthy discussions at a time when we need instead to make quick decisions with as much consensus as possible. That kind of consensus used to exist, but this proposal is liable to call it into question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It should be an internal market for citizens and companies at the same time.

The only thing I can say to that is that he should come to my constituency. In my constituency, there are hardly any big companies. My constituency lives off of this internal market and has a great many small and medium-sized enterprises that profit from this internal market. They would not have anywhere near the same sales opportunities in a world without the internal market. That is why I can say that, where my constituency is concerned, this opinion is grossly incorrect.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Ms Weiler mentioned in the debate that in her view, the transposition of the Payment Services Directive was also somewhat lagging in Germany. All I can say to you, Ms Weiler, is that we will do all we can – whoever is in government in Germany – to ensure that the directives passed in this House – with the democratic participation of the European colegislator, of the Council and thus of a federal German minister – are also transposed in Germany as they should be.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, may I come back to one point that has not received much attention in this debate so far, but which is included in Mr Busuttil’s report. If we pass more regulations – and thankfully the Commission has made some proposals in the Single Market Act as to where the instrument of the regulation should be used for legislation in the single European market – we allow the Member States scope in their transposition, but we create uniformity in the application of the law. That seems to me to be something that we should bear in mind much more in the future if we are to succeed in reducing the transposition deficit in this internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner – Michel – I would therefore like to remind you once again that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) places particular emphasis on checking very carefully where directives should be used and where regulations should be used, in order to achieve the best results in the internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I thought it would only benefit capital and not be of much benefit to the people, to citizens. Fortunately, however, I have changed my mind about the internal market since then. I have seen it in action, and I have to say that today, the internal market has become the engine of EU cooperation. The internal market has contributed to growth, to jobs and to prosperity for the EU’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that this continues in the future. That is why we have to ensure that the internal market functions even better in the future. That requires us to do more than we are doing at present, however. In fact, I am a bit annoyed that the Council is not here to listen to the debate, because one of the things that I feel is important is that the Member States realise that they have a huge responsibility to ensure that the legislation made in the internal market is correctly transposed.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Busuttil said, it appears that there are countries that are doing this really well. If all the EU Member States were like Malta, we would have a pretty well functioning internal market. As far as I can see, then, it is largely about whether the Member States have the will to do it. That is what we need to improve.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to do it better, because if we do not do it better, then we will lose our citizens’ and our businesses’ support for the internal market. We are already making a mockery of our farmers, who are complying with the requirements by having built new housing for their egg-laying hens. We are making a mockery of them because at the same time, we in effect allow eggs to be sold on the internal market that come from hens housed in accommodation that does not comply with the requirements. We are also creating distrust among consumers, who are finding that they cannot be confident that the products they buy on the internal market are safe and healthy because there are Member States that are not ensuring effective market surveillance. We are also creating legitimate dissatisfaction among workers, who find that they are being forced out of their jobs because the authorities are not capable of ensuring fair competition.</p>
<p class="contents">We can do better, if we want to do better. In my opinion, the scoreboard is a really good example of this. It is a tool that shows us where the problems lie and what we can do about them. I also agree with Mr Busuttil’s idea of creating fast-track proceedings to deal with those cases in which Member States are not properly adhering to the rules. Getting EU legislation transposed should not take a long time. It is not being done quickly enough at the moment. There are other things that can be done, too. As the Commissioner said, there is the task force that travels around the capitals of the Member States and helps countries improve their transposition of EU legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to express my thanks for a good report and for the work that has been done. We can do better, and I think it is important that we use the 20th anniversary to show our citizens that the internal market is there for them, not the other way round. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union has endless opportunities, but there is also the danger that we will ourselves destroy those opportunities. In this respect, Mr Busuttil’s report adopts an opinion on a very important issue: the implementation of legislation. Member States continue to fail to implement jointly agreed directives and regulations within the agreed deadlines. This is particularly the case with matters relating to taxation and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth noting that it is not just the citizens of any given Member State that will suffer if legislation is not implemented: the other Member States operating within the EU’s internal market will also suffer. If our objective is to promote unity and economic growth in the EU and the functioning of its internal market, we should put the provisions of directives and regulations into practice more quickly than is the case now. If Member States are not willing to implement, for example, legislative acts on the environment, how does the EU intend to achieve, say, the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy as regards resource and energy efficiency in Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">Legislation that is implemented unsatisfactorily weakens the credibility of the EU, competitiveness and, above all, the rights of citizens. We should also ask ourselves how we can ask the public to believe in and, furthermore, commit to an internal market for the EU, if Member States and policy makers in the various Member States do not care to.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU uses legislation to aspire, for example, to a better operating environment for consumers and SMEs. A better operating environment will be difficult to achieve, however, without reform and common legislation. For this reason, we need to be prepared, if necessary, to intervene in some way in the activities of Member States that are reluctant to obey the rules that we have agreed on together.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not intervene in the activities of Member States who flout the rules, the future of the internal market will be fragmentation, not unity. Moreover, this is the issue with the crisis that is now affecting Europe. It is a matter of morals and ethics: about whether all the Member States, from the largest to the smallest, are actually prepared to commit to decisions made jointly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The single market is a topic where it is agreed, among all Member States without exception, that it is beneficial to the European Union in terms of restoring economic growth and creating jobs. However, the first condition ensuring the single market’s smooth operation is for all Member States to transpose European regulations into national legislation. On this point, unfortunately, although progress has been made, we still have Member States delaying this transposition.</p>
<p class="contents">The second condition is to have a high-quality process for transposing European regulations into national legislation. On this score, I must point out that we come up against the first obstacle even when drafting European legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Any time we enter into tripartite negotiations involving the European Parliament, Council and the Commission, we encounter resistance from some Member States in agreeing to produce correlation tables between the provisions of the European regulations and the provisions of the national legislation into which these regulations are being transposed. These correlation tables mark the first step towards proficient monitoring of the way in which quality is observed in the transposition process. This is why I think we should have a rule stating that any European legislation must be accompanied by the production of these correlation tables in Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I had prepared a different speech but, unfortunately, I have to say something else, having noticed the amendment that completely changed the spirit of the report. In Greece, there is a very well-known song, which says, ‘what starts well ends in tears’. I remembered that song, because the report started well and was widely accepted, having been passed unanimously in committee, but it will not end well, because the internal market – and especially the scoreboard – concerns people, not numbers. It concerns European citizens, in a time of crisis no less.</p>
<p class="contents">When the European Parliament debates, considers and legislates, it does so for European citizens and it considers and legislates <span class="italic">in vivo</span>, not <span class="italic">in vitro</span>, because we are interested in life itself. As far as the scoreboard is concerned, we know that it maps how well each Member States has transposed European legislation and how well it is being applied in its territory. We all know that there are Member States in arrears. We all agree that those Member States must accept reprimands and, possibly, suffer penalties. However, what we must consider, before imposing a penalty, is why those Member States are in arrears and what exactly is to blame. The fact that half the cases pending have to do with taxation and the environment speaks volumes, because we are currently debating economic and monetary union and because it is clear that, when these two are not in step, we have problems and crisis in Europe and the euro comes under threat. So this amendment has been tabled calling, no more and no less, for us to appoint a prosecutor and establish another elected body to impose penalties in order to bring the Member States to their senses. I fear that, if we take that route, Europe will not progress and the internal market will become unattractive. Please can we think very seriously about the question of incentives and penalties, because they reflect perceptions. We socialists and democrats are in favour of incentives and trust that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) are not only in favour of penalties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was sorry to miss Simon Busuttil’s presentation of his report and your response, Commissioner, but I would just say that, as Chair of the committee, I am pleased that so many colleagues are here to support you. We do not all agree on everything, as Ms Rapti indicated, but nevertheless, I think the detailed analysis of the issues in this report is an indication of the depth of knowledge and engagement that my committee has for single market issues. I know you will take it seriously, as I am sure you have already said at the beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, because I was not here to hear everybody else’s speeches, I do not know whether I will be duplicating what people have already said. But in my remarks, I just want to concentrate on two particular aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">I will come back in a moment to refer to the question of infringements which Ms Rapti raised, but first I want to highlight how our monitoring of the effectiveness and impact of the single market can evolve, namely, by understanding the level of lost opportunities that still exist.</p>
<p class="contents">I am reminded of a phrase that was used by one of your distinguished predecessors, Mr Bolkestein, in one of his reports on the single market, which we received annually – and I have been around long enough in the single market to have done a report on that – where he described the single market as a Ferrari motoring along in second gear. At the time, I said that it was not necessarily a Ferrari that we wanted, because what we want is not top speed but solidity, reliability and accessibility to everybody; but I think the point was, nevertheless, well made. The problem that we have, colleagues, is that we do not know how many lost opportunities are still out there in the single market, where businesses have tried to sell goods or services in a country (which they are legally entitled to do) and are still frustrated by existing barriers – many of which should have been cast away by the Services Directive and the goods package – so they go off and go to another market, or they take another product.</p>
<p class="contents">We can never calculate those lost opportunities, but I think the question about attitudes of business to the single market, knowledge of instruments like SOLVIT and the point of single contact, are clear indicators of loss of potential. In this report, there is just a short paragraph (but a significant one) where we ask the Commission to include the findings of the Eurobarometer surveys in the annual governance check-up. What I particularly want to ask the Commissioner is whether, in the annual Eurobarometer surveys that are linked into the governance framework for the internal market, we should be including awareness measures about the extent to which companies and individuals know about their rights, SOLVIT and the points of single contact – because if we do not do that, we will have no indication about how the Member States and the Commission are promoting [the single market] together. Similarly, my colleagues have called for the Your Europe platform to be incorporated too so we can have a single powerful brand name and citizens and businesses will know where to go to get information. That is my first point.</p>
<p class="contents">On the second point, about infringements, I think the core idea that was in the report about fast-track procedures stands. It may well be that ideas about an independent infringement assessment are at too much of an early stage but, to be fair to Mr Busuttil’s amendment, it only says ‘potentially considered’. However, it seems to me that, if people cannot sell a product or a service because of a government not implementing legislation, we have to deal with that quickly. Justice delayed is justice denied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I therefore welcome all these initiatives and the only thing I would like to be given greater emphasis is the strong need for communication, because you have portals everywhere, in every country, but there is too little communication taking place on these portals, even between people whose responsibility it is to communicate. There is very little in the way of advance communication, including oral communication, which is why the percentage of small and medium-sized enterprises that actually know about this is very small, while the others are practically excluded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union works in the citizens’ interests when we transpose EU law well, so the numerical targets must be met here. Transposition of legislation is something which is extremely important, so these numbers are needed, as of course are incentives and exchange of best practices – such as the Eurobarometer surveys and a single good information portal like Your Europe – so that these missed opportunities will not occur. I am pleased that the Single Market Forum I proposed in my report two years ago was so successful that this year, we are holding a Single Market Week. However, I would firstly like this project to be continued, so that a Single Market Forum or Single Market Week will be held every year, and I would like to secure still closer cooperation between Parliament and the European Commission as part of this project, because only then will the single market really be something all the citizens understand and identify with, and only then will it be at the centre of debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Michel Barnier, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, I am grateful to each and every one of you for your speeches and your proposals. I would like to thank Andreas Schwab in particular, as Ms Girling did just a moment ago, for highlighting at the beginning of his speech that when we talk about the single market, we are talking about this source of growth.</p>
<p class="contents">I said – and I am also responding to Mr Cofferati here, who was talking about the crisis as the main threat to the single market – at the beginning of my own speech earlier something that is in line with the speeches you made yourselves. I will say it again: in this crisis – with the rise of protectionism and the return to nationalism – we are seeing that the market could be its first victim. For if we split up European economic activity again under the impetus of national or indeed nationalist reflexes and protectionism, it is clear that the single market will not be able to withstand it.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, at the same time, in order to get out of this crisis, I agree that this large internal market, with more freedom and less separation, is our best chance. It is our best chance for restoring growth.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, in order to act effectively, in order to make the single market work properly, we must recognise where there are weaknesses, bad transpositions, sometimes mistakes, shortcomings in terms of contact or information with citizens or companies, and I agree with Malcolm Harbour, who called for such recognition – that is where the interest lies in Mr Busuttil’s report and the work that we are doing.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the reason for this scoreboard, for this desire for transparency that Mr Schwab recommended. I would like to tell Mr Schwab that beyond this global scoreboard, which mentions all the single market texts, we must indeed go further and examine how it functions, text by text. That is what I am going to do, for example, with one of the main documents on the single market, which is not working well, and it has only been in place for three years. I am talking about the Services Directive, which covers 40% of the European economy, as all the other services sectors are covered by other European texts. We must examine text by text, brick by brick, how each of the directives is evaluated within the overall framework of the scoreboard.</p>
<p class="contents">With this scoreboard we have, as Ms Schaldemose and Ms Băsescu said, an opportunity to send out regular early warnings, to point the finger, to separate good or bad points from time to time, but also to help Member States, to practise what Róża Thun mentioned as an exchange of good practices.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say to Mr Stolojan and Mr Schwab that it is important to me, as it is to them, that we have correlation tables, that Member States provide these correlation tables for all the texts, all the directives and that we are able publish them, where appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Repo mentioned infringement proceedings. I have decided to use these infringement proceedings – as I have already done – to force Member States to do what they must, but I want, above all else, to rule out any possible contracts or incentives. We have already improved things, Mr Repo. I want to say this to be objective. For example, thanks to EU Pilot proceedings, we have substantially reduced the number of infringement proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now also like to reduce the length of infringement proceedings. Among the tools that we need to bring the single market together, to bring Brussels closer to citizens and companies, we have SOLVIT, this tool that I firmly believe in. I have worked a great deal for two years in each Member State so that SOLVIT could have – as Mr Correia de Campos and Mr Obermayr wanted – the legal and technical resources it needed as well as the necessary staff, and I am continuing in this work with a great deal of vigilance.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of you, like Mr Busuttil, but also Ms Weiler and Ms Rapti, mentioned this new idea – Mr Busuttil – of a prosecutor.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has certain reservations about this idea quite simply – I believe that Mr Busuttil will understand this – because we believe institutionally, within the framework of the Treaties, that we are the Guardian of the Treaties and that duplications or reduplications in terms of function or responsibility should be avoided. However, you have a right, as it is your role as legislator, to ask the Commission to do its work. That is the aim of this report, the aim of other tools we have.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that Parliament has a role of political oversight within all these tasks, and I believe that it is through dialogue between our institution and yours, with the support of the Council, that we can improve the implementation of these tools. Now I think, Mr Busuttil, that we must strengthen the role of the Commission and its work with a view to the proper transposition of all these texts. I will propose working on certain ideas such as determining the legislation or sectors that are a priority in terms of the internal market, where we could, after identifying the most efficient priority sectors for growth and competitiveness, have a strengthened partnership with the Member States and, in some cases, achieve zero tolerance. This is, moreover, the objective that you undoubtedly had in mind with your amendment, Mr Busuttil.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that we could suggest that this exercise regarding the proper implementation of the market falls within the framework of a binding and more comprehensive exercise, that is the European Semester, so as not to content ourselves in this semester with assessing performances or budgetary recommendations, but also competitiveness and growth. I have already discussed this with my colleague, Olli Rehn.</p>
<p class="contents">We must do our work, but we must also make an effort to open dialogue with citizens and with small and medium-sized enterprises. I would like to tell Ms Mazej Kukovič that that is indeed the idea behind this internal market week, which comes after the success of the internal market forum, which your colleague, Róża Thun, set up and in which many of you participated.</p>
<p class="contents">We will try to use all the new means of communication, particularly online and social networks, to get as close to people as possible. I will, as Mr Harbour and Mr Schwab have advised me, along with my colleague, Mr Tajani, specifically bear small and medium-sized enterprises in mind in the dialogue, using the Internet to directly bring them the content of everything we have been doing with you for several years, and at this very moment, to facilitate their work. Reconciling citizens and small and medium-sized enterprises with the internal market is precisely what we want to do, and it is also one of the points that Mr Baldassarre mentioned while urging us not to forget about national parliaments. I completely agree.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about freedom and the circulation of goods – I am responding to Mr Paška here – we are actually talking about the security of goods as well, Mr Paška, of those that enter the internal market and which must respect standards, particularly in terms of security, and of those circulating within the market. It is a subject which my colleague, John Dalli, is, of course, responsible for and which he is following closely.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this large single market, there is – as Ms Gáll-Pelcz rightly mentioned – a part of the economy which depends on public procurement: 15 to 17%. I think that respect for these texts in terms of public procurement and also the progress we can make, particularly with electronic public procurement, can lead to extremely significant, beneficial savings.</p>
<p class="contents">The other day, several of you were there at the workshop we held in Parliament in Brussels with Mr Tarabella and Mr Arias Echeverría on <span class="italic">e</span>-procurement. We had demonstrations which showed that if we manage, together, through our texts, to systematise, to generally develop public <span class="italic">e</span>-procurement, we could make savings with all the local authorities of close to EUR 100 billion per year, thanks to this digitisation and this generalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the concrete progress that has been made in the Single Market Act. I share the opinion of Mr Schwab because we must be objective with the single market and the interest that it represents for small and medium-sized enterprises. The work that we want to do in all our texts, as I have just said, is to speed things up where accounting standards, very small enterprises, public procurement are concerned through simplification, activity and investment in small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to tell Mr Gustafsson and Ms Zuber that the single market does not mean all European policies. What is the single market? It is the foundation. It is the base on which we build public or private policies. However, of course, if the foundation is not broken, if the foundation is solid, anything that we build upon it, in terms of public or private initiatives, will be more efficient. This is precisely how we are working with policies for green growth, such as those mentioned by Mr Gustafsson in the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy. This is how we have worked with the 12 levers that form the Single Market Act and that demonstrate the balance we are hoping for. These levers embrace the foundations of the competitive social market economy – I personally wanted this and many of you encouraged me – in three, or rather, four words: economy, social, market, competitive. You will find this balance in the 12 levers which we will retain within the framework of the Single Market Act II that we are preparing for the end of the summer.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say, along with Ms Gáll-Pelcz, that I do find Mr Busuttil’s report effective, to use her words. I think that we must – as Mr Schwab always wanted, so that we can be even more effective, because we can be, and I am undertaking this screening work with that in mind – look at whether we should use the regulation rather than the directive, as I wanted to do. I am also undertaking similar work in the field of financial markets, and in the field of the Single Market Act and the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this spirit that we are preparing the Single Market Act with Ms Schaldemose and the Council, which has a very important role to play as colegislator. That is also why I want us, in Parliament, the Council and the Commission, to be able to find a way to deliver, to act on the 40 texts which are in this brochure and which have now been on your table for several months.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time to take action by going further, as we are going to do, by removing the obstacles that Mr Harbour mentioned. These obstacles to the internal market amount to missed opportunities for growth and employment. Frankly, I believe that we do not have the right, in times of crisis such as we are currently experiencing, to waste opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we must have the right tool, as Mr Busuttil recommended, to implement, with the Member States, all the internal market texts as they have already been proposed and adopted, and also to go further, sector by sector, company by company, as we proposed in the Single Market Act, to make this single market work better.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that that is where the first, the closest source of growth, competitiveness and employment lies, and we must go looking for it where it is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will come back to that in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">At the very beginning of this debate, Commissioner Barnier said we are facing a paradox: on the one hand, we all – or almost all of us – understand the potential of the internal market; on the other hand, we know that the internal market often ends up as the first victim of a protectionist tendency when things are going badly. This is, indeed, a paradox and it is the hurdle that we need to overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">In my report, I mention three ways of overcoming this paradox. The first is through transposition. We need to transpose internal market legislation on time and correctly. If we do not do that, we have a problem. Secondly, we need to implement laws effectively. If we do not implement laws, it is no use having them in the first place. Thirdly, we need to provide citizens and enterprises with the tools to find remedies when things go wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">Some colleagues have mentioned their reservations on the amendment that is to be presented. Let me quickly go through it in order to put their minds at rest. The amendment reads as follows: ‘calls on the Commission to put in place a fast-track infringement procedure and to consider’ – I emphasise ‘consider’ – ‘establishing an independent body within the Commission responsible for prosecuting cases of internal market infringements and pursuing infringement proceedings after obtaining the approval of the College of Commissioners’.</p>
<p class="contents">This amendment seeks to develop the concept of fast-track infringement proceedings. We want to give concrete meaning to this proposal. It would free the Commission from the undue political pressure that we all know it often faces when it tries to negotiate better implementation, or better transposition, with Member States at the initial stages of infringement proceedings – often with the result that the infringement proceedings are delayed for too long. So this is not about sanctions – as Ms Rapti understood it to be – but rather about depoliticising the process and making it quicker. It is certainly not ominous: it is about making the internal market work.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the timing and the question ‘why now?’ – now is the right time because, if we do not act now, we really have lost the plot.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I agree with all those colleagues who say that Europe’s major strength is the internal market. The question is how to ensure that we make the internal market work for all of us. I believe that we should seize the opportunity of the 20th anniversary of the internal market to muster the political will to address the remaining weaknesses of the market, in order to achieve a truly single internal market that can deliver the growth and economic prosperity that all our citizens want. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The citizens, which means consumers and business people, are a key component of the internal market, and it is these citizens we should especially bear in mind when drafting legislation or making information available. However, they often have problems finding the right information and do not know what opportunities the internal market does in fact offer them. This is often caused by information being provided in the wrong way. I do appreciate the work of the Commission in this respect, but the number of portals offering information is often so overwhelming that the citizens get confused and, as a result, do not find the information they need. This is why it is so important to coordinate information tools. I have already pointed out the problem with efficient provision of information about the single market on numerous occasions. When it comes to the Services Directive, for example, the Points of Single Contact were supposed to improve the situation, but as it turns out, they are not fully operational. The Member States should implement EU legislation in a way which makes the laws we adopt in Parliament useful to the people these laws are intended to benefit – the citizens. The internal market scoreboard is a good tool for motivating the Member States to transpose legislation efficiently. Unfortunately, the latest scoreboard has shown that the trend in terms of implementation of legislation is negative in comparison with previous years. We should therefore send a clear signal to the Member States that the potential of the internal market can only be fully achieved with real commitment on their part. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
