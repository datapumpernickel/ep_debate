<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Jöns </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have obtained codecision in social policy by means of the Amsterdam Treaty. However, whether or not we agree tomorrow to the social partners" framework agreement on fixed‐term work comes down to exactly the same thing in the end. This will be the case more and more from now on, since the incorporation of the social protocol into the Amsterdam Treaty will mean that the social partners will always be consulted first. The ball will only be in our court again if they fail to achieve a result. Amsterdam does not even require us to deliver an opinion at any point during this procedure. The fact that we are now able to deliver an opinion is solely because the German Presidency insisted upon it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission only forwarded the draft directive to Parliament on Monday. We are therefore now seeing, barely one month before the European elections, that the Amsterdam Treaty in fact limits our rights quite considerably in the area of social policy. This does not make it any easier to explain in the European election campaign why it is so important for our citizens to vote in the June elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Surely it is unacceptable for European laws to be made in this area without the European Parliament having any kind of formal involvement in this. Not only did Amsterdam fail to remove the democratic deficit in social policy by including the social protocol in the Treaty virtually unchanged, but it even increased it. This kind of atavism needs to be eliminated at once. I therefore strongly urge the Council and the future Commission to conclude with us as soon as possible – by the next revision of the Treaty – an interinstitutional agreement which also does justice to Parliament"s direct democratic legitimation.</p>
<p class="contents">That we are rejecting the current procedure does not however mean that we would therefore automatically be against all the outcomes of the social dialogue. I am merely thinking of our unanimous agreement in favour of parental leave. However, social partners" agreements do not relieve us of the duty to examine them critically, as we did with the agreement on part‐time work. Allow me to come straight to the point: more and more people have fixed‐term employment contracts. In the European Union, the number of employees in fixed‐term employment has increased from 14 million to 17.5 million in the last three years alone. However, long‐term employment relationships are still regarded as the sole guiding principle for both social insurance and conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">This in turn involves various forms of discrimination for fixed‐term employees, as we all know. The fact that the social partners have now agreed on a principle of non‐discrimination for fixed‐term employees is to be welcomed all the more. But unfortunately the same does not hold true for mandatory social security, although the social partners could have extended the non‐discrimination principle to this as well. This was already possible under Maastricht.</p>
<p class="contents">The only progress achieved on the highly controversial part‐time agreement is that the exceptions from the principle of non‐discrimination are cited more clearly. However, I absolutely cannot comprehend why the provisions combating abuse of fixed‐term contracts do not relate to the first contract, but only to successive contracts. What is more, the Member States can even choose from three options here. They either define objective reasons or a maximum duration, or the maximum number of extensions is defined.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement does not set a single uniform minimum standard. The provisions, which are uniform for everyone, stipulate only that one of the three possible provisions must be chosen. In future, we must – and I think this is essential – make it perfectly clear once and for all what we understand by uniform minimum social standards, but I still urge you to agree to this agreement, because otherwise we will be left with nothing at all.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hughes </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, Member States have committed themselves to the European employment strategy and to the four pillars of the employment guidelines, including the pillar on adaptability. They have also called upon the social partners to engage in negotiation with a view to reaching agreement at every level to promote adaptability by balancing flexibility for workplaces with security for workers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has done the same in its Green Paper on a partnership for the future organisation of work and in its subsequent communication. The social partners are therefore to be congratulated for adding this new agreement on fixed‐term contracts to their earlier agreement on part‐time work and I hope they will soon pursue a fresh agreement on workers placed by temporary employment agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">But that, Commissioner, still leaves the difficulty of social security provisions for atypical workers, part of the original atypical work directive. It is clear that cannot be tackled by the social partners and it is something that the Commission is going to have to tackle urgently. It is an outstanding matter that we need to address very quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">Like any agreement under the social dialogue provisions of the social chapter this agreement illustrates a new facet of the democratic deficit, as the rapporteur has just explained. We, the Parliament, have no formal rule in relation to agreements like this. That also needs to be tackled urgently by Treaty amendments and in the meantime by interinstitutional agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point I want to make is this Mr President: I am hearing rumours that one or more Member States might be interested in creating difficulties for this agreement in Council. I hope those rumours are not true, but if they are, I want those involved to think very carefully. Do they want to be responsible for killing social dialogue at European Union level and these important steps to promote adaptability? That would be the result.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that rather than obstructing they will endorse this agreement as quickly as possible.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pronk </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL) </span> Mr President, I am pleased that we can still discuss the Jöns report today. I believe the rapporteur should be congratulated on having been able to get this item on the agenda at this final part‐session of the parliamentary term. I continue to believe that social dialogue is important and that we must also discuss the consequences of social dialogue. I do not believe the Commission has any cause for complaint. We wanted to discuss this at this final part‐session and the Commission simply followed the traditional line, and if this had not been the final part‐session it would have been on the agenda next month. So I do not believe the Commission has any reason to complain. I do not believe the Council played much of a role at all. If the Council had wanted to play a role, it should have adopted an interinstitutional agreement which would have put an end to the unacceptable situation that the European Parliament is not, formally speaking, sufficiently involved in the results of social dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the matter of social security. I do not believe it is possible to ask the social partners to deal with the social security consequences of their agreement. The Council disagrees with this, which means that it takes just one Member State to insist on this position and nothing happens. But I should like to repeat my request for the Commission finally to draw up a directive in the field of social security, so that the Council can no longer take refuge behind the excuses it has been using to date and we will have genuine Council debate on a social security directive. I think these are the principal points.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we nevertheless find the rapporteur"s report to be much too critical of the work of the social partners. It seems as if the Socialist Group actually lacks confidence in the social partners, while at the same time giving the appearance of having so much faith in them. That rankles, Mr President. We have seen it during this debate. The PPE has confidence in the social partners, is ready to let them take on the job, which is why we also want to accept this, we want to improve the procedure, but that is as far as it should go. We do not need to study everything agreed by the social partners in minute detail.</p>

The agreement is really nothing more than a very small and modest step towards improving the status of those engaged in atypical work. The new Commission should embark without delay on a programme of action to find a solution to these as yet unsolved problems. The most important is the issue of extending legislation to cover other forms of atypical work, such as homeworking and hired labour, which have become much more common of late. The other task to address is the guarantee of social insurance for all employees, irrespective of the form of their contract.</p>
<p class="contents">There are considerably more women than men with atypical contracts of employment. Thus discrimination against those undertaking atypical work is at the same time a form of gender discrimination on the labour market. Ending this should be a priority task for the Union.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Andersson </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her report. I welcome this agreement between the social partners. The social dialogue has a significance of its own, leading as it does to agreements at European level between management and labour. This particular accord is the third of its kind and I would like to see more, covering such things as people working for temporary employment agencies and distance workers. A balance does need to be struck, however, between agreements as such and legislation, and I shall be coming back to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Agreements always involve compromise between the social partners. This one is no exception. Its two most important features are that contracts of an indefinite duration are the rule, and that those with fixed‐term contracts will not suffer discrimination. Social security is not covered, as the social partners did not see any scope for successful negotiation here. We have consequently urged the Commission to submit proposals in this equally important field. Let us hope that action will be forthcoming in the not too distant future.</p>
<p class="contents">This framework agreement is a sound one, in my opinion. If – as Mr Hughes says – some Member States are creating difficulties over legislative adoption in the Council, then that is extremely serious. We have here an important agreement between management and labour. Any blocking in the Council would be very damaging for the social dialogue.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Flynn, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. ‐</span> Mr President, I should first like to thank those who have contributed and particularly you, Mrs Jöns, for the speed of the response to the social partners agreement on fixed‐term work. The Commission only adopted the proposal for a directive last Wednesday. I know it is a short time span but it is a very important initiative both in principle and in effect.</p>
<p class="contents">For the third time the interprofessional social partners have concluded a major agreement at European level in the framework of the social dialogue process. The agreement applies the principle of non‐discrimination to fixed‐term workers and it also establishes a framework to prevent abuse arising from the use of successive fixed‐term employment contracts or relationships.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the agreement. It welcomes it as a significant advance in terms of non‐standard forms of employment and as the most comprehensive and refined agreement the social partners have produced so far.</p>
<p class="contents">At the request of the social partners the Commission has now adopted my proposal for a directive to make the provisions of the agreement binding in the Member States. By giving your opinion so quickly you will make it easy for the Council to proceed with adoption of the directive at the end of this month, in time for the Cologne Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement comes at an important point in the development of our shared agenda. Not only has the Amsterdam Treaty just entered into force but we are at a key point in the implementation of the Union's employment strategy. These events confer real opportunities and of course serious responsibilities, too, upon the European social partners. The confirmation which this agreement offers of their commitment and their capacity to contribute to laying down social rights is an important and welcome message. It is important because the agenda on working conditions and employment must now be one of the social partnership for the modernisation of work. It is important because we need to find a new balance of workplace flexibility and of course worker security, especially as new technologies, competition and the new demographic profile of the work force change the conditions for companies and for workers and indeed for public policy too.</p>
<p class="contents">This social partnership requires a culture of adaptation and anticipation of change. That demands trust and cooperation on the basis of informed choice. That cannot happen without practical steps, like the proposal you have before you today.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the European Parliament has not been given a formal role in the procedures under which this directive will be adopted, I have worked closely with you up till now to make sure that the Council has the full benefits of your views and to ensure that Parliament has the broadest role possible within the limits of the Treaty. For me this has been a worthwhile effort. I want to thank you for the way in which you have continued to work on the agreement and the proposal for a directive in spite of the difficult timescale that has applied here.</p>
<p class="contents">When you think back to 1990 when we made the first proposal dealing with atypical work, there were three strands to that: nothing happened. The Council blocked everything, it was impossible to make any progress and here we have two collective agreements that have been achieved in the meantime. So I am satisfied that we are making progress here.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the question about the interinstitutional agreement: I regard that as necessary. Documents have been prepared to advance that. Unfortunately it cannot be concluded just now but certainly it is an important matter that should be attended to as a high priority with the next Parliament and Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I regard it as a good proposal and I would like to agree with the rapporteur, Mrs Jöns. It has been requested, as you quite rightly said, by both the presidency and by the European Parliament as a matter of urgency. One has to thank Parliament for being so generous in allowing this to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a good example, as Mr Hughes has said, of the social dialogue at work, in action, and we can look forward hopefully to a success in May. I hear rumours, too, but perhaps there is sufficient good will in the Council, recognising that the social dialogue is a fundamental matter and that this is a ‘deal done", an agreement between the social partners. How could they turn their backs on it? I will be looking forward to that kind of good result in May.</p>
