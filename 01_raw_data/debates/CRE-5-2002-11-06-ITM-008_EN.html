<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Daul (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am pleased to present to you today the motion for a resolution on a mid-term review adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 21 October. Without wishing to give a complete history of the various stages of the common agricultural policy and subsequent reviews carried out by the European Union, allow me nevertheless to remind you that the European Council, at the Berlin Summit, set out the applicable guidelines for the period 1999-2006. It also introduced amendments with regard to certain common organisations of the market, in particular the cereal, beef and milk COMs. I would remind you that the European Council asked the Commission to present a report in 2002 on changes in agricultural spending, accompanied, where necessary, by the appropriate proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">It is within this context that the European Commission sent a proposal for a reform of the common agricultural policy to Parliament and the Council, which was presented by Commissioner Fischler on 10 July this year. Discussions within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development therefore took place within this context, resulting in the drafting of the resolution I have the honour of presenting to you today.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate was extremely comprehensive. As we can see from the 388 amendments tabled by the members of the committee, the compromise we were able to achieve required a great deal of effort from all concerned, whatever their political leanings or the national interests they represent. The vote, which was won by a substantial majority, shows, if this were necessary, its members’ concern to go beyond political and national divisions in order to present comments capable of influencing the debates.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of this resolution is threefold. First and foremost, its aim is to reiterate the fundamental principles of the common agricultural policy, in particular financial solidarity, the need for a fair income for producers and the maintenance of border protection in order to prevent distortions of competition. Its second aim is to define the broad guidelines for its implementation by paying more attention to the concerns expressed by European citizens with regard to the environment, health protection, food quality, rural development and animal welfare, while responding to farmers’ demands concerning remuneration for their work and the simplification of the agricultural policy’s administration, to encourage young farmers to work in the sector. Its third and final aim is to frame the CAP review in a long-term perspective in order to make market management mechanisms more comprehensible for farmers, and more generally for the agri-food sector, and enable them to make long-term investments.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development feels that, without calling into question the powers of the other committees concerned, any adaptation of the CAP must take place within a long-term budgetary perspective which must, in any case, go beyond 2006, the year in which new guidelines will have to be negotiated.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council now also shares this concern. The fact that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Council take the same view shows how important it is to maintain a strong common agricultural policy which is seen by all our citizens to be implemented equitably, and which we now need to endorse.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the resolution proposed, I shall first consider market management aid. The European Commission’s approach, designed to decouple direct aid to producers, simplifies the management of this aid, but will also lead to the eventual dismantling of any market management measures.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development suggests partial decoupling. Furthermore, this step should not cause production prices to fall. Lastly, the suggested proposals to lower intervention prices do not appear necessary in the current context. Establishing partial decoupling in the work of the committee would allow producers to receive a fixed sum of basic aid per farm or per hectare, calculated on past figures but restricted to a maximum figure of EUR 10 000.</p>
<p class="contents">The second element of the resolution is the reinforcement of the second pillar, in order to support certain policies relating to rural development. The resolution emphasises flexibility, which is crucial to implementing rural development policies, and which allows account to be taken of the concerns expressed at regional level.</p>
<p class="contents">The third guideline concerns the need for strict compliance by producers who receive Community aid, under both the first and the second pillar, with the principles laid down by European directives in the field of environmental protection and animal welfare.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wanted, by means of its resolution, to strengthen the position of the European Union in future negotiations, by taking account of the dynamics of enlargement, by emphasising in particular the need for coherence between proposals for a mid-term review and agricultural supply to the candidate countries, in order to allow for better integration of these countries, while highlighting the margins for manoeuvre provided by WTO negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner reminded us of all this within the Committee on Agriculture at our meeting of 5 October and the European Commission should soon submit legislative measures which will have to comply with all of these restrictions. Our role is to study them and listen to the Commission when it proposes them, and we shall assume our responsibilities in Parliament. That is why I would ask the House to adopt the resolution tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad to have the opportunity today to present to you my assessment of the decisions on agricultural policy taken at the Brussels Summit. As long ago as July, the Commission, by opening the mid-term review, prompted a wide-ranging debate on the future of the agricultural policy. Now, in addition, the European Council has answered a number of budget questions relating to the common agricultural policy. The summit decisions are, in the first place, significant in that the way ahead is opened up for the Member States to conclude the enlargement negotiations, and in that the fifteen Heads of State and Government have accepted the Commission proposal for the phasing-in of direct payments in the agricultural sector for the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">If the candidate countries demonstrate the same realism, then it should be possible to conclude the enlargement negotiations at the Copenhagen Summit, but the Brussels decisions will also have substantial effects on the agricultural policy of the future. The primary consideration here of course is that we should have, for the period from 2007 to 2013, a Budget framework predetermined by the EU Fifteen for the costs of market regulation and the direct payments. This framework consists of the EU Fifteen's planned expenditure for 2006 on the one hand, and the ten new members' financial proposals for 2006 in nominal values on the other. These will be increased only by 1% each year. Initially, this will mean that, in 2007 and 2008, two thirds of the implementation of the Agenda 2000 reforms in the milk sector will have to be funded below the new upper limit, as must 70% of the phasing-in of the direct payments and all the reforms that the Council has already heralded, by which I mean such things as sugar or olive oil, tobacco, wine or cotton.</p>
<p class="contents">This, then, at last means that the old agricultural guideline – which had already ceased to have any effect – is no longer in existence. What now matters is that this new financial framework should serve as a basis for giving the common agricultural policy for the next ten years a clear perspective for planning and development. What does that mean for the mid-term review in the first instance? The Presidency's Final Conclusions establish that the Brussels decisions should no more prejudice the mid-term review decided on at Berlin than the international commitments we made at Doha and elsewhere, any more than any other future decisions on the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">These committed us to continue to take account of the decisions taken by the Heads of State and Government in Berlin and Gothenburg. It is, in this context, noteworthy that the Brussels Summit set no limit to the funds for rural development. Quite on the contrary, it reminded us of the importance of the less favoured regions and of the multifunctionality of agriculture, in effect, then, of the development of the second pillar, for which Parliament has called on many occasions already.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore working on the assumption that Parliament will be firm in stating its intentions when setting down the new Financial Perspective for the post-2006 period, on which, in contrast to the common agricultural policy, it has full power of codecision. The fact that the Final Conclusions expressly refer to the European Union's undertakings resulting from the start of the Doha Development Round is taken by some to mean that the proposal to decouple the direct payments is dead and buried.</p>
<p class="contents">I warn against adopting any such interpretation, as, if the international negotiations produce any commitment to make blue-box reductions – something that the European Union, like all the WTO members represented at Doha, has declared itself prepared, in principle, to do and to which the Council re-committed itself at the sustainability summit in Johannesburg – then that would mean at least partial abandonment of direct payments, as the option of decoupling would then no longer be available. This issue will be discussed in March at the latest, when arrangements for the agricultural sector are put on the WTO table.</p>
<p class="contents">What will be the effects of the mid-term review on the agricultural sector? This question is often asked, and, in its communication entitled ‘<span class="italic">Auf dem Weg zu nachhaltiger Landwirtschaft – Eine Zwischenübersicht über die gemeinsame Agrarpolitik</span>’ (‘Towards sustainable agriculture – a mid-term review of the common agricultural policy’), the Commission has subjected it to an initial qualitative evaluation founded on internal analyses, which concentrate on the ways in which farmers, consumers, taxpayers, the public, the food industry and governmental authorities will benefit, and on the contribution the proposals would make to the enlargement process and to the EU's position on the international stage.</p>
<p class="contents">This analysis was also supplemented in the communication on the mid-term review by medium-term prognoses for agricultural markets and reports on the rice, nut and milk sectors, which were published by the Agriculture Directorate-General in June. An internal investigation into EU enlargement's effects on agricultural markets and incomes in the candidate countries was published in March. Work is currently in progress, under the aegis of the Agriculture Directorate-General, on comprehensive analyses of the potential effects of the actual policy proposals, the results of which will be presented at the end of the year along with the draft legislation. In this, we will of course be taking full account of the Brussels decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add something on the subject of Parliament's draft resolution. I share your view that our policy objectives require us to satisfy ourselves that our policy instruments are balanced and uniform. I welcome your offer of cooperation with the aim of guaranteeing that, in an enlarged Europe, the European agricultural model will be not only further developed and enhanced, but also safeguarded. You and I are at one in the belief that matters other than trade have to be better integrated into multilateral agreements, but, as negotiators for the European Union, we can achieve this only if we have enough bargaining counters to negotiate with.</p>
<p class="contents">We acknowledge, secondly, that greater quality, certifications, audits and so on will entail additional costs for our farmers, particularly the smaller ones. These considerations make our proposals for decoupling and strengthening the second pillar crucially important in terms of the maintenance of the European agricultural model. I am also very receptive to Parliament's proposals for giving women a greater role in agriculture. I see clearly defined conditions for farm management, in the form of cross-compliance, as an essential factor in getting the common agricultural policy back in line with what the public wants, and I also absolutely share Parliament's desire to provide for straightforward and efficient procedures for these audits.</p>
<p class="contents">Simplification in general will remain a key objective, but quality must be capable of being demonstrated and attested if it is to remain credible. As I said earlier, I expect Parliament to be emphatic in specifying how it wants the second pillar to be equipped. Conversely, I support Parliament's concern that it should be accorded rights of codecision in agricultural policy as well, which would significantly enhance the common agricultural policy's standing in the public eye.</p>
<p class="contents">We must now seize the opportunity to build up a sustainable agricultural policy, to bring it into line with society's expectations, and to give farmers a long-term political perspective. I am counting on your support in this!</p>

<p class="contents">As agreed in Agenda 2000, on 10 July this year the Commission submitted the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy. One of the main priorities for the Danish Presidency has been to ensure as much progress as possible in the discussions concerning the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy. Commissioner Fischler presented his discussion paper on the future development of the common agricultural policy at a Council meeting on 15 July. On this occasion, there was an open debate in the Council, in which the Member States had opportunity to make known their immediate opinions on the Commission’s thoughts. The Danish Presidency has had discussion of the mid-term review on the agenda of all the Council sessions in July, September and October, and the Council has thus had a thorough debate on the main topics in the Commission’s discussion paper. The paper has also been discussed within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and in a number of relevant working groups. The conclusions of the Brussels Summit emphasised, as the Commissioner mentioned in his contribution, that this was without prejudice to future decisions on the common agricultural policy and the funding of the EU after 2006, nor to any result following the implementation of paragraph 22 of the conclusions of the Berlin agenda, that is, Agenda 2000, nor to the international commitments entered into by the EU, <span class="italic">inter alia</span> in the launching of the Doha Development Round. In other words, the mid-term review continues directly as part of Agenda 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise that, like the European Parliament and other institutions, we knew from the start that our discussions on the discussion paper were to form a basis for the Commission’s submission of legal proposals at a later point in time. The Presidency has therefore organised general discussions at which ministers were given opportunity to express their various attitudes to all aspects of the Commission’s communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I start my review I would like to thank the European Parliament for its discussion of the matter. We look forward to Parliament’s final decision tomorrow, and it is obvious that the decision will be extremely important and an important contribution to the debate. There is no reason to hide the fact that the ministers’ reactions to the mid-term review have been divergent from the start, with regard to both the timing and the framework, and of course also as regards the content. In general, however, as Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Fisheries I have been able to establish that there is broad agreement on the fact that rural policy should be strengthened and that greater emphasis should be placed on food safety, on protection of the environment and on animal welfare.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and Gentlemen, I will now contribute some comments on the main elements of the Commission’s communication in the light of the discussions that we have had in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The mid-term review contains two entirely fundamental horizontal aspects, namely the decoupling of direct subsidies and dynamic modulation. The Commission’s ideas in this area have been more wide-ranging than has been seen previously. The Council held its first overall discussion of these aspects in July and has yet to hold more technical discussions regarding the individual elements.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as decoupling is concerned, I can say that the delegations have expressed a great need for further information from the Commission in the form of impact assessments of the financial, social and regional effects of the proposal before a final position can be taken. On the other hand, some delegations support the fundamental principle of decoupling. They believe that it will allow farmers to focus on products that give them the best return on sales without having to keep an eye on the size of the subsidies given to the various products. At the same time, it is regarded as being an effective signal to send, both to consumers and to tax-payers. Finally, the countries also point out the negotiating advantages in a WTO context of the transition to a decoupled system. It could also be an important step towards obtaining understanding of the EU’s other negotiating aims.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as dynamic modulation is concerned, a number of ministers have welcomed the proposal in principle. They consider it to be a good way of securing the necessary funding to strengthen the priority objectives of food safety, quality, the environment and animal welfare and other important areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Other ministers have criticised dynamic modulation on the grounds that in reality it means a progressive reduction in subsidies in real terms and because the model – apart from franchising and capping – does not take sufficient account of existing regional differences. Similarly, opinion varies between the delegations regarding the reduction of the first pillar subsidies and regarding how the modulated resources should then be distributed and the criteria according to which this should take place.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment on the more specific market sectors. We had a full debate on the main crops at the Council session in September and, although the Commission’s overall direction was able to be supported to a certain extent, there were very clear specific proposals which met with substantial opposition. Various groups of delegations thus expressed strong arguments against a reduction in the intervention price for grain, removal of the monthly grain supplement, abolition of the intervention scheme as far as rye is concerned, the proposed changes to the arrangements for durum wheat and the proposed environmentally-friendly agricultural set-aside, as well as the Commission’s proposed adjustment of subsidies for energy crops.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s communication was also accompanied by detailed reports on rice, nuts and milk. The Council again had a full debate on these areas at its October meeting. With regard to rice and nuts, opinions were clearly divided along the obvious lines of whether or not one was a producer of the products discussed. As far as rice is concerned, however, there was initially broad agreement on the need for change in the sector – the adoption of the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative makes this inevitable. However, a number of ministers from producer countries expressed dissatisfaction with the specific measures proposed by the Commission, while the non-producer countries regarded the Commission’s proposal as a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to milk, the Commission presented four options for the dairy sector for the period 2008-2015. The options were discussed with the result that it is unlikely that any of them – apart from option 3, i.e. that concerning a and c quotas – can be considered due to the uncertainty regarding compatibility with the WTO rules. In view of this it was deemed appropriate to consider the situation further.</p>
<p class="contents">Where nuts are concerned, the producer countries clearly expressed a need for special subsidies in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s initiative to strengthen rural policy is welcomed by the Member States. As I have mentioned previously, however, there is no agreement on the choice of tools for achieving this objective and the debate in the Council revealed divergent attitudes on matters such as the choice of instruments and distribution of the resources. Nonetheless, the debate was extremely positive in the sense that there is broad agreement that something must be done in this area, including the fact that there is a great need for simplification of the arrangements, and the delegations have a number of ideas for improvements and for new measures in the slightly longer term.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the farm audit, many delegations have generally expressed great interest in the Commission’s ideas, again in principle. The majority of the delegations however feel that in the first instance it should be a voluntary system that is attractive to farmers, so that we can get as many as possible to use the scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Council have thoroughly examined the Commission’s communication on the mid-term review. The delegations have been given opportunity to ask questions, make comments, contribute new ideas, support or criticise all aspects of the Commission’s communication and the reports accompanying the communication. In the light of this the Commission now has a solid basis for considering the Member States’ wishes as regards future development of the common agricultural policy and also for drawing the necessary conclusions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, and this is an important distinction, we are now talking about reforming the common agricultural policy as from 2007, which means that we will continue with the present policy up to 2006 and that Europe's agricultural sector will move forward on the basis of a reformed policy as from 2007. Commissioner Fischler, I think you need to assume that neither the timing nor the content of your proposals will be viable if we have correctly interpreted the compromise on direct agricultural payments negotiated in Brussels by the Heads of State and Government. In other words, it is now clear that the agreements reached at the Berlin Summit will remain in force until 2006, and that the most recent decisions provide a firm basis for planning by the EU's farmers up to 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that the candidate countries can certainly rely on increases in direct payments as from 2004. That, incidentally, formed part of the proposals presented by the Commission back in December 2001 on the financing of direct agricultural payments for the enlargement countries. The only difference, and this was already clear to us back then, is that the 100% compensation payments for all EU Member States in 2013 will no longer be matched by 100% financing capacity as in 2006. I think it must be clear to everyone that this will be lower by then. Every farmer in the enlarged European Union must be aware of that. In order to prevent mistakes, we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats are, in a motion for a resolution tabled by all the groups in the European Parliament, requesting, for this reason among others, that unlimited budget rights and full codecision should be transferred to this House for agricultural matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Similarly, I also think it would be useful to know what the budget level of the first pillar of the CAP will be until 2013. Having said that, although the summit set the level of budgetary commitments, it did not adopt a position on how this would be achieved, in other words on the CAP’s provision for the second part of Agenda 2000 and after 2006. This major question therefore remains to be answered, since nobody can dispute the fact that food safety, sustainable development and land-use planning are still undeniably fundamental issues that need to be resolved without delay. They alone justify a review, or at least significant changes to the current CAP as of 2004. That is the purpose of the only amendment that we as the PSE Group are tabling with regard to the resolution tabled by Mr Daul on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on which Parliament will vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, therefore, we have society’s expectations, to which the CAP must provide swift, positive responses; on the other, there is our strategic position in the WTO negotiations, which will be more successful if it is based on effectively strengthening the multifunctionality of European agriculture within the context of rural development, as well as partially decoupling public aid to production. It would be better to adopt an offensive stance in negotiations so that we can rally the developing countries, in particular in questioning the US Farm Bill, rather than running the risk of being a target for all the special interest groups present within the WTO. Beyond that, Commissioner, I would draw your attention to the need for qualified external protection and internal market regulation, to ensure that the efforts made by farmers to protect the environment, their work and product quality are appropriately compensated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to begin by congratulating the European Council on having reached an agreement that is extraordinarily sound and extraordinarily important. I nonetheless wish also to emphasise that this agreement entails significant changes, such as we had not really anticipated, to the whole debate on future agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">A few words now on the mid-term review. There is an obvious need for reform of agricultural policy for reasons to do with the budget, justice and the environment, for other reasons – into which I shall not go into detail here – and for reasons linked to the results from Doha and concerned with helping world trade function better and making it easier for poor countries to develop their economies. It is hugely important that these reforms should work. It is therefore essential that it be possible to implement the Commission’s proposals for decoupling and for better adapting agricultural policy to the market. It is also essential to be able to implement modulation, that is to say a larger investment in the environment and countryside, and to gather in a little money from the direct contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">A few words now about Parliament’s resolution. We have arrived at a compromise that, in the main, supports the Commission’s proposal. I think it extremely valuable that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development should have succeeded in this, in spite of our having had quite different views from the beginning. There are nonetheless a few points that will have to be voted on separately. I am, for example, able to state on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party that we cannot support changing the interinstitutional agreement with a view to using the budget ceiling of 1.27% of GDP. That is completely impossible. We must vote against these points we cannot support, and I hope that they do not go through, either.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to be able to continue the debate on a constructive change to agricultural policy in the long term, it is important, however, for the proposal put forward by the Commission in its mid-term review to be able to get off the ground. I should like to ask both the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council what they intend to do to keep the debate going now that it is significantly harder to discuss modulation, that we do not know where we are to obtain the money from and that it is considerably more difficult to justify a decoupling of direct payments. What action are we to take in order to get all this to work and obtain a constructive debate on future agricultural policy? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the matter addressed in Parliament’s resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, the decoupling of financial support would effectively end up taking the form of aid, with the consequent loss of legitimacy in the medium term. This would run counter to the aims of cohesion, because it would limit the receipt of aid to the historical base – I am referring to the Commission’s proposal as it stands - it would promote inactivity in areas that already have problems caused by nature and would concentrate aid in areas which have more intensive farming. It would also create problems of depopulation and of reduction in economic activity.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be hard to compensate for these processes by means of a few instruments for rural development with the very limited financial resources they currently have. The poorly named ‘modulation’ is designed more to save money than to ensure a distribution of aid that is fairer and which has greater legitimacy in the eyes of the public.</p>
<p class="contents">The ceiling of EUR 300 000 would affect only 1 900 of the four and a half million farms; according to our calculations, however, the annual 3% reduction would affect an entire range of farms, from the very small to the largest. The result will be that 15% of savings would be made on farms receiving between EUR 5 000 and EUR 10 000 per year. The proposal adopts, therefore, quite an antisocial approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The sole purpose of the sectoral reforms is to save money. Only partial compensation is being proposed for the reduction in farmers’ incomes as a result of the fall in market prices, of the further liberalisation of trade and of increased competition as a result of the US Farm Bill.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, Commissioner, I read something that did make me happy; it seems that, following the Brussels Council, the Commission is exploring new forms of modulation. At least this is how I understood it and this could be something positive. It would be ideal if the review went beyond being a disguised step backwards and instead achieved a genuine modulation that is more redistributive, in accordance with a range of criteria, most crucially that of employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that should be of concern to you, President-in-Office of the Council, at a time when the Brussels Council is deciding on enlargement, but when, at the same time, it is freezing the agriculture budget until 2013. We do not want to believe that what has been discussed, in particular with regard to the mid-term review, might be called into question and become obsolete, because the representatives of the Council have a variety of interests.</p>
<p class="contents">President-in-Office of the Council, your comments have indeed been extremely soothing, but they will not suffice to anaesthetise us. When the Council speaks of rural development or sustainable development, this is clearly nothing more than rhetoric. If we really want to carry out rural development, you will have to tell us sooner or later when it will be possible to move from 10% funding to the 20% funding proposed by Commissioner Fischler and approved by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development as a whole. If we continue to be so vague, what does that mean? Will we in fact have the means to implement our policy if modulation is not restrictive? How, then, will we effectively be able to continue to carry out ecoconditionality, land-use planning, and address social issues? This will not be possible if you do not actually provide the means to implement this policy. Will we really be able to hold a proper debate and carry weight in the WTO as of 2003 if we cannot prove, for example to the developing countries, that the model Europe is creating is truly a model of multifunctionality that respects both mankind and the environment, and not a form of trade in disguise? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berlato (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s proposal on the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy is worrying in a number of respects in terms of the preservation and future development of European farming. We are concerned, in particular, at the proposal to make heavy cuts in direct payments, in that decoupling direct payments from production will not guarantee farmers protection from price fluctuations and will not boost their competitiveness on the international market. Not to mention the fact that the Commission is proposing to turn intervention systems into mere safety nets, without providing for sufficiently comprehensive external protection. Quite apart from the fact that this is extremely dangerous, it means that the stability of a multifunctional European model of agriculture cannot be guaranteed. Moreover, the compulsory modulation of direct payments, as proposed by the Commission, could, in the attempt to release funds for rural development, cause further damage to the COMs in the most vulnerable and weakest sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">We certainly support multifunctional agriculture and the development of the second pillar of the CAP, but we believe that this goal can be achieved more gradually. Given that compulsory modulation cannot be the only means of funding of rural development in the long term, it will be necessary to release resources from other budget headings, but we feel that this must not be to the detriment of the COMs.</p>
<p class="contents">If enlargement and the new economic situation make cuts necessary, these cuts must not be to the detriment of the very sectors and small farmers at risk, who are already in great difficulties now, for otherwise, paradoxically, we may well find our countryside full of people fleeing the towns, certainly not young farmers. This is not the kind of rural development we want.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider excessive the Commission’s proposal to cut payments to producers in many sectors – particularly the rice, nuts and durum wheat sectors – and animal husbandry. We are therefore opposed to the Commission proposal overall and we can only welcome the decision taken by the Heads of State and Government at the Brussels Summit of 24 and 25 October last to leave the Berlin Summit agreement and the budget headings unchanged until 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the fact that the summit conclusions have temporarily reassured the producers and the markets of the Member States, making the possibility of a complete review and therefore distortion of the fundamental principles of the CAP less likely. We also welcome the schedule decided upon by the summit to be followed until 2013, although it is quite clear that CAP-related budget and resource management decisions will be taken by the 25 countries together after 2006, that is with the participation of the new Member States. In this respect, we hope for a positive outcome to a necessary consultation process, and we hope equally that the new Member States will exercise the same pragmatism as that displayed by the Heads of State and Government at Brussels and accept the recent proposal of the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">More specifically, however, as regards the text of the resolution to be put to the vote tomorrow, I must stress that, although it does moderate or enhance some of the Commission’s proposals in a number of respects, there are certain elements that we cannot endorse, particularly since it supports the principle of introducing a new model of support based on a system in which income support is decoupled from production, it is in favour of phasing-out direct payments, it supports the principle of compulsory modulation and since entire sectors – such as the rice, nuts, milk and animal husbandry sectors – are disregarded. These are the main reasons for our opposition to the text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even if you assure us that the financial framework will be respected, you are nonetheless proposing to change the very spirit of the CAP, particularly in proposing to decouple production aid. We believe farmers should be able to make a living from their work. The majority of their income should therefore come from production.</p>
<p class="contents">For agriculture to be sustainable and fulfil its role in the management of the environment and the upkeep of the countryside, any proposals concerning it must primarily involve economic and social prospects. How, otherwise, can we ensure a future for current farmers and encourage young people to work in the sector? We have chosen diversified agriculture and a production model that favours quality and environmental protection. All these are constraints that increase our production costs without the markets being able to recoup them. We should therefore provide for compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">You are proposing to strengthen the second pillar, yet at the same time, you are implying that you will strengthen this second pillar and extend its scope without actually defining it.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I also asked you this question in July and I am sorry to say that to this day I have still not received a response.</p>
<p class="contents">Small farmers cannot take responsibility for everything. They cannot shoulder all the problems of the rural world: the environment, rural infrastructures, the maintenance of public services, land-use planning, nor all of society’s demands, animal welfare and consumer health. This will be the straw that breaks the camel’s back.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also defend these choices in a global context which is becoming increasingly globalised. The Treaties provide us with the appropriate tool: Community preference. It is regrettable that the Commission makes no reference to this and I would draw your attention to the fact that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development reminds you of this in its resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, these profound changes are dictated by enlargement. We must, however, guard against acting hastily, against robbing Peter to pay Paul, which would ultimately satisfy no one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the case of the guiding principles on which the CAP should be based in the long term. I believe there are four particularly important principles.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is price protection. Farmers, like any businessmen, must live mainly from the sale of their products and not from aid provided by taxpayers, which is always precarious and could be revoked at any time. They need remunerative prices which must also cover the cost of environmental, social, quality and safety requirements, which are the requirements of our fellow citizens. This system of coupling has now become highly relevant once again, since the Brussels Summit set the ceiling for the direct aid budget at a level that does not even guarantee compensation for inflation. Unless a considerable reduction in agricultural income is accepted, in particular as of 2007, it will not be possible to compensate for this other than by means of prices that, in accordance with Article 33 of the Treaty, ensure an acceptable lifestyle for the farming community. This must be our starting point in negotiations with the WTO, not the other way round.</p>
<p class="contents">The second principle consists of a revised definition of Community preference, based on the disparity between requirements imposed on European producers and on those imposed in third countries. This disparity justifies protecting our internal market against social or environmental dumping by the world market.</p>
<p class="contents">The third principle is stability. We must stop radically overhauling the rules of the game every three years. Farmers, particularly young farmers, like any businessmen, need to be given enough information to make strategic choices and to make investments that have a lifespan of at least fifteen years, and sometimes their whole career.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the fourth principle is that of food safety. We must not only talk about it; we must give ourselves the means to implement it. An economic unit such as the European Union must not depend heavily on imports, as is the case today for the strategic sector of fodder proteins. Returning to the disastrous Blair House agreements, which have allowed America to dominate the oilseed sector completely, this should be a fundamental concern of a Commission that truly wants to defend European interests. For now, Mr President, this is far from the reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words, if we talk about planning certainty, such a thing may now exist for those carrying out budget planning, but it certainly does not yet apply to farmers. So it is now up to us to establish a policy up to 2013. Only that way will farmers have the security they need to plan ahead. That is what we have to do, and this is where the Commission will make its contribution. By approximately the end of the year we will draw up appropriate proposals so that we can then move the debate on in a meaningful way. I am sorry that I cannot stay for the end of the debate. I am certainly not leaving for reasons of pleasure. My plane takes off from the airport in half an hour, and there are 13 ministers waiting for me in Prague. So I hope you will forgive me if I can no longer be present for the debate after 9 p.m. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
