<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Camisón Asensio </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (ES)</span> Mr President, as we have said on previous occasions when we debated this very technical issue, we are faced with a proposal for a directive that has been developed mainly to fill the two main gaps in the rules on the manufacture, transport, marketing, use and maintenance of all transportable pressure equipment. These gaps have hindered normal development and have resulted in a lack of transport safety and in problems for the free movement of such equipment in the Community market. We therefore had to meet these two fundamental objectives and I sincerely believe that we are close to achieving this. In any event, the proposal for a directive is open to amendment as the recovery procedure has been included for possible future enlargements, and this offers some safety for the future. This is an issue that could, in itself, be resolved by potential changes to the European Agreement and International Agreement on the carriage of dangerous goods by road and rail respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the common position approved by the Council, the mutual recognition of inspections is guaranteed on the basis of criteria that take account of experience and the bodies concerned are given a sufficient degree of independence to allow them to function and be credible. This House has tabled a series of amendments, many of which have been accepted by the Commission and taken over by the Council in its common position. Among these amendments is one that deletes the word ‘refillable" from the original text, as was suggested by the Economic and Social Committee. There is also an amendment that limits the inspection bodies to only the two more independent categories. The new version of the directive refers only to ‘notified bodies", formerly type A, and ‘approved bodies", formerly type B. Category C was not sufficiently independent and has been deleted from the text, as requested by Parliament at first reading in accordance with our corresponding report approved by the Committee on Transport and Tourism. It is now clear that transportable pressure equipment used exclusively for goods transport between the Community and third countries is excluded from the scope of this directive. It would be fitting to accept this exclusion as it complies with the international agreements in force, although we should like to point out the objective difficulty of clearly distinguishing equipment which is used only for this type of transport. As we see it, this is also the right time to accept the possibility that the Member States might allow the conformity of manufacture in series to be established by an approved body. This body would also be linked in some way to the undertaking body without the Community marking provided for in the directive. But it would be appropriate to guarantee notified inspection bodies a right of control, as outlined in our amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">The possibility of granting a transitional period has also been raised. We believe that this too is acceptable, provided that no extensions are granted.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other less important changes on top of these. Some merely refer to purely linguistic and formal aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we are, on the whole, in favour of this common position and we even believe that some of the changes it makes are positive ones. However, I believe it is necessary to mention the need to improve some further aspects, since the efficiency and quality of the legislation in this sensitive sector cannot exclude precise rules on transparency and legal certainty. This is in accordance with the law throughout the European Union and our amendments are along similar lines.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, and to sum up, the main issue in the proposal being debated centres on the major dilemma between the experience and independence of the inspection bodies. This is the crux of the matter. Given such a dilemma, the best solution is to strike a sensible balance between both points of view and to strengthen official monitoring of different conducts. We sincerely believe that with this common position and our amendments we will strike a sensible balance. This is why we are asking you to vote in favour of this common position that was unanimously approved in the Committee on Transport and Tourism.</p>

The report"s view has not changed at second reading and is one that will help increase safety as well as improve conditions for free movement in terms of the manufacture, use and transport of transportable pressure equipment in Europe. The Socialist Group supports the criteria of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which are the rapporteur"s initial criteria. Our group will therefore vote in favour of the small yet important amendments contained in this report and that the rapporteur has summarised.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of a single economic area based on a common market remains one of the objectives from the Treaty of Rome that requires constant improvement. Consequently, Parliament and the Commission have a lasting obligation to iron out technical problems in the trade of industrial goods in this area whenever there are cases where eliminating such problems will still guarantee a high level of safety. Both high safety levels and the elimination of technical difficulties can be achieved with this report. I still do not understand how the Council can be against approving and increasing transparency in limits on times when loaded lorries can use European motorways at weekends. Fortunately, we only have three months left of the German Presidency, after which we can assume that such approval will be granted.</p>
<p class="contents">We should like to congratulate Mr Camisón Asensio for his work throughout these two readings and also the Commission for its excellent initiative and for accepting most of the amendments from this House.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Kinnock, Neil, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. ‐</span> I should like to begin by thanking the Committee on Transport and Tourism and, in particular, Mr Camisón Asensio for the time and productive effort that he has spent on this issue, not only at this time, but for the period in which he has been living with this proposal – the past 18 months or more. The result of his efforts has been improvement in the Commission's proposal. We have recognised that in the most practical way by accepting a significant number of his first reading amendments. The sight of Mr Jarzembowski always disorientates me. Such a thing of beauty at this time of night!</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's position, which includes all the amendments accepted by the Commission – the common position – will improve the safety of transportable pressure equipment such as gas cylinders or tanks, will allow their free circulation and free use and will meet these purposes through provisions relating, among other things, to the conformity of new equipment, the reassessment of existing equipment, periodic testing and relevant Community marking.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me comment on the amendments to the common position that are offered by the report that we are considering tonight. First of all, the Commission is able to accept Amendment No 2 since it introduces the compulsory notification to the Commission in case of undue marking.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not, however, able to accept Amendment No 1. The reason for that is that reassessment of an existing receptacle by an agreed body is only a possibility under the terms of the proposal. The House will know that the Member States that are going to use this provision are those that already have a lot of experience with agreed bodies. They will only authorise some specific agreed bodies for the reassessment activities. In those circumstances and taking into account the fact that a notified body will have previously reassessed the type of conformity, unannounced visits by a notified body are not necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to congratulate the interpreters on the way in which they followed that passage that I have just read out.</p>
<p class="contents">Since Amendment No 4 is a consequence of Amendment No 1, that too is not acceptable. The Commission is also not able to accept Amendment No 3 for the simple and formal reason – which I know the rapporteur understands – that the report to the Council and the European Parliament on the adaptations to technical progress are laid down in the directives of the Commission which are published in the Official Journal.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the honourable Members will accept that the Commission's reasons for not accepting these few amendments are entirely the result of practical and procedural considerations and not objections in principle.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to offer my thanks to the rapporteur and his colleagues for their very constructive approach and bid Godspeed to this useful piece of legislation.</p>
