<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Smet (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, we are now descending to the level of a more everyday problem, namely the regulation of domestic work performed by third parties in private families, for that is the subject under discussion. The problem is that millions of people, particularly women, undertake this type of work, and there is a huge demand for it, but it is not subject to any regulations whatsoever. It would appear, from the limited amount of information available, to be a very extensive sector. I have therefore tried to establish, in various countries, but also at European level, how many people – insofar as this <span class="italic">can </span>be established, because the people concerned are often working ‘on the black’ of course – work in this sector. There are many millions of them. I have sought in vain at European level for an all-encompassing study that could give us an idea of the scale of the sector and the problems within it, the regulations – however incomplete they may be – in the European countries, the pilot projects, and any experiments that may have been instigated by the left or right, but I have to say that there was nothing to be found in the Commission. Hence my first suggestion to the Commission: set up an inquiry, get the funding for this – assuming it is needed – from the funding for women’s studies, for example, because this issue mainly concerns women after all, or get it from the funding for poverty studies because it is often poor women that do this type of work. So I think both sources of funding should be considered, with a view to carrying out a comprehensive study of the issue and to finding out what kind of initiatives people are trying to get off the ground in particular countries. That was my first specific question.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if it is our intention to regulate the sector, then naturally we need to investigate a number of aspects. The first aspect concerns the reconciliation of supply and demand. It is not just the case that the demand for domestic help is on the increase whilst the supply of willing applicants is dwindling. After all, who wants to work in a sector when you know it has to be done ‘on the black’, and without social security, etc., etc. In addition, there is nowhere at all where supply and demand can be matched. So that is one aspect. A second aspect is that the cost to the employer, i.e. the private family that employs domestic help on the regular market, the white market, must not be notably higher than the cost of such labour on the black market, because otherwise it stands to reason that undeclared work will remain the order of the day. A third aspect is that the employee, i.e. the domestic help, must stand to earn more than they would from working ‘on the black’. Fourthly, we need to look into what kind of social statute can be established in this connection. Finally, all this will inevitably involve financial intervention from the government, be it fiscal or parafiscal, because a private family would not be able to afford a full statute, even a limited one, and then they would all carry on taking people from the black market.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the best thing to do would be to spur the Member States on to regulate the sector, via the employment guidelines, as has already been called for in Parliament’s opinion on these guidelines. I would therefore like to ask the Commission what efforts it is going to make in future to adapt the employment guidelines, at least in terms of including this service in the section on services, and when does it intend to ask the Member States to start finding a solution to these problems?</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to my final point, that of migrant women, which is, of course, a very specific problematic area. Many migrant women are here illegally in that they enter on a tourist visa and go back every three months, for example, to the Eastern block countries, to have the visa renewed, and work here as a domestic help in the meantime. In some cases they are exploited and ill-treated. There is no one to help them. They fear that if they were to turn to someone their illegal situation would be exposed. Hence it is imperative that we give special attention to their plight. I have discovered over the past few weeks that there is a great deal of interest, both within international trade union circles and within a number of national trade union organisations. I have had dealings with the Dutch, the Belgians and the Italians over this issue. I would therefore advise the Commission to at least make a start on the search for a solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This work has not been recognised or valued, either economically or socially. Today it is part of what we call the hidden economy and this has a negative effect on those who carry it out and also on states’ finances. However, it is a form of work with a flexible timetable, which is of great assistance in reconciling family life with professional life.</p>
<p class="contents">Changes in family circumstances mean that this work is of increasing importance in the world of work, and it is therefore essential that this type of work be defined and that studies be carried out to assess the numbers of people involved. This is an area of work that must be fully recognised and that should be included in the directives on employment to regulate the social rights of the worker.</p>
<p class="contents">The countries of the Union today have greatly differing situations, which should be standardised. The workers, mostly women, should be provided with access to training. The immigrant population is usually a significant group in this sector, and this requires special measures, such as specialised reception centres, which provide the necessary assistance.</p>

What we are in fact dealing with here is the breaking of a political taboo. Because if you believe that domestic work should be recognised as an occupation in its own right, and Mrs Smet says that, and I echo her sentiments, then what you meet with in the first instance is disbelief and a lack of understanding. I shall evaluate some of these arguments.</p>
<p class="contents">Argument one: should domestic work actually be defined as labour? Should it feature among the labour statistics? The answer is ‘yes’, but then we <span class="italic">will </span>need a European definition, and the countries, the governments, will have to make more effort to get the issue of illegal work out into the open.</p>
<p class="contents">Argument two: are you in favour of introducing pay for housewives? The answer is ‘no’. Any one demanding this is confusing two issues. What we are discussing here is paid domestic service undertaken by third parties in private households. We talk in terms of the ‘<span class="italic">werkster’</span> (cleaning/char lady) in the Netherlands, and the ‘<span class="italic">poetsvrouw’ </span>(same meaning) in Belgium, where they also use the word ‘<span class="italic">interieur verzorgster’ </span>(interior attendant). How amusing.</p>
<p class="contents">Argument three. Regulating the work done by cleaning ladies would simply be making undeclared work all above board, and surely that would make it far too expensive? Now we have reached the heart of the matter. Domestic work is performed by the type of person who stands the least chance on the labour market. Women with an inadequate and out-of-date educational background, etc., etc. They are completely reliant on domestic work with irregular working hours and no form of legal security or social protection whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">This form of exploitation takes place because the employers, i.e. the families that the domestic helps work for, can claim complete innocence, given the lack of legislation. However, since there is going to be increased demand for domestic servants owing to social changes, it is high time we reviewed the relationship between the domestic workers, the employers and the authorities. The question as to how exactly we should go about this, requires a great deal more study and deliberation. But whatever happens, we must ensure that this type of work is established in a legal and social framework which affords those concerned recognition and social security cover, and which improves the quality of the work itself. This would also benefit the employers and so it would be quite reasonable to expect them to make a proportionate contribution to the costs involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me to state that domestic work is important. It must be respected, and it needs to be valued more highly. Those of us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party are therefore able to back most of the report’s conclusions. We shall nonetheless be voting against the report as a whole in the light of the subsidiarity principle. This is an issue for the Member States. Certain proposals are too detailed.</p>
<p class="contents">The following are nonetheless important points for the Member States to take into account. Attention needs to be given to situations in which women have two jobs. Domestic work is often heavy, involving many places of work. Wages are too low, there is an increase in illicit work, and a situation often prevails in which women, often immigrants, are the first to be exploited. Many end up outside the social security systems. In the interests of a social Europe, the Member States have an urgent duty to ensure that immigrant women, often from the applicant States, obtain tolerable working conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">A broader approach to domestic work would enable many people, including young people and immigrants, to see such work as a good way of getting into the labour market. 'Legitimate' domestic help is often too expensive nowadays when VAT and employers' charges have to be paid. Experiments involving tax deductions and ways of simplifying the system ought to be made. It must be made easier to start up and run companies which provide domestic help.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country, Sweden, two main arguments are often advanced against facilitating paid domestic help. First of all, that it would militate against equality between men and women. Wrong! It would make things easier for many families and increase equality. Many women can opt to have careers and go out to work if they are given help with practical tasks – perhaps that is the case for some of the women in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">The second argument is that it would create a B team within the labour market. Wrong! All those who are at present engaged in illicit work would obtain work with decent social conditions. There are therefore both economic and moral reasons in favour of the report's intentions, but these issues must be resolved at <span class="italic">national</span> rather than EU level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is, of course, absolutely essential to try to get to grips with illicit work within different sectors of society, especially when it comes to domestic services. It is also high time that we accorded more status to work in the home and recognised domestic work as a perfectly valid occupation. It is important, too, to ensure that immigrant women are not exploited in terms of everything from poor wages to a lack of social security and outright oppression.</p>
<p class="contents">To demand, as proposed in the report, that the Member States use a directive or some other form of legislation both to adjust prices and to offer tax deductions for domestic services would, however, be to send out a completely wrong signal. It would be to go too far and would also be the wrong route to take. It is inconsistent with the determination to see domestic work as a perfectly valid occupation. What, in fact, is the rationale behind saying that you are to have tax deductions for having your floors polished but not for having your rubbish taken away? To see domestic services as something completely different from other services is not at all the same thing as raising the status of domestic work.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I just want to add that I should like to have seen a report which acknowledged that, within the near future, we shall be in great need of the manpower offered by our immigrants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Demand has risen many times over in recent years, and yet this fact has scarcely been taken into account in general working life and as regards the rights and duties involved. Just where does this activity fit into the scheme of things? We need a legal framework that recognises domestic work, which is given many different names, as a fully fledged job in all Member States, and which provides for the implementation of appropriate labour law provisions. A pan-European description of domestic work as an occupation is needed, bringing in the social partners, and where this does not exist employment policy guidelines should be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">However, defining domestic work is certainly difficult. Where do you draw the dividing lines with such a variety of domestic duties? Is domestic work just cleaning or cooking, or just child care or just gardening? The fact is that there are thousands of women who have been doing all these jobs for years without insurance cover or pension rights. Of course, both employers and workers – generally both women – are often happy with this state of affairs, which saves money.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to educate people and to expand and improve the basic framework that already exists in some countries, so as to provide incentives to phase out the present grey economy. In Austria, and especially in my own region, an EU-assisted project involving a women's advice centre acting as an agency for domestic helps has been very successfully running for three years. Many women have been able to obtain a permanent job through this work. In addition, as a result of this project, two or three families have often clubbed together to employ a domestic help. What we are talking about is registering every contractual relationship between employer and employee and ultimately enhancing the work prospects of domestic employees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course, we do have the Commission communication on undeclared work which was recently adopted by Parliament and which could be used as a basis, including by the Member States in collaboration with the Commission, for policies to bring domestic work within the legal economy. According to the communication, the first two basic steps are, first, you must record and compile statistics on domestic help – as Mrs Smet has said, there are as yet no statistics at European level or in many Member States on this problem – and, secondly, you must deal with it by integrating it into the overall strategy on employment. This strategy to transfer undeclared workers to the legal economy calls for a combination of individual policies which might be sanctions in the case of exploitation, information campaigns, which are needed at all levels, on the benefits of legalising these people and, thirdly, constant effort to harmonise and modernise legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">We have little experience and few Member States have specifically tackled the problem of domestic help. I am loath at present to commit myself and say that we could tackle it through the employment guidelines for 2002. However, what I can say is that the guidelines for 2001 are the first to clearly mention undeclared work and that we intend to work on the basis of the proposal in the conclusions and compile statistics and studies to record the problem so that we can hold a second debate and discuss what the next step should be at European level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
