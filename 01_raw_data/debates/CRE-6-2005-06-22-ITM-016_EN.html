<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicolas Schmit,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span><span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, a fortnight or three weeks ago, we celebrated 20 years of the Schengen agreements. These agreements opened up a new dimension of Europe and put it in a new perspective. I believe that the regulation we are discussing this evening, which reflects an agreement at the first reading between Parliament and the Council, is a good signal to send 20 years after the conclusion of the Schengen agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">We have achieved an objective in this domain, an objective set for us by the Thessaloniki European Council on 19 and 20 June 2004. In other words, we have achieved this objective in something like record time, because the recasting undertaken in the framework of this regulation is designed, on the one hand, to remove obsolete provisions from the handbook and, on the other hand, to develop and clarify other provisions on the basis of an analysis of the everyday problems encountered on the ground at the external or internal borders of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation, however, goes further than a mere makeover, because it establishes a veritable Community Code governing the movement of persons across borders, not only relating to the external borders of the Union but also, as I said, with a component on the internal borders, since these two aspects are undeniably complementary. Moreover, the regulation resolves the problem of the ambiguous legal basis of the handbook by creating a proper legal instrument containing all the basic principles and rules relating to borders.</p>
<p class="contents">The internal-border component reiterates the provisions of the Schengen Convention on the abolition of checks on persons at internal borders and on procedures for the temporary reintroduction of such checks in the event of a threat to public safety or to the internal security of a Member State. This regulation adapts these provisions to the institutional framework of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the external borders are concerned, the basic principles governing checks at these borders as enshrined in the Schengen Convention and some parts of the common handbook have been more or less reproduced. The practicalities for the conduct of these checks are laid down in the annexes and are mostly subject, like the core provisions of the regulation, to the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Work began on the Community Code on 2 July 2004 under the Dutch Presidency and has been vigorously pursued throughout the period of the Luxembourg Presidency. At the meeting of Coreper on 1 June, a general agreement was reached on the wording of the Code and then, on 13 June, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs unanimously adopted the compromise amendments. The Community Code is the first instrument in the field of asylum, immigration, visas and borders to be subject to codecision with Parliament. For this reason, its adoption at the first reading is extremely important as a means of establishing, on the one hand, a relationship of mutual trust between Parliament and the Council and, on the other hand, a precedent that can only enhance the efficiency of future work on dossiers examined under the codecision procedure. It also demonstrates that codecision is by no means a hindrance to rapid progress but, on the contrary, serves to hasten progress and promote efficiency and, most importantly, that it takes place in a more strongly democratic context.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency wishes to thank Parliament, and especially your rapporteur, Mr Cashman, for having worked with the Presidency and the Council in a spirit of openness and transparency but also of mutual trust. This collaboration has served to establish compromises which all three institutions can now endorse. It is, in fact, thanks to the amendments tabled by Parliament that the Community Border Code guarantees more transparency and greater protection for citizens of the European Union and of non-EU countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe there has been much talk of crisis today, of a European Union in crisis. We undoubtedly have considerable difficulties, huge difficulties, but I believe that the act we are discussing this evening in preparation for its adoption at first reading tomorrow shows that the European Union is capable of taking decisions, of making progress in the interests of the people and above all, as I indicated before, of progressing democratically with parliamentary support. I believe that is the crux of the matter because, in a field that concerns people first and foremost, codecision has finally been given its place, thanks to today’s application of the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency also wishes to thank the Commission for its efforts and for its input, throughout the legislative process, of valuable technical knowledge without which the Code would never have seen the light of day. I therefore believe that this is a good evening for Europe. We are poised to adopt an important instrument. On behalf of the Presidency, I thank Parliament and the Commission for their collaboration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rapporteur has without doubt carried out some extraordinary work, and the same must be said of the Presidency. The Luxembourg Presidency rightly sought to make a commitment – and the Commission has always supported that commitment – to being able to put a balanced provision to the vote in Parliament at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">This provision has many merits, and it is difficult to point them out in a very few minutes: the first is the balance achieved between the need to confirm the principle of free movement of persons within the Union and the equally crucial requirement for effective controls at the external borders of the European Union. The other significant merit is that of having adapted a number of procedures originating in a purely intergovernmental domain to the context of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We have taken a step forward. I am referring to the principle of reintroducing internal border controls for obvious reasons of policing, effectively for reasons of security: it was an extremely sensitive subject, and any false move would have been genuinely counterproductive. There then follows a positive item for the Commission: the involvement and active participation of the Commission in the process of reintroducing the controls.</p>
<p class="contents">That is another sign, which I believe is important, of how the European Commission can offer a constant and – I am certain of this and I will obviously strive for this – constructive contribution to ensuring the optimum application of that regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by saying, Mr President, that those signs are the signs that the European citizens are waiting for. They are signs of faith in a Europe, in a European Union, which is alive, which can continue to make progress and to obtain tangible results. Security and freedom are two pillars of the European Union, and there is a good balance in this provision: I would say it is an exemplary case to point out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The importance of this has been underlined by the previous speakers. It is the first time that the Parliament has acted in codecision in the area of asylum, immigration and border control. It is extremely important that the Parliament dealt with this dossier in a mature, reasonable and practicable way. Wish lists are for the past. Of course we have not achieved everything that we in Parliament wanted; as we know that is the nature of compromise. That is not to say that compromise is a bad word, it is a brilliant word. Compromise is the whole notion on which the European project was built in the early 1950s and in 1957. I am proud that today we are legislating. In this House, and indeed in our other institutions, we talk too much and do not deliver enough. Tonight we are legislating and bringing forward changes that will have a real effect on real lives.</p>
<p class="contents">As was mentioned earlier, each of us, especially as politicians, can talk a defining moment into a crisis. But what do we achieve in doing this? We actually reinforce the argument from eurosceptics and the europhobes that this House means nothing and achieves nothing. We have difficulties, but out of difficulties comes a rebirth, a renaissance. Without a renaissance there is nothing for the future. So, codecision does not have to be slow, but it has to be thorough and it has to be built on absolute mutual respect for each of the parties involved in the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Why have we have achieved so much? Because we have done it on the basis that only by acting together can we achieve more than we could ever achieve by acting alone.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to thank my fellow rapporteurs. There have been no shadows in this report; we have been equal rapporteurs, equal participants and without them we could not have presented this document today.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Battilocchio for the opinion he gave on behalf of the Committee on Development. More importantly, I would like to thank those people who sit behind us – sometimes seen, sometimes unseen: our assistants and our advisers, without whom we could not do this work. Those people are so rarely thanked.</p>
<p class="contents">So let me say once again, we have achieved a great deal. We have reinforced the role of the Parliament, especially in the re-introduction of internal borders. We have reinforced the role of the Commission, but again I wish we could have done more in relation to spot checks on the application of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span>, which was not possible. I wanted us to have a right of appeal or for the European Court of Justice to have jurisdiction. We did not achieve this, but we achieved a great deal more. On non-discrimination akin to Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, for example, there is the right of people undergoing second line checks to have those checks conducted with dignity and, if necessary, in a non-public area. On refusal of entry, there will be clearer explanations of the justification of that refusal and the right of appeal once the appellant has returned to their country of origin. And where appeals are successful, the necessary compensation will be provided according to national law and corrections. We have reinforced and upheld the principle of freedom of movement for EU citizens and others with a right to reside which, in a Eurobarometer poll, was seen as the single biggest benefit of being in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As an inclusion to the main body of text, the annexes are extremely important when we come to adopt and review this regulation in future. Regular reports on the implementation of the regulation are to be compiled by the Commission. Also, very importantly, there is the declaration by the Council and the Parliament on the issue of stateless citizens which states that ‘the European Parliament and the Council request the Commission to bring forward proposals, in the framework of the revision of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, in order to exempt holders of aliens’ and non-citizens’ passports residing in a Member State from the visa obligation’.</p>
<p class="contents">I am proud of what we have done, I am proud of the collaboration and I now wait to hear from my co-rapporteurs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His report supplements and includes a large number of the observations that I had set out in my opinion on this important topic drafted on behalf of the Committee on Development.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to highlight the political value of the fact, which in my opinion is very positive, that for the first time the Members of the European Parliament can follow the codecision process in this domain. Among the numerous opportunities that would be lost if the process of ratifying the European Constitution foundered, following the ‘no’ votes in France and the Netherlands, would also be that of embarking for the first time upon a policy on immigration shared by all of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">On this issue, the European Parliament has over and again established the need to balance the interests of the European citizens, immigrants, the Member States and developing countries. The equation is not easy, but an effort is required in order to achieve a balance between the need for security for our countries, which has to be upheld and safeguarded, and a policy of openness towards those who lawfully venture within our borders in search of improved living conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">It should in fact be remembered that, as the European Union, we also have humanitarian duties. It is therefore right to implement the necessary controls at border crossings in order to regulate the influx of those seeking visas and asylum, but we cannot, however, avoid adopting a global approach of solidarity and respect for human rights, particularly in humanitarian crisis situations, such as in the recent cases of the tsunami and of Darfur.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens of third countries have to be thoroughly informed about the immigration rules and about the control methods; the criteria for refusing access have to be objective and verifiable, with a view to preventing the unpleasant, and, alas, frequent episodes of discrimination, which to date still occur. Strict controls based on a clear set of rules and respect for the rights of the individual: Community action in this delicate area must be based on this inseparable pairing. It will not be easy, but it is a challenge that today’s Europe has to accept and overcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur, at one point, believed that a modification should be proposed, specifically the derogation of Article 22 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, and presented Amendments 85 and 70. In accordance with Article 22 of the Convention, foreigners should declare their entry to the competent authorities, either on entry or within three working days of entry, and the Member States should establish the conditions and exceptions in the field.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs raised the issue with the Committee on Legal Affairs and, having studied it, the latter came to the conclusion that that proposed amendment would make it necessary to review the legal basis and that Article 62(1) and Article 62(2) would not be sufficient, but that Article 62(3) of the Treaty would also be necessary, since Article 62(3) of the Treaty refers to the conditions in which third-country nationals can travel freely in the territory of the Member States for a period of no longer than three months.</p>
<p class="contents">That was the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. The rapporteur subsequently reached an agreement with the Committee in this regard and did not consider it necessary to continue with his amendment, and it is not therefore now necessary to change the legal basis. In any event, perhaps the only value of this work is that we know that, in the case of the reference to the Schengen Agreements, not only will the reference to paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 62 be necessary, but also the reference to paragraph 3. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It falls within the context of the Treaty of Amsterdam, thanks to which the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> has been incorporated within the European framework.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the first real opportunity for this Parliament to deal with the issue in its entirety, keeping in mind the fact that the proposal has been transferred from the consultation process to the codecision process as a result of the decision made by the Council of the Hague.</p>
<p class="contents">This complex and substantial proposal has two main objectives: firstly, to consolidate the rules in force on the crossing of external borders, as laid down in the Schengen framework; secondly, to further develop the subject, particularly with regard to the crossing of internal borders.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal is broken down into four titles: the first contains general provisions; the second regulates the crossing of external borders and conditions for entry in the Schengen area; the third deals with internal borders, reaffirming the abolition of all border controls and stipulating the cases and the procedures in which such controls can be reintroduced; and the fourth contains the final provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">A large proportion of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur aim at clarifying a number of the elements of the Commission proposal only in terms of the language used. Such changes are designed to improve the quality of the text, and, simultaneously, to clarify and simplify the articles. All of that will be highly beneficial when the code on the crossing of borders definitively enters into force and becomes an item of everyday reference for the border guards and the authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has worked commendably, in close cooperation with all of the shadow rapporteurs and political groups, in addition to checking first-hand how the borders are crossed today. Thanks to this ongoing dialogue, the rapporteur has fulfilled all of the requests submitted to him. He has, moreover, taken part in lengthy negotiations with the Council, with the Luxembourg Presidency, and it is therefore desirable that the report is put to the vote during the current presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise that has been reached with the various political groups, with the agreement of the Council and the Commission, has been put to the vote and unanimously approved by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. I personally made sure before the vote in committee that Vice-President Frattini’s office was also in favour of the report, and I also received confirmation of this from the very positive outlook on each individual amendment tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">Precisely as a result of this general consensus, which was reached by means of a complex series of bilateral and multilateral compromises, the report should not be subjected to changes at the present time, and it is therefore desirable that it is adopted in full. Having followed its development and having thoroughly established that no problem exists, I personally, as shadow rapporteur, propose that, through our vote, we give our full support to the rapporteur, whom I wholeheartedly thank for the valuable work he has carried out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Because asylum, refugee policy and immigration are issues to which we in the committee devote a lot of time, it was necessary initially to obtain clear rules on the Community Code and the movement of persons across borders. The fact that we can now revise controls and jointly strengthen the external borders means that the EU’s borders become more secure. Criminals, drug traffickers and human traffickers who import women and children for the purposes of prostitution will have fewer opportunities to move freely across borders, while other people, despite their foreign appearance, can now feel welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">When, tomorrow, we vote in favour of the report, we shall be able to get to grips with one of the committees’ major tasks: asylum and immigration policy. We have so many shared questions about how we in the EU are to safeguard the values referred to. We want of course to see a more open EU, but that requires common solutions and respect for countries, as well as respect between countries and between people and groups. That is the first step. Thank you again for a very constructive report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My thanks go to those who are seated behind Mr Frattini today. I wish to thank Mr Cashman, who, in the face of widespread scepticism, in which I initially shared, sought to reach agreement with the Council at first reading. Congratulations, Michael! But I also wish to extend my congratulations to the Luxembourg Presidency for showing the necessary drive and tenacity to stay on course while encouraging the essential compromises. It is indeed a marvellous Little Big Land, this Grand Duchy of Luxembourg!</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I had three particular concerns about this dossier. The first was that, while guaranteeing the rights of the beneficiaries of freedom of movement under Community law, the instrument must also keep open the option of conducting the checks required for the identification at external borders of persons registered for refusal of admission and wanted persons. The agreement reached on this point, which is reflected in the wording of Article 6(2), corresponds very precisely to the spirit of the amendment I had tabled myself but is an improvement on my proposal, and I am delighted with that.</p>
<p class="contents">It seemed to me – and this was my second concern – that, in cases where nationals of non-EU countries were refused entry to the territory of the Union, their rights ought to be clearly defined and made known to the parties concerned, but at the same time security requirements had to be rigorous. The people of Europe do not want their external borders to be controlled by thugs, but neither do they want to have them controlled by blinded and limbless eunuchs. The provision that is set out today in Article 11(13) is a good provision, and I am delighted about that – just as I am delighted, Mr President, by the confirmation of the exceptional nature of the reintroduction of checks at external borders and by the more prominent role assigned to the Commission and Parliament. In view of these three grounds for satisfaction, it will give me pleasure to vote in favour of this report, and the entire Group will do likewise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The various groups within this House have amply demonstrated their ability to cooperate jointly and effectively, both among themselves and with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give an example of the sort of case that could occur, the sort of case with which we were faced when we began work on this dossier. A citizen of a third country wishing to enter the EU, and holding a visa to do so, could be refused entry if he was unable to produce all the required documents at a border crossing point. This would have resulted in a stamp being placed in his passport showing that he had been refused entry to the EU. It is hardly likely that the person in question would then have been able to travel to the USA, Canada or Australia with a stamp of this kind in his passport.</p>
<p class="contents">The point I should particularly like to emphasise is therefore that we have succeeded in enshrining the right to appeal in the regulation, following lengthy negotiations. The most important consequence of this is that all stamps indicating refusal of entry into the EU will be corrected in cases where entry has been refused for no good reason.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also achieved other, equally significant improvements for third–country nationals. Human dignity must be respected during border controls, and discrimination on any grounds is prohibited. In a nutshell, our joint efforts have resulted in a solution which means that checks on those crossing the EU’s external borders will become a great deal more welcoming. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Doing all of that within a codecision procedure is a great achievement and we have learned a lot from the way that cooperation has taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a great success because Members like me have observed that reaching a compromise between security at border control on the one hand, and fairness on the other, is very difficult. Therefore I commend in this report – the first time in a codecision report since the Article 13 directives went through this Parliament – the fact that we have an explicit reference to anti-discrimination and to the dignity of people while carrying out border checks. There is a huge hidden minority of people that are harassed and victimised at borders. Mr Cashman has understood this, he has put it explicitly in his report and he has created the balance that we all wanted to see. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
