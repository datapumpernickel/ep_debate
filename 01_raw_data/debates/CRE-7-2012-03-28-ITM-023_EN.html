Having said that, such measures should not be applicable to non-public corporations. Corporate governance rules are naturally necessary to regulate the relationship between shareholders, directors and managers. If the number of shareholders is not large, irrespective of their size or business, there is no need for corporate governance. Moreover, such rules are not appropriate for SMEs where flexibility is of the essence. So, the key points of this report, as well as of the future corporate governance legislation, should strengthen the ties between a company and both its non-executive directors and its shareholders.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect a clear demarcation line should be drawn between the attributions of the chairman of the board and the chief executive officer. Furthermore, non-executive directors should have a professional background, an expertise, for instance former executives from other companies in the same or another industry or in the same or another market. Such qualifications are necessary because it is the board that selects the officers and furthermore watches over their activity in order to report to shareholders and supervisors.</p>
<p class="contents">To perform this properly they should be trained and skilled. Moreover, the number of seats that one director can hold should be limited, except in the situation where the companies on whose board the director sits are members of the same group or where the director is performing this role as a representative of an institutional investor where he holds his main job. The composition of the board should also be more diverse and the role of non-residents – for multinational companies – and of women should be increased.</p>
<p class="contents">Shareholders should be more involved, to stimulate their appetite to participate in decision-making within the company, even if their investment is just for a short period of time. Electronic voting could be a solution and the Commission should evaluate this possibility based on a cost-benefit ratio.</p>
<p class="contents">Shareholders should receive the same amount of information from the company, irrespective of their stake. Cooperation between shareholders should also be allowed. In some Member States this is forbidden when it comes to voting. A conflict of interests between shareholders and the company, for instance transactions with related parties, should lead to the shareholders concerned, irrespective of the size of their stake, refraining from voting. Minority shareholders should be protected against the abusive decisions of the dominant one, but without giving the opportunity to allow harassing behaviour by the former.</p>
<p class="contents">Risk behaviour should be approved by the board and publicly disclosed, and the bonuses of officers should be linked more to long-term results in order to discourage risky behaviour that endangers the company in the long run. Furthermore, the remuneration policy of both directors and officers should be approved by the general meeting of shareholders.</p>
<p class="contents">The report aims also to strengthen the role of the audit, nomination and remuneration committees. The key issue of this report will be mandatory norms versus compliance with plain principle and I am glad that the PPE point of view in favour of the latter prevailed after the vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Last, but not least, all such measures to be introduced should be considered based on the cost of each measure, for instance periodic mandatory appraisal. The Commission should then come up with a set of tools contained in a European Code of Conduct which will leave the main corporate governance instruments to be applied by public corporations, customised in certain matters in accordance with the policy of each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The final goal of the future legislative report that is yet to come, later this year, is to preserve the strength of our corporations and make them important global actors, protecting their competitiveness and, as a consequence, securing jobs and profits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an important point for us and I see it, in a sense, as the first high point of a collective consultation process, Mr Bodu, to which we, on behalf of the Commission, tried to give significant impetus with the Green Paper in April.</p>
<p class="contents">This study and consultation process found an audience. It meets a genuine need. We have noted significant participation of all economic, social and scientific players from throughout Europe, with almost 400 responses, honourable Members, which is a very sizeable number. This participation is on a par with what is at stake: Europeans’ confidence in their companies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my belief that when we speak of sustainable economic performance, and that is what our people expect, and employment and growth, there are a number of pre-conditions: the large single market – our shared collective area of economic and social life – innovation, investment, and we should not forget good governance and social cohesion in companies. Those are the essential prerequisites for sustainable economic performance.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, it is not only in the financial sector that we have to restore people’s confidence. That is why, in my opinion, Mr Bodu, honourable Members, the European Parliament also has a central role to play here too from the point of view of good governance.</p>
<p class="contents">When we look at the results of this consultation process, there are naturally many points on which there is agreement, particularly on the need for a new European corporate governance framework. Yet, there is very clear support for European measures in particular areas: transparency in remuneration, identification of shareholders and monitoring of proxy advisers.</p>
<p class="contents">Your resolution, Mr Bodu, is a good reflection of this trend: precise, timely, effective action in a certain number of specific areas. However it is too early, as far as I am concerned, for me to comment on all the points that you raise. However, as is my custom, I shall pay a great deal of attention to what Parliament says, to what it will say through this resolution, and that will be extremely useful in giving direction to our future proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to raise two points briefly. The first concerns diversity on management boards. I find that this is a very important point because I believe that this kind of diversity on management boards and on supervisory boards also provides more effective corporate governance. I am convinced that a governance framework must, if it is to be credible, include measures to enhance this diversity and I fully intend, honourable Members, to include this point in the initiatives that we are preparing. I believe, specifically, that decision-making bodies should be more open to women. My services are currently working on a measure to require greater transparency from companies as regards their diversity policy in management boards.</p>
<p class="contents">We have indeed already done so in certain texts which are under discussion: a text that President Karas knows well, the Capital Requirements Directives (CRD 4), of which he is rapporteur, and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), for diversity measures to promote women, particularly in the boards of management of financial institutions. We have also entered into discussions with Ms Reding on this point. She herself has undertaken a consultation process. We are working, as I said before, on a proposal to enhance corporate transparency, to increase diversity on boards and we are not averse to proposing quantitative measures (quotas or flexiquotas) to improve the balance of men and women particularly on the boards of listed companies. As far as I am concerned, I am personally in favour of such measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point relates to company law, Mr Bodu. Let us, as you suggest, take a broad view. We cannot separate corporate governance from company law. I think that they are both closely linked. That is why I wanted to have two broad themes, ‘corporate governance’ on the one hand, and ‘European company law’ on the other, to create a coherent common framework.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, six weeks ago we launched a consultation on the future of European company law. The results will be available very soon (late May/early June). This approach, along with our work on governance, that I have just mentioned, will enable us to prepare future initiatives in a more consistent and effective manner. However, I am able to tell you right now that in October 2012 I shall present a work programme in these two areas with a list of concrete initiatives supporting a major project: the long-term development of responsible companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Previously Member States have taken different approaches in how they promote good corporate governance, often as a result of their different company law. It is time to establish best practice across the EU to improve corporate governance for all companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Best practice is constantly evolving, and setting prescriptive rules may hinder the development of new methods and techniques that improve the overall corporate governance of companies. This is why we welcome Mr Bodu’s report, which has achieved broad cooperation and support for the principle of ‘comply or explain’.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the issues in the field of corporate governance are not black and white and overly defined rules could lead to a tick-box approach, which could take us back many years. We want better qualified directors and more actively engaged shareholders to ensure better run companies across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECR does not support mandatory quotas on company boards, but does support the many voluntary moves that are currently under way to encourage more diversity, not just on boards but at all levels of management of companies.</p>
<p class="contents">And a plea to the Commissioner: forced diversity often does not bring the same benefits that the voluntary schemes provide in terms of overall cultural change, especially in changing how business leaders choose to manage their companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">But how can corporate governance be improved? I believe that the methods indicated in the report by Mr Bodu are a useful tool for closely examining and developing this reasoning. There is a need for greater transparency in current governance and firms must be willing and able to adopt socially responsible practices, but no longer on a voluntary basis, but by introducing constraints that are also accompanied by stimulation and incentives.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, the labour and the rights of those working in corporations must always be respected, whatever their level of responsibility. For this reason, there are three characteristics that are of greater value than others. We must first encourage women’s representation through gender quotas. I say this explicitly: moral persuasion in this case will not lead us anywhere. We then need to capitalise on shareholders’ involvement irrespective of their origin, whether they be workers or outsiders to the corporation. Finally, if we really want practical sustainability goals, a significant portion of wages and salaries also needs to be linked to these and therefore serve as an incentive to achieving the final objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the subject matter of the report and this is the reason why this report is important for us today.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one thing, however, which I believe is missing from the report, namely a more decisive approach to the issue of quotas for women’s representation on company boards. We already know that soft approaches to this issue do not deliver results, and for this reason I am very pleased that Mrs Reding is now talking about hard-hitting and decisive quotas, and the Commissioner has also spoken of this matter today. Unfortunately this does not appear in the report on which we will be voting tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">At a meeting today of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) different opinions were expressed, but there was an clear majority of those in favour of hard-hitting and stringent quotas, which is something that I welcome greatly, as they do not impose any restrictions on economic freedom or on the freedom of companies. All that they do is to make boards of companies more socially responsible. Various studies have shown that boards and companies where there is a better gender balance deliver better economic results. I hope that we will support quotas tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first is a strong recommendation from the Committee on the Internal Market relating to professional and social diversity in company management boards. This concern can be found in the Bodu report, which points out that management boards should include independent individuals with a mix of skills, experiences and backgrounds. We insist, and we made this point strongly at the International Cooperation (INCO) conference, on the diversity of professional and personal backgrounds.</p>
<p class="contents">Another priority for our Committee: that there should be balanced European proposals as regards the release of information to shareholders in annual reports. We stress the crucial need for transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Our final recommendation concerns, naturally, the principles of parity and equal treatment.

If we want to make the functioning of the European business sector more efficient by making changes to corporate governance that are sensible and – what is even more important – possible to implement in the free market, then we should support the report by our colleague Sebastian Bodu. I agree that, in these times of crisis, European companies must pay attention not just to economic outcomes, as after all it is they that generate employment, but also a wide range of social and environmental issues, as well as their own shareholders. The provisions negotiated by our rapporteur encourage greater transparency, stability and reliability of European companies at the same time as corporate social responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course I understand that for some MEPs these recommendations are too weak and do not go far enough. However, I would repeat the question that I asked at the beginning. Do we want to put forward proposals that sound good but are unrealistic or do we want to bring about real change? I believe that the provisions concerning governance and operations as regards both substantive issues and technicalities, as well as the introduction of the ‘comply or explain’ principle into all companies and the corporate governance code will make it possible to create a better and more functional system.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be borne in mind, however, that the introduction of corporate governance principles will not mean that companies are protected against the risks borne by every economic entity as regards their activities. Good management means sensible and balanced management that takes into account the interests of all stakeholders. Let us remember that we are also speaking here of private companies, companies that are functioning in the free Union market, and companies of which we like to boast loudly and often. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is about learning the right lessons from the crisis and from the collapse of Lehman Brothers, on the basis of a corporate culture which is controlled by greed and short-term profit and which has caused and continues to cause huge amounts of damage. However, companies are not aliens. They are not little green men from Mars operating in a vacuum. On the contrary, they are part of our society and this is why we need fair, long-term rules on corporate governance.</p>
<p class="contents">The Bodu report is totally unsuitable for this purpose. It is of key importance, and I am quoting the Commission here, that European companies take the greatest possible responsibility for their employees, their shareholders and society as a whole. This concept also forms the basis for the alternative motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. We need clear, binding rules on corporate governance and we also need sanctions. Self-regulation and the comply-or-explain principle have failed miserably. In the case of corporate governance, self-regulation is either a marketing ploy or simply a well-intentioned approach and good intentions very often fail to hit the mark.</p>
<p class="contents">An important factor in the lasting success of a company is the involvement not only of shareholders, but also of other stakeholders. I am thinking here of the inclusion of employees and their representatives on boards of directors and supervisory boards. They have an interest in the long-term success of the company and, after all, this is all about achieving long-term success. It is also important to ensure transparency by publishing all managers’ salaries and by extending the scope to all listed companies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to touch on the very passionate discussion about quotas for women. The Commission and Ms Reding are promoting the concept of quotas in a very credible way. This House, the European Parliament, has often done the same thing. The subject of mandatory quotas for women is, of course, hugely important in the context of corporate governance rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Normally in the Committee on Legal Affairs, when it comes to own-initiative reports, in other words, non-legislative proposals, we try to bring all the political groups on board by means of compromises. On this occasion we did not succeed and that is a good thing, because in the case of corporate governance there are fundamental differences in the political perspectives of the Social Democrats and the Greens on the one hand and the Liberals, the Christian Democrats and the Conservatives on the other. For example, we believe that the comply-or-explain system is a useful tool in corporate governance. Any deviation from the code of conduct should be justified in an appropriate way and the alternative corporate governance measure that is taken should be described and explained.</p>
<p class="contents">Calling for binding rules in this area, as the Social Democrats do in their alternative motion for a resolution, involves intervening to an excessive extent in companies’ freedom to do business and this is unacceptable, particularly when it is not dependent on the size of the company. Listed companies, some of which are small organisations, must not be lumped together with non-listed companies and small and medium-sized enterprises, especially given the additional call for sanctions to be imposed whenever there is a well-justified deviation from the code of conduct. This is pure socialism.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot simply force companies to accept the German or Austrian codetermination model in the light of the different corporate cultures in other Member States, even if this would perhaps prevent a few unnecessary strikes of the kind that often take place in southern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to discuss the quotas for women. We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have tabled a far-reaching amendment concerning the representation of women on boards. We are not fully in agreement within our group and we have heard the same thing from speakers from other groups. Nevertheless, I hope that this issue will receive broad support. In future, I would like to see the Commission giving more consideration to the dual structure that we have in Europe and not focusing solely on the system with a single board. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, this is not covered by this report to the extent that we would have liked. As the previous speaker has already said, there were very different approaches here. One of these concerned social responsibility and long-term thinking, rather than focusing only on short-term profit margins in boards and in shareholders’ meetings. This was about resolving the question of who the companies should be responsible to. Is it a narrow view of responsibility which restricts itself to boosting short-term profits and focuses all the activities of the business on this area? Or do we have an obligation to go a step further in this respect? This structure is not here for nothing. Its purpose is to include other aspects, such as the codetermination of employees, longer-term thinking and focusing on factors other than short-term profit. We would like to see not just clever explanations or attractive websites with references to social responsibility, but also opportunities for imposing sanctions. Otherwise this simply will not work.</p>
<p class="contents">That also applies to the quotas for women. Once again I would like to make it very clear that, unfortunately, nothing has ever happened of its own accord for the women of this world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From the series of bankruptcies seen over the past few years we can conclude that responsible governance in itself is insufficient to prevent excessive risk-taking, and therefore there is a need to set up independent auditing and flexible rules that respect differences between the various corporate cultures. Initiatives for corporate governance must be accompanied by initiatives for the social responsibility of corporations. However, it is not advisable to confuse these two; this matter also spurred serious disputes during the preparation of this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that the report’s main concerns are extremely complex technical and theoretical solutions related to governance, it still comes as a great surprise that it is the matter of quotas that is generating heated disputes. What I find even more surprising is that even the opinions of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection focused on this aspect. I believe that when discussing boards of directors we cannot avoid the matter of diversity, but I find that this is indeed not a central issue and the fate of the report should not depend on it. In my opinion we do need to be mindful of this issue, but professional background and expertise should definitely be taken into account, and should be just as important as diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The financial crisis is evidence of this, if it were needed. Since 2008 Parliament and the Council have taken responsibility, and agreed a raft of measures to better regulate the financial services sector. The process has started and needs to continue, but equally there needs to be a complete overhaul of the entire corporate governance framework. When confronted with corporate governance scandals too often the response is that these were isolated cases, things are different now, but sadly this is not the case.</p>

Making good corporate governance is not an optional extra.

I am convinced that in this way the system of governance can be rendered more flexible and can be brought closer to the practices of everyday life. Furthermore, the new regulatory system is in conformity with the system for the corporate governance of companies providing financial services, and promotes the setting of rules of conduct for companies at national level. An own-initiative proposal for the Commission to draft a governance package comprising acknowledged best practices in order to allow SMEs, the driving force of the internal market, to operate under increasingly uniform conditions has also been included in the report.

<p class="contents">Ms Swinburne said that we should not adopt a tick-box approach. Mr Zwiefka said: ‘We should keep some unrealistic proposals’. I agree. Indeed, that is why we are taking the time to have a consultation process and in particular to take account of the Green Papers. I am taking the time to consult so as not to improvise proposals about new and good governance. Mr Bodu’s report has provided an extremely useful contribution within the time frame set aside for consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of you have spoken about diversity and parity between men and women. Naturally, that is not the only subject, but it is an important subject and we should focus, as is our intention in our proposals, primarily on transparency as regards diversity policies. We still have not tackled the question of mandatory quotas. I had told you that I had my own opinion on this subject, and so does Ms Reding, indeed our views are similar. I also agree with what Mr Cofferati and Ms Kolarska-Bobińska have said, and also with what Ms Prendergast said a moment ago.</p>
<p class="contents">In a company and in the community represented by that company, all employees must be respected, and in this context of respect, there is also a concern for greater diversity and for women normally to be more present, particularly in management positions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to Mr Zwiefka, to Ms Swinburne, to Ms Ford, that the Commission is well aware of the different national systems of governance. The flexibility of the European model offers an advantage to our companies which, as we all know, must compete with China, India and the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, corporate governance, and I say this also to Ms Gáll-Pelcz, is not a question of principles alone. A whole part of this governance is included in company law which regulates issues of external and internal monitoring, as well as in decision-making mechanisms and the separation of powers within companies, particularly in the Shareholders’ Rights Directive, the Audit Directive, the Transparency Directive, the Takeover Directive and in the regulations, which I believe are still insufficient, on directors’ remuneration.</p>
<p class="contents">This is indeed company law and we are working on this and not only on principles. It is true to say, honourable Members, that corporate governance is often a question of behaviour, but in other areas as well, there are useful, binding rules which govern people’s behaviour, for example the highway code or the penal code. Therefore, our problem is essentially one of finding a fair balance between these two demands, and here I am addressing Ms Ţicău, who mentioned this subject. The Commission is working on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Regner mentioned the scope of the measures that we intend to take, and I can confirm that we shall apply rules to all listed companies. This is an issue, Ms Regner, on which there is no dispute and all listed companies, at least, will be governed by these rules. We shall pay particular attention, and I also say this to Ms Thein, who spoke of the difficulty and the characteristics of small and medium-sized enterprises, in this area as in others, to the situation of small and medium-sized enterprises. We should probably not impose on these small enterprises the same constraints as we do on other larger enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cofferati, Ms Le Grip, Ms Bauer, Ms Lichtenberger and Ms Dăncilă have all spoken about social responsibility. This autumn we shall propose rules on the transparency of non-financial information, and corporate social and ecological responsibility, and I thank you, as I do Ms Regner, for your support for the need, in certain areas, for binding rules. I too do not believe in self-regulation in certain areas. It has shown its limitations, so to speak, in the area of financial regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Le Grip mentioned the priorities of the Commission and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO): the single market, diversity, independence, shareholder information, transparency. We are in agreement with all these priorities and you will indeed find them in our action plan. I should also like to point out to several of you, to Ms Bauer, to Ms Costello and Ms Regner, that all our proposals fit well within the global regulatory framework and the lessons that we are learning, week after week, from the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">This crisis has not finished, and we have not stopped learning from it. If you look closely at my agenda, which President Karas knows well, and which I am offering you, we are endeavouring to learn week after week what we can from the shortcomings and failures and, often, irresponsible behaviour. I think that good corporate governance is one of the lessons that we must learn from this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Thein asked a specific question on the particular nature of the dual structure with an executive board and a supervisory board, with which we are all familiar. This particular feature does not exist in every country; having said that, some problems do indeed exist regardless of what structure is used. Consequently, a lack of diversity and a lack of transparency on remuneration exist whatever structure is being used. The aim of the Green Paper was not to tackle all the issues but rather to launch discussion, and this question was asked in the Green Paper. We will therefore now, on the basis of impact assessments, make proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">That is it and I would like, honourable Members, to thank you. Echoing what Ms Mazej Kukovič said just now, I would like to welcome the fact that all the MEPs who spoke emphasised the need for good governance, for better governance, with greater transparency, greater diversity, greater responsibility, more long-term commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the spirit in which the Commission will work, in the light of Mr Bodu’s report, and it will go possibly even further in some areas, following its own lines, in relation to the proposals that we will make over the months to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner Barnier, I want to propose collaboration on the following issue, which should put an end to successive debates on various reports dealing in fact with other topics besides the topic of possible quotas of women’s representation on boards of directors. Therefore, I propose that we, here in Parliament, before receiving the Commission’s legislative proposal for the European Parliament, express our view on a separate report having a single topic: that of women’s participation in boards of directors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It calls for the elaboration and implementation of legislative measures, including quotas to increase female representation on corporate boards to 40 % by 2020. There have been discussions on whether the principle of gender quotas contradicts the principle of high professional qualifications in corporate appointments. I strongly believe that respect for gender equality and high professionalism go hand-in-hand. I am confident that responsible companies are able to appoint to their boards more women whose professional qualifications are higher than those of candidates found through the ‘old-boys networks’. Figures show that progress in the area of corporate leadership has been extremely slow, despite national, European and international commitments to equality between women and men and despite the legislative and voluntary measures some countries have taken. Women’s representation on the boards of Europe’s largest companies is still lower than 3 %! I hope that this resolution will help to improve this shameful statistic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Green Paper itself relies on a study susceptible to bias: the draftsman, Mr Jacques de Larosière, Chairman of the High-Level Group on Financial Supervision in the EU, presented the study to the Commission in February 2009, at which time he was also an advisor to the president of a giant financial institution, BNP Paribas. This case demonstrates how light-heartedly the current framework of corporate governance assimilates potential conflicts of interests. The paper also fails to adequately address the role that compliance departments should develop in the context of social corporate responsibility objectives. Stricter rules at EU level should be developed to ensure that reports under the ‘comply or explain’ approach are thoroughly drafted and sufficiently informative. I encourage a remuneration policy based on transparency, where the disclosure of directors’ remuneration is mandatory. Directors’ remuneration should reflect the long-term viability of the company concerned. I consider that European rules on corporate governance should apply to all companies having an economic impact beyond a set threshold, regardless of whether or not they are listed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Naturally, in a time of crisis, every company gives priority to its financial results, as it wants to survive in a market that is becoming ever more challenging. Nevertheless, in my opinion, we should not forget about the human factor, as the effect of factors such as high social and ethical standards is to improve productivity in companies, and employees always wish to be associated with such standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of the solutions proposed by the rapporteur could have a decisive impact on improving the companies operating in the European market. The proposals for the introduction of certain quality standards for company boards, even if this merely involves emphasising that members of the board should possess a wide and varied set of skills, and in particular competencies, will help companies to grow more effectively.

A year ago, the Commissioner responsible for gender equality, Ms Reding, challenged listed companies in Europe to commit to voluntary action to increase the number of women in management positions. Only 24 companies replied to the survey, and last year the number of women on corporate boards grew only slightly, from 11.8% to 13.7%. The fact that Ms Reding’s initiative failed clearly shows that voluntary action is not enough to boost equality in corporate management.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Reding said a year ago that if voluntary action is not enough, then binding measures would have to be introduced. Last year, Parliament gave its support to Ms Reding’s initiative, and so it must now call for more robust efforts to increase equality. Parliament is to vote on the EU’s corporate governance framework for European companies, which demands clear goals for gender equality. By 2015, 30% of either gender must be represented in corporate management, and by 2020 that figure should be 40%. At the current rate, this target would not be achieved until the latter half of this century.</p>
<p class="contents">Non-discrimination in policy-making is not only a matter of equality: it is also one of quality. The larger the group from which the decision-makers are selected, the more diverse and better quality the decisions.

The EU financial transaction tax is a salty treat for Members, which they shake so vigorously on to so many reports that I am worried about their blood pressure. This report has been spiced up with the House’s other favourite condiment: quotas for women in the boardroom. Why should a perfectly reasonable report which promotes good corporate governance, which underpins jobs and growth in the EU, be peppered with unreasonable references to boardroom quotas? Quotas are intimidation not motivation, to say nothing of the way in which they patronise women. We need voluntary targets to persuade more company chairmen to appoint women to their boards, not bullying from Brussels. I am not suggesting that women should stay in the kitchen with their salt shaker and their pepper pot, but I hope that Members will soon realise that they are over-seasoning many of the reports which pass through this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
