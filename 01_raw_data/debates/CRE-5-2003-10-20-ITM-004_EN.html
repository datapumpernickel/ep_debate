<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Redondo Jiménez (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, when approximately a year ago we voted here on this Parliament's report at first reading and we achieved a sufficient majority to support the thesis I was advocating, I felt as if I had the strong support of the whole of Parliament. I was advocating that this Parliament needed to demonstrate political firmness in relation to the proposed Forest Focus Regulation, which the Commission was presenting as a replacement for the two former regulations on pollution: combating pollution in Europe and combating fires in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed law presented by the Commission added to these two objectives – ‘pollution’ and ‘fires’ – the study of biodiversity, climate change and carbon retention. The Commission said that all of this had to be done with less money – with EUR 51 million – and that, furthermore, the prevention aspect of combating fires would be transferred to rural development. In this way, this Parliament abandoned codecision for a mere opinion, without being able to control whether these programmes were going to be complied with or not, since they were being left to the Member States and were being transferred to a regulation whose control by Parliament was reduced to an opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament was not therefore politically able to accept that proposal, nor could it accept it when the Council’s common position was communicated and discussed and a small effort was made, of half a million euros, increasing the sum from EUR 13 million to EUR 13.5 million, which represented a minimal effort in terms of assessing our forests. It is not sufficient to say that we believe in them, but rather our support should be reflected in a greater budgetary increase, in a greater effort, since this is the only regulation we have for our forests.</p>
<p class="contents">We have held numerous meetings, both with the Council and the Commission, in order to reach an agreement and in order that this may become a significant commitment, and this is going to be achieved tomorrow in this Parliament, God willing. A proposal has been received from the Council and accepted in Coreper, which takes account of those principal and priority needs which Parliament had described at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 1 places the prevention of fires on an equal footing with the other objectives of the Forest Focus Regulation. Article 13 sets a budgetary increase, not the amount we would have liked, but sufficient so that we could reach agreement amongst all the Member States, increasing it to EUR 61 million until 2006; in Article 18, Member States are urged to present an assessment of the Regulation before the end of 2005, and the Commission to present new proposals from 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">By means of this agreement, reached amongst the majority of political groups in this House, I hope that tomorrow we will be able to close this regulation at second reading and provide political impetus for European construction. It was very difficult for the countries of the European Union, especially those which have been ablaze this summer – in all corners of Europe, but essentially the countries of the south – to understand why prevention should not be included in this regulation. The fact that it has been introduced on an equal footing is a cause of satisfaction for us and I would essentially like to thank the Commission, the Commissioner and Marie Claude Blin, for their efforts in reaching this agreement; I would also like to thank the Council, which has worked hard so that we may reach this agreement, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs from all the political groups, who have moved forward so that this agreement would be possible at second reading and so that we would resolve an issue which presented us with a serious problem: combating fires. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to recall what Forest Focus is designed to do. The regulation aims to set up monitoring and reporting systems to help protect forests. Sound political decisions have to be based on reliable information, and I firmly believe that we need harmonised and comprehensive long-term monitoring of forests at Community level. This is also important so that the Community and Member States can implement activities agreed at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this core task of monitoring, I want to reassure you that the Commission places great importance on the need to ensure the continuity of the measures covered by the two previous regulations concerning the protection of forests against air pollution and fire. For this reason, since early summer, the Commission services have adopted a flexible approach in response to concerns expressed at the first reading stage by Parliament and the Member States. I am pleased to say that the Commission can agree to the compromise presented by Parliament and by the rapporteur, Mrs Redondo Jiménez. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I say outstanding because, despite serious initial concerns, we have finally reached this compromise agreement with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The European forest is very diverse: from the forests of Scandinavia to those of the Mediterranean, the problems we encounter are completely different. This summer, disaster struck southern Europe because of the drought and the heatwave. It was therefore important to include fire prevention, which was not at all clear at the outset.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Redondo Jiménez has explained so eloquently, we need to consider all of the different facets of our forests: we need to look at them from an environmental point of view and take into account the problems of pollution, but we also need to consider their economic, touristic and social functions. We need to compare different people's experiences and indeed take advantage of the good example set by the Scandinavian countries on forest management, but we also need to see our forests as part of our rural development strategy. There is no doubt that a good number of Member States need to reflect on the future of their forests.</p>
<p class="contents">Fire prevention requires us to keep farming our land. This should give critics of the common agricultural policy pause for thought.</p>
<p class="contents">The public should also be better informed in risk areas. Finally, and above all, replanting of the forests that have been destroyed needs to be carefully thought through and species chosen that are appropriate to the land and climate and more likely to withstand fire.</p>
<p class="contents">We can therefore only welcome the new financial framework for 2003 to 2006, which provides for EUR 61 million, EUR 9 million of which will be allocated to fire prevention. At last, we can exercise our full power of codecision because in 2006 we will also be evaluating what we have achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations have, it is true, been very lengthy, but the result is important for Europe. It is up to us to continue our efforts because, as our Commissioner said, this is an ongoing task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Forests are an important natural resource, and their sustainable management is vital, not only for natural diversity and ecological balance but also for our economy and prosperity. It is important to establish a common database regarding the condition of the forests and the environmental pollution from which they are under threat. This way we would be in a better position to ward off the threats and create a policy which will also safeguard our top quality forest resources in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">During Parliament’s debate the prevention of forest fires was added to the group of activities to be funded out of the programme in the Commission proposal. At the same time, Parliament has also been prepared to increase programme funding as part of the intergroup compromise. The Council in its common position was strongly opposed to both these points: both the inclusion of fire prevention activities and an increase in funding. The debates, however, have seen a clear convergence of opinion. Parliament, and the Commission too, have worked hard to bring the Council closer to Parliament’s position.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we have to see to it that there is consensus right to the end. If Parliament’s intergroup compromise is jeopardised in any way in tomorrow’s vote, the implementation of the entire plan will also be jeopardised, so I hope that the spiritual powers the rapporteur called upon will be present tomorrow in the vote.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of the compromise, too, the programme will cease at the end of 2006. The Commission should put forward a proposal to continue with action to protect forests from atmospheric pollution and other phenomena that weaken them.</p>
<p class="contents">We nevertheless have to bear in mind how diverse the European forests are. Fire prevention activities must be carried out by means of regional programmes in order to be able to address the most outstanding problems of each region and so that the activities involved are suited to forest types and climate. It is also important that the people in a region can become involved in these programmes. For this reason, when this programme work is undertaken in the future, these matters I think should be highlighted very clearly, and I believe that the Member States will supply valuable information before the Commission then puts forward its own proposal for after 2006. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the increase by millions of euros for the reconstruction of forests struck by disasters is extremely sensitive, but I believe that there must be democratic control in all the countries of the Mediterranean so that the investments of this Parliament in relation to information, prevention and repopulation are properly complied with, because otherwise we may find in a few years’ time that we have not moved forward, and that we are still affected by the atmospheric situation, by global warming and by bad management on the part of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been talking about diversity of forests throughout the whole of the European Union and we therefore believe that we must create a common forest policy for the whole of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the end of the day, the amounts at stake are modest and perhaps did not merit all of the political wrangling to reach this compromise. Nevertheless, the Greens are satisfied with the compromise that has finally emerged. In our view, this report could have been settled long ago, but we are reassured because the programme will, at long last, be able to be launched. It could have started as early as 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">We also wish to remind you that the measures in this programme are transitional ones and that the countries that have not invested in fire prevention would be well advised to do so before the review in 2006. We want the EU to find a happy medium at the next review, so as to strike a balance precisely between the two extremes: the countries of the North, which support subsidiarity in forest policy, and those in the South, which perhaps tend rather to knock on the door of the European treasury when problems arise.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, where the projects are concerned, we would ask that one of the factors in the selection process be biodiversity, because although it is true that it is difficult to explain what biodiversity is, we are very well aware of how important it is in the forestry environment. Reforestation, for example, should take the form of restoring the forest biodiversity that was damaged, if not totally destroyed, in the fires this summer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As at first reading, our group strongly supported the amendments tabled in Parliament, especially those of Mrs Redondo Jiménez, whom I congratulate on her work. These amendments concentrated on three central concerns of this new Forest Focus programme: the need to pay due attention to preventing forest fires, the need for the budgetary framework to be more open, and the need to pay clearer attention to the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">We supported the bulk of the amendments, therefore, both those tabled by the Commission and the other proposals by certain fellow Members of this House, some of whom are members of my own group. News of this compromise is welcome. It follows on from the debate held here last February at first reading, and is especially pertinent given the heightened awareness of this issue in the wake of this summer’s disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">I would simply like to use this opportunity to remind you of some of the resolutions we have adopted recently. In September the European Parliament insisted on the need to continue pursuing an effective prevention policy against forest fires, and reaffirmed that the Community should promote monitoring and prevention measures, especially within the framework of the Forest Focus Regulation. It insisted on the need to reallocate to the European Union the same financial resources approved under Regulation No 2158/92 on protection of the Community’s forests against fire, particularly with a view to financing appropriate measures to prevent forest fires, such as lines, firebreaks, forest trails, access points and water-points.</p>
<p class="contents">Even more recently, during the October part-session, when we mobilised the Solidarity Fund, this point was reiterated. I welcome the fact, therefore, that the Council and the Commission have finally become more open to Parliament’s continual requests and have allayed one of European public opinion’s great concerns. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Finland and Sweden together account for 40% of European forestry production, and that is the backbone of the biggest export business in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Sweden has a forestry law that is a hundred years old this year. Most forests are now certified, which means that forest owners themselves take responsibility for biodiversity.</p>
<p class="contents">Responsibility at local level is best. The European Union cannot, on this issue, be controlled in its entirety from Brussels. The Member States’ national forestry strategies and laws must be all-embracing, and the individual forest owner must have control of what he rightfully owns. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In its resolution on the effects of the summer heatwave, adopted on 4 September, a substantial majority of this House voted in favour of an amendment tabled on the initiative of my colleague Mr Savary, with the support of thirty-one Socialist Members, of whom I was one, insisting that the European Union be granted the same financial resources as it had under the regulation on protection of the Community's forests against fire, in particular so as to fund appropriate facilities to prevent forest fires, such as firebreaks, forest tracks, access points and water supply points.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me therefore to express my delight that the Council, thanks I might add to the perseverance of our rapporteur, Mrs Redondo Jiménez, is now finally acknowledging, at least to some extent, that our arguments are valid. We will in fact be asked to vote tomorrow on two amendments that partially meet our concerns. We therefore note that a step has been taken in the right direction. For all that, is it sufficient? Forest fires should remain one of our political priorities, one of the symbols of the solidarity between northern and southern Europe. I very much hope, therefore, that during the Commission's evaluation exercise in December 2005 the issue of an independent, European budget line, devoted to preventing forest fires, will again be raised, and that this will be done in close cooperation with all of the stakeholders, first and foremost the foresters.</p>
<p class="contents">We ought therefore, without prejudice of any kind, to consider whether the choice that is being made today is not to the detriment of a general safety policy, a policy that had proved to be very effective and was a visible sign of the European Union's presence in our regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, a forest ecosystem does not qualify as such merely by reason of the fact that it measures half a hectare; a set of criteria and preconditions are needed in order for an area to qualify as a forest ecosystem. Moreover, the report makes no reference to forests which have shrubbery and where trees account for less than 10%. Tens of millions of acres of forest ecosystem in my country, which are today protected by Greek legislation and are a basic protected factor, according to recent announcements by the government on the bill which, basically, brings Greek legislation into line with the proposed directive, are in danger of becoming the object of exploitation, with incalculable consequences on the forest ecosystem, on the subsoil, on water retention and on preventing floods and enriching the water table.</p>
<p class="contents">Any so-called forestry policy to date – and I quote my country as a typical bad example – has failed to address the basic problems of forest ecosystems; on the contrary, they have contributed to the privatisation of the forests, hence the large number of arson attacks, given that we are talking about fires, the rapid appearance of big business and speculation in ecosystems of huge size and importance, such as national trust lands and so on, and appropriations and changes of use, in the aim of stepping up speculation by making use of them for tourist and housing purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, mere lip service is being paid to a greater interest in forest ecosystems; in fact, the application of more general policies and economic options is hardening, with more suffocating control and complete indifference as to the peculiarities and actual requirements of the forest ecosystems of the Member States, again serving speculation by big business. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is excellent that the European Union is taking this important step to improve the condition of our forests and support a better and diverse forestry policy in all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Nordic countries, and Finland in particular, forests are especially important for recreation and the economy but also for nature conservation. The forests in the EU Member States are very different from one another owing, for example, to local natural conditions. The social significance of forests and the principal reason they are needed also vary in different parts of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Last summer we saw what sort of massive destruction forest fires cause. I am glad that Parliament has now also given attention to forest fire prevention in addition to monitoring activities. In particular I would like to express my support for Amendment No 19, which concerns the status of the Standing Forestry Committee. In my opinion, the Standing Forestry Committee should be involved in this programme and take account of coordination of forestry issues at EU level. The forthcoming enlargement of the EU will also mean the coordination of forestry policy will have to be improved. There are big differences between the current and the new Member States with regard to the forest ownership structure, and in the promotion of private forestry, for example, we Finns could be active in offering expert help to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, on the basis of our experience. Amendment No 4, which emphasises the multifunctional role of forests, is also welcome in my view. This is important, just as Amendment No 15 regarding compliance with the principle of subsidiarity is, because they both highlight the differences between forests and our regional and climatic conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The scheme quite rightly supports national forestry policies in Member States whilst respecting the specific ecological characteristics of the remoter regions of the EU. In future we have to stress the primary importance of national measures and the rules relating to the management of forests. The creation of norms and regulations governing the management of forests must in future, I think, fall within the powers of decision of each Member State. In this respect I also want to support the view of my colleague, Peder Wachtmeister, that the sustainable use of forests and decision-making in forestry matters are above all the responsibility of the forest owner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Protecting and preserving them is essential to our survival. We all know how important forests are to the planetary balance, to biodiversity and to economic activity, not to mention the aesthetic and environmental benefits they bring.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is concerned about the future of its forests and must start by using the way it protects its woodland areas to set an example. This applies from the Mediterranean to Scandinavia, since the problems of our forests know no frontiers. The Forest Focus Regulation seeks to draw on the experience of two previous regulations in order to create a long-term monitoring system designed to assess the state of the European Union’s forest ecosystem.</p>
<p class="contents">It also reveals lofty ambitions, aiming to embrace fields such as pollution, climate change, biodiversity, natural resources and soils. This is all well and good, but the regulation did have two weaknesses. The first was the cut in the total funding for achieving these lofty ambitions, a cut rendered scarcely less swingeing by the compromise obtained. The second weakness was the sacrifice of the fire prevention measures recommended for rural development programmes. The reintroduction of the fire-fighting dimension appeases us: progress has undeniably been made.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission promised that when it presented its communication on forestry strategy, as it is scheduled to do by the end of this year, it would include a proposal on plans for protection against fires. It goes without saying that that was not enough for us. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, our particular sensitivity to the issue of fires is understandable. The images of last summer’s towering infernos, which left a swathe of destruction in their wake, especially in Portugal, are still very vivid for us. The memory of such flames cannot easily be snuffed from the mind, or from the landscape. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we know, not only was this year no exception to that rule, but the situation reached tragic proportions in southern countries, and especially in Portugal, where 20 people died, 45 000 lost their sources of income, and it is estimated that more than 11% of woodland was consumed by the fires. The total cost is more than EUR 1.3 billion in direct damages.</p>
<p class="contents">This disaster provides ample proof that the European Union needs to promote measures for fighting forest fires, particularly at the level of prevention. A large majority in the European Parliament used the resolution of 4 September 2003, on the consequences of the summer heat wave, to indicate that that was its understanding of the situation. That resolution asked not only for more funds to bolster the Forest Focus programme, but also for the inclusion in that programme of adequate prevention measures consonant with the actions laid down in Regulation No 2158/92, which expired on 31 December 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to remind you that not all the fire prevention measures included in that regulation are covered by the forestry-related actions laid down in the recent Regulation No 1999/1257, on rural development. I mention this because continuity is important in relation to prevention measures, which are even more urgent under the present circumstances. The rapporteur rightly reiterates her insistence on including the prevention-related amendments tabled at first reading and then rejected by the Council. She also asks for an increase in the amounts for financing the Forest Focus programme. These are positive proposals which should be adopted once more by this Parliament and which I support. Moreover, I regret the fact that the final compromise does not consider all of these measures together. I feel that the need to preserve the heritage of our forests, combined with the high-risk situation of many woodland areas, means that the Council must accept these amendments, tabled by Parliament, on prevention and financing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">No wise man would deny that the value of forests is priceless. They have an environmental, a climatic, a health, an economic, a social, a cultural and, still more, a historic value. So when you have something which is priceless to look after, it is unacceptable to make comprises as regards the economic dimension of what you have to look after and the measures you take. Allow me to remind you that, 5 000 years ago and more, the ancient Greeks had put the care of the forests into the hands of the gods, while we compromise on what funds we shall make available – more or less – to save and look after this priceless, God-given treasure.</p>
<p class="contents">In all events, we must nonetheless be decisive in recording both the state of the forests and the information which is needed so that we can identify the cause of fires. We must fight the causes at their root if we are to be able to save the forests. We need to make an effort to increase citizens' sensitivity in the approach to and use made of forests. We must make provision for measures which will not allow fires to break out or to spread if they do break out. We must look after the forests and, finally, we must realise that forest fires do not obey the Schengen regulation. They pass borders without any control and the fires themselves have no borders. That is why there must be very close and very efficient cooperation between countries which belong to the European Union and others which do not belong and we must help each other to bring about the best possible result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It brings to mind the old proverb, ‘prevention is better than cure’. During his visit to the regions affected by the fires, Commissioner Barnier himself drew attention to this consideration. It has become abundantly clear that we need monitoring systems, but above all that we need to guard against the causes of woodland decline. Only by studying the causes and their effects will we be able to mount a relentless campaign to fight the fires. The prevention measures, therefore, aim to reduce the size of the affected areas, fight the causes of fire and monitor our forests. The European Union cannot content itself with monitoring the fires and taking action after the disaster has occurred. What is needed is a real prevention policy. The task, then, is not to impose unwanted measures on Portugal, but rather to devise tangible, robust courses of action that are compatible with the national forestry strategy currently being devised.</p>
<p class="contents">I would argue, therefore, that prevention should form an integral part of the Forest Focus programme, regardless of the regulation on rural development. When dealing with an issue as important as forests, one of Europe’s treasures, one cannot consider skimping on a few pennies. With a view to financing these prevention measures, therefore, I have already proposed increasing the amounts in the European Union’s general budget, by means of the financial perspective for the period up to 2006. No preventive measure can truly come into operation unless it is supported by adequate financial resources.</p>

Mr Folias, you are absolutely right that we cannot trust the gods to take responsibility for the forests. This summer's events – with such huge forest fires in Portugal and other countries – demonstrate that. I can, of course, see the link to climate change, where I guess the gods are crying over what we are doing to this planet and to our climate.</p>
<p class="contents">A second reading agreement is needed to ensure the continuity of the measures which have been carried out over a period of more than 15 years. A loss of one year over the monitoring of forest fires and the air pollution effects on forests would of course mean an information gap which can only be filled after several years of additional efforts. This must be avoided. The compromise approach would give the European Commission the time to reflect – together with Member States and stakeholders – on ways in which forest fire risks might be minimised, and on the possibilities of improving prevention measures in the most appropriate way after 2006. In this sense, I would encourage Members of the European Parliament to support the compromise proposal which aims to reach broad consensus. I should like to thank both the rapporteur and all Members once again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
