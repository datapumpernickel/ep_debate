<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Nassauer </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is probably the last time that we will be holding this debate under Article K.6. Once the Treaty of Amsterdam comes into force, our debate will not only be based on a new article, it will also be far more limited in scope, as it will only be concerned with police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. Madam President‐in‐Office, Mr President‐in‐Office, before I move on to the subject at hand, I would first like to make some procedural comments.</p>
<p class="contents">Up to now, we have normally held this debate at the end of a Council presidency, in December. This had the clear advantage that at least one of the Presidents‐in‐Office responsible could respond to Parliament. We really must insist on arrangements being made to return to that pattern in future. I concede that this is less an issue for the Council presidency than for Parliament itself, but this does need to be coordinated.</p>
<p class="contents">However, my second point is most definitely one for the Council. Traditionally, we get this debate underway with an oral question and a motion for a resolution. For years we have been calling on the Council to provide us with a written report as a basis for our debate. This would also have great advantages for the Council, as it could highlight what it sees as the key points and what it regards as successful achievements. Giving us a written report before this debate could not fail to improve cooperation with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution includes various requests about cooperation between Parliament and the Council that we have made before. However, during the Maastricht Treaty phase they never resulted in a proper procedure. Interestingly enough, the rather unfortunate wording concerning the most important aspects of the activities on which the Council is supposed to consult Parliament has been eliminated from the Treaty of Amsterdam, which I am pleased to say makes it clear exactly when Parliament is to be consulted and when it is just to be informed.</p>
<p class="contents">But a series of consultations has been overlooked even under the present wording – I shall come back to this point in a moment. The new arrangement we have requested provides for us to be kept informed about important developments, as stipulated in Article 39(2). This relates in particular, Madam President‐in‐Office, Mr President‐in‐Office, to Council meetings, including informal ones.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament should not have to piece together information about events in the Council from press reports. Surely it cannot be a problem to inform Parliament beforehand what is to be discussed at Council meetings, and, afterwards, what was discussed. I would now like to refer to a few practical points. Certain key legislative matters – and I am sorry to have to harp on about this – are communitarised in the Treaty of Amsterdam. They may require a unanimous vote for at least five years, but nevertheless they have been communitarised. In other words, they have been removed from the legislative competence of national parliaments. At the same time, however, they are still outside this Parliament's competence, since we are only entitled to be consulted until the codecision procedure has been introduced. That means – and I can see two brilliant lawyers in front of me – that for the purposes of the development of European legislation areas that are clearly subject to the legal process, such as asylum and immigration, can no longer be directly influenced by an elected parliament, and that is surely not acceptable. The only possibility I can see is for the Council to consult Parliament particularly carefully during the interim phase, five years plus x, and to take account of the views Parliament expresses during the consultation. I just wanted to say a few words about that.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to mention another aspect, just by way of example. I was delighted that the President‐in‐Office last Monday or Tuesday called for the scope of Europol's operations to be extended. I was delighted to hear that because his erstwhile fellow member of the Green Group in the European Parliament, Ms Roth, would have run out of the Chamber screaming if she had heard words like that. The point I want to make is that the further development of Europol is coming up against the limits imposed by the structure of intergovernmental cooperation. In view of the communitarisation involved, progress in this field needs to be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and judicial control. So anyone wanting to achieve progress in this field must submit themselves to the rigours of communitarised progress, and that is what Parliament is urging you to do.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Van Lancker </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (NL)</span> Madam President, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that today"s debate on Schengen has come at just the right moment at the start of the German Presidency of the Union, which also coincides with Germany"s Schengen presidency. This is of crucial importance, because it is the time when, under the Schengen Protocol, the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> must be transferred to the Treaty of Amsterdam. Parliament has also just received the second annual report by the Executive Committee and the Joint Supervisory Authority. I should therefore like to thank the German Presidency for this first opportunity to discuss this issue with them, and I would like to thank my colleagues for their helpful cooperation in dealing with this report as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has always had mixed feelings about Schengen. On the one hand, we are naturally delighted that a number of Member States have taken the lead in establishing the free movement of persons and an area of freedom, security and justice in practice, but on the other hand we have always regretted the fact that this has happened outside the EU structures.</p>
<p class="contents">Legally speaking, too, Schengen is not exactly a thing of beauty. The <span class="italic">acquis</span> is a melting‐pot of guidelines, measures and decisions through which few people can find their way, let alone their rights. Now that Schengen is to be integrated into the EU Treaty, we can take definitive steps towards greater clarity and democracy. The inclusion of part of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> in the first pillar will pave the way for the communitarisation of this policy and will enable us to take measures to tidy up ‘<span class="italic">la nébuleuse Schengen</span> ", as my predecessor used to call it. However, all these good intentions have been jeopardised by the discussions that have been dragging on for 18 months now on how the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> should be integrated into the Treaty. First and foremost, it has not yet been possible to define what the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> is, nor to eliminate the redundant clauses from it. Thirdly, there is still a major debate going on about whether to include Schengen in the first pillar or the third. I have to say that the obstinate refusal of certain Member States to transfer part of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> to the first pillar is threatening to undermine the modest progress that we have made with the Amsterdam Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">At the European summit in Vienna last month, the Heads of State urged that a decision should be taken quickly. This was an important political signal, Mr President‐in‐Office, and I should like to hear from the German Presidency and also from the Commissioner as the guardian of the Treaties what political measures they intend to take to get out of this impasse. I would also like to know how they intend to involve the European Parliament in this transposition process. The integration of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> into the Treaty, and in particular how it is divided between the first and third pillars, will have important implications for Parliament"s future involvement and the future development of all European legislation on security and freedom. Even if the Schengen Protocol does not specifically provide for Parliament to be consulted, I still think that Parliament"s rights must be respected, because it would be of enormous damage to our interests if we were not. Parliament would have to think very seriously about going to the Court of Justice if our democratic rights were disregarded.</p>
<p class="contents">We would certainly urge that the aims of the Treaty should be borne in mind when integrating Schengen, and that the balance must be restored between efficient policing and respect for fundamental rights and the rule of law. In my first report on Schengen we called for greater transparency, greater parliamentary and judicial controls and respect for human rights. I think that these now need to be put into practice, and that in defining the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> the opportunity must be taken to publicise it, to involve the European Parliament and the national parliaments more, and to provide the public with better information about their rights. I would also point out that we feel that the future of the Schengen information system is of crucial importance. Our recommendation even calls for the SIS to be developed as a trans‐European network, managed by an agency under the operational authority of both the Commission and the Council, with data from the various sections strictly separated for end‐users, and supervised by the body provided for in the Treaty. I would like to know what the President‐in‐Office thinks about this point in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency has naturally fixed other priorities, most of which we support, such as strengthening international cooperation in cases of criminal prosecution, which is very necessary. The German Presidency is also calling for further harmonisation of visa policies, which would also be a welcome development, because the current situation is an out‐and‐out disaster. As regards the accession of new Member States, Mr President‐in‐Office, I would simply say that the mistakes of the past are threatening to be repeated. The evaluation of the applicant countries must involve more than just demanding watertight border controls. We also expect you to assess the operation of their legal systems, their human rights record and their respect for the principles of the rules of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to take a quick look at a number of points from the Schengen annual report. Firstly, France is still maintaining border controls at its frontiers with Belgium and Luxembourg, despite all the efforts that have been made. Can the President‐in‐Office tell me when this unfortunate situation will be resolved? Secondly, there is the evaluation of the Schengen information system. I have to say that as far as we are concerned, evaluating the amount of data stored is not a measure of the system"s success, and we would strongly urge that a qualitative assessment should be made of the efficiency of the Schengen system. Thirdly, there is the report by the Joint Supervisory Authority which monitors compliance with data protection requirements. I have to say that reading this report raises serious questions about a number of lapses. I could give you some hair‐raising examples here, but unfortunately there is not time. I would simply say that the Supervisory Authority has uncovered some very serious problems relating to data finalisation, the removal of data and refusal of access to the Schengen area. We expect the Council presidency to carry out the Authority"s recommendations here. After the four years in which Schengen has been in operation, this first debate has come not a moment too soon. There are many adjustments to be made and there is still a good deal of work to be done before a European area of security and freedom can be achieved. The European Parliament expects to be involved in this work from now on.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schily, </span>  <span class="italic">President‐in‐Office of the Council. – (DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Van Lancker and Mr Nassauer. Mr Nassauer, you were quite right in saying that it would be normal to give the report at the end of the Council presidency, but you know why it was postponed. So the blame in this matter cannot be laid at the Council's door. Nevertheless, the fact that we are the ones making the report does have certain advantages, although I was not involved in both stages during the previous presidency. But it does mean that we have the benefit of a certain distance which perhaps gives us a better view of the outcome of these presidencies. Drawing on information provided by the previous two presidencies, I shall try to be as objective as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two possible approaches to assessing progress. The first is a quantitative approach, summating all the various achievements. It is certainly true to say that a great deal has been accomplished: a dozen joint measures have been adopted under two agreements and political agreement has been reached on two further agreements. But maybe it would be more helpful to assess progress in qualitative terms, paying particular attention to the Council's activities concerning the European Parliament's participation. I would like to say straight away that I am happy to take up your suggestion of producing a written report, and we will try to implement that. It is a perfectly reasonable suggestion to have a written report before us so that we do not have to rely on an oral report.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the Luxembourg Presidency before them, the two presidencies over the last year have involved the European Parliament in anticipation of the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam, and we shall endeavour to do the same. My colleague Mrs Däubler‐Gmelin will give you further details of this. We shall of course take advantage of this opportunity today not just to assess progress but also to give you a foretaste of our presidency. Today the main focus of this is of course on justice and home affairs, with particular reference to the action plan for the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice. Mrs Däubler‐Gmelin will also have detailed comments on that point.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to address a number of different points, taking one subject at a time. The first is asylum and immigration. More than any other, this is perhaps an area where we need to match our work to the pace of developments and to react to international events. You know that Kosovo is one of the trouble spots we shall possibly be considering at the next informal meeting of EU justice and home affairs ministers because of its current relevance. It will also be necessary to develop forward‐looking strategies and to establish generally applicable rules.</p>
<p class="contents">1998 was notable for two influxes of migrants. First, the influx of Kurdish refugees from Iraq and the neighbouring region, and second, the problems caused by the conflict in Kosovo, which has already been mentioned and which has resulted in an influx of asylum‐seekers throughout Europe. Some countries have been especially affected by this.</p>
<p class="contents">In January 1998, the Council reacted to the influx of migrants from Iraq and the neighbouring region by adopting a comprehensive new action plan. This influx of migrants also made it apparent that the Dublin Convention that had recently come into force was only capable of solving some of the problems it was intended to address, because of the role of criminal organisations in smuggling in migrants on an ever more massive scale. And the situation is deteriorating.</p>
<p class="contents">The Kosovo crisis led to a similar but less widespread phenomenon. In order to counter these developments the Council, acting on a proposal from the Netherlands, decided in December 1998 to set up a high‐level group to formulate proposals for joint measures for a number of countries which seem likely to be the source of a massive influx of illegal immigrants. This group is to analyse the push factors and then develop a strategy for dealing with them.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year there was a preliminary discussion of a Commission proposal for an agreement governing the admission of third‐country nationals to the territory of Member States. This is a very important proposal that would come under the new EC powers included in the Treaty of Amsterdam. The exchanges of views held so far suggest that Member States see a need for considerable further discussion before agreement can be reached.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already mentioned the Dublin Convention that came into force in October 1997. Although it is certainly to soon to pass judgment on how the Convention is working in practice, there has already been a feeling for some time that a legal instrument is needed to support the implementation of the Convention by providing for fingerprints to be taken from asylum‐seekers so that these prints can be compared by a central office.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the draft Eurodac Convention, and I am pleased to report that the Council did indeed reach political agreement on this in December. With the massive influx of Kurds revealing problems in implementing the Dublin Convention, the Council decided in March to extend the Eurodac project to fingerprinting illegal immigrants. The protocol that will create the necessary legal basis is still being negotiated. The progress made at the December Council meeting gives grounds for hope that the work will soon be concluded, which I regard as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of asylum, one side of the discussions was the implementation of the Dublin Convention itself. In this context, the committee set up under Article 18 of this Convention adopted a work programme and a declaration with the intention of improving some of the practical aspects of the implementation of the Convention. The other side was the discussion of measures for temporary refuge and sharing of the burden between Member States in accepting refugees, particularly those fleeing from civil wars. These proposals were put forward by the Commission in July and considered by the European Parliament in December, and the German Presidency intends to move them forward with all speed. I should like to say that the German Presidency firmly considers that temporary refuge and burden sharing are inextricably linked. As far as we are concerned, this is a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> .</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to travel, identity and residence documents, in June 1998 the Council adopted a recommendation on the provision of forgery detection equipment at ports of entry to the European Union. In order to facilitate the checks concerned, in December the Council accordingly adopted a joint measure setting up the FADO electronic image archiving system, providing for a rapid exchange of information on both genuine and forged documents.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has pursued contacts with the applicant countries concerning visas, and two visa group meetings took place with the applicant countries, in May and November 1998. Following the second of these two meetings, expert groups were set up to assess the security of the applicant countries' documents and to bring their computer systems into line with the Schengen cooperation requirements in relation to checking visa applications and the administration and organisation of visa offices. A partnership has also been set up to evaluate the training and equipment needs of the applicant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1998 the Council adopted three instruments on the uniform format of residence permits. The first of these was a Council decision on sharing the cost of producing specimens of the common‐format residence permits. The second was a communication on the publication of the format for these permits. The third was a Council decision on common rules for filling in the uniform format for residence permits.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to police cooperation, and especially Europol and the war on drugs – Europol has, of course, already been mentioned. On 1 October 1998 the Europol Convention came into force, and although this was a very welcome intermediate step, Europol has still not commenced its activities, as it has not yet been possible to conclude work on certain implementing regulations required before it can start work.</p>
<p class="contents">The following texts have been approved or adopted so far: determining the rights and obligations of liaison officers in relation to Europol, the rules applicable to analysis files, staff regulations, confidentiality regulations and the Headquarters Agreement. The financial regulation is to be adopted shortly. I am pleased that it has been possible to reach a compromise on the senior appointments at Europol. Once again, the financial regulation is to be adopted shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">The following legal instruments have either not yet come into force or still need to be finalised: the Europol immunity protocol, Europol's institutions and staff members – in this case you may be aware that the ratification process has not yet been completed by four Member States – and the bilateral immunity and privilege agreements for liaison officers posted to Europol and their families. The Member States have reached agreement with the Kingdom of the Netherlands on a text, and the relevant verbal notes are soon to be exchanged. The Council has also adopted texts governing Europol's external relations with third countries and third bodies and the receipt of information by Europol from third countries and third parties.</p>
<p class="contents">The joint supervisory body has reached agreement on its rules of procedure, which are now before the Council for approval. The most important question still to be settled is on procedural aspects of the complaints procedure. This relates to both the non‐disclosure of data with security implications and observance of the necessary procedural guarantees. A succession of discussions has taken place on this, and I hope that we will be able to resolve these issues during the German Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to talk about Europol's institutions. Following the entry into force of the Convention, the management board and the joint supervisory body started work in November 1998. The joint audit committee has been established and has issued a declaration concerning the financial regulation. At the meeting of the Council held on 3 and 4 December, agreement was reached on the future composition of the management board. The financial regulation will be revised to take account of this, if necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to talk about Europol's computer system. At its meeting in September 1998, the Council took note of a progress report on the setting up of the Europol computer system, TECS. The report pointed out that because of the delay in setting up TECS, which is at present only approaching the procurement phase, an interim system would be provided for analysis and index purposes when Europol started work. Regarding the scope of Europol's mandate, at its meeting on 3 and 4 December the Council adopted a decision instructing Europol to deal with crimes committed or likely to be committed in the course of terrorist activities against life, limb, personal freedom or property. The Council also agreed that Europol should be instructed to prepare to extend its mandate to dealing with the forgery of money and means of payment, particularly in view of the introduction of the euro – something which I consider to be very important. Lastly, the definition of traffic in human beings as a form of crime in the Annex referred to in Article 2 of the Europol Convention is to be supplemented.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn to the subject of drugs. As under the previous presidencies, the war on drugs was also a priority for the British and Austrian Presidencies. The most important activities in this field were the preparation of a drug strategy for the period after 1999, the UN General Assembly special session on drugs, and the development of regional initiatives in Latin America and central Asia, both centres of the drug trade. The principle underlying the European Union's approach has been to combat the scourge of drugs in a comprehensive, integrated and balanced way.</p>
<p class="contents">Several initiatives, especially those of the UN General Assembly and the measures relating to Latin America, focused on reducing demand. The work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction played an important part here. The programme of Community action on the prevention of drug dependence was continued, and a European Drug Prevention Week was held at European, national and regional level in November. As you know, we also attach great importance to prevention at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">It has emerged from the Member States' progress reports on the continued implementation of the joint measure on the approximation of laws and procedures that many Member States have, at national and European level and also within the Schengen arrangements, further strengthened measures aimed at achieving close cooperation between police, customs services and judicial authorities. Implementation of the joint measure on new synthetic drugs was carried forward, and a detailed report on these activities was presented to the European Council in Vienna.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to relations with third countries and enlargement issues, which Mrs Van Lancker has also expressed a particular interest in. On enlargement, I would like to refer to two particularly important measures: on 28 May 1998 the Council adopted the Pre‐Accession Pact on Organised Crime between the Member States of the European Union and the applicant CEECs and Cyprus. The German word for pre‐accession pact is one of those interesting new words that the bureaucrats are always inventing, and I nearly mispronounced it so that it came out as pre‐cession! In the case of organised crime we are faced with criminal activities which are unfortunately spreading not only within the applicant countries but also from them into the Member States of the European Union. It therefore makes sense to involve representatives from the applicant countries at this stage in the general effort to combat these widespread criminal activities – illicit drugs, traffic in human beings, prostitution and money laundering. We really must not underestimate the dangers of these forms of crime.</p>
<p class="contents">A group of experts on the Pre‐Accession Pact, which consists of representatives of the 15 Member States and the 11 applicant countries, meets regularly for mutual exchanges of police experience and to draw up a joint strategy, in conjunction with Europol, to identify the main dangers and develop effective countermeasures. There is also the joint measure of 29 June 1998 establishing a mechanism for collective evaluation of the transposition, application and effective implementation by the applicant countries of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> in the field of justice and home affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Recognising that it is not enough to pass laws and ratify agreements, but that the new legislation concerned also has to be applied by appropriately equipped and trained forces in sufficient numbers, the Council has set up a special group. This is of course a well‐known problem: it is not just about having the legislation itself, it is also about how it is enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">The remit of the joint evaluation working party is to prepare and subsequently update, by analysing all available information, a collective evaluation of the situation in the applicant countries regarding the transposition, application and effective implementation of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> in the field of justice and home affairs, working in close cooperation with the K.4 Committee. The Justice and Home Affairs Council receives regular reports on this. This ensures that in particularly sensitive areas such as checks at external borders or the fight against organised crime, experts can monitor whether the standards flowing from the European Union or Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> are being achieved, and where there may still be room for improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">Relations with third countries are particularly important in the field of justice and home affairs. During the year the existing cooperation under the TREVI system was systematically extended and now includes the USA and Canada, the Mediterranean countries participating under Euromed, countries such as Norway, Iceland, Switzerland, Turkey, Morocco, Russia and Ukraine, while in special cases such as the fight against drugs it also extends to the countries of Latin America and central Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the second part of my report, on Schengen cooperation, and I would like to start with some fundamental comments. Schengen cooperation consists of a balanced system of measures which guarantees freedom of movement in the Schengen area and at the same time reduces the security risks inherent in ending controls at internal borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the period of almost four years during which this system has been applied in practice, it has largely proved its worth. We must therefore continue to pursue its underlying concept of freedom of movement combined with security. As Mrs Van Lancker has already commented, the development of Schengen cooperation has reached an important turning point. The entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam means that Schengen will be integrated into the European Union. The required legal and institutional preparatory work is already under way. We must now push ahead with this work at full speed, so as to complete it, if at all possible, by the time the Treaty of Amsterdam comes into force.</p>
<p class="contents">Germany has always firmly supported this objective and will ensure that the necessary effort continues under its EU presidency in the first half of 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that we have already agreed that Germany will continue to hold the Schengen presidency in the first half of the coming year will assist the integration process.</p>
<p class="contents">Now let me say a few words about defining the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> . For Schengen to be successfully incorporated into the EU, we will have a lot of homework to do on the EU side. First and foremost, this means defining exactly what the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> consists of. Mrs Van Lancker talked about nebulous structures, and we certainly want to help to disperse this fog. For reasons of legal certainty and clarity, the states already applying the <span class="italic">acquis</span> , the states that will have to adopt it on accession to the EU, and above all our citizens themselves need to know precisely which Schengen provisions will continue to apply and which will not.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the tasks still to be accomplished is dividing the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> between the legal bases of the Treaty establishing the European Community and the Treaty on European Union. Current thinking and future strategy can be summed up as follows: because of fundamental differences between Member States at expert level, it has not yet been possible to find conclusive answers in either area, I have to admit. It may well be necessary to sort this out at political level. If it really proves impossible to reach agreement on this, we would have to resort to the Schengen Protocol safeguard clause, which fictionally deems that Schengen is entirely based on the third pillar. Mrs Van Lancker, I know that you do not approve of that, and for the time being we will have to make every effort to reach agreement, but that would be the consequence.</p>
<p class="contents">Negotiations with Norway and Iceland, which I am pleased to say have already made great progress, are to be finalised by means of an association agreement. Germany has already sought to achieve the most efficient possible means of linking these states with the Schengen cooperation, and that remains our approach. The planned cooperation structure is a good way to take account of these Nordic states' legitimate interest in participating in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">My next subject is EU enlargement. Schengen faces another significant challenge because of the Central and Eastern European countries' accession to the Union. The Schengen states will have to be prepared for the fact that in future all states joining the EU will automatically become members of the Schengen cooperation under the EU umbrella. The transition protocol commits them to adopting the <span class="italic">acquis</span> in its entirety. I must stress that it will not be possible to allow any departures from this principle during the accession negotiations. Schengen's carefully balanced association of freedom of movement and security will only carry on working if it requires the same of all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to ensure that it will only be possible for a state to take part in this association in future if it can demonstrate that it fully complies with the necessary requirements. To this end, the instrument concerning the entry into force of the Schengen regulations for any given state must at all costs be complied with. We also still have a special problem with one country in the south. We need to actively support new EU members preparing to adopt the Schengen standards.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to say just a few words about the focal points of the German Schengen presidency in the first half of 1999. This presidency has set itself the objective of further reinforcing cooperation in the Schengen states by means of a number of initiatives. In doing this, we are continuing where the German Schengen work programme for the second half of 1998 left off. The focal points are to be the following: improving police mutual assistance in criminal matters by adopting a catalogue of criminal investigations compulsory for all Schengen states, which the police can apply for and deal with without involving the judicial authorities, as a means of speeding things up, but without any loss of legal sovereignty; mutual posting of liaison officers involved in border police work to Schengen external borders to give advice and support; establishing the interoperability of various police digital communication systems in internal border areas; reviewing Germany's implementation of the Schengen Implementation Agreement, which means that we are subjecting ourselves to the first review, which I think is a good thing in itself; and improvement in the exchange of visa information and the introduction of an exit document.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Däubler‐Gmelin, </span>  <span class="italic">President‐in‐Office of the Council. – (DE)</span> Madam President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank you for this opportunity to discuss this interesting subject with you here today, a subject of great importance to the citizens of the Member States of the European Union. I welcome the fact that we are not just discussing these issues today alone. Continuing the theme already embarked upon by Mr Schily, we are at an interesting point in time. As you, Mr Nassauer, pointed out, we are today in the unusual situation of not only having to report on the events and progress of the last year, that is on the achievements of the British and Austrian Presidencies. We also have to give you a short overview of the German Presidency's plans for the next six months. It is good that today is not the only chance to do this, and I am delighted that we shall have an opportunity to continue this discussion about our plans and the problems informing our decisions over the coming week in the relevant committees of this House. For that reason, I hope you will forgive me if I limit my presentation here to a few significant points.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Nassauer, I would like to start with a few general comments about relations between the Council and the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very much in sympathy with your suggestions. We must certainly heed your comments about democratic control in areas which we have always traditionally felt – and I am sure rightly so – are subject to the law‐making process. I have read the passages in the motion for a resolution to be debated today with great interest. You can rest assured that we will do what we can, within the bounds of the Treaty, to further enhance relations between the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking back over the events of the past year, in the areas on which I have to report today, of course, it is fair to say that on the whole relations between the Council and the European Parliament have been fruitful and positive. Both the British and the Austrian Presidencies had an opportunity to present their work programme for the next six months to you and to discuss it with you. Depending on the area of competence, these work programmes were explained in detail and discussed with the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs or in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights. There was also an exchange of views between the presidency and Members of Parliament on aspects of mutual interest in the fields of justice and home affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we can safely say, Mr Nassauer, that there was accordingly a chance to discuss issues before they were considered at formal or informal meetings of the Council. We thus ensured that the views of the European Parliament had some impact at those meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">It was also a useful exercise for the Presidents‐in‐Office to give a detailed report to Parliament's committees at the end of each half year on the work done by the Council during the period under review. We will continue that practice. Furthermore, the presidency also continued the practice established by the Luxembourg Presidency in the second half of 1997 of consulting the European Parliament in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">We should carry on doing that. It has been another way – a successful one to my mind – in which we have tried to take account of the views of the European Parliament. And in each case the presidency has conveyed Parliament's views to the relevant Council body.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add that in December 1998 the Council consulted the European Parliament on a project which has a very special role to play, namely an action plan for the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, which your resolution also touches upon, albeit from a particular point of view. This action plan is intended to point the way ahead and broadly determine how we proceed in future, in the first five years – you yourself, Mr Nassauer, said five years plus x – after the Treaty of Amsterdam has come into force.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say this again: you can rest assured that the German Presidency attaches great importance to improving relations between the Council and the European Parliament still further. We think it was very positive that throughout the year the European Parliament demonstrated considerable interest in work in this field. The Council received more than 100 questions, which I think is proof enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to talk about the conclusions of the Council of 19 March last year. These conclusions related to openness and transparency in the Council's activities in the field of Title VI of the Treaty on the European Union, providing a wider range of information on the activity of the Council and reinforcing its external impact. Some of this relates to matters we have already discussed and some of it to your own proposals: making the calendar of meetings available to the public, publishing Council decisions on the Internet, and having public debates in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now turn to my second point. What progress was made on judicial cooperation last year under the British and Austrian Presidencies? The first point I should mention is judicial cooperation on civil matters. I say that simply because we know very well that this is of special interest to Europe's citizens. A key event in the field of judicial cooperation on civil matters was the adoption by the Council of the Brussels II Convention on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters, and the signing of this convention by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, this convention is of great interest to Europe's citizens. It stipulates in which Member State a divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment can be applied for, and also determines which Member State is responsible for making a judgment on parental authority for children of binational marriages when a divorce, separation or marriage annulment has been applied for.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not have to tell you that for binational marriages in particular, divorces involve many problems. By virtue of this convention, we can endeavour to create a reasonable framework for legal and judicial processes and practice. But it is of course almost impossible to legislate for the human aspect of the problems associated with this, and I think we will have to explore other options in this case. I believe that the Members of this House also have a part to play in helping with this aspect of regulation and practice.</p>
<p class="contents">But let me return to the convention itself. As soon as the courts of a Member State have made a judgment, it can then be recognised and enforced in other Member States by means of a quick, simple and inexpensive procedure. It is also important to note that in connection with this convention the Council adopted a legal instrument simultaneously signed by the Member States concerning the interpretation of the convention by the European Court of Justice. This legal instrument is not only important as a means of taking matters further forward, but also in that it highlights the importance of the European Court of Justice. I believe that emphasising the significance of the European Court of Justice in this way is important as a means of furthering the concept of judicial control and thus also of constitutionality in the European Union, in exactly the same way as in all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Important work on judicial cooperation in the field of civil law was launched in relation to revising the Brussels I and Lugano Conventions. This too was a very positive development. The Brussels Convention of 27 September 1968 lays down uniform rules for the Member States on international jurisdiction, <span class="italic">lis pendens</span> conditions, recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. The Lugano Convention of 16 September 1988 is similarly structured but, as you know, there are differences of detail. The signatories to the Lugano Convention are, in addition to the EU Member States, the EFTA states of Switzerland, Norway and Iceland.</p>
<p class="contents">The German Presidency plans to revise these conventions over the next six months. The objective of the discussions is to bring these two conventions more closely into line with each other, to make improvements on the basis of experience of legal practice and in particular to further simplify the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments. We particularly want to keep an eye on the simplification side. So the aim of these negotiations is to achieve an important step towards establishing the area of freedom, security and justice which the Member States want to create together. We hope to complete this during the German Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">In July 1998, a Council working party met to consider the requirements for creating a legal instrument on the law applicable to non‐contractual obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">This is known as the Rome II project, and it builds on Rome I, the agreement between the EU Member States of 19 June 1980 on the law applicable to contractual obligations. The working party achieved a positive interim result and is now to produce a draft on the basis of a working document prepared by the Austrian Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now turn to judicial cooperation in the field of criminal law, which Mrs Van Lancker also touched upon. First, I would like to mention the importance in practical terms of the Convention on driving disqualification, another subject with a very immediate impact on people in the Member States of the European Union. I have to tell you that in Germany too people are constantly asking questions and expressing their fears about this convention, although it is also widely praised.</p>
<p class="contents">The convention adopted by the Council on 16 June 1998 provides that judgments no longer subject to the right of appeal may in certain circumstances be enforced in a Member State other than the state of residence. This therefore makes a valuable contribution to road safety and simultaneously, by tackling such a practical subject, helps to create a common legal area of which our citizens are directly aware.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another field in which I unfortunately cannot report the same degree of progress. I am talking about improving mutual assistance in criminal matters. Despite the extraordinarily commendable and persistent efforts of the Austrian Presidency in particular – which I would like to emphasise – there has been far less progress in this field, the reason being the different systems that exist in the Member States. Another reason is the various expectations people have of the European Union in this field, and I think that in this case all the European institutions, and above all the European Parliament, have a duty not only to generate greater appreciation of the issue, but also to take supportive action so as to facilitate effective international negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">To do this it is necessary to improve the existing instruments of international mutual assistance in criminal matters and to adapt them to the requirements of modern international law enforcement. This particularly applies, as we all know, to modern international communications technology, such as satellite communications. The German Presidency plans to work towards adoption of the Agreement on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters as quickly as possible, preferably within the six months of our presidency. There is a considerable body of earlier work for us to build on. In particular, there is already a consensus about simplified procedures for passing on requests for mutual assistance, and also on rules governing modern methods of passing requests across borders – the key words here being controlled deliveries and undercover agents – as well as questioning via video‐conferencing. However, I am sure that I do not need to tell you again that there are still many problems to be solved. We may perhaps have a chance to tell the relevant committees more about this next week.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of combating fraud and corruption, by adopting the joint measure on corruption in the private sector in December 1998 we have managed to create a new basis for combating corruption in business in the common market under criminal law. I have no doubt that this too is a very important step forward that should be brought to the public's attention in an appropriate way.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the fight against organised crime. Just before the Treaty of Amsterdam was signed the European Council instructed a high‐level group on organised crime to work out an action plan to develop a comprehensive approach to this task. This has enabled the various parties involved – the police, judicial and customs authorities – to work together in a multidisciplinary team, initially for a limited period, to combat the scourge of organised crime. This is in marked contrast to the artificial barriers which previously separated them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would once again like to stress that the Council very much appreciates the important contribution made by the European Parliament to the Multidisciplinary Group on Organised Crime. I particularly have in mind Ms Cederschiöld's report on the action plan. This report was – and still is – one of the cornerstones of the Group's work. For example, the resolution adopted by the Council on 21 December 1998 on the prevention of organised crime goes back to an initiative inspired by the debate in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Substantial progress has been made in implementing the action plan, and this was set out in detail in the report to the Vienna European Council. I would like to draw special attention to the launch of the European Judicial Network and the adoption of a joint measure on money laundering, the identification, tracing, freezing, seizing and confiscation of the instruments used in and the proceeds from crime, and the adoption of a joint measure under which the legislation of all the Member States will make it a criminal offence for any person on their territory to participate in a criminal organisation, regardless of where it is located or pursues its criminal activities.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the deadline for implementing the recommendations in the action plan is the end of 1999. The Council will then have to reach a decision on the follow‐up to this work and on how it links up with the new action plan on the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice. I am sure I do not need to tell you that this decision will be a rather important one.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to say a few words about the action plan on the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice. The process of drawing up this new action plan was the focal point of the Council's work in the second half of 1998, making it the centre‐piece of the Austrian Presidency. As you know, the Cardiff European Council called upon the Council and the Commission to present proposals to the Vienna European Council on the best means of implementing the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam concerning an area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">A document was presented to the Vienna Summit in which an attempt was made to pinpoint the changes and progressive innovations contained in the Treaty of Amsterdam, or in other words its added value, and to draw up a work programme for the next two to five years. The Vienna European Council approved the action plan and stated that it would give the field of justice and home affairs a new dimension after the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, thus creating a concrete framework for developing activity in this field. I think it is right to draw attention to this.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the European Council decided that progress to date should be assessed at the Special Justice and Home Affairs European Council to be held in Tampere in October 1999 and that that meeting should set further guidelines for EU action in the field of justice and home affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an important task and the opinion sought from Parliament by the Austrian Presidency in mid‐December will be accorded its full weight. I can certainly assure you that the German Presidency, which will be making the initial preparations for Tampere, will ensure that the European Parliament's opinion is fully taken on board.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the Tampere Special Council will give us an opportunity to make significant further progress with discussions in this field and I hope that the German Presidency can count on the continuing support of the European Parliament in achieving this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention once again that we are at the interface of two interesting phases. The European Parliament elections are about to take place, and it will be important to enter into a dialogue with our citizens about the progress we have made and the potential of a European legal area and common security area. The entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam makes this a time of radical change, and this will have a special impact in our area.</p>
<p class="contents">We should all be aware that a key factor in driving Europe as a whole forward is the enormous interest shown by Europe's citizens in the common legal area – which will mean additional and common rights for all – and also in the common European security area. So the challenge we face is to act jointly and to use our knowledge and ability to the full to find ways of bringing Europe as a whole closer to a social and democratic constitutional identity. I think that is your objective, and it is also the objective of the German Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents" align="center">IN THE CHAIR: MR HAARDER<br /><span class="italic">Vice‐President</span></p>
<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gradin, </span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (SV)</span> Mr President, Ministers, ladies and gentlemen, EU cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs is now entering its sixth year. This area has gradually taken on greater significance, as Mr Nassauer also notes in his report. At the same time, the need for a new approach has become increasingly evident. Through the Amsterdam Treaty we have set ourselves a more ambitious task: to establish progressively an area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">One of my major goals last year was to give substance and intelligibility to this vision in the communication which I forwarded to the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. Previous experience shows just how important this is.</p>
<p class="contents">Four years have now elapsed since, as Commissioner, I began work on cooperation in justice and home affairs, and a clear pattern has now emerged. Underlying the initiatives, there are common challenges and a genuine desire for a European solution that works. In most cases, there is strong popular support for the ideas behind the proposals, but when it comes to implementing them there is real resistance. This point is well illustrated in Mr Nassauer's report where he lists the numerous issues which the Council of Ministers has not managed to resolve during the past year, partly due to the length of time that proposals have had to wait for a decision, and partly because, for various reasons, the decisions have not been implemented. Of all the conventions dealt with during the past five years, only one – the Europol Convention – has entered into force.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not just in the Council that progress has been slow. Parliament has also sometimes found it difficult to reach agreement on a common strategy. There is therefore also a need for a far‐reaching debate here in Parliament. What is required is a new impetus to speed up the cooperation process. I hope that during the spring we can have a broad public debate on the direction that EU cooperation on justice and home affairs will take in the future. There are a number of basic issues to be analysed here. We must look for answers in the everyday reality in which the citizens of Europe live. I therefore wholeheartedly support Parliament's idea that we should try to arrange an interparliamentary conference next spring. Such a meeting would be the perfect forum in which to launch a broad public debate on the Union's priorities in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Nassauer notes in his report that not one single legislative instrument was approved in this field during 1998. I too had hoped that we would make more progress. This applies in particular to the proposal concerning temporary shelter where there has been a mass influx of refugees. Two years have elapsed since the issue was first raised in the Council of Ministers, and I have put forward concrete draft proposals on two separate occasions. I have also prepared a model for joint action in burden sharing. With so much preparatory work, more should really have been accomplished, and I would like to say that I am open to any kind of suggestions. At the same time, I naturally expect help from the Member States in finding a constructive alternative solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year we had a major success with the Europol Convention. It gives us more scope for action in the fight against organised crime. This year we have to finalise our work on the plan of action for fighting organised crime. The Commission will also be playing an active role in this task.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also in the process of updating the Union's action plan on drugs. As you know, the current plan runs for another year, and the Commission will be putting forward another five‐year plan in the spring. This work took on new momentum following the special session on drugs organised last year by the United Nations in New York. While I was there, in the company of Members of the European Parliament, I noted that the work of the UN in this area would continue to be characterised by continuity and resolve. I also welcome the resolution giving clear support to the UN Drugs Convention, which Parliament approved in October. This ensures that for a long time to come, the policy on drugs will continue to build on past knowledge and experience.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important priority last year was enlargement. A number of applicant countries are involved in the process. Intensive negotiations are in progress with all of them, particularly in the field of justice and home affairs. It is incumbent upon the Commission to give them as much help as possible, particularly through technical assistance. The PHARE programme is an important tool in this respect, as is the education and exchange programme.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of my colleague Mr Monti, I should like to say a few words about Schengen. To a large extent, the Commission agrees with the analysis prepared by the rapporteur, Mrs Van Lancker, and her recommendations concerning the integration of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> . First of all, it is essential that Schengen should be integrated into the Union and not the other way round; secondly, integration should really serve to bring about the increased openness and legal control that is envisaged; and thirdly, the integration of Schengen should not hinder any future progress as laid down in the Amsterdam Treaty. The Schengen Protocol clearly stipulates a line of communication between the first and third pillars. If we cannot reach agreement, then the whole Schengen system would be deemed to be based on the third pillar instead of being integrated within the Union framework. I think this would go against the spirit of the new Treaty and is therefore totally unacceptable. The Commission will do everything in its power to finalise the work on this line of communication before the new Treaty enters into force. Naturally, Parliament should be as fully involved as possible in the preliminary work. In the coming weeks, the Commission is definitely not going to change its stance on this in any future contacts with the German Presidency. We intend to work with the presidency to find the most effective way possible of organising our work with Parliament. I am sure the House will be pleased to know that the negotiations with Norway and Iceland have now been concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Amsterdam Treaty, justice and home affairs are upgraded. The new Treaty opens the door to a number of fresh areas for action by the Commission. I see new challenges ahead, above all in the area of justice. The demands of our citizens for equal access to justice know no boundaries. An integrated Europe where people move around freely both implies, as well as strengthens, a common sense of justice. This is something we should welcome and encourage. Terrorism, bribery, corruption, fraud and the sexual exploitation of women and children are just a few examples of crimes which arouse disgust throughout the Union. The Treaty provides access to new and interesting initiatives, for example in relation to the right to punish.</p>
<p class="contents">Another area we began to investigate in 1998 was the Union's role with regard to victims of crime. What can we do to protect people who are exposed to violence and other forms of criminal behaviour when they are in another Member State? I intend, during the course of the year, to issue a communication describing what progress can also be made in this area through European cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the enslavement of women and the sexual exploitation of children, over a period of several years we have only succeeded in raising the issue to its present level. We have come up with a framework for a common strategy and put forward concrete proposals and measures. Through the STOP programme, we have also succeeded in earmarking financial support for these activities. Consequently, in the communication on the smuggling of women which I issued last month, I identify other areas where further measures are needed, such as temporary residence permits for women who would like to stay to give evidence against smugglers and pimps.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, we also put forward a proposal for a programme of work known as Daphne, to be carried out over a number of years, with the aim of combating the abuse of women, teenagers and children. I am especially pleased with this programme. As you know, it is directed at the voluntary organisations with the aim of encouraging them to use their expertise in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">An important aspect of our work is increasing people's awareness of how Europe functions in practical terms in the fields of justice and home affairs. In this way we can build respect for, and understanding of, the differences that exist, and develop an interest in finding solutions to the problems that arise. To my mind, it is the best form of confidence building. During 1998, we therefore devoted a great deal of time to the ongoing programmes of work we have begun. Through them we have been able, over the past two years, to support hundreds of awareness‐raising and confidence‐building projects within the Union and around Europe. I shall shortly be proposing that this work programme should be extended to cover the new democracies in Central and Eastern Europe. They already participate in numerous projects, but now they should also be initiating their own.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation in justice and home affairs obviously has a place on today's EU agenda. The decision to hold a special top‐level meeting in Tammerfors later in the year is proof of this. At the same time, support for cooperation should be deeply rooted. An essential condition for establishing an area of freedom, security and justice is that our work should have strong popular support. We must therefore commit ourselves to initiating a lively and sustained dialogue between the EU and its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(EN) I have a particular answer for Mr Nassauer.</span></p>
<p class="contents">Twenty‐one proposals for conventions, joint actions and other instruments have been discussed in the Justice and Home Affairs Council during 1998. Ten of these proposals were based on Commission initiatives. The Member States presented 11 proposals. The Commission has systematically sent copies of all its initiatives to Parliament at the same moment they were sent to the Council. It has also always urged the presidency to consult Parliament in accordance with Article K.6 EU. This includes both Commission initiatives and proposals submitted by the Member States. Five Commission initiatives have not yet been finalised. They are: joint action on temporary protection, joint action on burden sharing, the convention on admission, the joint action on support of reception, repatriation of displaced persons and asylum seekers and, finally, the initiative to revise the Brussels Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The joint action on non‐cash means of payment was presented late in the year so its finalisation could not reasonably be accepted before the end of 1998. In many cases the reason for non‐progress is the profound divergence of opinion between the Member States. A good example is the actions on temporary protection and on burden sharing. In the latter case the Commission, together with the German presidency, will attempt to find compromise solutions to the issues at stake. On the basis of the content that is agreed, the Commission will then present post‐Amsterdam proposals in the form of a Community instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">As a supplement to my answer, we have also produced a detailed table of initiatives taken within the field of justice and home affairs during 1998. I have handed over this table to the chairman of the committee, Mrs d'Ancona, and I also gave it to Mr Nassauer before he left the hemicycle. Others who might be interested can also look at this table. It makes it easier to see who has done what.</p>

You mentioned that we are under great time pressure. This is partly occasioned by the fact that the statements by the two German Ministers took up some 50 minutes. I am not complaining because what they said contained some fascinating, important and valuable information. I wonder if it might be possible, exceptionally in this case, to have their statements translated into the official languages promptly. I know this happens in the normal course of events but it can take up to a year. It is such important information that it would be very valuable.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">d"Ancona </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I really have very little speaking time, and I have to say that in comparison with the time given to the Council and the Commission, Parliament"s time is extremely limited. I shall therefore confine myself to a few comments on what Mrs Däubler said about relations between the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it is a major step forward that the Amsterdam Treaty now requires us to be consulted about relevant issues. It does not always happen, unfortunately, but nevertheless a good many proposals are put to us. However, we are often given very little time to deliver our opinion, and the Council always seems to be in a hurry as well, so that it often scarcely has time to look at Parliament"s opinion in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">My first question, therefore, is this: would it not be a good idea to organise a meeting shortly before the Council so that our rapporteur can inform the ministers? This would be a good way of ensuring that the best use is made of our work. For example, we will finish work on the action plan in mid‐April, so it would make sense if we were given time then to explain our position.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, following on from this, we never actually hear what happens to our opinions. I have just been told here that our recommendation on the action plan on organised crime was very useful, but it has taken until now for us to hear this. It would therefore be useful, in addition to sending a representative to the Council meetings, if the Council could send us a written report on which parts of our opinions it is prepared to accept and which not.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly – I cannot go any faster or put my points any more briefly – as far as our committee is concerned the K.6 debate is extremely important. We have asked on five occasions for an annual progress report on the third pillar, so we were absolutely delighted to read that the Council had decided on 19 March last year to send Parliament progress reports not just once but twice a year. But nothing has happened – we have not actually seen one of these reports yet. So I hope that the Council intends to keep its promise and that we will receive these reports in future under the new presidency, which I naturally wish every success.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I hope that we will receive replies to these three questions.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Chanterie </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I should like first of all to apologise to the President‐in‐Office of the Council for the fact that so few members of my group are here – an important vote is currently being taken in the group on an issue that is one of the next on the agenda. However, I shall try to make my group"s position on the Van Lancker report clear. I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Van Lancker, on the way in which she got us all to work together on this report, which had to be prepared under very difficult circumstances given the extremely short time it was before the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been given a very comprehensive picture by the presidency this morning, for which I would thank the ministers concerned. The presidency has clearly described the work which has to be done to integrate the Schengen Agreement into the EU Treaty. There is an important point in the document from the German Presidency to which I would to draw your attention, where it talks about the Schengen system being founded on two pillars: the free movement of persons and security. It says that the abolition of individual controls at the internal borders of the Schengen states is based on the assumption that the planned compensatory measures are genuinely effective. I think that this is an important principle and one which my group wholeheartedly supports, because a number of Member States have attempted to use Schengen to introduce freedom of movement. We must also not forget security considerations. I think that internal security is an extremely important issue for the public, and that people want to have both freedom and security at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need to do now is to ensure that the fairly complicated transition from inter‐state cooperation to cross‐border policy measures should happen as smoothly and flexibly as possible. With the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, and this was another point made at the European Council in Vienna, Schengen must be incorporated into the European Union as quickly as possible. The minister referred to the problems that are still being encountered, although these have not really been identified – the choice of legal bases for the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> , perhaps? I know that this is a fairly complicated subject. Perhaps we could be given more detailed information, maybe in writing, on this and on the operation of the Schengen information system. The PPE Group feels that the system must not become a ‘big brother", but on the other hand it must not be a little system either. In other words, data must be recorded accurately and carefully in the system and only the competent authorities must have access to it. We must prevent any infringement of privacy, and we must prevent those responsible for international organised crime from having access to information that encourages the white slave trade or the trade in foreigners. These are two of the biggest phenomena that we are facing and for which the international community, whether under the Treaty or the Schengen Agreement, has really not found an answer. I think, Minister, that we must give our fullest support to further efforts in this direction. I have no more time to deal with any other points.</p>

<p class="contents">I will therefore only say a few words in support of the approach proposed by Mrs Van Lancker. The Liberal Group as a whole is in favour of her proposals and, once again, we join her in deploring the difficulties that the Member States are having in coming to an agreement on the definition of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> . It would be unfortunate if these difficulties could not be overcome in such a sensitive field as the movement of persons. It goes without saying that the European Parliament must be informed of the substance of Schengen and consulted on the draft decision that will allow the <span class="italic">acquis</span> to be integrated into the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the presence here today of the German ministers who are assuming the Council presidency, and I would like to say to them that they will always be able to count on the Liberal Group whenever the rights of the defendant are at stake. It is a matter that we feel is fundamental, and I welcome the initiatives that you announced in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we should be pleased about the extension of the Schengen area, the common European approach means that the United Kingdom and Ireland need to join their partners as soon as possible so that the same rules can be applied to the movement of persons as to the movement of goods. The timid approach that is the root of many obstacles in the field of free movement of persons must give way to a wider vision that focuses on the requirements of the vast area of freedom, security and justice to which a great majority of us aspire.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by saying that through her sound proposals, Mrs Van Lancker is making a significant contribution towards achieving this great plan, and we will be sure to demonstrate the support that I have just outlined when it comes to the vote.</p>

<p class="contents">While the objective of Schengen cooperation is to ensure the free movement of persons and to remove internal border controls, that objective only has meaning if the necessary accompanying measures are put in place at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">In Mrs Van Lancker"s report, one senses an element of reproach, considering as it does that the main emphasis has been placed on strengthening external border controls, on admission policy and on police and judicial cooperation. While these measures are not the primary objective of the Schengen agreements, they are an essential consequence of it, in order to guarantee the greatest possible security for the citizens of the Union and to ensure that they support the system.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the integration of Schengen into the Treaty and the division of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> between the first and third pillars, my group cannot share her view on the institutional catastrophe that would result from the application of the safeguard clause, which would mean a complete transfer to the third pillar. This would be even less the case if the Council, as requested by the recommendation, informed Parliament by involving it both in defining the strategies and also in the legislative measures to be taken under the third pillar, and if it respected the transparency rules, certainly with regard to the European Parliament but also with regard to the national parliaments and the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">My group welcomes the proposal to make a start now on converting the Schengen Information System into a European Information System by strengthening links with the Europol data processing systems. This would allow the involvement, at least in this area, of the United Kingdom and Ireland, who are signatories of the Europol convention and, for obvious geographical reasons, are outside the Schengen area.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of my group, I of course welcome the German Presidency"s objective of improving international cooperation in criminal affairs as well as the decision of the Member States to harmonise their visa policies and to introduce without delay a computerised format for residence permits for third‐country nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to assessing the operation of Schengen, we also welcome the progress that has been made, in particular in the accession of Italy and Austria, and we agree that it is important to encourage the involvement of the United Kingdom and Ireland in the areas covered by Title IV of the Treaty. I cannot, of course, agree with the regrets expressed concerning France"s use of the exemption mechanism provided for in Article 2(2) of the Convention in respect of its land borders with Belgium and Luxembourg. I prefer, and I have tabled an amendment to this effect, to place emphasis on continuing the efforts being made by those countries to combat drug trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur also highlights an incident which occurred at the Belgian Sirene office, where personal data was stolen. She questions the reliability of the database protection system, and I wonder whether the problem lies with Belgium rather than with the Sirene network. Overall, apart from these various points, we will vote for these two reports.</p>

<p class="contents">As the speaker before me, Mrs d"Ancona, pointed out, it is vital for the Council to comply once and for all with the provisions of the Treaty and to inform Parliament regularly of the preparations for and results of its discussions and official meetings. Without such information, it is impossible to have any sort of adequate democratic supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">It is significant that at this stage we have not adopted any legislation relating to our policy on asylum, refugees and immigration. This demonstrates the lack of political will among the governments and European institutions to give decisive, serious and, above all, consistent consideration to these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">In this Schengen area that is being created, there should be a clause making it possible to implement common policies on the socio‐cultural integration of immigrants, avoiding any discrimination against people or groups due to race, colour or religion or due to national, social or ethnic orientation. The Schengen responsibilities must be incorporated into the Union"s policies, as provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam, but they must also be subject to the supervision of its institutions in order to ensure that they do not turn into an instrument for resisting immigration. Integration is essential, yet we must also unequivocally guarantee respect for the fundamental rights of the citizens of the European Union and third country nationals. The same can be said for the transparency and democratic supervision of the decision‐making procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I would like to mention a specific problem, but one that is no less important in the creation of this Schengen area of freedom and justice: the protection of personal data, which must be guaranteed without exception in any democratic society. The incident in the Belgian SIRENE office, where personal data were removed, is proof of the lack of sufficient protection for databases and the need to take clear measures to guarantee effective protection in this respect.</p>

We cannot accept the wording on Europol and on asylum and migration policy. We are not opposed to Europol, quite the contrary, we are in favour of Europol and citizens' rights. What is at stake is the legality of the work done by officials in the EU who are supposed to be dealing with citizens' security. It seems that there is agreement on police cooperation, and on setting up Europol, but they are being denied the legal bases required for their work, in other words democratic legal bases guaranteed in the Member States. We find that unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The police need generally applicable laws in order to operate properly. But that was not the subject of the decision – it was about the immunity of Europol officials. Who are we protecting against whom? We are protecting our officials against our own democratic laws and courts, but we are not protecting anyone else.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry that Mr Nassauer is not with us now. He welcomed the Austrian Presidency's failed initiative against illegal immigration. The fact that he also welcomes the campaign in my home <span class="italic">Land</span> of Hessen against dual nationality is his problem. I would like to ask him if we agree on the definition of illegal immigration. What does illegal mean in the EU? Does it include people recognised as refugees in one Member State but rejected in another because it has different asylum laws? There is indeed illegal immigration, from eastern Europe for example. We are not defending the idea of open borders, and we are prepared to accept reasonable regulations and harmonisation. However, this must not mean that human rights suffer as a consequence.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful for the current Council presidency's suggestion that we need a new summit, as explained by Mr Fischer, the German Minister for Foreign Affairs, and I hope that the German Presidency will succeed in making certain changes in this area.</p>

The goal of the operation is still to set up this area of freedom, security and justice, and this is worth repeating, insofar as nowadays more importance is attached to increasing the number of bolts, fortifications, barbed wire and protective walls than to explaining to citizens the measures to be taken and the point of a Europe without borders, this Europe that is behaving more like a club for rich people who intend to continue to increase their wealth.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know if you have been curious enough to take the train between Brussels and Strasbourg. Well, between Brussels and Strasbourg, perhaps not exactly at the border crossing but a few kilometres either side, passengers are subjected to controls in which they are asked their nationality, their profession and the reason for their journey, and all with a degree of courtesy that is inversely proportional to the presumed importance of the traveller. We have tabled two amendments in order to condemn and put an end to the French Government"s attitude, as it continues to demand the application of exemption clauses. The controls that are currently carried out at European internal borders should be able to end. I would like to draw your attention to this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the report presented by Mr Nassauer, this text will of course receive at least our qualified support. We naturally welcome the progress made in 1998, although we know that despite everything this progress was made at a snail"s pace rather than the fast pace we would have liked. Commissioner Gradin drew attention to the fact that we were perhaps simply not very fast. Nevertheless, I think that we must radically increase our speed.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, Mr Nassauer must be supported in his demand that Parliament should be listened to and heard, and that its decisions and positions should be taken into account by the Council. There are, of course, initiatives to be taken, but first of all it is enough to apply the clauses of the Treaty and to implement them effectively. That would already be a significant step. There are still two small points on which I would have reservations or disagreements, or which I would at least like to have clarified before the report is adopted, as they concern me slightly: one is the central fingerprints file and the other is the status and the monitoring of Interpol staff.</p>

One of the fundamental elements of the Agreement is of course the gradual removal of border controls among the signatory states, and experience has shown that implementing the Schengen Agreement is a delicate and difficult matter. Indeed, this is why France was obliged to apply exemption mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">If the implementation of Schengen was difficult, then integrating it into the legal corpus of the European Union appears to be just as difficult. The Member States are unable to agree on the definition of what, in Eurospeak, we call the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> , nor can they agree on the division between the first and third pillars. The easy solution would otherwise be to place everything under the third pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, as Mr Nassauer pointed out, in the transitory period, national parliamentary control will disappear, but without our Parliament"s control coming into effect, and on that point we join Mr Nassauer in his request for information. However, information does not mean control. In practice, all these problems point to a reality: Schengen disregarded the facts and they are now catching up on Schengen and on the European Union.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lindeperg </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, as this debate on Article K.6 of the Maastricht Treaty is most likely the last one before the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, it is no longer the time to bemoan, once again, the slow pace, the inefficiency and the lack of transparency and democracy of the operation of the third pillar. We have done plenty of this in previous years and the criticisms that we made then are still valid now.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of Parliament made an excellent summary of the situation on 16 October at a conference in Avignon, when he said that an evaluation of the initiatives and proposals of the last few years bears too great a resemblance to Dante"s hell, in that it is paved with good intentions. He also said that a huge number of conventions that were signed have not been ratified and it is reasonable to doubt that they will ever come into force. The President was illustrating, in a concise but extremely exact manner, a major concern expressed by our committee in Article 23 of the Nassauer resolution. This article gives a list of the main acts that have not yet been ratified. What will become of these agreements and protocols? How can we escape the legal insecurity that we are currently facing? The members of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs invite the Commission to present, in good time, the proposals that are essential for transforming these acts into Community measures as from the entry into force of the new Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I also share the concerns expressed by Mr Pradier and by the Green Group. I do not have enough time to dwell on those concerns and I would particularly like to refer back to a point that has already been made by several of my colleagues, notably by Mr Nassauer and Mrs d"Ancona, and which concerns us greatly. It is the issue of democratic control, which for citizens is an essential counterweight to the sharing of sovereignty that they are being asked to accept. I believe, and the opinion polls show, that they are prepared to accept the transfer of sovereignty that results from bringing part of the third pillar within the Community"s powers. They understand that together we are more capable of fighting large‐scale crime, organised international fraud, and trafficking of every kind. They do not want internal borders to continue to be an obstacle to justice, nor do they want mixed couples who divorce, and the children of these couples, to continue be faced with contradictory rulings. In short, they feel that there is an evident need for the European judicial area that is taking its first steps, and they understand that a shared European sovereignty is better than a declining national sovereignty that no longer has a grip on events. However, this is on condition that effective parliamentary control, which is the only means of democratically operating that shared sovereignty, can be exerted, which is why the Council must take into consideration Parliament"s opinions and change its behaviour towards Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is it, Mr President‐in‐Office, that the demands that we have made one by one over the years, through resolutions like today"s, go unheeded? Mr Nassauer"s resolution recalls the terms of the resolution of 12 December 1996, for which I was rapporteur, which detailed the demands that we made then to the Council for more genuine and more complete information, for systematic consultation, and for our points of view to actually be taken into account. Today we could repeat these terms word for word, as nothing has changed. It is not acceptable, for example, that we were not consulted on the Austrian Presidency"s strategy paper that is going to determine European policy on asylum and immigration for many years.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor is it acceptable that the Council, having taken the official decision, on 19 March 1998, and following our repeated demands, to publish an interim report at the end of each presidency, that is every six months, has not done so. You have expressed your agreement, Mr President‐in‐Office. You see, the problem is that the Council always agrees, in words, but the necessary actions do not follow. If a report was presented beforehand, there could be a real debate in the House.</p>

<p class="contents">I would therefore like to pick up just two points which I consider especially important in this context and which need to be followed up. The first is exchanges of information and relations between the Council, the Council presidency and the European Parliament. It is evident from the comments made by honourable Members that there are genuine problems. I would like to assure you that we will endeavour to work with you to solve these problems in a spirit of cooperation and in accordance with the European treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I would like to pick up is the transition from the Maastricht Treaty to the Treaty of Amsterdam. I believe that we can expect an important debate on new ideas here – including the work done by the Commission – so that we can push ahead with our plans in the fields of internal security and the common European legal area, quickly and profitably.</p>
