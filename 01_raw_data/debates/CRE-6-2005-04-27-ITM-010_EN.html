<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Milan Cabrnoch (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(CS)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to present Parliament’s motion for a resolution on the Commission report on modernising social protection and developing high-quality health care and long-term care. The Commission presented this report to the European Council, Parliament, the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee last spring. Its main aim was to identify the principle challenges to be overcome by all the health care systems in all the Member States, and to propose joint objectives that could be used as guidelines by the Member States when developing or, potentially, reforming these systems. The open method of coordination is used in identifying common challenges, committing to joint objectives, exchanging views and experience and carrying out joint evaluations of the success of developments in care systems in the individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which both discussed the Commission report, took a keen interest in it, as can be seen from the fact that over 100 amendments to my motion for a resolution were tabled. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs discussed the motion for a resolution in late March and voted on all the amendments that had been tabled, and the motion we have before us today is the end result of that process. In any event, only five amendments have so far been tabled, all of which propose changes that were tabled and rejected by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. I am firmly convinced that the House will vote in favour of my motion for a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may, I should now like to make some brief comments on the issues that we discussed. Problems relating to health and long-term care are of central interest to all the EU Member States, and a lively debate on the health care system and its future is taking place in every one of them. Furthermore, I can state without hesitation that health care reforms are either underway or on the drawing board in each of the Member States. Health care affects every member of the public, and that obviously also includes politicians. The provision of high-quality health care that is accessible to everyone who needs it, irrespective of age, status or wealth, is in the public interest, and is therefore a task for politicians. Something else that is in the public interest, and hence also a task for politicians, is maintaining a stable health care system, and by ‘stable’ I mean not only financially stable, but also stable in other respects, for example in terms of staffing, which is a key issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission identifies three main challenges in its report, namely the ageing of the population, new technologies for preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic care and the growing expectations of a public that is increasingly aware of health care choices. To these can be added the rising age of health care workers, the fact that these workers are leaving certain countries to work abroad, the increased movement of EU citizens between Member States and the growing levels of immigration from third countries into the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The main objectives proposed by the Commission are high-quality care, accessibility to all and long-term financial sustainability, which would obviate the need for state funding from other budget headings. When the Commission report was discussed in committee, consensus was reached on these challenges and on the joint objectives. Another issue that was highlighted was the question of subsidiarity, the implication of which in the field of health and long-term care is that national governments are fully responsible for developing and reforming health care in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also stress that prevention is the most effective way of improving public health. The role of patients as clients of health care services is of great significance to Parliament, as patients have the right to decide freely on their health and the care they receive. Following on from this, they also have the right to receive detailed and easy to understand information on health and illness, as well as on health care and its outcomes, possibilities, alternatives and risks. New communications technologies represent both a major challenge and a significant opportunity, as information comes at a premium in the field of health care, and we will be able to achieve higher quality care and a better use of public funds if this information can be shared between individual patients and their doctors.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else we would highlight is the key role played by patients, as well as their right to decide and the responsibility they bear for such decisions. Information is an essential requirement for decision-taking, as is cooperation with doctors, even though the latter will always have an advantage in terms of information. This does not, however, give them the right to take decisions for patients. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that my report and the motion for a resolution I have tabled will be endorsed by the vast majority of Members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It contains a great many proposals and recommendations, and the Commission will pay due attention to all of them. I was particularly glad to see that the report argues in favour of stepping up cooperation in order to improve health and long-term care for senior citizens in the Member States, and that it takes the open method of coordination as its basis.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of this year, the Commission will adopt a communication setting out proposals aimed at rationalising and simplifying the open method of coordination in the field of social protection. As noted in paragraph 32 of the report, these proposals will cover health and long-term care, as well as social integration and pensions. We regard health care as one of the key aspects of the strategies to be developed by the Member States over the next few years with a view to solving the problem of demographic ageing whilst maintaining a high level of social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Your report has therefore come at a very opportune time, and will be of great help to us in drafting these proposals. The same is true for the national reports on health and long-term care that we are in the process of receiving from the Member States. A crucial part of our work schedule will be to identify opportunities for interaction with the current and future European public health strategies and with the relevant Community action programme. Both Commissioner Kyprianou and myself and our departments will continue to cooperate closely to this end. At the same time, of course, we will not lose sight of the fact that the Member States bear the primary responsibility for health and long-term care, and that the European Union’s job is to support political bodies with decision-making powers at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">Your report discusses a wide range of issues relating to social protection and public health, as well as those relating to the free movement of persons and services on the internal market. All these fundamental issues must be addressed using the appropriate instruments, which include the legislative powers we hold with regard to the internal market and freedom of movement, as well as the action programme for public health and the open method of coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will seek to ensure maximum coherence between these individual instruments, whilst at the same time continuing to promote an integrated understanding of health care in terms of efforts to provide appropriate and fair health care to all citizens, whether in their own countries or in other EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, this is an extremely wide-ranging and thorough report, and I should merely like to comment on one of its paragraphs. According to paragraph 7, Parliament regrets that the Commission views the modernisation of social protection with regard to health care essentially in terms of the requirements of the Stability Pact. In my opinion, this is not entirely accurate. Mr Cabrnoch has already said that the threefold aim of accessibility, quality and long-term financial sustainability lies at the heart of all debates on modernisation. This means that although long-term financial sustainability is of considerable importance, it is not the only guiding principle for all of our decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said at the start of my speech, this report has come at a very opportune time, and the points covered in it are such that we will undoubtedly give consideration to them in our future work. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Benchmarking, and the dissemination of the best practice resulting from it, is very much to be welcomed as an approach, particularly in the healthcare sector.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an approach codified and institutionalised by the open method of coordination incorporated into the Lisbon Strategy, a method which requires the participation of the Member States in line with the Commission’s timetables. The best-case scenario is that this makes the whole process more dynamic. In the worst-case scenario, the result is an avalanche of data, with which the authorities concerned cannot cope.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate that we do not yet have the experiential data, collected over many years, that would enable us to carry out accurate assessments of this very complex area. Their absence seems to be a fact of life, particularly in the healthcare sector. If the people on whose work the system depends are to be won over to the idea of inner-European exchange in the health sector, I think the open method of coordination needs, in the first instance, to be introduced carefully and progressively.</p>
<p class="contents">Under no circumstances must data be collected in such massive quantities that the authorities would then be unable to process it. The dynamics of the process as a whole would seem to make a mandatory timetable by far the most sensible option, although computerised data collection cannot be started everywhere at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">In the health sector, I regard the cautious and progressive introduction of statistical returns, hand in hand with in-depth feedback from the personnel involved, as the right way ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be possible, for the sake of efficiency and the long-term acceptance of the open method of coordination, to create an ideally efficient portfolio of data by doing away with the less important returns. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I wish to start by saying that I support, in full, the priorities set out by the Council, which will lead to access for all to good quality health care, provided in a context of long-term financial sustainability. Although health and social protection policy continues to fall under the Member States’ competence, the EU has rightly taken a step forward by applying the open method of coordination in this area, thereby strengthening cooperation between national policies. In this regard, the open method of coordination is undoubtedly the most effective instrument in the current circumstances, although we are aware that measures of this kind are mainly geared towards the citizens as health care consumers. Unless there is a climate of confidence between the citizens and the health care services, none of this will be anything more than good intentions. As in all relations between consumers and suppliers, a climate of confidence is essential, and this is especially true of the health care sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In some Member States, the citizens’ confidence in the services falls well short of what one would wish to see. For the system to be able to work, it is crucial that the citizens have confidence in the services at their disposal, yet for this to become a reality, no information should be kept from the users of health care services. It should be made absolutely clear that patients’ rights are paramount and first and foremost among them is the right to information on their state of health, on the possibilities available to them in terms of health care and long-term care and on the level of quality of the care offered on the market by individual providers. The prime objective, which is at the moment still a utopian dream, is to provide every European citizen unlimited access to good quality services, regardless of age, sex, nationality and financial status. For this to happen, however, Member States must accept that reforms must be carried out to ensure the system’s financial stability. Accordingly, they will need to introduce the principle that the patient pays for certain health care expenses. The Member States must face the fact that every service comes at a price, although with regard to payment by patients, the person’s economic situation must be taken into account, with the onus naturally falling on the State to help the poorest sections of society.</p>
<p class="contents">Member State governments have sovereignty in this area, but this initiative must be seen as an important step towards the construction of a social Europe. I therefore welcome it wholeheartedly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The development of high-quality health care inevitably entails rising costs, and if policy takes no account of this fact, we cannot help ending up with first and second-class medicine. History shows us who gets less care under those circumstances. We can expect to live longer, and, when I say it is fortunate that there are more and more older people, I mean that in the sense that major issues always bring with them new ideas and innovation, so it may well be that the EU of 25 or 27 will thereby be turned into a humane society founded upon solidarity. It is for that reason that this report makes the specific point that particular care needs to be taken to maintain equity if the poorer members of society are to bear an ever-greater share of the cost of healthcare.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the EU – by which I now mean the EU of 27 – health provision varies from one extreme to another. In terms of costs, this means that countries’ expenditure on healthcare varies from 4% to 9% of their gross domestic product. Of the new Member States, the poorest spend the least and also have the worst health provision. That is a fact. It does not, however, simply mean that spending more adds up to better performance. That requires more efficient management and particular attention to the type of care and the demand for it if health provision and long-term care are to be funded in the long run. This calls for a European benchmark and open coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I want to make about cost is that the United States spend nearly 14% of their gross domestic product on health, and make a poor job of sharing it out. We cannot aim to do that, and nor should we. We do, on the other hand, have to take account of the fact that, at present, medical knowledge doubles every five years. Although that means more costs, everyone has the same entitlement to care, and that is something to which we have to give priority. Hence the need not only for benchmarking, but also for solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no shortage of problems to deal with. The new Member States are still combating corruption in many areas of their health systems. It is where the lack of provision is most glaring that corruption is at its height and older people are poorest, and their poverty is increasing more than elsewhere. Those, in essence, are the social challenges we face. Believe me, older people are most afraid when they believe they will be inadequately cared for when ill or that it will no longer be possible to care for them. It is in the new Member States, as a result of budgetary pressure, that public funding is least secure.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I have listed just a few problems, there are others that are becoming apparent; health workers are relocating from the new Member States to the old Fifteen, to the benefit of the healthcare systems there. So let me repeat that this is a sensitive political issue, and improved coordination and cooperation are absolutely vital. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, it has to be considered in the context of the pressure that the Lisbon process puts on health care and on the social insurance systems in order to turn them into services capable of being marketed throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, when considering it, we have to bear in mind the fact that the services directive will make health care subject to European competition rules and to the country of origin principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as is emphasised at various points in the report, one consequence of population change is that, in many Member States, healthcare systems are regarded as an intolerable burden on the national budget, and this has had a markedly detrimental effect on the working conditions of healthcare personnel.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s latest proposals give backing to this trend. The report plays a crucial part in preparing for a fundamental choice between what has been proposed by the Commission and the Council on the one hand and by Parliament on the other. The question at issue is whether health care and social protection systems should remain wholly within the sphere of services of general interest or whether they should be made subject to the competition rules of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s response, in no uncertain terms, to this is that health care must continue to be considered as a service of general interest, and universal access for all – regardless of their purchasing power – must be guaranteed. In this report, moreover, this House makes it quite clear that systems of financial solidarity must be neither abandoned nor reduced to empty shells. I hope that the Commission will, in its future proposals, take on board the detailed amendments in this report, which constitute a clear and alternative response to the challenge we face. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although I believe that the key principles adopted by the Confederal Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left are reflected in his motion for a resolution, I have tabled a number of amendments that emphasise our group’s priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I am delighted that the rapporteur’s proposals stress that health care should be provided to EU citizens in accordance with the principle of solidarity. The right to health is after all considered to be a fundamental right in all the EU Member States, and one that is conferred on the basis of solidarity. My amendment was intended to ensure that this is in fact what happens. Secondly, it is surely the case that as well as safeguarding the freedom of movement of workers, we should also safeguard their right to receive appropriate, high-quality and accessible health care in all EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that I have tabled further amendments aimed at improving training for health care workers, in order to achieve a comparable level of training in all Member States. I firmly believe that this training must be funded from the EU training budget, and that the Member States must not be left to deal with this matter on their own.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I welcome the rapporteur’s comments to the effect that the health care services should focus on prevention, and I believe that the Commission should encourage the Member States to step up all preventive measures, not only with regard to health care provision, but also with regard to working time and health at work. Our aim should be not only to increase the flexibility and competitiveness of the workforce, but also to protect the health of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, I agree with the rapporteur when he says that although medical science offers new diagnostic and therapeutic options, health care systems must also be financially stable. In my opinion, health care cannot be viewed only in accounting terms, and I would therefore find it regrettable if such an approach dominated our understanding of health care reform. I would be unable to lend my support to such an approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every country should be required to maintain and fund essential health care services. The liberal approach, which consists of privatising services and imposing market conditions upon them by means of various pieces of legislation will not safeguard the provision of care in areas such as preventive medicine, mother and baby care, diseases of civilisation and geriatric and palliative care. Even though these areas are all loss-making, they are essential and crucial for public health. It is a well-known fact that investing in health means investing in people, as is the case with education. As I only have a few minutes’ speaking time, I should like to focus on what we see as the most important points. There needs to be a public health service, and this health service must continue to develop and remain accessible to all, both to those who can afford treatment and to those who cannot. No ideal system has yet been found for either organising or funding health care services. There are advantages and disadvantages inherent in every system, including both systems based on insurance contributions and what could be termed state-funded systems. The best solution is therefore probably a mixed system. At the same time, however, the social rights of health care workers and patients must be properly safeguarded. State funding must be available for public hospitals, preventive medicine and all other loss-making areas. A great many lofty sentiments have been expressed, particularly in EU legislation, on the subject of modernising social protection in order to develop and improve health care, yet they are often contradictory. The sole result of this is to aggravate the situation with regard to social and health care, even though it is already difficult enough in many countries as a result of increasing costs, bloodthirsty capitalism and a failure to observe moral principles. A good example of this is the contradictions that arise from the fact that the Member States have seemingly been placed in charge of organisation and funding, yet medical services have been included in the services directive. If we wish to guarantee the provision of high-quality care, we cannot regard health as a productive sector of the economy, or health services as normal commercial services. By way of example, one company expects to make as much as CHF 13 billion from sales of an anti-cancer drug after gaining permission to sell the drug in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I have sometimes heard it said in this House that a poor Europe cannot afford to provide long-term care, and that instead we should practice euthanasia, or in other words get rid of the problem by putting people to death. This should not be what is meant by modernising social protection in order to develop and improve health care. The only answer to an ageing population is to change our attitude to conceived life. We should protect this life and do all we can, by which I also mean observing moral principles, in order to improve not only the quality, but also the functioning of health care services. Furthermore, we will not improve health care services in any way whatsoever through extensive administrative machinery, corruption, bureaucracy and by publishing ever more regulations, reports, opinions, declarations and identical or similar lists. This merely increases costs and wastes the time of both the authorities and the doctors and nurses, whose job is to help the sick. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The remaining 90% is determined by many other factors, such as social situation, the lack of jobs and feelings of insecurity amongst those with no means of making a living. Even though the Member States are responsible for public health care, I therefore believe that the European Union should draw up a set of minimum social standards. This would guarantee a minimum of social protection in all Member States, whilst still allowing the richer countries to provide better welfare and health care systems. In my opinion, the European Union should have the right to be informed of the minimum levels of social benefits in the individual Member States. In Poland this figure currently stands at EUR 100, although our dream is to achieve EUR 250. The EU should also be informed of the situation with regard to health care. Polish doctors earn EUR 400 a month at present, and rely on bribes to supplement their income. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It has to be said, though, that the accessibility and quality of health provision and care diverge to a considerable degree. An EU action programme to help promote public health has been in place since 2003, and it provides a sound basis on which our Member States can step up their cooperation. We need to arrive at common objectives, and specifically national strategies can then be devised to deal with the challenges of more mobile patients, rising costs for new treatments and – thank heaven – increased life expectancy.</p>
<p class="contents">Far too little, though – as the rapporteur has pointed out – is being invested in the preventive care that stops people becoming ill in the first place. The healthcare sector has considerable potential for employment. It is rightly seen as being likely to become more important in the future, not only in terms of the money that will be spent on it, but also of its potential for innovation. I am thinking of such things as home care services, for which there is an ever-increasing demand, and which make it possible for old people and the sick to be cared for in familiar domestic surroundings, something that is psychologically important and plays an important part in helping people to live longer and more healthily.</p>
<p class="contents">Rising life expectancy gives people a chance to make a personal contribution to society, in the shape of their own experience, which is so vital to it. There are many obstacles standing in the way of job creation in the health sector, and they will be difficult to overcome – one thinks, for example, of the high cost of social insurance in Germany, my home country. The European Union’s healthcare systems must be organised in such a way that the public can afford them and businesses can be freed from excessive costs and thereby encouraged to create jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur emphasises the need for preventive care, improved long-term treatment, and on the need to help patients by improving the much-needed exchange of information between Member States, and I agree with him in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the year 2000, when the report on modernisation of the social protection systems was being debated, I myself was the rapporteur. The first time that we debated the open coordination method, together with healthcare, pensions and other issues was when we were drawing up the relevant strategy. The organisation and funding of health care are a national issue that, in certain countries, is dealt with at regional level, as it should be allowed to be in the future too. The issue is that of whether there is added value for Europe in cooperation, and the answer is yes, because these are common challenges that we face. You pointed out some of them, two of which I want to address.</p>
<p class="contents">Technical development, enabling us to do more, is of course a positive development meaning that more people can be cured. It also places greater demands on future priorities, however. We are also living longer. That is a good thing, but it also puts a bigger strain on health services. An exchange of best practice in this area is possible.</p>
<p class="contents">As many have pointed out, it is important to invest in preventive health. In this connection, I myself pushed the issue of our needing a developed occupational health service because many illnesses and other problems arise in working life. Being familiar with the working environment and able to intervene early is important for health care. I see those who have to make use of health services as being, in the first place, patients rather than customers. This is connected with the view that health care is not a commercial service but a service driven by need. I do not think it belongs in the Services Directive, a view also expressed by a number of other people in this House. The Services Directive is, in the first place, about commercial services, while this is a service of general interest and should be debated in that context. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If he wants to highlight the need for costs to be cut in healthcare provision, he ought not to ignore the part played by the pharmaceutical industry. I regard the failure to address this as a defect in the report we are discussing.</p>
<p class="contents">I want, though, to draw your attention to something else – the link between the lack of doctors in EU Member States, to which the report refers, and the Working Time Directive, which is currently under discussion. Doctors in many German hospitals complain of poor working conditions and intolerable working hours, and the criticism levelled by the women among them is that deliberate mobbing makes it more difficult for them to balance work and family. This often adds up to overworked and stressed-out doctors, who may move to other countries or even leave the profession altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who bear responsibility for the misguided health and personnel policies of recent years are now trying to make the workers pay for their failures. They do this by drawing a distinction between active and non-active on-call time, the latter of which they refuse to pay for, claiming that thousands of new healthcare posts would be needed if they were to do so. The employers’ association of the German <span class="italic">Länder</span>,<span class="italic"> </span>and individual ministers in the <span class="italic">Länder</span>,<span class="italic"> </span>have given us examples of what they mean by non-active on-call time: time spent on general visits, changing dressings, time outside ordinary working time spent doing infusions, injections, and routine chores such as dealing with correspondence.</p>
<p class="contents">I see this as a whole new kind of exploitation, and I ask Members not only to support our amendments, but also, when considering the Working Time Directive, to see to it that what the Commission has drafted does not go unchanged.</p>

I have written to him concerning a possible scam that is appearing in various EU countries. Tourists who unfortunately fall ill are suddenly taken from their hotel and deflected to private hospitals where they are then landed with a hefty bill. Even if they happen to be conscious when they are taken away and protest that they are entitled to equivalent free healthcare, they are nonetheless whisked off to a private hospital.</p>
<p class="contents">I accept that this a matter for Member States, but I ask the Commissioner whether there is there anything he or we can do about it. Is he aware of the extent of the problem and does he accept, as this report states, that citizens have the right to equivalent healthcare in every Member State and that this needs reinforcing? What can he do to reinforce it? I would ask him to be so good as to reply in English saying what can be done, so that I can send this reply to my constituent in the West Midlands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Confidence that health care can be provided is a precondition of the individual being able to operate properly in society. It provides security. Work therefore needs to be done on harmonising and improving the quality of the health care Europeans receive. The ageing of the population will create problems in relation to the national health systems’ capacity to secure access and quality in the future. In spite of their different healthcare arrangements, all the Member States face this problem. Modernisation is required. Resources within the health sector therefore need to be used better, but it is important for this not just to mean rationalisation and greater efficiency. We have to remember that prevention is the most effective form of health care.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Europe of the future, health must not be seen as a cost but, rather, as facilitating a competitive economy. The mid-term evaluation of the Lisbon Strategy also emphasises the need for the social pillar. The social dimension is quite simply a necessity if Europe is to achieve growth and employment. If we are to go on securing a well-educated and skilful labour force, we must be able to offer effective and universal health care. The Member States must therefore become better at making use of the open coordination method and the opportunity it provides for exchanging good practice.</p>
<p class="contents">More should also be done to improve our working environment so that we prevent accidents at work and work-related illnesses. An improved environment will generally also have a beneficial effect on general health and will thus make for healthier people, which will again release resources for health care. Health, growth and employment are inextricably linked. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These systems must operate on the basis of non-discrimination, benefiting people on low incomes, guaranteeing equal access for all to good quality public services and safeguarding human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore opposed to the proposals paving the way for the privatisation of public services in these essential areas. We object for example to the Bolkestein proposal for a directive intended to set up an internal market for services and to the proposal for a directive on certain aspects of the organisation of working time, which, by undermining health professionals’ working conditions, also jeopardises the health of people using the services in question.</p>

For that, I would like to say how grateful I am to him.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s eventual agreement, in October of last year, to the use of open coordination in health provision and the care of the elderly is another success chalked up by this House. I am confident that the PROGRESS programme, on which I am the rapporteur, will soon provide us with an instrument for organising the exchange of best practice, which is so urgently needed, and for pushing through a reciprocal and mutual process of learning from one another. At the end of the day, the Member States need to be helped to undertake reforms aimed at modernising and strengthening health systems, in which process particular importance must be attached to social cohesion and the principle of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Member States want to ensure, in future, continued universal access to their systems for health care and the care of the elderly, to guarantee their quality and secure their funding, what is needed above all is more prevention and greater transparency. Transparency is itself indispensable if quality is to be maintained and if the resources available to the healthcare systems are to be used in the best possible way. Assessing the quality of medical services must be made much easier; paying out large sums of money for poor-quality service must come to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">Patients’ organisations have a very important part to play in this, and they must be more involved in future decisions on health policy. All the Member States wanted to go further by adopting a Patients’ Law or Patients’ Charter. They all also face major challenges where the care of the elderly and long-term care are concerned. We should join together in seeking strategies for improving the interaction between healthcare provision and treatment, in order to be able to improve care for patients in their homes and to provide sufficient care facilities.</p>

This has painful consequences for public health and leeches the income of the grass-roots. The patient is a customer. Basically, there is no health policy. Health and safety at work regulations are primitive. On an annual basis, 40% of healthcare services provided are covered by workers' wages. Health is increasingly being integrated into the more general anti-grass roots policy of the European Union. Responsibility for the protection of health is being individualised and the healthcare services market is being fully liberalised, following the sweeping changes in industrial relations and in social insurance, such as the organisation of working times, the increase in the retirement age, the reduction in pensions and so on. Healthcare should not be a commodity. It should be a free, quality service provided on an equal footing to everyone by the state alone. The pharmaceutical and biomedical technology sectors, production and marketing should belong to the state and should be controlled by society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It remains too general, does not set any timetables, and is not sufficiently focused. Well, on this issue, incantations are not enough. Let us be ambitious for this social Europe every one of us wants to see, and let us take healthcare and social protection expenditure from the Stability and Growth Pact, as this expenditure does not represent costs; it is an investment that creates wealth and efficiency for society as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Two significant matters absent from the report are the issue of financing a pioneering social protection system and mass unemployment in Europe. Both issues are of major importance. Without shared financing and without financial income contributions to the solidarity effort, it will be impossible to achieve the desired goal. With regard to unemployment, it is a long-lasting strain on the sum of revenues required to finance social protection and healthcare.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, let me add these two precise responses to the precise needs of the European people. In striving too hard to reach a limp consensus, which in the end leads to nothing, we are only intensifying Eurosceptism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In a certain sense it pushes us to our limits; after all, no one can fail to be moved by anguish, suffering and death, and these are all part and parcel of health care.</p>
<p class="contents">It emerged clearly from the debate that the open method of coordination is regarded as a suitable way of coordinating health care systems in the European Union, and this is something I very much welcome. Speakers also warned that consideration must be given to questions of administrative and technical management whenever this method is used. This is undoubtedly true, and I have taken note of these warnings. I am no fan of collecting useless information and creating systems that are incapable of delivering results.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bushill-Matthews, who is no longer present in the Chamber, asked a question that I imagine relates to a specific incident. If I understood what was said correctly, the gist of what had happened was that someone had suffered health problems and was presumably treated in a clinic against his will, whereupon the clinic demanded payment for services that were not covered by his insurance. It is by no means the Commission’s intention that eventualities and instances of this kind should prove to be commonplace or likely, and I will look into this incident in order to obtain more detailed information on it.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, honourable Members, our debate has shown that this report is an extremely valuable document, and I should like to quote one last paragraph from it. According to paragraph 9, Parliament takes the view that the ageing of the population constitutes a challenge and should also be taken as an opportunity to involve people with long and valuable experience more closely in society and enterprises as a part of active ageing. I believe that this paragraph demonstrates that the report is both well thought-out and well-balanced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
