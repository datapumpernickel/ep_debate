<p class="contents">The intention behind the introduction of Europass is the formation of a single framework of European Union documents to achieve greater transparency of qualifications and competences of citizens. It would also be a contribution to the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy and at the same time it would help to improve the quality of education in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Europass documents are: the Europass curriculum vitae, the Europass mobility pass, which records periods of education abroad, the Europass diploma supplement, which contains information about the holder's achievements at a university level, the Europass language pass, which shows language knowledge, and the Europass certificate supplement, which shows the qualifications and competence defined by a vocational training certificate.</p>
<p class="contents">Citizens are free to use individual Europass documents or the entire dossier of documents. In future years it will be possible to add new documents, particularly in the field of information technology.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament gave its opinion on the legislative proposal at first reading under the codecision procedure on 21 April 2004 and 14 amendments were tabled, almost all of which were taken up. The European Council reached a political agreement on the draft at its meeting on 27 and 28 May.</p>
<p class="contents">After the draft document had been discussed in the Committee on Culture and Education it was unanimously decided (with one abstention) to accept Europass with immediate effect at the plenary session of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur, I support the Europass proposal and I am in favour of its rapid entry into force. Assuring that the advantages and benefits of the use of this document is in the interests of the citizens of the European Union, as well as the Commission and the Netherlands Presidency. The proposed date of entry into force is 1 January 2005. The early introduction of the proposed Europass will also enable the early establishment of all the procedures for its realisation.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the proposal, each Member State is responsible for implementation at a national level. To that end each Member State will establish a national Europass Centre, responsible for coordinating activities in this area. A European network of national Europass Centres will also be established. Their activities will be coordinated by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be the task of national Europass Centres to coordinate, in cooperation with the appropriate state bodies, activities related to the availability and issue of Europass documents, to establish and manage a national information system, to encourage the use of Europass, to ensure, in cooperation with the appropriate state bodies, that relevant guidelines and information about Europass are available to every citizen, to provide information about possibilities for study in Europe and about the structure of educational and training systems, to manage all activities connected to this at a national level with the financial support of the Community, and to participate in the European network of National Centres. The National Centre functions as an executive body at the national level.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the Member States will ensure that both at Community level and at a national level appropriate actions are taken to introduce Europass and to keep citizens, education and training providers, social partners and enterprises informed about it. The Commission will also report regularly to Parliament and the Council as to the implementation of such actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The first report and evaluation will be three years after the document comes into effect. The report period thereafter will be every four years. Given that education is the basis of the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, Europass documents will greatly improve the mobility of European citizens in the field of education and employment and will allow closer cooperation between the peoples of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europass is this initiative. It is a step towards a European learning area, as my predecessor said during the first reading. Europass will help people make their qualifications and competences clearly and easily understood throughout Europe. It will thus make it easier for citizens to find a job or move more easily from one country to another for studies or work.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal brings together, in a coordinated portfolio called Europass, five existing transparency documents. These are the Europass-Curriculum Vitae, which will highlight personal competences; the Europass-Language Portfolio, which provides an accurate description of linguistic skills; Europass-Mobility, which records all mobility experiences for learning purposes and replaces existing Europass training while giving it wider scope; the Europass-Diploma Supplement; and lastly the Europass-Certificate Supplement. These last documents clarify respectively competences behind a higher education diploma and a vocational training certificate.</p>
<p class="contents">Europass is an open framework which in future could include other instruments, for instance to target specific competences such as computer-related skills. I am pleased to know that this essential feature was endorsed and enriched by Parliament, which stressed its importance, as well as by the Council, which defined a clear procedure to put it into practice. This illustrates how the proposal, without having been substantially changed, has been improved through the exchange of views between institutions, based on the widespread consensus on both its purpose and content.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to stress the remarkable work achieved first by Mrs Zissener and now by Mrs Novak, in close contact with the Commission and the Council. This work has allowed us to reach this final stage.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position adopted by the Council responds to the concerns expressed by both legislative bodies, integrating the amendments proposed by Parliament with only two minor changes that leave their substance unchanged. As you know, the Commission accepts this common position. I am therefore pleased that Mrs Novak's report proposes accepting this common position, which would allow its entry into force on 1 January 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">I intend to go further, proposing to Member States and social partners an appropriate instrument to facilitate the transparency of qualifications. We hope the European Parliament will support the Commission in its efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to express my gratitude to the European Parliament, in particular the Committee on Culture and Education, for its efforts to speed up the process especially at this second reading phase. I also express my gratitude to both the Irish and Netherlands presidencies of the Council for all their work. Europass is a direct service to citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Europass is a European record of achievement with which, I am glad to say, we have been able to take a small but important step forward after all the fine words about taking government to the people.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it creates transparency throughout Europe for all periods of education and training, for skills acquired in all walks of life. Secondly, it creates credibility through the certification and recognition of occupational and extra-vocational experience, including voluntary work in the realms of social welfare, culture and sport as well as the acquisition of various linguistic skills. Thirdly, it creates efficiency, because it fosters understanding and recognition of qualifications and skills for an ever-increasing number of young and not-so-young people.</p>
<p class="contents">More than ever before, we need to take government closer to the people, and we need fewer eulogies to a technocratic and bureaucratic virtual Europe. We need tangible instruments, of which the Europass is a prime example. It is a resource for people’s everyday lives. It lets people experience Europe at first hand on a daily basis, wherever they are.</p>
<p class="contents">All measures in the field of education policy, such as Comenius, Erasmus, Grundtvig, e-learning, the mutual recognition of diplomas and now the Europass, add value to Europe by lending it a human dimension. This injection of soul into Europe, which puts individuals at the heart of the debate and makes them the focus of decisions affecting their everyday lives, is important. The Europass is a key element, not only in terms of the comparability and recognition of professional achievements but more especially because it includes voluntary social and civic involvement in the catalogue of acquired skills.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to congratulate the Commission and all of us here for having created this really good mechanism in such a short time – less than a year – and I very much hope that, along with the other improvements envisaged by Commissioner Figeľ, we shall have a good platform from which to launch the Europass next year. I wish him, and hence our young people too, every success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that this aim has slipped down the list of priorities and that we should present it in a far more progressive manner than is currently the case. As for this Europass, although it is a ‘soft’ form of evidence of qualifications and competence with no binding force, it is still very important and helps young and mobile people on training courses who spend training periods abroad to obtain a transparent and comprehensible summarised record of their achievements, qualifications and acquired skills with more or less full comparability throughout the EU. This, at last, is a sign of the transparency we are always invoking.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Europass is intended to give future employers within the European Union an overview of a young person’s experience and qualifications. The extended collection of documents, which, as you know, comprises a curriculum vitae, a mobility pass and other papers, is a standardised supplementary instrument. This new framework, which guarantees that new documents in the field of information technology, for example, can be incorporated into the Europass portfolio in future, is very important, because education is always full of innovations, and the Europass will have to accommodate them. I am very grateful for this flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to refer to the value of periods spent in other countries, and I believe that the documents should not only record dates and technical details but should also include explicit and retraceable references to intercultural learning experiences and social integration. The EU stands for openness and mobility. It encourages and demands mobility. For this reason, I proposed that people be issued with an introductory guide to mobility. This proposal, unfortunately, has been watered down by the addition of the phrase ‘where appropriate’. May I ask that issuing such a guide be deemed appropriate in very many cases, because that, to me, would be a real sign of government being taken to the people. Moreover, I believe that the national Europass agencies should be integrated into existing agencies and that these should be developed with a view to pooling the experience, activities and networks of existing institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also launch an information campaign. The first of January will soon be here, and there is still a widespread lack of awareness. There is therefore an urgent need to mobilise in the cause of mobility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also often hear about delays in meeting targets. We are halfway through the period by the end of which we are aiming to be the most competitive and most dynamic knowledge-based economy capable of sustainable economic growth, with more and better jobs. If Europe’s position in the knowledge-based economy is to be cemented, the appropriate conditions must be created. European systems of education and specialist training must meet the requirements of the new economy and must be able to interconnect. Opportunities for education and specialist training must be offered in the different Member States and at different stages in the lives of young people, whether unemployed or employed, who are threatened by the fact that rapid technological changes might render their qualifications worthless.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, this single Framework for the Transparency of Qualifications and Competences <span class="bold">will</span> make it easier for citizens to inform Europe of their qualifications and competences. This framework will make the existing system of using documents better coordinated, more streamlined and more effective for the transparency of qualifications and competences accepted at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Many employers and head teachers are aware of the current problems with the assessment of levels of knowledge and skill achieved within an uncoordinated framework of different qualifications, certificates and diplomas. The introduction of the Europass will make it easier for workers, students, employers and educational institutions to operate in the European labour and education market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The difficulty is not in adopting this proposal but in implementing it. Mrs Novak's explanatory statement helpfully highlights the role envisaged for the national Europass centres to coordinate all the activities laid down by this decision.</p>
<p class="contents">But this is not some detailed administrative role. If the proposal is to have the maximum benefit, implementation entails direct and continuous contact by the national Europass centres both with universities and colleges and also with employers' organisations. I wonder whether, in his reply to the debate, the Commissioner might dwell on this point and indicate how he sees the national Europass centres successfully undertaking this work?</p>
<p class="contents">The other – related – point I wish to raise is the question of monitoring the system. The initial evaluation period will now take place after three years – originally it was proposed after four years – and thereafter at intervening four-year timescales. I would have thought it unlikely that after the initial evaluation period radical changes would be made; so what that really means is that it is not until the system has been up and running for seven years that the Commission is going to be able to take a view on it. That seems rather a long way off. I wonder whether the Commissioner might dwell on that point as well? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My thanks are also due to the Commission for its initiative. This is an area of our activity to which the people of Europe, especially our young people, can relate and from which they can derive many benefits. With such initiatives we can show young people that the Community makes tangible improvements which affect their daily lives. It is certainly a good example of the people-centred policy we need to pursue.</p>
<p class="contents">The document on the table is the fruit of a lengthy development process, and I should stress that it is not the final word, for the Commission has also stated clearly that the scope and potential for development must be preserved, and indeed the document itself provides for an open-ended process. Specific initiatives in the field of education, of course, were already being launched back in the sixties and seventies. The aim was always to enhance the quality and mobility of students and trainees without seeking to harmonise European education policies. It goes without saying that we must accompany such measures with instruments and incentives to make cross-border education a feasible option. Particularly for residents of territorially smaller countries with many borders, these initiatives are an important point of entry to the single European market.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim must therefore be to introduce further improvements, which means clearing away a significant amount of red tape and, most importantly, involving business and labour organisations and making the system easier and cheaper to manage, especially as regards documentation. More exchanges of young trainees must be encouraged at every level, with primary importance attaching to financial support. This is the only way for us to achieve the Lisbon objective and, in particular, to increase public satisfaction with the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, let me simply add that more than 200 000 young people have already taken part in these mobility programmes in recent years, and this is the direction in which we should seek to progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to respond to several points. Of course I should begin by expressing my thanks for the support given to the concept and to the process itself. EUROPASS is a good initiative and I am convinced that it will bear fruit. </p>
<p class="contents">Our actual approach has a deadline of next year but as early as tomorrow morning I am travelling to Maastricht, which is hosting a large conference of ministers of education and vocational training. This will be followed by a conference with our economic and social partners, the aim of which is to promote still further the Copenhagen process, which is a constituent part of the Lisbon Strategy. In January, under the Luxembourg Presidency, we want to launch a campaign to apply EUROPASS in the individual Member States. The current network of so-called experts and consultants for EUROPASS correspondents will be changed to a network of national centres for EUROPASS. Our agencies in the various countries will be required to prepare for the transition to national EUROPASS centres. I believe that the resources which the Commission has earmarked for the years 2005 and 2006, although modest, have been directed precisely towards support for the concept of EUROPASS. The sum of EUR 2 million per annum will not only help us to visualise this possibility but will increase its effect in that it will start to be used as a credible document for the transparency of qualifications within the European Union. As Mr Beazley said, the single market does indeed demand much greater opportunities for the movement of labour and also for the movement of students, those people who are in the process of gaining qualifications. I am sure that this further step taken towards the recognition of qualifications other than the regulated ones should not take as long as some of the processes did in the past in building up compatibility in the single market area. I would also like to add to what Mrs Prets said, namely that support for intercultural dialogue will increase and that anyone who can find their feet in a broader cultural environment and who masters the language and culture of a particular country will have the same comparative advantage. The enlarged European Union needs all of this to become a reality. I think I have said enough. I would like to thank you once more for allowing me the opportunity to participate in this discussion and I would like to wish you and all of us every success. Thank you very much, <span class="italic">merci beaucoup</span>.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
