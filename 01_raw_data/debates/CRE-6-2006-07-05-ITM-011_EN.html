<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Giovanni Claudio Fava (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament constantly has to tackle a high-minded and difficult task: making its personal contribution to combating terror. As you know, on Saturday, alongside our British friends, we will be commemorating the fifty people who died in last year’s bomb attacks in London.</p>
<p class="contents">We have another equally difficult task: investigating the truth, including the truth about the abuses committed over the past few years in the name of the fight against terrorism. This is the raison d’être of our committee: the truth about the rights denied those accused of being our enemies, but who, as human beings who stand accused, are entitled to representation by a lawyer, to a trial, a judge and dignified and humane treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, where there are no rights there are no laws – merely the exercise of force and arbitrary acts. When we talk of extraordinary rendition, which is the theme on which our committee has focused, we are talking about an arbitrary act that certain countries want and others accept in the name of the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Extraordinary rendition refers to the extraordinary transport of terrorist suspects captured by the CIA and sent to complaisant countries that are willing to interrogate them using any methods at their disposal and to hold them without trial.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years, Mr President, rendition has been a fact and not an opinion or a conjecture. It is a fact that has even been admitted by the US State Department, a practice that has been used and abused, even to the detriment of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We are reserving the work conclusions reached in the past few months, and those that we hope to reach over the next few months, for the concluding report; but it is now our duty to inform you of a vast and general range of offences, involving various European countries and different levels of responsibility: some have been complicit, some have covered up the illegal operations and some have simply looked the other way.</p>
<p class="contents">A few hours ago, news arrived from Italy that the Milan investigating judge has signed a protective custody warrant against the deputy director of the Sismi, the Italian military security service, for acting as an accomplice in the abduction of Abu Omar, the Milan imam who was kidnapped, in whose case another twenty-two preventative custody warrants have been issued against CIA agents. And here I must impress upon you the seriousness of the fact that the director of the Sismi, General Pollari, appeared before our committee to assert that his agency had never received any information regarding this abduction. Let us note the fact that the deputy director was arrested because he was considered to be responsible for this abduction.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we are not a court of justice; because of this event, however, we have an additional responsibility at the political and institutional levels, as do governments and Member States, to which we appeal because the burden of proof – precisely because we are not a court of justice – is a burden that must be shared with the governments, whose full collaboration and commitment to absolute truth we will need in the months to come.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we would like to make every effort to discover the plain truth on the facts and responsibilities, to ensure above all that these events and abuses are never repeated on European territory or to the detriment of European citizens, and I believe that this is the ultimate aim of our committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to the work of our assistants – the committee staff, whom I would like to thank – we have reconstructed in detail a complex system of aircraft and fictitious companies used by the CIA for its assignments in recent years; we have minutely reconstructed the routes of over one thousand flights, which we have made available to our fellow Members of Parliament. We know that many of these flights were routine flights used to transport equipment or officials, but not all of them were: Abu Omar, Maher Arar, Khaled el-Masri, Mohamed Algiza and many others were roughly loaded onto and transported in these aircraft to their prisons.</p>
<p class="contents">These flights have landed in our airports, used our skies and taken advantage of our silence with impunity and in only one case out of 1 084 flights has a police officer claimed to be able to identify crews and passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we have provided the victims of scandalous errors of justice with a voice and the right to speak, as we have those who have enabled this committee to do its work. We now have a difficult task before us, for which we ask Parliament to authorise us to continue our work until the end of our mandate, in the knowledge that the truth that we will have obtained and consolidated by the end of it will constitute a body of work to be placed at the disposal of all European countries and, of course, of this Parliament.</p>

<p class="contents">Right at the start, I would like to say that the subject of this interim report is an extremely important one, and I consider that the initiative taken regarding this issue by the European Parliament and the Council of Europe and its Parliamentary Assembly is very important and significant.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue is the implementation of fundamental rights in Europe and action against terrorism. These must not be allowed to come into conflict with one another. All action taken against terrorism must be in compliance with obligations under international law, and no compromises on these, where it concerns human rights, refugee or humanitarian issues, can be accepted in the name of action against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">With reference to the interim report under discussion, I would nevertheless like to emphasise that the Treaties do not bestow competence on the European Union in such matters as these, and national intelligence is not within the scope of application of the Treaty, because the Member States have unanimously decided to reserve the task of monitoring the work of national intelligence services for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">This obviously does not mean that the Council has adopted a passive stance regarding the matters raised in the report. Since last November it has been suspected publicly that the US Central Intelligence Agency was using flights to transport prisoners and illegal detention facilities in Europe. On 21 November the European Union Foreign Affairs Ministers discussed this information at a session of the General Affairs and External Affairs Council. As a result of this discussion, on 29 November 2005, the Foreign Affairs Minister for the country to hold the Presidency at the time, Jack Straw, wrote to US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on the European Union’s behalf, trying to discover the US Government’s views regarding these allegations. On 5 December the US Secretary of State made a detailed statement on the matter, prior to her European visit, according to which the United States considered that international agreements were binding on its own actions and that the United States respected other countries’ sovereignty and that it did not transport detained persons to countries where they would be tortured, under interrogation or otherwise. The European Union Foreign Affairs Ministers and Secretary of State Rice discussed the matter again later on during the latter’s visit to Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">Since early this year there has been intensive dialogue with the United States at various levels and in different assemblies regarding these matters. Human rights have been discussed on many an occasion with the United States. There have also been discussions on the need for compliance with international law in the fight against terrorism. This was most recently on the agenda at the US-EU Summit in Vienna on 21 June.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has repeatedly asked the US Government to allow United Nations human rights reporters full access to Guantanamo Bay. EU Foreign Affairs Ministers have stated that the European Union is still seriously concerned about Guantanamo Bay, and the topic has been discussed with the United States on more than one occasion. It is the opinion of the EU that the US Government should take steps to close Guantanamo down as soon as possible. Accordingly, the Union welcomed the remark made by President Bush at the Vienna Summit that he was willing to close down the Guantanamo Bay detention centre.</p>
<p class="contents">As the country to hold the Presidency of the Council, Finland will naturally continue to keep alive the debate on human rights in dialogue with the United States. That will be very important during our Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Franco Frattini, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. <span class="italic">(IT) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the eve of the anniversary of the terrorist attacks in London, the fight against terror must certainly remain the main objective of European security strategy and this is a good opportunity to remember it, together with the declaration, which should be loud and clear, that respect for the fundamental human rights of every human being is the other factor that should be included in European security strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that, when we erode guarantees of freedom and people’s fundamental rights, we involuntarily risk providing a propaganda target for the very terrorists that we are combating. The search for truth is therefore necessary, and, I have to say, it involves a historical truth, a legal truth and a search for liability, and naturally the Commission has made and will continue to make a heartfelt contribution to it.</p>
<p class="contents">From the very beginning, the European Commission has made its contribution with conviction, a fact that I believe the committee chairman, Mr Coelho, can corroborate. It assisted and vigorously supported the request from the temporary committee to obtain the Eurocontrol data, which, as emerges from the report, have provided some of the most important evidence for identifying certain facts.</p>
<p class="contents">I also strongly supported requests from the temporary Parliamentary committee for access to European Agency satellite photos. Together with colleagues from the Council, we worked to ensure that the request was dealt with rapidly and I think that this was a useful contribution to the first phase of the temporary committee’s work.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I have tried three times to impress on the Ministers of Home Affairs in the Member States the importance of collaborating with the European Parliament temporary committee and with the Council of Europe, in other words of ensuring that enquiries and national checks make progress in countries where this has not yet happened. I can tell you in advance that at the next Council of Ministers on 24 July, the first to be held under the Finnish Presidency, I will repeat my invitation to the Ministers of Home Affairs in the 25 Member States to continue to collaborate with the temporary Parliamentary committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I acknowledge and agree that the European Parliament temporary committee does not claim to be a sort of ‘European super-court’ and this is a very important factor in identifying institutional responsibilities. However, I maintain that the items indicated in the report are useful tools that must be assessed in detail. Some elements have already been assessed because they were already available to the many national judicial authorities involved in enquiries, some of them highly detailed, that started a long time ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that now, in the light of the data contained in this report, national authorities can and must proceed to such checks with greater conviction, including in cases in which they have not yet been carried out; that they must do so with full guarantees of due process, which are in fact the guarantees of the rule of law, full rights for victims, to whom you too have listened to some extent, and for those accused, and to provide proof of the events, until a judgment determines when and if there is liability for specific events.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the result that, I am sure, we all hope for: to find out at last the full and satisfactory truth on these charges. I think that it is important that we await the decisions to be taken by judges in the Member States with confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express a final thought on future prospects, which seem to me to be just as interesting. I want to reflect on the reform of the so-called secret services, a reform that comes under national competences, but which I think could benefit from broader debate. We could, for example, reflect on whether the rules of transparency, in terms of relations with Parliament’s bodies, can be improved at national level; whether the coordination of the activity of the services in each Member State should, as I believe it should, provide for more direct responsibility on the part of the heads of government of the respective countries; whether there should be some sort of national parliamentary control over the financial resources of the secret services – since everyone knows that where there is control of financial resources, one can have a significant effect on operating activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I quote the reference in the report to the need to define new rules on non-commercial aviation, including by civil aircraft, with a definition of ‘State aircraft’ or ‘used for State business’. I can tell you now that, in this respect, the Commission is ready to discuss this with the temporary committee in the next work period, since finding a European definition, for example for ‘State aircraft’, could be a step forward in this area, which, as you know, is currently insufficiently covered by national legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore confirm my commitment to collaborating with the chairman and the members of the temporary committee. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As regards the report, I believe, Mr President, that it is not sufficient for the rapporteur to say that he can accept some of our amendments. It is a highly tendentious report, which takes into consideration only those points of view critical of the United States. Two examples: until now they have refused to insert two statements by Mr Solana and Mr de Vries because they both said things that were not to the liking of the committee and that were not satisfactory to the Left; they declared that they had no knowledge of any breach of the law by European Member States in their cooperation with the CIA. Now, as a great concession, it appears that they are ready to accept it.</p>
<p class="contents">However, they refuse to accept another statement because it goes against the so-called truth that the committee is trying to impose on us; that is the statement made by an expert from Human Rights Watch <span class="bold">–</span> which as we know, is definitely not an organisation that is in favour of the Bush Administration <span class="bold">–</span> to our committee: ‘we have our suspicions, but no proof.’ We all know that the Americans have made mistakes, for which they must be criticised or even condemned, but they have made mistakes because they are doing something.</p>
<p class="contents">I would have been pleased to see in this report recognition of the fact that, if today we are meeting to discuss the CIA problem, it is thanks to the US press, the US Congress and the US people and not thanks to the report writers. There is no trace of this in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, we remain extremely critical, not to mention disappointed, in this report.</p>

<p class="contents">Let me emphasise and clarify at this point that nobody in our group is against the idea that we should join together in fighting international terrorism. Quite the contrary: but we do take the view that we can no longer do this using the same weapons as the terrorists, but only by lawful means and in accordance with the ethical and moral principles on which our community of values, the European Union, is founded, on which we insist wherever we go in the world and in which we can also take pride.</p>
<p class="contents">It is surely not acceptable that people should be abducted from EU territory or from states that are desirous of joining our Community, flown halfway round the globe and tortured in prisons in such places as Kabul, which has been shown to be what happened to Khaled El-Masri, himself a German citizen. The fact is that this is where the end does not justify the means, and that is what must come between us and the approach adopted by the Bush administration and the CIA. When we express criticism of such goings-on, that has nothing – nothing whatever – to do with anti-Americanism; on the contrary, it is our duty to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">We also find ourselves facing the question that the governments in the EU must answer, namely that as to precisely what a secret service – which is what the CIA is, albeit one from a friendly state – is permitted to do on our soil, and in what manner it may act. After all, this is not something to which the country of origin principle can apply. The Member States of the EU, and also the countries that seek to become such must also make it clear that action may be taken against a person suspected of terrorism only by way of proceedings in accordance with the rule of law. How else, then, do the EU Member States think they can cooperate with such institutions as the European Parliament and the Council of Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">This is a question that the government of FYROM in Skopje has to face up to as well, for we really do not take kindly to being lied to. I am glad, though, that the German foreign minister Mr Steinmeier has not hesitated to confirm that he will be coming to meet our committee; I have to say that we also expect other prominent figures to do likewise.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not our function to carry out investigations with the exact attention to detail of a state prosecutor and eventually produce a statement of facts and a charge sheet; what we must do is to make it clear to the citizens of the European Union, once our work is done, what, to our knowledge, has taken place and what political conclusions should be drawn from it in order that we may continue to hold fast to our values and principles, and to demonstrate the European Union’s readiness to defend and guarantee freedom, security and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears, though, that there are some in the House who have not yet even begun to grasp what that might mean. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank Mr Coelho for his assiduous and steady chairmanship.</p>
<p class="contents">The area of justice and human rights in the EU is not working effectively. On the one hand, some Member States have not implemented EU anti-terrorism laws passed five years ago, so we are not equipped throughout the EU to investigate and prosecute terrorist offences. In some Member States there is not even a definition of terrorism, so terrorists can escape conviction and imprisonment. Mr Fava recalled the London bombings, which we will sadly remember on Friday; we also remember the Madrid bombings. If the same thing happened in some of our national capitals, there would be no prospect of terrorists being convicted.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope Mr Gawronski and his friends are knocking on the doors of those national capitals which have not implemented the framework decision on terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time it is apparent on the basis of credible indications that gross human rights abuses have taken place in the name of fighting terrorism – the so-called war on terror. The EU has allowed a situation to develop where we cannot prosecute terrorists, but we can persecute terrorist suspects and deprive them of their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">What credibility does this give the EU at home or abroad, either for effectively combating terrorism or for upholding human rights? Let us be clear: what we are saying in this report is that we have heard testimony and seen corroborating facts, such as flight logs, which attest to extraordinary renditions having taken place in Europe, and it is highly implausible that governments or their agencies had no idea what was going on. We have not implied we are a court or we have the powers of an investigating police officer or prosecutor, but we have done enough in cooperation and in complementarity with Dick Marty in the Council of Europe, with national MPs and judicial inquiries, to shift the burden of proof.</p>
<p class="contents">Once allegations are no longer speculative but are shown to be credible, as is the case, then under European and international human rights instruments Member States have a positive obligation to investigate and to punish anyone responsible for human rights abuses.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that in private the Presidency is saying something different to its 24 EU government colleagues than it is saying here. I hope it is saying this conspiracy of silence must stop. To say, as the Minister did, that the Treaties do not give the EU any powers is untrue. If that is the case, then why did governments unanimously insert the human rights clause into the EU Treaty and a clause, Article 7, which provides for sanctions for breach?</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that we lack the monitoring mechanisms to connect the obligation to the powers and that needs to be filled in. It is pathetic that Javier Solana and Gijs de Vries are obliged to come to us and say, ‘we do not believe there have been any violations, but we do not have the competence to ask Member States the relevant questions’.</p>
<p class="contents">I am quite happy to accept Mr Gawronski’s amendment in this connection, since it shows up the ludicrous nature of the gap in competence. I am not reproaching them, but I am accusing the Council and Member States of being guilty of creating a lot of hot air and rhetoric about the EU as a beacon of human rights without delivering the results. If you want our citizens to relate to the EU, I give you a cause worth championing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that this cooperation between the Council of Europe and the European Parliament points the way for future cooperation in the defence of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me begin with a general observation. There are legal ways of handing prisoners over to foreign authorities. The transfers that this committee has had to consider amount to something more than the transport of a suspect from one location to another, for the practice that we have had to consider, far from being provided for in relevant legislation, actually circumvents the principles we sum up under the heading of the rule of law, namely the right to appropriate legal representation and to proper legal proceedings in court, and it is no more consistent with the stipulation that nobody may be extradited or taken to a state in which he would be exposed to the risk of being tortured or subjected to any other inhumane treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the victims of these transfers were illegally arrested from the very outset, some of them having been abducted, and all of them were taken from one country to another in an unlawful manner. Many of them have since disappeared. Those victims who testified to our committee spoke of torture and other inhumane treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">In the final analysis, it can be said that this practice was intended to ‘outsource’ torture and make it more difficult to establish where the responsibility for the violation of human rights lay. There are many who say that it cannot be determined with any precision how many people in total were arrested, abducted and taken to other countries, and they may be right, but, by the very same token, it is also true that we can regard enough instances in which human rights were violated as proven, and about these the report has things to say in very blunt terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chicago Convention allows private flights throughout European airspace without the need for further permission; the CIA exploited this by deliberately declaring its flights to be private, while many states – among them Member States of the European Union – acted on the basis of the Chicago Convention in letting the CIA do whatever they wanted. In so doing, these states disregarded other provisions of this Convention that gave them the right to search aircraft where there were reasonable grounds for suspicion that the plane was being used for illegal purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States of the European Union are bound by various international treaties, in particular – as made quite plain in Article 6 – by the European Convention on Human Rights. The European Court of Human Rights has repeatedly emphasised that every state is under a positive obligation to intervene, investigate, and take legal action against the persons responsible, whenever people need to be protected from torture and other forms of inhumane treatment. It is perfectly clear that there were many Member States of the European Union in which this was not done. Italy has recently done what the law requires of it, and for that it deserves gratitude and respect, but I also – and I believe that I am speaking for the majority in this House when I say this – expect other countries to follow its example.</p>

<p class="contents">It is a mistaken strategy because it is based on the theory of pre-emptive war and on the erosion of the rule of law. Rather than weakening terrorism, this strategy has fed and radicalised it, thereby contributing to the achievement of the very objectives set by the terrorists.</p>
<p class="contents">Just a few days ago, following its Guantánamo judgment, the Supreme Court of the United States told us that, between 2001 and 2003, more than half of the prisoners in Guantánamo were taken there from Afghanistan, which means that Europe was the place of transit for over two hundred prisoners, European airports were used for stopovers, and US and NATO bases in Europe were used as outposts. Our committee has also ascertained that there is no doubt that there have been abductions, including the obvious case of Abu Omar.</p>
<p class="contents">We have investigated the facts in great detail and have ascertained that, as John Bellinger and Condoleezza Rice have said, US intelligence activity has been carried out with the involvement of national governments. John Bellinger and Condoleezza Rice have explicitly stated that there has been no breach of national sovereignty. This should also be mentioned, Mr Gawronski, not just extracts from Mr Sifton’s speeches.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it has emerged beyond a shadow of a doubt that European governments have aided and abetted the actions of US Intelligence on European territory. An Italian policeman has confessed and today the deputy head of the Sismi, the Italian intelligence service, has been arrested. I think that we need further clarification.</p>
<p class="contents">The head of the Italian intelligence service, Dr Pollari, either lied to our committee or did not know about the activities of his deputy; each possibility is equally serious. The same applies to Commissioner Frattini, who should clarify this point. At the time of the events, Commissioner Frattini was Minister for Foreign Affairs, so either he did not know, as he told the committee, or he was unaware of the agreements ...</p>

It makes too much use of the language of certainty and fact in places where suspicion and doubt would be more appropriate. According to the previous report of the Council of Europe, we are dealing with a dozen such cases of rendition, affecting some 17 people. Not all of these cases are blatantly breaches of international law. Mr Arar, for example, was handed over by order of an immigration court, so he hardly qualifies for inclusion in the group of extraordinary renditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Until we know the exact extent of the phenomenon, we have no authority to make the assertion contained in paragraph 6 of the report, which states that serious and inadmissible violations of fundamental rights have taken place on several occasions. The US Government interprets the Convention against Torture differently, which is its right. The committee on this convention has not questioned this interpretation, which is backed by many years of practice, a Senate decision and Supreme Court judgments.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see the report give space to a broader description of the context of the matter in order to avoid caricaturisation along the lines of ‘European Union good, America bad’. We should underline the key role of the fight against terrorism in world security, and the positive results of collaboration between European and US security services. In confronting terrorism, Europe and America are sometimes forced to step into a legal void.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe wants to treat terrorists like criminals who should be given defence lawyers and all the rights of due process. The American practice is closer to the traditions of military rule, which in my view is more suited to these circumstances, but which leads to legal acrobatics.

In all its work to date it has not succeeded in acquiring a single item, and I stress, a single item, of previously unknown information. As a result the committee’s report presented here today is nothing but another piece of uncorroborated media information.</p>
<p class="contents">There is nothing to indicate that extending the committee’s mandate will bring any concrete facts to light. It does not have the tools for activities of this type. Why should we carry on wasting taxpayers’ money to prolong its existence? Why support a committee that is toothless? There are no rational grounds for doing so. Any extension of the committee’s mandate would be for political and propaganda purposes. Its activities are in any case already being used by the socialists and liberals for their own ends. They will use any pretext to attack the United States and its European allies. In this way they seriously undermine the only common front that has been created in the fight against the exceptionally grave threat of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">This should not really come as any surprise to us. Historically, ever since the turn of the last century, the socialists themselves resorted to acts that today would be regarded as terrorist acts. Sympathy for such political methods persists, even in this House. It is no coincidence that the lines of division on this report are based not on its merits, or even on nationality, but on ideology. It is fundamentally a division between socialists and conservatives.</p>
<p class="contents">In deciding to terminate the work of the Temporary Committee we will be doing a great service to the societies of our countries, and that is what I appeal for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some Left-wing Members of this House wanted to take advantage of the activities of the interim committee to indulge in cheap anti-Americanism, of which this biased report is a manifestation.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the way in which the committee has worked to date has raised a few questions. Witnesses were sometimes accompanied by lawyers who ensured that difficult questions remained unanswered. On more than one occasion, the vagueness of those involved meant that we were unable to gain a clear picture of the facts with which they were charged, or of their political background for that matter. Other people who appeared before the committee, including High Representative Javier Solana, were so predictably noncommittal that their input was a waste of time for everyone.</p>

<p class="contents">I should first like to echo the words of Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, and say that this is an interim report. This document could not be accused of not containing the kind of conclusions found in a final report. I should also like to thank all the members of the committee that I chair and in particular the rapporteur Mr Fava for his high-quality, dedicated work in committee. I also wish to thank all of those who helped us. Thirdly, I wish to point out that in the hearings, there were 70 testimonies made, 50 hours of statements given, two foreign missions undertaken – one to the United States and one to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – and thousands of documents analysed.</p>
<p class="contents">As things stand, I feel that quite apart from the fact that the committee has justified its existence, illegal acts have taken place in Europe that need to be assessed in terms of their scale and the extent to which the Member States were involved. Furthermore, control of air space and airport facilities needs to be stepped up, the democratic control of the activities of the secret services should be strengthened, as Mr Frattini said, and the activities of foreign secret services on European soil needs to be more closely monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">In adopting this report, we are asking the Board to put in place the conditions to discover the truth about what happened, and with the key amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats we are contributing towards a balanced, accurate and fair report.

A legitimate fight against terrorism goes hand-in-hand with reflection on the means used to conduct this fight, on the state of democracy, the rule of law and on civil liberties in situations where special services are given special authority and where general surveillance is carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">A new kind of community is arising on both sides of the Atlantic – a community of lawyers, journalists and politicians from different sides of the political scene, activists from humanitarian organisations and citizens who are against the recent infringements of human rights and political and civic freedoms by some European governments and the US Government. Last week the Supreme Court in the USA pronounced the special military tribunals appointed by President Bush in November 2001 by way of a decree, bypassing Congress, as illegal and contrary to the Geneva Conventions and the American system of military courts. The ruling of the Supreme Court is proof that we are not condemned to a tragic choice between security and freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">The Temporary Committee appointed by Parliament on 18 January this year has completed the first stage of its work. The interim report concludes that illegal practices affecting citizens and residents of Europe were carried out in Europe. I would like to underline that the committee’s report is by no means anti-American or ideological, and it is not aimed against any country or government. The report was based primarily on around 50 hours of hearings involving lawyers, journalists, representatives of non-governmental organisations, alleged victims of special rendition proceedings, representatives of the governments of the Member States and representatives of the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress that in its interim report the committee does not once mention the name ‘Poland’, unlike Dick Marty’s report before the Council of Europe in June this year. However, our report does assert the need to ascertain whether there is proof that secret prisons are operating in some European countries, as some journalists and bona-fide non-governmental organisations claimed in the course of the investigations. What is particularly worrying is, as Senator Marty’s report points out, Warsaw’s unwillingness to cooperate seriously with the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Temporary Committee should now proceed with the rest of its 12-month mandate, during which it should make official visits to various countries, including Poland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite what may be gleaned from the brief speech by the representative of the Council, we do not look to Washington. We look to the European capitals. We look to the Council, in Brussels, waiting for it to commit itself to the truth which has not yet come, to explain to us the why and the how of what we now know.</p>
<p class="contents">Because, just like archaeologists who gradually go on digging up small items through small excavations and then put all of that information together to produce a map of a city that had been hidden and the precise whereabouts of which nobody knew, the Commission, with the invaluable support of other people, of NGOs, in cooperation with the Council of Europe etc., has managed to draw up that map, to uncover and bring to light that hidden city, which is a plan designed for the systematic violation of the fundamental rights of the citizens on the theoretical premise of protecting our fundamental rights; we should protect our rights and our security by violating the rights of others. That is the approach our work has been taking.</p>
<p class="contents">That is something that could not have happened without the active support or deliberate passivity of the Member States of the European Union. That is our conclusion. That is our moral conviction, and no one will be able to take it away from us, with or without votes.</p>
<p class="contents">We are dealing with a great jigsaw puzzle in which it is not sufficient for any State to say that no crime has taken place on their territory, if it turns out, for example, that the role played by that State in this overall plan was to give logistical support to the aircraft so that the people taking part in this great drama could rest beforehand or afterwards.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore still awaiting coherent explanations from the Council and the Member States so that we may know the truth and guarantee respect for the European Union's fundamental values, for which we are all supposed to be fighting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the hearings that we have held over recent months it has become clear that we cannot carry on talking about alleged practices, but rather we must discuss and analyse specific facts and call the relevant people to account, as other Members have also pointed out.</p>

The detention today in Italy is simply the tip of the iceberg, and we hope that everything else will come to light soon.</p>
<p class="contents">I would insist that it is not a question of knowing whether these practices have occurred, but of who in Europe knew about them, and often collaborated in them, and also who, since they must have known about them, evaded their responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The report’s conclusion is clear: the work we are doing is necessary and must continue.

If there was even one Member of this House who was not already speechless with fury, the hearing of Khaled El-Masri must have had that effect. What, though, did our governments do? They did nothing. The El-Masri case was the subject of canteen gossip in Skopje; German officials knew about it, but the German Government, no doubt for reasons of state, left Mr El-Masri to his fate.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me put it bluntly: every government has the duty of protecting its citizens from the violation of their human rights by others; failure to do anything is a gross violation of human rights. Over and over again, evidence is demanded, yet, instead of obliging the government to produce it, such evidence is demanded from the victims. This is the line taken by right-wingers, not least those in the ranks of the conservatives in this House, but who is to be required to produce the evidence? Mr Marty of the Council of Europe is quite right to say that it is a fundamental duty incumbent on governments to actively investigate all human rights violations that are committed on their territory or against their citizens. They have to demonstrate that their conduct has always been correct and that they have acted in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights and the fundamental values shared throughout the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why our committee cannot yet declare the case closed. We must not allow governments to bury their heads in the sand, and that is true whether we are talking about the government of my own country or the government of Macedonia, a candidate country that has tried to put one over on us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Terrorists do not respect human life, they do not respect democracy and they do not respect human rights. We are all behind that fight, but it is the way we go about it that has to be debated and decided upon.</p>
<p class="contents">The American Government has to realise that it must comply with the rule of law and well-established international conventions and practices in its effort to defeat international terrorism. Unfortunately, the USA has acted arbitrarily when it has sought to build political alliances on this matter through the structures of the United Nations. The strategies pursued by America in Iraq and in the broader Middle East in recent years have arguably generated a greater level of sympathy for terrorists.</p>
<p class="contents">I am an Irish Member of this Parliament and we in Ireland know how terrorism builds and grows and how, by making the wrong decisions, governments can strengthen terrorist organisations. As an example, the IRA was almost defeated on a number of occasions, but wrong decisions were made and it won public sympathy and grew again. The way terrorism is defeated has to be looked at very carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">The interim report before us today points to the undeniable fact that rendition flights have taken place in Europe. The American Government must bring this practice to an end if it is going to build EU-US transatlantic relations. If we are going to fight terrorism, we must all work together within the law.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee still has much work to do and it is seeking support from Parliament to continue its work for a further six months. I hope that Parliament will give this committee the extra time it needs to bring its work to a conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the American Government must implement new strategies if it is going to win the war against international terrorism. There are so many examples of how not to do it, but it is only through enlightened policies and through those of us who believe in democracy and human rights working together that terrorism can be fought and permanently eradicated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On that day Islamic terrorists started a global war against Western civilisation, bringing us fear and death. In this Parliament, we cannot consider today’s fight against terrorism in isolation from those events. The fight against terrorism is a consequence of them, and human rights for terrorists should not compromise the effective protection of our families and societies.</p>
<p class="contents">We should remember that the terrorists do not recognise any rights, treaties or conventions. I was concerned to see what went on behind the scenes when the so-called ‘CIA Committee’ was established. Unfortunately its appointment was purely political, with the aim of slurring countries who have actually been involved in fighting terrorism. As a member of the committee I can see that its activities are a ‘European witch-hunt’, where the witches being hunted are US allies in Europe, which is a reflection of the complexes and anti-Americanism of a number of Member States of the ‘old EU’.</p>
<p class="contents">The call to battle was based on unconfirmed information from Amnesty International and press reports. By naming countries that allegedly infringe human rights, we are exposing them to the danger of reprisals and revenge attacks by terrorists. The committee’s report has neither divulged anything new, nor has it proved anything. In civilised countries verdicts are not issued without evidence, but the committee has taken upon itself to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Our report is based on hearsay and circumstantial evidence, but it makes judgments and even passes sentence with the burden on the accused of proving his innocence. In a normal system of law, it is guilt, and not innocence, that needs to be proved. The application to extend the work of the committee for another six months is a waste of taxpayers’ money.

I should like to quote her comments to you.

<p class="contents">I hope that our rapporteur will take note of these comments. His report is entirely speculative and circumstantial. It seeks to present unsubstantiated allegations as fact. Evidence of flights that <span class="italic">may</span> have been linked to the CIA is not evidence of rendition, still less evidence of mistreatment. The committee started from an a priori belief that the USA and the CIA are guilty, and merely sought with little success to substantiate its prejudices.

<p class="contents">Whether we like it or not, the war against terror is real and it is now. The US has taken a lead in this war.

It is unfortunate that its interim report, which we now have before us, is as yet neither even-handed nor complete. I can live with the fact that the groups in this House attach different values to the statements made to the committee, but it is a fundamental requirement of any balanced report that it should include all statements, including those that do not tally with the committee's preconceived ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">Completeness demands, then, that the statements by Mr Solana and Mr de Fries at their respective hearings to the effect that they were not aware of any breach of the law on the part of any Member State, be included in the report along with the fact that no evidence has been provided, to this day, of the existence of so-called secret prisons in the European Union. This report must also include the statement made by John Bellinger on behalf of the American administration; after all, the members of the committee had travelled specially to Washington to ask him the questions he answered. None of the things I have mentioned have as yet been included in the report, for the reason that the majority on the committee found them disagreeable; I dare say that that is hardly commensurate with their task of seeking out facts and establishing the truth.</p>
<p class="contents">The justified interest in the investigation of the accusations that have been made must not result in a one-sided approach to the assessment and evaluation of the facts. If this committee and this House are to have any credibility, then this interim report must reflect objectively all the information available to us; then – and only then – can we adopt this report by a large majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When Parliament and we in the Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners began our work, I for one did not have very high expectations of what we could achieve, as a lot of the alleged practices had taken place quite a few years ago. I have been pleasantly surprised, however. Our work has produced results aimed at making Europe safer and human rights more secure.</p>
<p class="contents">For me as a Social Democrat MEP from Sweden and a proud witch, as someone chose to call us, I am particularly pleased that, on the issues of extraordinary rendition and diplomatic guarantees, we have now reached an agreement and that we are making clear the dividing lines between the fight against terrorism, a humane policy on refugees and respect for human rights, which are also in crisis following the terrorist acts of 11 September 2001 in New York. In this area, the expulsion from Sweden of the Egyptians Mohammed Al Zery and Ahmed Agiza following a decision by the Swedish Government have pointed to solutions of the kind we do not want to see any more of. The CIA’s solutions are unsustainable, both in the short and the long term and for both the EU and the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee needs more time. We have learned from the mistakes that have been made and we shall propose measures and safety nets so that we do not end up in similar situations in the future. Europeans expect a better job to be made of sorting out future crises through cooperation between the Council of Europe, all the countries of Europe and ourselves in the European Parliament. Mr Frattini has some interesting thoughts on the security service, necessary future controls on aviation and getting the balance right in combating terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To me, this is like a jigsaw puzzle that is nearing completion. Although there are still a few pieces missing, we get the general picture. As it is the Member States who must supply the missing pieces, it is a complete mystery to me why they should be so reluctant to provide the additional evidence. After all, it is Europe's moral leadership that is at stake here.</p>

The security policy we adopt here in Europe should therefore apply our own standards, our own methods and our own conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think it is essential that we, as a matter of urgency, start a parliamentary dialogue with the Americans to discuss security and human rights and the way in which we can, together, on the basis of shared values, fight the monster of terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a question that we need to ask.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of facts and the political consequences that we should be drawing from this, it is almost irrelevant whether there have been two or three renditions as we were told in the US by the US Administration, or whether the facts unearthed so far reveal two or three renditions, or whether we have found more.</p>
<p class="contents">We have discovered that Member States, even if they want to know what is going on, do not necessarily have the right or the mechanisms to find out, let alone the political will. We have been told by two of our own senior people that they do not have the right to pursue such issues. We have been told that the law is inadequate in this new era of greater threat. However, we also need to question whether we are using the law we have effectively and fairly in accordance with international human rights obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue is not just about the method – whether it is abduction or immigration problems – but also the outcome. There is an absolute prohibition on torture under international human rights instruments. Therefore, what do we make of the memoranda of understanding which are increasingly coming into play and have implications for other areas of EU policy? These are some of the areas we should be looking at politically. This is another reason why we need the committee to continue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It states that the rules of cooperation between national security services should be established at EU level, that effective parliamentary scrutiny of national intelligence services should be at European level and that the Commission should immediately legislate to harmonise laws on the surveillance of non-commercial civil aviation. There never seems to be an ill wind that cannot blow the European Union some good.</p>
<p class="contents">The report and the minority opinion expressed agree that some illegal detentions and transportations may have taken place. However, it is unlikely that the real truth will ever be known. I have no time whatsoever for illegal detentions and transportations of citizens or of non-EU citizens. The existing legal means are draconian enough.</p>

Surprisingly for a lawyer, he does not seem to know that very similar arrangements exist with the European Union.

In it there is a yawning gap between the evidence collected and the opinions formulated by the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report, the committee makes extremely grave accusations, for example, that in Europe ‘inadmissible violations of fundamental human rights have taken place on several occasions’. On the other hand, it can only confirm exactly four cases of the procedure described as the illegal transfer of persons suspected of terrorism. Furthermore, the tone used by the committee varies: on the one hand, it speaks guardedly about some facts, such as in paragraph 12, for example: ‘all the work of the temporary committee so far seems to indicate that European airspace and airports have been used by CIA front companies’. On the other hand, it is categorical in making value judgments such as the one in the above-quoted paragraph 6, where it speaks of violations of fundamental human rights on several occasions, although the evidence gathered does not authorise it to make such statements. No evidence is provided anywhere of use of torture against the suspects, nor is any proof provided of the existence of detention centres in any country where suspects might be held – I mean within the European Union – and, in view of this, we should ask ourselves whether the four cases of rendition of terrorist suspects and several hundred flights by CIA aircraft – and they are something we knew about before the committee started its work – allow the committee to come to such radical conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">I get the impression that the committee is building its own virtual view of reality, and instead of taking the occasion to give EU citizens a view of reality is for some reason, undoubtedly political, putting forward its own virtual view as though it were real, and thereby misleading the citizens. This is poor practice, since it serves to undermine the authority of the European Parliament. If the committee carries on like this in the next phase of its work, the prestige of the European Parliament may end up like that of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.</p>

We can never justify the means we use to beat terrorism by claiming that the ends are noble. We cannot defend our values by abandoning them and I suspect that some of the people involved in today’s debate would much rather we abandoned our values just to prove themselves right.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable that, for party political reasons, some Members are not willing to recognise what everybody else sees, not just in this House but outside it. Illegal renditions by US agents have taken place. Some EU Member States’ services have colluded in those renditions, either passively or actively. The cross-referencing of witness statements and Eurocontrol records has established that some EU states have serious questions to answer and have so far refused to come clean. This inquiry must therefore continue.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliamentary investigations are necessary, particularly in countries like my own, Ireland, where it has been established that 50 CIA flights have landed at Irish airports and that the aircraft used to transfer Abu Omar illegally from Italy to Egypt, via Germany, also landed at an Irish airport. We have good reason to believe that Abu Omar was in fact tortured in Egypt. So it is quite ridiculous for Members in this House to argue that this inquiry should not proceed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish human rights body, a government-sponsored body, has called on the Irish Government to establish a legally enforceable regime of aircraft inspections, which at the moment does not exist. It has also called for a legally enforceable regime whereby diplomatic assurances from third countries can be challenged in law. The Irish Government has so far refused to do this. These are issues that need to be addressed and the Irish Government and its agencies need to be cross-examined by this committee, as, indeed, do many other Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I can understand why some, for political reasons, might not share the view put across by the committee, and I can also understand why others might find the failure to share that view something worthy of scorn. On this occasion, of course, we have done no more than assemble circumstantial evidence rather than watertight proof, quite simply because no head of a secret service is going to come out and say, ‘Yes, of course, that’s how we did it. We abducted people illegally.’ There are people in this House who would probably not notice that they had been illegally abducted if they had been confined to an aircraft, been blindfolded and taken away, but that is irrelevant.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many legal systems in which circumstantial evidence can be used as the basis of a trial, and there is circumstantial evidence that is so weighty that it virtually constitutes proof. This is a situation we have found ourselves in in a number of cases. Not everything will turn out to be the way some people, with their conspiracy theories, imagine it to be, but nor is the world as pink and pretty as those imagine who maintain that these things never happened at all, and so this committee has done valuable work in bringing to light at least the tip of an iceberg, for if we want to win the war on terrorism, we can do so only if we are credible, and we can be credible only if we keep to the rules that we lay down to others.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like to see, then, is for this committee to carry on doing what it is doing and come to an objective conclusion. I would, by the way, like to say something to the members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats: your counterparts in the Council of Europe voted to endorse Mr Marty's report, which, as we have just heard, goes even further than the report before this House, and so I find myself wondering how you will be able to justify it if you decide not to vote in favour of this one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One cannot avoid the conclusion that what it has come up with is quite negligible, and rightly too, for that only goes to show either that no offences were committed, or that those that were were isolated occurrences. I was, then, all the more astonished when I eventually came to read the report, which was one-sided, tendentious, and did not reflect that which was brought to light during the committee’s deliberations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask those on the other side of the House why they refused, when it came to the vote in committee, to incorporate what Mr de Vries and Mr Solana actually found out, that being that there was no proof. Why, I ask you, did you refuse to incorporate a statement to the effect that no evidence could be found that secret prisons actually existed?

Why did you refuse to include a reference to the fact that it had been established in the USA that that country had not made any use of torture?</p>

One thing that is paramount in this has also been clearly encapsulated in Mr Fava’s report, namely where he states that we can never win the battle against international terrorism if we sacrifice the very principles we seek to uphold in the fight against it. It is this, then, on which we have focussed.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the indications that the CIA, or other security services, quite possibly without our governments’ knowledge, have taken action that contravenes the fundamental rights and freedoms? To what extent has national and international law been violated in the process? These are very serious questions that fully justify the investigation. We cannot cover up the questions that have been raised, because that would seriously harm public confidence at a time when we need all the confidence we can get in order to be able fight terrorism effectively, yet fairly, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">The interim results of the investigation show the need to resume the investigation after the summer. There is no doubt that extraordinary renditions via European airports have taken place. It is highly likely that various European governments were aware of this practice and it is likely that European and international human rights agreements were violated in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the investigation clearly showed up the serious loopholes in our legislation and in our monitoring practices. These activities took place in the twilight zone which we left open. Following on from the investigation, we will, then, need to concentrate on two things. Firstly, to what extent were Member States and candidate countries involved in this, and, secondly, what needs to be done in order to plug the loopholes in law and legislation in order to avoid this happening again? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have every confidence in stating that the CIA is directly responsible for the illegal seizure, removal, abduction and detention of people on the territory of Member States. It is through criminal intention, implicit approval and gross negligence that such large-scale human rights abuse has been permitted to take place. Either way, it is clear that security forces in some Member States are working outside the reach of proper and effective governmental control and scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">Soon we will remember the victims of the London bombings. The UK response has been the adoption of shoot-to-kill policies on the basis of guidance from the security forces in the war on terror, which has seen an innocent man killed in my own country and another lucky to be alive. They, along with so many others, are also victims. Their only crime was to be visibly different from the majority.</p>
<p class="contents">Governments have underlined the importance of leaving no stone unturned when justifying the intolerable suspension of civil liberties in the name of national security, rendering certain sections of our population subject to unrelenting, imbalanced scrutiny. This is where this House must step in for the good of all our citizens.

After all, the way suspects are treated is, in effect, at the very heart of the values in which we in the EU share. It should, therefore, become clear, in the interest of the public and the European Union itself, what has, and has not, happened.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, then, congratulate all those who have shown great commitment to the investigation, and who will take it further. I should nevertheless like to point out that there has been more hypothesis than proof to date. That is understandable to some degree, for we find ourselves in a tricky situation. If this proves anything, it is that Europe is not complete. Commissioners must be given more powers in the area of investigations and should be able to approach the Member States with a view to unearthing the truth. This House, which is quite powerless in comparison to the investigation methods of national parliaments, should also be given more powers where investigations are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">We should now make do, though, with the means that are at our disposal. We found the vote in committee unsatisfactory on the grounds that a number of sound amendments we had tabled were not adopted. What is at stake at the moment is finding out the truth and regaining confidence. I call on everyone to throw their full weight behind those amendments that narrow the gap between what has already been proven and what is being claimed. In particular, I would like to see a more realistic reflection of the number of cases in respect of which evidence has been gathered, of the remarks of the terrorism coordinator Mr De Vries, Mr Solana and Mr Bellinger and also the clear statement that no proof has as yet been found for the existence of secret prisons in Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that that would enhance the credibility of the Commission’s work and, with it, support in the plenary. It is up to our committee to continue the work, and that can go two ways. Either more proof will as yet be submitted and sound conclusions can be drawn, or no more proof will be submitted, in which case the conclusions should be toned down for the sake of integrity. The latter is not necessarily a bad conclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Are, indeed, all those in America who look to see whether the war on terror is being waged in accordance with legal principles to be described as anti-American? No, I really do not believe that they can be!</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are then told that we are undermining the war on terror. We are all in favour of the war on terror, but what it calls for is broad support, popular support, in Europe, so if we want to wage this war, we need support from the people, who have no less interest in the rule of law being upheld than we do. We must explicitly uphold the rule of law as an essential element in the European Union, and this is a point that Commissioner Frattini constantly, and rightly, makes.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, whom do you want to punish? This should not be about punishing just anyone; let us be frank: in the aftermath of 11 September and that dreadful deed and the terrorist activities in America, we did perhaps take too relaxed an approach. It was believed in various European states that rapid action was called for and that we had to support the Americans, and that I can understand. Now, though, we have to get back to the rule of law, which is absolutely necessary if war is to be waged on terrorism with any success, and one of this committee’s essential objectives is to ensure that the war on terror can, in future, be waged effectively and in accordance with sound legal principles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This report, however, cannot and must not become an instrumental act of accusation against the United States and other countries involved in the front line in the fight against terrorism. The political purpose must never distort the truth out of contempt for the principles of law.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the events in Italy, I would like to highlight a few points. In the first place, the Italian Government and the security services organisation have always stated, at all parliamentary sittings, that they had no connection whatsoever with the events leading to the capture of Abu Omar and so far nobody has been able to prove the contrary. I would also like to express my solidarity with Mr Frattini, who has been attacked by Mr Catania: any possible personal liability cannot involve the Institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, last Monday Abu Omar was again arrested in Cairo because he was considered a threat to the security of the Egyptian State.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the Milanese mosque in Viale Jenner, well-known even outside Italy because it has been involved in investigations into terrorism, today expressed satisfaction at the arrest of the two representatives of the military secret service. I am also astonished at the rapporteur’s one-sided defence of civil rights in this matter, where, in contradiction to European legal culture, arrest is conflated with conviction, a confusion that the rapporteur did not make, however, in the case of Abu Omar.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, the magistrate who arrested the two directors of the Sismi at the same time ordered a search to be carried out at the headquarters of a daily newspaper and at the houses of two journalists who had dealt with the Abu Omar case. This was a flagrant breach of the freedom of the press, in particular because the procedure was directed against a newspaper that is highly critical of the government and involved in combating terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it would be a good idea to remember that, in five years of centre-right government in Italy, there were no terrorist attacks, but rather many attempts were foiled. Many lives have been saved through the sacrifice of the police, the armed forces and the security services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Respecting these values is the duty of all the institutions, countries and citizens of the European Union. One of these values, which arises from the European legal tradition, is the old principle of innocence until proved guilty.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want this principle to be used with respect to persons accused of terrorism, we cannot give a negative example ourselves. In my view Mr Fava’s report was biased, and based primarily on doubt, conjecture and circumstantial evidence. The report confirms only two previously known facts, the Italian and the Swedish cases, which are already being dealt with by the relevant domestic authorities of these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In this situation, should our committee not concentrate on looking for legal solutions which would prevent any such misdeeds in the future? Should we not work harder on proper legislation and the use of European air space, try and get the Member States to adopt legislation about common counter-terrorism measures, and monitor the Member States whose legislation does not include terrorism as a crime? Only such action would provide legal protection for all those we suspect or may suspect of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">We should ensure that the laws and procedures in the fight against terrorism, even in the area that is by nature kept secret, still provide sanctions and punish breaches of human rights and dignity. Secrecy should not mean illegality. However, Member States should themselves deal with punishing the guilty. Our committee does not have the competence or the authority to do so. How the governments of the Member States deal with the accusations levelled at them by public opinion, and how they collaborate with the committee, is another matter. For the Member States this is a test, a check how well their agencies comply with international treaties; if we do not implement this we will always be surrounded by the demons of suspicion and by accusations that are in many cases unfounded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is no question that abhorrent activities are habitually taking place. This generation cannot and must not tolerate this situation, as some of our predecessors did by not facing up to the existence of death camps.</p>
<p class="contents">Crimes against human rights cannot go unpunished, and must never be forgotten, as happened in the case of other flights by former dictatorships in Argentina and Chile.</p>

Six months of work in the committee has revealed nothing that had not already appeared in the media. It irks me that the majority of the committee has drawn subjective, distorted conclusions from a few facts and from a huge number of unsubstantiated rumours. I fear that the committee’s irresponsible approach may lead not only to Parliament’s credibility being eroded, but also to trust between the European and US allies being damaged. This trust is key to winning the fight against terrorism, to ensuring the security of the transatlantic area and to guaranteeing the stability of international relations as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to emphasise that the fight against terrorism must be pursued in compliance with international law and with respect for human rights. At the same time, however, it is wrong to present a series of mistakes that may have occurred in the context of complex global anti–terror operations as a systemic problem. If there are suspicions that human rights have been violated in EU countries, they should be investigated by the judicial systems of the Member States. Rather than unsubstantiated denunciations of the US secret services, the EU’s political authorities should be focusing on how to prevent terrorism effectively and how to meet their responsibilities as regards world security, in close cooperation with the allies and in compliance with the fundamental principles of international law. I firmly believe, Mr President, that Parliament should take the opportunity to amend the report to ensure that our work is credible. Otherwise, I will have no option but to reject this temporary committee report, along with the entire Czech contingent from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which has agreed on this course of action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The US Supreme Court has recently said that in the prisons of Guantánamo and Kabul, where so-called unlawful combatants are festering, Washington is not only holding them unlawfully, it is keeping them in prison in breach of both US and international law. It is in breach of laws that have been used, and continue to be used to try and pass sentence on the most odious criminals, including the Nazis.</p>

The courts can and must do justice, by compensating the innocent people who suffered and by punishing those who twisted rather than promoted the rule of law, and who, worse still, by violating the law and human rights were failing to serve Europe’s security and defence; instead, they were sinking to the terrorists’ level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I joined the inquiry with great interest and enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="contents">I have participated in the vast majority of hearings held by the committee to date, and I have listened with interest to everything the relevant invited guests had to say. While it was our objective to establish whether the CIA had been using unlawful means in fighting terrorism, unlike a court of law we were not able to interview witnesses under oath. The key was to ascertain whether the persons detained had been subjected to torture during interrogations and moved to third countries against their will. I must point out, however, that the testimony given by the witnesses was fairly unconvincing. Sometimes they would even testify indirectly, and sometimes it would be a lawyer speaking. On yet another occasion a British diplomat testified, barely concealing his resentment against the UK Government for dismissing him from the diplomatic service.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor did Senator Marty persuade me, as his replies were no better than news reports and unable to prove anything apart from suspicions. I believe that he went too far in attacking the Polish Government despite the fact the Polish authorities have repeatedly indicated that they were unable to prove the existence of detention facilities in their country. As an MEP from one of the new Member States, I am primarily interested in the human rights and justice dimension; hence, I wanted to know whether my country has hosted any such illegal facility. I was therefore pleased to learn from the relevant authorities, including the government, justice minister and director of the intelligence service that they could not confirm that any such facilities had been set up in Slovakia or that there had been any secret CIA flights to or over Slovakia.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats we take a critical view of the approach adopted by the rapporteur, who likes to interpret suspicions as hard evidence. One cannot avoid forming the impression (and I am about to wind up my speech) that in the course of committee deliberations the left-wing MEPs have abandoned fact-finding in favour of maligning the United States, the country that has taken the lead in fighting terrorism. Unless the left accepts realistic amendments that contribute significantly towards establishing the truth, I will have to consider whether I can support the report in its current form. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this particular instance, you have to follow the aeroplanes.</p>
<p class="contents">Over recent months a series of apparently innocent flights between Europe and the USA has highlighted the huge issues which arise when you try to combat terrorism while ignoring fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first instance, of abductions by the CIA, over 1 000 secret service flights landed at and took off from European airports, but were not subject to the slightest check by the competent European authorities which, even if they did not cooperate directly with them, opted for the 'see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing' approach.</p>
<p class="contents">In the second instance, in a rare case of hasty cooperation between governments at European level, an agreement riddled with holes was signed with the USA, known as the transfer of Passenger Name Records or PNR, not only without adequate proof of the need for the measures, but also with barely any fundamental safeguarding of binding American obligations for the secure and legal use of our data.</p>
<p class="contents">The European governments are today directly obliged, both individually and in cooperation with each other, to take all the necessary measures which will ensure that illegal CIA flights are not repeated. This requires explicit <span class="italic">de minimus</span> instructions to their civil aviation authorities so that at least the aeroplanes which we know were CIA aeroplanes and at least the front companies that we know were CIA companies are controlled from now on together, of course, with more efficient and democratic controls of their secret services.</p>

<p class="contents">I shall just say that we cannot forget the tragedy of September 11; we cannot forget the London bloodshed; we cannot forget the Madrid massacre. We cannot, of course, ignore the fact that the USA is the central target of terrorism and we cannot underestimate the fact that the main task of combating terrorism falls on its shoulders.</p>
<p class="contents">However, at the same time, we cannot forget that human rights are a cornerstone of modern European political philosophy. Therefore, despite our understanding of the USA’s role in combating terrorism, we cannot shut our eyes to certain activities that are contrary to European principles, values and rules. It is a fact that the CIA abused the understanding of certain countries. We condemn the practices of the CIA. We strongly condemn the CIA for the acts referred to by previous speakers and in Mr Fava’s report: extraordinary renditions, suspicious flights. We do the Americans no service if we leave the right of criticism of the CIA for acts committed in violation of human rights to those who are passionately anti-American.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Coelho, Chairman of the Temporary Committee, that in general Mr Fava’s report is good. However, it could be made more balanced if amendments stressing the other side of the coin were accepted. I appeal therefore to the rapporteur and to the other political groups to accept certain basic amendments proposed by Mr Gawronski, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, so that this House votes unanimously on two main points: firstly on the condemnation of terrorists and secondly on the protection of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is for all those reasons that we must extend this report.</p>
<p class="contents">People opposite have talked about circumstantial evidence. They must understand that we called on the testimony of 70 people and spent over 50 hours in this committee, not because we are anti-American — and I commend our rapporteur for never, ever, falling into that trap — but because we wanted to get to the truth.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous speaker spoke about 7/7 and London. There are one or two Members in this Chamber who represent the area affected by that bombing. The people who have written to us are not anti-American; they want anti-terrorism to be strengthened because human rights are being strengthened. That is the approach of my Socialist colleagues and of many Members across this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Why should we continue? We should continue because of the testimony of people like Maher Arar, whom I listened to and believed. Do I know that he is telling the final truth? No, I do not, because we are waiting for the Member States and for those who have not spoken to finally speak. That is why we need to extend this report and to extend the time we have.</p>

<p class="contents">We have to tell them we can deal with the issue credibly. We see it happening in the Council of Europe, and they should also see it happening in their Parliament. On our side of the House, we want to see the report extended, because we believe we have the right approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an expensive exercise, duplicating Senator Marty’s efforts in the Council of Europe, and one driven by a political desire by the left and liberals to bash America, and the CIA in particular, in their efforts to fight global terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Fava report is heavy on allegations and accusations, but light on proof. In a hazardous project as widespread in the west as fighting terrorism, inevitably some mistakes and excesses may have occurred, but in my opinion there was no systematic US policy for extraordinary renditions to torture abductees in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, there is no proof whatsoever of the existence of CIA detention camps in Romania or Poland. Simple renditions of illegal combatant terrorist suspects through EU territory are a proven fact, but not necessarily illegal under international law where torture is not involved.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, I agree with Alan Dershowitz, Harvard Professor of Law, when he argues that there exists a vast black hole in international law as regards combating terrorism, with categorisation of detainees anachronistic and the rules governing how such detainees are treated currently dangerously blurred. I believe that he is correct in arguing that many of us tend to stick with comfortable old ways, rather than addressing the difficult adjustments to the law that we may need to make vis-à-vis the balance we have to strike between human rights and the security of our public.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, a recent visit to Guantánamo by MEP colleagues from this House vindicated my long-held view that immediate, as opposed to long-term, closure of Guantánamo is not desirable, as many of those held there are extremely dangerous threats to our EU Member States’ national security and it is not possible to deport these individuals, as many might face execution or torture if returned to their home countries like Saudi Arabia or Egypt, where they are well known and wanted as known terrorists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The elucidation of the circumstances under which, in various European states, suspects were alleged to have been seized and their rendition organised, is still patchy, and that may well be because there is in fact less to bring to light than some particularly zealous persons who are critical of America or hostile to it had hoped.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say something fundamental about what has been going on over the past few weeks: Europe in general and we in this House too should not, in a difficult time like this one, be dissipating our energies with enterprises the ultimate motivation behind which is the need of certain persons to distance themselves from the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">We still have no certainty of eventually getting the Constitution in place. There are complicated issues concerning the enlargement of the Union, our common identity and the limits of the European project that we have to address.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards all these issues, there are far fewer proposals for solutions on the table than the development of Europe could do with. With things as they are, it strikes me as reflecting a rather idiosyncratic scheme of priorities for all the European institutions to devote their attention to CIA flights up to the point where the main thing we know is that we know nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has more serious problems to deal with than the question of whether someone or other was flown somewhere or other from one Member State of the EU or another – or was not, as the case may be. If we want ourselves to be taken seriously, then we should dissolve this superfluous committee at once and, in short order, move on to thinking more about ourselves than about the possible misdeeds of a state that is our strongest ally and will – I hope – remain so in future. It is with all these considerations in mind that I will be voting against the anti-American resolution with which we have been presented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There have been many hours of hearings and debates in the committee since then and now we have our first interim report.</p>
<p class="contents">An honest assessment of the committee’s work to date would give a mixed picture, I believe. On the one hand there has been a certain level of frustration that new evidence and facts have not been forthcoming in most of our hearings. However, that said, I believe that the committee’s work has been useful in outlining and exposing all of the facts that are available to date, and certain facts are available. Even if we are reconsidering evidence already exposed by the Council of Europe, we need to be realistic. Our committee is not a court of law; we are politicians attempting to draw conclusions based on the balance of probability, given the evidence available.</p>
<p class="contents">Investigating the activities of the CIA or any secret services was never going to be a straightforward exercise. I believe that the report should have given more recognition to the fact that more evidence is needed to draw definitive conclusions in regard to certain issues, such as the possible existence of ‘black sites’ in EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate that the debate on whether or not to support this report has been reduced by some to a polarising of positions, a pro- and anti-US stance, or even a left versus right divide. I am sorry that view has developed as it undermines the work of a well-intentioned committee and misses the point as regards what we are trying to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not anti-American to criticise extraordinary rendition or to push to establish facts, particularly if there are accusations against EU Member States in this regard. I would consider myself a hypocrite as a human rights spokesperson if I did not speak out against extraordinary rendition, even if it means criticising and asking awkward questions of governments that I consider to be our friends and allies. I include the US in that.</p>
<p class="contents">No approach to the necessary and difficult war on terrorism should be supported if it involves acting outside the rule of international law and the various standards that we, in Europe, stand up for. The interim report is not a perfect one, but the acceptance of PPE-DE amendments will add balance to a text worth supporting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I can confirm that the European Commission is ready to continue working with this Parliament’s temporary committee on the many fundamental issues that have been addressed. Mrs Ludford has touched on the theme of the implementation of anti-terrorism legislation by Member States, a central issue on which we certainly need to work.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will know, unfortunately five EU Member States have not yet even transposed the European framework decision on combating terrorism; you also know that only seven out of the 25 States have ratified the Europe-United States agreement on extradition, an agreement which, if it were to come into force, would certainly clarify the legal framework precisely regarding the transfer of prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">Some speakers, such as Mr Swoboda and Mrs in't Veld, have mentioned the possibility and the need to work together for improved security and greater freedom. I totally agree and I welcome the proposal made for structured, political dialogue with the United States of America on the theme of the fight against terrorism, simultaneously with the theme of safeguarding freedom. I can tell you that I had already thought about this and as early as last February I suggested that this dialogue should begin at expert level, and it has now begun.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this dialogue can proceed and I already know that the Finnish Presidency intends to move forward in this area. I think that it will be possible to exchange assessments with Parliament on the Europe-USA umbrella framework, on the fight against terrorism and on the guarantees of freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I believe that the Guantánamo judgment handed down by the US Supreme Court proves that the system for legally supervising guarantees and rights under the US democratic system does indeed function and provides a reassuring basis for our joint work.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also ready for a dialogue with Parliament on the lines for restructuring the intelligence system, including democratic and parliamentary control of intelligence services; even though, as you know, national legislation alone is competent in this case, I think that a political debate on this subject would be useful.</p>
<p class="contents">It will also be useful to discuss the use of airspace by non-civil aviation and I can confirm that there is an ongoing debate on the notion of state aircraft and flights for institutional and State assignments; I have gathered very interesting opinions on the role of national courts, which will have their say in providing a response as to individual responsibility when the right conditions exist.</p>
<p class="contents">What I have said confirms my willingness, and that of all the European Commission services, to work with the temporary committee.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, I have the moral and institutional obligation, above all to myself, to respond to a personal attack on me made by Mr Catania, the only one of the 54 speakers who has asked me, for the fourth time, to clarify my role as Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time of the Abu Omar case.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this question, which I have answered several times before the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, may well gain Mr Catania a mention in some headline in the Italian newspapers, but I would have thought that the obligation to tell the truth to this Parliament would have imposed on him the same duty as it does on me: to remember that the government at that time formally denied any knowledge of the Abu Omar case and did so without there being any proof to the contrary. Under Italian law, however, and here it is not a matter of opinion, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the post that I held at that time, not only cannot but must not know about the operating activities of the Italian secret services.</p>
<p class="contents">That is a piece of information on Italian laws of which Mr Catania is aware, but of which many of you are not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
