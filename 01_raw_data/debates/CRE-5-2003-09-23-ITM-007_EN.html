<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> I wish to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their very constructive efforts to reach a compromise between the institutions so that we can adopt this proposal at first reading. As you know, an adoption at first reading is of major importance for the timely execution of the 2004 consumer policy budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much appreciate your support for the key principle of this proposal - that the Consumer Policy Strategy sets the scope, political orientations and priorities for the programming of expenditure on consumer policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that we spend our money on actions designed to achieve the objectives of this strategy: a high common level of consumer protection, better enforcement of consumer protection rules and the closer involvement of consumer organisations in the making of all EU policies that affect consumer interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding accession countries, I fully share Parliament’s view that the application of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> in the accession countries must be given high priority in the consumer policy budget. The Commission will ensure that specific projects undertaken by consumer organisations and aiming to accelerate the effective implementation of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> on consumer protection in the new Member States can be eligible for a financial contribution of 75%.</p>
<p class="contents">As to independent European consumer organisations, you have, in your report, emphasised the need to support these organisations. Here also, I fully agree with you. I also share Parliament’s view that the integration of consumer interests in other EU policies must be given high priority in the consumer policy budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming to grant applications, firstly, the Commission will ensure that consumer organisations are appropriately informed about the new requirements and their strict implementation. The application procedures for grants will be kept as simple as possible, and we will offer consumer organisations seminars to explain how they work.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in order to improve the quality of project applications and project management, initiatives are already under way to offer professionals of consumer organisations training in project development.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, in order to assist consumer organisations in finding project partners, the Commission is putting into place an on-line forum to facilitate networking and cross-border contacts.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to your report, Mr Whitehead, I also wish to assure you and the European Parliament that the Commission will speed up the decision-making on grant applications. Payments will also be made as promptly as possible. However, I must also plead here for your understanding. We will make every effort to complete the decision-making on grant applications within three months. But you must be aware that in the post-accession period, the workload and translation requirements will substantially increase. It is also probable that we will have more third-country participation in consumer policy actions than before.</p>
<p class="contents">Our efforts to streamline and speed up the grant application process cannot be made at the expense of proper evaluation of the proposals, and must comply fully with the rules governing budget management. I take the sound management of Community funds very seriously. The consumer policy budget must and will be executed in strict accordance with the rules set out in the Financial Regulation. On that, no compromise is possible, and I trust that you share that conviction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Tonight, the House has the opportunity to carry through an agreement at first reading, which will guarantee that support for consumers' activities. It came to us a little late but we have made good progress. I would particularly like to thank you, Commissioner, for the effort you made to get here tonight, after the lengthy day you have had, and also for the work of your staff. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their solidarity which includes their presence here tonight, my own assistant Laura Sullivan, the consumer NGOs and the Council Presidency, all of whom have brought us to a position where we can tonight demonstrate that the total support in Council is overwhelmingly replicated in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We are presenting about thirty-one compromise amendments en bloc, all of which have involved give and take. If passed, the second bloc of amendments to the fifteen original ones would fall. That would leave about five remaining amendments which I would advise the House to vote down. I will deal with those last.</p>
<p class="contents">These compromises reflect the consensus view that we need to widen the scale and the proportionate limit of support for consumer activities. We stand on the brink of enlargement and all the diverse needs that will follow from it. We have had to find legally sound ways to extend those provisions up to 2007, in cooperation with our friends and colleagues on the Committee on Budgetary Control.</p>
<p class="contents">We also acknowledge that small - but equally deserving - applicants have been disadvantaged in the past by the arcane nature and length of the assessment process. The converse also applies. We need to be certain of the rules, qualifications and funding of all applicants, however obscure. Events unfolding today before other committees suggest that this caution is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has told us that it accepts with good grace the requirement to supply an assessment of applications within three months. When that is not possible, we will be told why. I am glad that the Commissioner has stressed that his best endeavours and those of his team will go towards making early consideration of all these applications as effective as possible and that there will be seminars and other instruction particularly for those making applications for the first time and, sometimes, from a country which is itself a new Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an anomaly that we are having to discuss the pressing needs of enlargement at a time when, technically, we cannot consider the budget that we know must be used for that purpose post 2004. This is a first reading which can result in instant agreement between the three institutions if we all accept that none of the three have been pushed beyond their limits.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner knows that there has been a certain exasperation over some of the committees that have been set up and the discussions that have been held about consumer protection, not just in this institution but elsewhere too. We have to accept the limits of what we can do in saying who can meet where and do what in relation to consumer advice.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleagues have wisely decided on that score that they would not push some of the amendments that came before the Committee, although we support and indeed sometimes salute the principles that inspired them.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say to my good friend, colleague and namesake Mr Bushill-Matthews that his Amendment No 11 is an amendment too far. I supported it in the Committee because I felt that we needed to make this point: there is exasperation where sometimes - and the Commission I think accepts this as the case - applications have not been considered not just within three or four months, as the Commission would have preferred, but within five months and beyond. The worst offenders are not DG SANCO. Indeed, some of the examples Mr Bushill-Matthews gave come from other directorates-general. The point however stands, we need to improve on it and we need to be able to demonstrate a greater responsiveness on the part of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope Mr Bushill-Matthews will tell us tonight with his customary subtlety that he understands the position we are in.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, this is a modest proposal. The Commissioner will understand that I do not mean this in a Swiftian sense. We are not devouring our children; we are nourishing them with this proposal. I hope it is commended by everybody in the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are, in a sense, the other element of the triptych which makes up democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also, however, like to stress certain aspects which seem to me to be very positive. In accordance with this spirit of providing incentive, I believe it is enormously important to create networks and that they are not just made up of the European consumers’ associations already consolidated. The danger with this type of aid is that we create a group of associations receiving preferential treatment which, in the end, creates an autonomous body, with no relationship with the grass roots.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, we have introduced certain amendments mentioning regional and national associations, because it is extremely important that, particularly in relation to the management and implementation of the programme, the Commission ensures that the small associations can emerge, clearly linked to the scheme and the network. Since we also have the challenge of the new democracies in the Eastern countries, it is essential to incentivise the creation of small associations in every part of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to praise the efforts of the small associations located in regions far from the decision-making centres such as Brussels. It often takes genuine heroism to create an association in these regions, in which the people feel alone and misunderstood and where they often have to touch raw nerves or denounce aspects relating to their immediate neighbours to the local authorities, bearing in mind the scant inspection the administration can carry out.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome this initiative and would ask that, when it comes to distributing aid, account be taken not just of the need to provide incentives for emerging associations and to strengthen the small ones, by linking them to the more consolidated associations, but that we also need to ensure that the more consolidated ones fulfil their duties and make contacts with all parts of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have all worked in a spirit of how important it is to strengthen the consumer organisations and reinforce the objectives of consumer work. I therefore want to say thank you to Phillip.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous speakers have already mentioned the situation in the candidate countries. It is for the new Europe that we are developing the consumer area. In this area, as in many others, I believe there is an old heritage we must combat. I believe that strong consumer organisations are extremely important for enabling people to participate and for giving them the opportunity to exercise influence. For those reasons too, approval is important so that the candidate countries become part of the required network.</p>
<p class="contents">In Parliament’s amendments, we indicate the importance of genuinely integrating consumer issues into other areas. This has been an issue especially close to my heart. As MEPs, we see how strong the lobbying is in other areas. We must give the consumer the power to study, inform and share best practices. The next issues must be those of mobile telephone conversations, price fixing or the ways in which billing operates in different countries. I therefore think it important for us to highlight this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous speakers, especially the rapporteur and the Commissioner, spoke of the administrative procedures. The work we have done together – and I want to emphasise the word ‘together’ – may be genuinely groundbreaking in bringing about rapid procedures and quick responses in place of a situation in which applicants are constantly forced to communicate when there is no need to. I hope that the outcome of our work will serve as an example of better procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the committee proposed that the committee, mentioned in Article 15, should be disbanded. We knew that the Council would not perhaps accept the proposal. I nonetheless hope that the Commissioner, the Commission and all of us are agreed about following up the question of what the committee costs. Does it give value for money? In an enlarged EU, it may be extremely difficult to have large committees of this kind that decide about quite small funds. I hope that the Commission will genuinely look into what the committee mentioned in Article 15 will, in reality, cost. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The clarification of the detailed rules for financing consumer protection organisations was essential. The definition of such bodies must be strict. The report follows this line, while at the same time guaranteeing the participation of a panel of organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we must keep those organisations which demonstrate the necessary technical competence, but we must also ensure the independence of representative bodies. It is absolutely essential to avoid a situation in which pressure groups – whether industrial, commercial, professional or any other kind – see those bodies as a means of indirectly influencing the Union’s policy. On the other hand, we must maintain our relations with the cooperatives, which take consumers’ interests into account in their charters.</p>
<p class="contents">Relations with consumer protection organisations have to be developed in close contact with the public. We cannot, therefore, be satisfied with giving preferential treatment to relations with Community or national organisations while merely offering support to regional bodies: the latter must enjoy proper representation within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, as well as corresponding financial aid. That committee will also be responsible for ensuring even greater representation of civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">The expansion in the sphere of competence is important. The bodies in the food sector have now been joined by consumer protection organisations in the services sector and, more broadly, in the non-food sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Access to information is an essential guarantee of consumer protection. This is why we asked for, and obtained, public data banks that would be easily accessible. The public must be able to find out about the precise history of products, their origin, their method of production etc. This means, amongst other things, improving labelling – an effective means of guaranteeing that consumers are informed.</p>
<p class="contents">We must go further, however. If we want to be sure that safe products are being marketed, we not only need to be informed about the risks: we also need to see about reducing those risks. That is only possible if we develop comparative evaluations with a view to sustainable and responsible production and consumption. That is the real consumer protection policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This called for Commission officials responsible for non-payment in due time to be named in the official Parliamentary record after a three-week deadline. The purpose of this flowed from an experience of one of my constituents in the West Midlands who had to wait for over a year to get paid his due from - I have to say - the Agriculture DG rather than your own, Commissioner, but who none the less came across two particular individuals who were not only incompetent but also unhelpful. They know who they are. I think it is appropriate that other people should know who they are. So this amendment was not tabled out of malice, but out of experience and a desire to be helpful, in my usual style.</p>
<p class="contents">I was pleased that in your opening remarks you said that, perhaps as a result of this amendment, it is your intention to speed up decision-making. But I was concerned about your follow-up comments when you said that we have to take note of the possibility of enlargement slowing things up, that we still have to take care of evaluation, and so on. There were too many 'buts' from my point of view. I have to say gently, but firmly, Commissioner, that those are fine words but we shall be watching you.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to say that this should go through at first reading, despite what I have just said. I agree with the rapporteur that this is an important issue. To help it on its way the PPE-DE Group is calling for a roll-call vote on this particular amendment but will then abstain so that the amendment will fall. Hopefully then, the report will go through but we will have put down a marker.</p>
<p class="contents">As MEPs we are each held accountable for what we say, what we do and what we fail to do. This is as it should be. But I must say to the Commissioner that such a policy should not just apply to us; it should apply to everyone in authority and especially to those in public service. Some Commission officials clearly believe that it does not apply to them. They are quite wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">If they fail to learn, then I am confident that Parliament will put forward another helpful amendment in due course that will not be voted down. Today and tomorrow we will have given a warning shot. If this fails to work, we shall use live rounds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It cannot be emphasised enough how important a proper consumer policy is for the EU. Consumer policy has, of course, many important purposes. It must contribute to sustainable development, sustainable production and sustainable consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also necessary to change our consumer behaviour, and the small consumer organisations are very important in this context. I particularly want to discuss the aid given to small consumer organisations and, in particular, to the new Member States. They should not be discouraged by the fact that it takes some time for them to be informed about the co-financing projects. Instead, it must be ensured that the procedure is changed so that they are notified quickly and so enabled to continue their good work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I personally feel that the codecision process has resulted in significant improvements to this decision. The compromise amendments proposed have reaped the benefit of the combined expertise of all three institutions. The Commission can accept this compromise package, consisting of Amendments Nos 1, 2, 12, 14, 15, 22, 23 and 29 up to and including 59.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Amendment No 52 is concerned, the Commission notes the Parliament’s wish and the Council’s unanimous agreement that there should be a three-month deadline for decision-making on grant applications. We are committed to reducing the time taken for such decisions to the absolute minimum and will work towards this deadline. Nevertheless, the Commission wishes to remind Parliament of the importance of not deviating from the imperatives of proper evaluation and the full respect of rules on financial and budget management.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to the comments from Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines and Mr Rod on regional organisations, I should say that I am fully aware of the important role played by regional consumer organisations in certain EU countries. Their proximity to consumer concerns makes them an interesting partner for implementing the policy objectives of EU consumer policy. Regional consumer organisations are eligible for grants for specific projects and can also benefit from the capacity-building actions we offer to consumer organisations. For example, the training courses we offer to consumer organisations to help improve their managerial capacity and the contribution of consumer representatives to EU policy development are open to the staff of regional consumer organisations. Specific projects that promote the objectives of EU policy at regional level are eligible for cofinancing from the EU budget. I very much hope that regional consumer organisations will make good use of such opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mrs Thors' question regarding the integration of consumer issues in other policies, I want to stress that the integration of consumer interests into all relevant EU policies is enshrined in Article 153 of the Treaty. It should be pursued by all Commission services and by all EU institutions. We have been making progress on this issue. In the important debate about services of general interest, that followed the adoption of the Commission Green Paper, consumer interests are amongst the core issues on the table. We hope that the progress achieved so far - in air transport, for example, with the charter on passenger rights and the denied boarding regulation - will serve as a reference for the improvement of passenger rights in other modes of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Actions in this proposal for a decision that will contribute to the integration objectives are many; to name but a few: actions to provide consumer organisations with the technical and legal expertise to effectively contribute to policy development in EU policy areas relevant to consumers, and actions to collect data that provide an evidence base for the integration of consumer interests into other EU policies.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of comitology raised by Mrs Thors, I would like to say that since 1999 the Consultative Committee of the Member States has advised the Commission, in particular concerning the attribution of grants. It makes a useful contribution to coordinating EU and national policies for project grants. In addition, this Committee will become the essential forum for discussion and advice on the implementation of a new type of action - those that are jointly financed by the Community budget and the Member States. These joint actions will in particular be used for the Commission's future activities in the area of administrative and enforcement cooperation and to consolidate the existing networks of European Consumer Centres and the Extra-Judicial network.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee, therefore, has a key role to play in the implementation of the proposed framework. I took full note when Mr Bushill-Matthews said that he will be watching me: that, of course, is his job and that of Parliament. We are accountable to Parliament and Parliament is of course accountable to the elected Members. I noted that Mr Bushill-Matthews also said that next time he will fire live rounds. I suppose that means that up until now he has been firing blanks!</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, my special gratitude goes to Mr Whitehead, who has proved a master in negotiating at a high level to achieve a compromise with the Council. I take note of what he said in relation to us nourishing our children rather than devouring them. Of course you will realise, Mr Whitehead, that this proposal is not a modest proposal: it is quite a substantial proposal. Your reference to my fellow countryman points to the title 'A Modest Proposal', which, of course, is inappropriate in this instance.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider this exercise to be an excellent example of how the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission can work together constructively on consumer policy issues. I trust that the vote will confirm the orientations set out today.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that other consumer issues pending before this Parliament can also, in due course, be resolved with equal skill and constructive spirit.<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
