<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cox </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. ‐</span> Madam President, I regret that Commissioner Monti is not here, not because I want to make a pedantic point about his absence, but rather because I would have liked to say this to him personally and have it put on the record in the House. But even in his absence I am happy to do so. He is one of a number of Commissioners in the present caretaker college whose resignation because of circumstances not to do with himself I deeply regret. He has performed his European public function commendably and I would like to put that on the record. I do not know whether in the future he is likely to be renominated or redesignated but in any event he is one of the many innocent victims of the fall‐out of recent events and I would like to record that on my own behalf.</p>
<p class="contents">For those colleagues who are here I have little to add to what I said several weeks ago. In substance the report before us is based on the Commission's proposal, which is itself a useful proposal. In terms of Parliament's approach to it I hope we vote ‘yes" to new taxes, but ‘no" to more taxes. In other words we want to see the tax base expand through the energy tax, but we want to state clearly and politically to the Commission and to the Council that we would like to see offsets of this new expanded energy tax base being recycled into lowering the tax wedge, the tax cost and labour. That is the reason we support this; it is not the only reason but a major reason.</p>
<p class="contents">To those who look at structural unemployment problems in the European Union and who condemn the high levels of unemployment but who refuse to contemplate, through their votes in this House, a broadening of the tax base in areas such as energy, I would say: could they please tell us on the record where will we find the alternative resources to address the tax crisis in a number of states to do with structural problems and unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">My second general point: this proposal should not be exaggerated. It is modest but useful. However, in my opinion and in the opinion of the majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs it is riddled with too many exceptions. We support the Monti proposal but we want a greener Monti proposal. We support some exceptions but we want the emphasis on green exceptions.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to tax rates, as before we propose not a complex system of coming back on the question every so many years, but an accelerator principle to be subject to review potentially every five years. We recognise that in some firms and sectors the energy cost may be very high as a proportion of total cost and for such firms and such sectors we need a mechanism to recognise and address the competitive handicap. We believe that competitive handicap can be addressed by allowing Member States some degree of discretion, but in my view it should be subject to Commission review. There is an amendment tomorrow to that effect, specifying how the Commission might review requests from sectors and Member States who plead a special case, and that amendment should be adopted, because this should not be used as a <span class="italic">carte blanche</span> simply to ignore the tax.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, we support a new energy and eco‐tax system but we do not support more taxes <span class="italic">per se</span> . In other words, we demand fiscal neutrality. We insist that the price of introducing this is that we lower labour taxes. We want a simpler and more certain tax‐ based definition. We want a more predictable base‐deepening formula through an accelerator principle to determine the evolution of tax rates, given the new tax base. We want competitive handicap to be recognised and addressed but only where that is genuine and not simply a <span class="italic">carte blanche</span> to ignore the tax altogether. If that happens – and I hope it will happen in the vote – then I will recommend to colleagues that this is a report worth supporting. Last time out, Madam President, we narrowly missed getting a majority. That arose partly through a misunderstanding of some of the detail. I hope there will be no misunderstandings tomorrow and indeed that some of the sceptics might re‐read the report in substance and realise it is the way of the future. I therefore commend the report to the House.</p>

<p class="contents">However, this is not very well planned, Mr Cox. Do you know what kind of a reduction we would see in the emission of pollutants, particularly CO<span class="sub">2</span> , if we were to increase prices, as you propose? We would not even see a reduction of 1 %. We are making too great a fuss over something that will provide very few results.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we are currently trying to lower the price of electricity and gas through the liberalisation of the markets because energy in Europe is expensive and it is very difficult for us to compete with Japan and the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">We are trying to do everything at once but this is not the time for that. We must do one thing at a time.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, the amendments you are proposing will produce an increase in charges. Nevertheless, according to the economic studies carried out by the Commission"s advisers, 150 000 jobs would be created and a 1 % reduction in CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions achieved. It is true that the macroeconomic effects would be minor – neither inflation nor the deficit would rise a great deal – but at the moment our countries are all committed to their stability programmes. In other words, I do not believe that your report is very timely, although this does not mean that I do not think that it is a good report. I do not feel that this is the right time for it, nor is it the right time for the Commission"s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry to say that our group will not be supporting your amendments, Mr Cox. Indeed, if this report is voted through, it will be quite unrealistic since it achieves very little. In any event, you and I can be assured that progress will be made in this area in the future. But perhaps this is not the right time for it or the right time to introduce new taxes. You say ‘no new taxes" and you are right. But this should also apply to energy, since it is already very highly taxed in Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">At the time, we put forward our analysis of the Commission"s proposal, which indicated that it was perhaps overly ambitious.</p>
<p class="contents">It hopes to achieve three objectives through a single set of rules, and we all know that the effectiveness of a set of rules is normally inversely proportional to the number of objectives it has.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Estevan Bolea pointed out, the three objectives are quite ambitious and Mr Cox"s report tries to help us understand the exceptions and how they will be applied. This is difficult to achieve with a set of fiscal rules that are actually designed to extend the scope of the tax.</p>
<p class="contents">In cases where new scope is defined for fiscal rules, such as VAT, there are many very detailed exceptions. We are talking here about rules proposed by the Commission that increase the excise duty on oil products and increase taxation on energy products. These are complicated rules and they also seek to meet environmental objectives that are difficult to achieve or that entail massive marginal costs, as Mrs Estevan Bolea explained. Moreover, there is no certainty as to the fiscal neutrality of the rules, or at least we have not been able to find it anywhere. We therefore have no guarantees that the rules will be fiscally neutral.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that Mr Cox has tried to simplify the exceptions, but we do not agree with this as we believe that it would be very difficult for the Commission to manage. We are back to the famous method of giving the Commission, via the Member States, countless individual cases and authorisations to deal with according to the level of energy consumption, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, we do believe that there have to be some rules. And, as Mrs Estevan Bolea mentioned, we will eventually have to do something. Perhaps we will have to divide up the objectives into various sets of rules and simplify the application of the ones we are discussing. Their objectives are commendable, but we believe that it would be extremely difficult to work towards them at this present moment in time.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, Mr Cox, we will maintain the same position tomorrow as we did a few weeks ago, since, as far as we can see, the substance of your report has not changed in any way and, therefore, the Commission proposal has not been altered.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Virrankoski </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(FI) </span> Madam President, Mr Cox has collaborated in producing a report which creates a sound basis for a review of energy taxation, for which I thank him sincerely. Obviously, our group supports its chairman"s report. Energy taxation is one of the best and most effective controls which society can use to reduce emissions and try to protect and improve the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The main argument in the report is that Member States should be left some leeway when it comes to applying taxation, so long as the single market is not affected. This has to be regarded as only right, as does the principle that renewable energy sources should not come within the scope of the directive. The argument that there should be continued support for the production of combined electricity and heating is extremely important and most welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, Patrick Cox, has already simplified and clarified the Commission"s proposal, but in my opinion it could have been simplified still further. The minimum levels of taxation mentioned in Articles 7 and 8 could even be harmonised. Levels of taxation for fuels used for production and those used for heating are now so close to one another that they could be harmonised.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise the importance of two details here. Firstly, peat should in future become recognised incontrovertibly as a renewable biomass. A marsh will produce roughly the same amount of peat in a year as a forest does wood pulp per unit area. Thus, peat is unquestionably a renewable source of energy. It is important to make this point, as peat is and will be of tremendous importance in the Nordic countries and Ireland too, for example. The second point is this. The tax on aircraft fuel should be left for individual countries to decide themselves. There are big differences in air traffic density among the Member States. Internal air traffic in small countries is insignificant, but in the large Member States, such as Finland, it is extremely important. For this reason, a harmonised taxation system would not treat different Member States fairly. Taking these observations into account, I believe the report is excellent and I give it my wholehearted support.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Breyer </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome this report as a small step in the right direction. It is clear to all of us that a great deal still remains to be done before we can finally achieve a breakthrough in the area of energy taxation. But it is essential for us that the second stage of ecological tax reform in Germany is not slowed down by Brussels and that in the medium‐term we can finally reach a stage where there are pioneer states that can lead the way in the European Union. We are particularly pleased that there are exceptions that are ‘green" and that involve not only energy‐intensive operations but also – and this must be clear to everyone – environmentally friendly renewable energies that can be exempted from energy taxation. The fact that nuclear energy is also to be taxed pleases us greatly, as otherwise we would have an imbalance in the energy taxation proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">We are pleased that our amendment received a majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy because it is crucial for us that local public transport can be exempted. For there is one thing that we must not forget: this energy taxation has a purpose, which is to help the environment and help to meet the commitment that we undertook to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This is what all these various possibilities are designed to do. What we need now is for the Council of Ministers to reach agreement as soon as possible. In this context I am pleased to inform you that the German Minister for the Environment, Mr Trittin, is endeavouring, during his visits to the Member States, to ensure that we reach agreement on this issue as soon as possible.</p>

On the other hand, I am glad that Mr Cox"s report has not lost too much of its force in the intervening period. It still offers a clear alternative to the hybrid Commission proposal. A large number of counter‐productive derogations have been scrapped, and I shall be glad to support the Cox report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council must now make up its mind. Either it sticks to the international agreements on limiting CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions and reducing environmental pollution or it opts for the unclear situation of the status quo, with further damage to our climate system as a result. I am in favour of abolishing the exemption from tax for civil aviation fuel. If the European Union unilaterally introduced a tax, however, this might lead to considerable distortion of aircraft movements. I think an excellent alternative would be an overflying tax as advocated earlier, in conjunction with air traffic control services.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Rübig </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in international competition we need a sensible form of energy taxation. In my opinion there are several reasons why the issue of energy taxation is one of the most forward‐looking debates in the European Union and beyond. Positively speaking, it mainly involves a system of incentives to encourage an economical and efficient use of our resources. But we must proceed with restraint to ensure that the baby – and therefore the economy – is not thrown out with the bathwater. After all, we are not against the introduction of harmonised energy taxation in principle. However, with it we must guarantee a level playing field in terms of competition. My country, for example, has taken a leading role in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, the general introduction of upper limits on taxation for energy‐intensive firms, as provided in Article 15 of the Commission proposal, makes a great deal of sense. We should not forget that such firms have already in the past updated their technical equipment and brought their energy consumption closer to minimum levels. In this case higher energy tax cannot achieve any further saving. We can prevent the increased costs that this would entail and thus support the competitiveness of our companies and of Europe as a location for business. For this reason we should also think about discontinuing the optional exemption of energy products that are not used as fuel and of energy products that are used to produce electricity and heat, as provided in Article 13.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, those Member States whose energy taxation rates are above the minimum level should at least be given the opportunity to adjust their taxation levels accordingly. A flexible system of upper limits could make it possible to find reasonable solutions.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Monti, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. ‐</span> I should like, first of all, to present my apologies to you, Madam President, as well as to all Members of Parliament in the Chamber at this time, in particular to Mr Harrison and Mr Cox, the two rapporteurs. Although I had planned my flight with plenty of time to spare, that proved insufficient. I apologise for this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Cox for what I understand have been very generous words on his part. I would also like to thank Mr Spencer.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cox, the report you have drafted and the conclusions you have drawn are extremely interesting and important. I am very pleased that you support the reasoning behind this proposal and the manner in which that reasoning is translated into action. The Commission has put a proposal to the Council, the main thrust of which is the need to modernise the Community system for the taxation of mineral oils and to extend its scope to all energy products. This is necessary to improve the functioning of the single market by reducing the tax‐induced distortions that exist at present.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also used the proposal to meet its obligation to review minimum rates of taxation on mineral oils and, at the same time, to respond to the ECOFIN Council request to come forward with new proposals following the deadlock in the negotiations on the CO2 energy tax. I need hardly add that in this context there is growing concern about the environmental effects of the combustion of fossil fuels. This has been highlighted by the recent adoption by the Council of emission targets for the Union in response to the Kyoto Protocol. The achievement of these targets will not be easy and fiscal measures are one of the concrete tools which can be utilised to assist in the task.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2, 3, 11, 12, 13, 23, 32, 33 and parts of Amendment No 25. However, the suggestion that we should move straight to the second stage of minimum rates from January 2000 and increase these annually by the rate of inflation plus 2 % for five years cannot be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as deletion of the initial stage of the minimum levels of taxation is concerned, it is true that the operative date of 1 January 1998 belongs to the past. However, discussions in the Council have shown that even the proposed minimum levels are causing difficulties for a number of Member States. Any increase in these levels is therefore not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to the suggestion that minimum tax levels should be increased annually by inflation plus 2 % for a period of five years. The Commission proposal restricts the increase to the rate of inflation in order to assist Member States who would be required to impose substantial increases in tax simply to attain the proposed minimum levels. To require them in addition to impose further increases in excess of inflation is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The removal of most of the proposed compulsory and optional exemptions and reductions relating to products which are not currently taxed cannot be accepted. These exemptions and reductions have been formulated for a number of reasons. Some exist in current legislation; others are necessary to reflect Community obligations under international agreements and a further group is considered necessary to protect the competitiveness of Community enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should just add a word or two on Mr Harrison's report.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(IT) This exercise in simplification, which recently led the Commission to present a proposal for a directive on the right to deduct, is a top priority for us. This proposed directive constitutes one more step in that direction; in essence, its aim is to prevent national administrations in future from obliging non‐resident traders to appoint a tax representative. I am pleased to note that Mr Harrison's report backs this approach and welcomes the Commission's proposal. However, the amendments do not strike me as acceptable; but I assure you that the Commission shares the rapporteur's view that the adoption of the definitive system will constitute the final and most important simplification for traders.</span></p>
