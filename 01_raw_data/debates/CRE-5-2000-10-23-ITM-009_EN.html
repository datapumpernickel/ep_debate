<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Riis-Jørgensen (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, I very much welcome the Commission’s report. It is a splendid piece of work that Commissioner Monti and his staff carried out last year. In my report on the twenty-ninth report on the Commission’s competition policy, I expended particular energy on the problems concerning mergers and the repayment of State aid. I did this for a number of reasons. Firstly because, in the course of last year, I was approached on a number of occasions by companies which have felt a certain degree of powerlessness in connection with rulings on mergers, especially in relation to those cases in which they have needed to appeal to the Court of First Instance against the Commission’s ruling. With regard to State aid, moreover, problems apparently still exist with ensuring that unlawfully paid State aid is paid back to the national exchequers.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us begin, however, with mergers. One consequence of EMU is, of course, that we see more and more mergers. I also think the time is ripe for re-assessing whether the procedures and sets of rules we have at present are as good as they could be. The world is not, of course, always so easy for those who have to follow the rules and procedures we are involved in devising. I think it is necessary for clear rules to be devised for what is called the relevant market. It is important to distinguish between what may be called the peripheral areas of Europe and what may be called the heart of Europe. It is especially important to put this distinction in place before enlargement, for it can be difficult for the smaller countries in the peripheral areas when companies wish to merge, because the latter quickly become large players in their own market. It is not especially appropriate that larger companies in small countries should be prevented from merging for, in that way, their opportunities to compete globally are reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to remind you that we do, of course, have existing rules to take care of those circumstances in which companies exploit their important and possibly dominant market positions. We therefore need not perhaps be so afraid of mergers. After all, it is not a crime for companies to merge. Another thing I feel very strongly about is the need to arrange for mergers to go through more quickly. I am thinking here, in particular, of those circumstances in which a company wishes to appeal against the Commission’s ruling. Quite simply, a period of between 25 and 35 months is too long in our global village for getting a case through the courts, and what is very time consuming is having the documents of the case translated. That is not good enough. We owe it to our companies to offer them the best conditions so that they are able to plan their production and, especially, their future.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of mergers, I have two questions for you, Commissioner Monti. Would it be possible to consider different possible solutions for separating the Commission’s functions of judge and prosecutor? For example, could there be a panel of independent experts during the second hearing so that it is not exclusively people from the Commission who assess individual merger cases? I also have another idea, even if it is perhaps a touch outside your sphere of authority. Might not a committee of experts or an expert tribunal, specialising in companies, be set up in the department of first instance at the court in Luxembourg? In Denmark, for example, we have a special maritime and commercial court dealing exclusively with issues relating to companies. I would also take the opportunity of asking the Commissioner to explain why one of the most trusted merger specialists has left the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The other subject I raised in my report is that of State aid and the repayment of State aid which has been awarded unlawfully. I make no secret of the fact that I feel very strongly about tightening up on the repayment of State aid which has been awarded unlawfully, especially since this is another area it is important to sort out before enlargement. It is good that State aid to shipyards in Europe should be phased out as per 1 January 2001, even if it is extremely problematic that our shipyards should continue to have to compete with the South Korean treasury. In the light of the latest development, I can appreciate why the Commission has, with good reason, adopted a harder line on South Korea. I am wondering, therefore, if you could report on the very latest developments, Commissioner, even though I am well aware that you only have limited time available.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to take the opportunity to ask Commissioner Monti if and when a public, efficient and properly functioning register of State aid may be expected to be put in place and, in the same vein, when the long-promised scoreboard is to become a reality. Finally, I want to emphasise that, for me as a liberal, it is crucially important that companies can be sure of being dealt with properly and efficiently in all areas, so that there are no hitches where companies’ future legal certainty is concerned. I should also like to thank my fellow MEPs in Committee for the splendid way in which they have cooperated in connection with my report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have been taken in joint debate because common issues apply. I endorse much of the agenda that has been set by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to begin somewhat unusually by congratulating the Commission on a document it published back in June 1999 – the Community rules on state aid, what I might call the "idiot's guide" to the operation of the state aid scheme. It is helpful in that it sets out the Treaty provisions, the definitions of state aid and also the exemptions from the ban on state aid. In the course of preparing my report, I have had to struggle with that particular conundrum. There are those in this House who will wish to emphasise the exemptions; however, I wish to make it clear that for the most part the operation of state aid works against free competition within a single market.</p>
<p class="contents">The single market is essential in terms of promoting the interests of consumers. They must have a wide variety of high-quality, competitively priced goods and that, ultimately, is the reason for pushing forward with the single market and, along with it, free competition, because it is to the benefit of all our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the eighth survey: although there has been a reduction in the overall level of state aid during the period concerned, this can in fact be attributed to a minority of Member States and, taken overall, ten Member States have seen levels of state aid increase. I know that is a matter of concern to the Commissioner and it is certainly a concern I share. I therefore welcome the indications we have received from the Commissioner that he anticipates that by July of next year we will be seeing progress in relation to the delivery of a state aid scoreboard and register. That is important in terms of the need for transparency. I would ask him how he sees the debate on enlargement in view of the fact that, on the one hand, we must ensure that we have a common regime across all states within the European Union and, on the other hand, it must be the case that some of the candidate countries have particular difficulties in adjusting to new open market conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also make the point to Commissioner Monti that it is important that in the next survey we see a rather larger section on the financial services sector. I should like to congratulate him on a speech he made in Barcelona in September – and I am very grateful to his staff for sending a copy of the speech to me – devoted as it was to his view on the synergy between state aid control and the financial services sector.</p>
<p class="contents">But in due course we must see rather more of that in the state aid report itself. I also would wish to see changes in the way that the state aid report is put together in order to ensure it is able to take account of future developments. For instance, during the period of time of this report, no state aid was given to the coal sector in the UK and yet we all know that significant aid is currently being proposed by the UK Government.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say in that context that I am very strongly of the view, as is the steel industry in very many parts of the European Union, that the steel aid code, which it is not planned to extend beyond 2002, needs to remain in place in order that all businesses are aware, in the current difficult circumstances for the steel industry, that a strict regime will be applied within the European Union, which is not discriminatory as between one country and another.</p>
<p class="contents">I take this opportunity to ask the Commissioner for some information regarding two cases within the United Kingdom where the Commission has currently instituted action – if indeed it is the case that action has been instituted. There are the cases of the universal bank proposed by the UK Government to assist post offices in the UK and also the venture capital schemes in the regions of the United Kingdom. I understand he has asked for information concerning this.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite clear that throughout the report itself much attention has been directed not just to the past but also to Commissioner Monti’s proposals for future reform of competition policy. That is an issue which will be coming before Parliament in due course. Commissioner Monti will be very well aware of the concerns that are shared by many people who support his proposals for reform but feel that there need to be answers in relation to issues like jurisdiction shopping, legal certainty, the role of national courts, dialogue between the national competition authorities and the Commission itself, as also issues of staffing within the Commission. Those are matters that we will consider in debates in due course and for which – I am delighted to inform the Commission – I have been appointed Parliament’s rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, you know that for some time now, there has been a substantial consensus in this House on competition issues. This means that the entire House supports the Commission in matters of competition policy. With the passage of time though, I have begun to wonder whether the Commission is not, in fact, gradually losing its sense of perspective where individual decisions are concerned, or whether it even wants to prejudge fundamental decisions in entirely different political fields under the mantle of competition. I will cite one of several examples, and it is one that is currently the subject of intense debate in other regions besides my own. It concerns the subsidisation decision or non-subsidisation decision in relation to the coal industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I will take the precaution, Commissioner – in case you should want to point out that this in fact falls within Commissioner Palacio’s remit – of saying that I am addressing the Commission as a whole. I would also draw your attention to the fact that the coal issue is raised both in the competition report and in the subsidy report that we are discussing today. I expect the Commission to uphold its agreements. I do not expect it to abuse judgements from the Court of Justice in order to withdraw from these agreements. I will reiterate what I have already said repeatedly in debates of this kind: competition is not an end in itself. When a decision is to be taken in matters of competition policy, account must be taken of the social, structural and industrial implications, and if this is not done then competition policy will degenerate to the level of pure ideology. If the aspects I mentioned are taken into consideration, and one considers the net product chain of the state-of-the-art technology, then the subsidy licences that have fallen due for coal mining must be granted without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not just apply to the sphere of energy policy; it applies right across the board. Competition is important but it is not the be-all and end-all.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, what we need is to strike a balance between competition rules and acting for the public good. This must be the guiding principle in all areas. Commissioner, I want to take up what I said at the beginning. The support is still there. But if you carry on in this vein, you risk losing the support of not insignificant sections of the House. I dare say that is unlikely to help matters overall. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to begin by congratulating her on a very good report.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the absolutely basic principles of EU cooperation is that competition between different companies, products, countries and regions should work well and be fair and correct, as well as be for the benefit of consumers. Allow me to begin with something said by Adam Smith, the father of economic liberalism, in 1776, to the effect that people in the same industry seldom meet for pleasure or diversion without their conversations’ ending with a conspiracy against the general public or some device for raising prices. Certainly, a good deal has happened in the last 200 years or so, but we have the same aspirations today. If the internal market is to operate, we must have active institutions which look after issues of competition. Commissioner Monti is to be congratulated in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 16 of Mrs Riis-Jørgensen’s report talks of increased legal certainty where applications for mergers are concerned, together with more effective and shorter timeframes within which to appeal before courts. This applies particularly in view of the fact that, in dealing with mergers, the Commission has something of a double role. The Commission both supervises and applies the rules of competition. This double role makes special demands in terms of openness, control and predictability.</p>
<p class="contents">The second paragraph I want to mention is paragraph 18. It is of general relevance, but its point of departure is the planned merger between motor manufacturers Volvo and Scania. As is well known, the Commission opposed this merger, which in turn led to an extensive debate about how the rules of competition operate and how market shares are to be calculated and assessed. A clearer definition and further discussion are needed in this area. As long as the internal market is not complete, it is mainly large companies in small Member States which can lose out in competitiveness to companies elsewhere in the world. How are large companies with large home markets to be able to merge and compete in a global market if the EU’s rules make this impossible? Coming as I do from a small country, I myself am very pleased, therefore, that the Committee should have adopted the amendments I proposed in this connection. I hope that the Commission is now also prepared to broaden the discussion and shed more light on the rules of competition on the basis of these assumptions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Della Vedova (TDI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Commissioner Monti, on behalf of the Italian Radicals, I too would like to thank the rapporteurs for the two sound reports they have produced, which commend both your work and the work of the Directorate-General for Competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to raise a few general points regarding European competition policies and also the competitiveness and opening-up of the European markets, not in order to deny any progress made thusfar, but with a view to the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, a particularly regrettable factor, if we want a genuinely open and competitive market economy to develop, is still the presence of large numbers of powerful public companies in sectors which have already been formally liberalised or which are currently going through this process. I could mention, for example ... let me see ... the State monopoly of retirement pensions, but I will restrict myself, more pertinently, to firms operating in the sectors of general interest services. It is my view that, in these sectors, competition and the market are being severely hampered by the fact that the State is both regulator and operator.</p>
<p class="contents">I know, Commissioner, because I have had occasion to read and hear your views on the matter, that your response to the objections is that the articles of the Treaties do not provide for any distinction between the public or private nature of firms. However, we cannot be satisfied with this response if we want Europe to become a more competitive and more open market in the future and – dare I say it – if we study carefully certain situations which are developing,<span class="bold"> </span>in which even the current rules would allow us to intervene. The whole of Europe is experiencing the growth of an aggressive State capitalism which has resulted in a series of private companies being taken over by State monopolies or former monopolies, in any case by companies which are firmly in public hands, companies which are State-owned. We have heard the justification many times; it is always ready to be trotted out – we must ensure that our companies and their assets retain their value through the privatisation process – meanwhile privatisation generally becomes more and more delayed instead of facilitated. And, naturally, these are clearly statements to which the ears of the various Ministers for the Treasury in Europe are extremely sensitive. In all cases, these are public companies whose financial prowess derives from their past and present positions of monopoly rather than managerial expertise. In many cases, they are companies which operate entirely or in part with considerable legal monopolistic reserves.</p>
<p class="contents">Truly, Commissioner, can we not perceive in these cases the existence of State aid, concealed to a greater or lesser extent, or abuse of a dominating position? Or again, the transfer at the very least of the distorting effects of the dominating position from one sector to another? Or, lastly, the ever increasing consolidation of the positions of the incumbents which will make it difficult for newcomers to enter the various markets after liberalisation? By way of example, <span class="italic">Deutsche Post</span> has recently gained control of <span class="italic">DHL International</span> and is operating under a monopoly for dispatches up to 200 grams, and then, on a more general note, we could cite the diversification of the State postal companies in other sectors; EDF<span class="italic"> (Eléctricité de France) </span>has taken over companies in Britain, Sweden and Finland, <span class="italic">France Telecom </span>has taken over <span class="italic">Orange</span>; on the Italian side of things, <span class="italic">Enel</span> has taken over <span class="italic">Infostrada</span> and, still in the Italian context, we could mention the various companies owned by local authorities which are behaving in a similar fashion. Lastly, Commissioner, there is the case of the public financing of State television under the alibi of financing a public service, which is a concept that is fading fast.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there is the Treaty of Amsterdam, but I wonder whether the constraints imposed by the governments on the excellent work of your predecessor should, in any case, be justified as a way of exempting these companies from European competition rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This overhaul is all the more imperative since nearly all of the Member States have now established a sound, independent competition authority. I do not share the concern expressed by quite a few fellow MEPs with regard to the re-nationalisation of policy. If we want to avoid a chaotic and unwieldy bureaucracy in Brussels, then we have no choice but to embrace decentralisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted about the special attention being paid to the position of large undertakings in small Member States in Paragraph 18 of the motion for a resolution. These are the ones experiencing major adverse effects from infringements of the internal market or from the continued existence of borders within the internal market, because their ‘home market’ cannot sufficiently absorb these blows. What are the Commissioner’s objections to lending the concept of ‘relevant market’ a predominantly EU-wide dimension in the event of mergers?</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to draw the Commissioner’s attention to the environmental significance of soil decontamination projects. Naturally, we endorse the polluter pays principle. But this principle certainly cannot always be applied, especially in the case of large or substantial soil decontamination projects, because we will then end up with contaminated soil well into the next century. Given the staff shortages in your Directorate-General, Mr Monti, it is not logical to accord a great deal of attention to this. It seems to me that the effect of these projects on the competitive sphere is rather minor.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the book by your predecessor, and former Commissioner, Mr Van Miert, entitled “Mijn jaren in Europa” [My years in Europe] gives some idea of the blackmail-like tactics which a Competition Commissioner comes up against. It speaks volumes. I hope you are affected by this to a lesser extent, but I fear the worst. I therefore wish you all the strength and wisdom you will need to keep your chin up over the next couple of years, and I look forward to reading similar memoirs by yourself in due course. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Competition is not, as has already been said, an end in itself. It must serve the interests of consumers, companies and local conditions. Competition is therefore always a means to an end. It is a vital cornerstone of our model, in terms of political order, of the socio-economic market economy. I stress this point because the market cannot regulate everything, which is why competition is not completely unrestricted, nor should it be.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need two things: firstly, in the interests of increased transparency, we need to make the public aware of all the approved subsidies that influence competition, and secondly there must be areas of our day-to-day lives and behaviour which are not subject lock, stock and barrel to the dictates of European competition policy. The sports sphere or the numerous non-governmental organisations in the social and health spheres, to quote two examples.</p>
<p class="contents">Who, like us, says ‘yes’ to a functioning internal market, must also have the courage of their convictions to say ‘yes’ to European competition policy. Therefore, we welcome the modernisation of competition policy, which is initiated and then maintained by a stream of new proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community’s competition policy has been given a new European and international dimension. In view of the enlargement process and globalisation, it is playing an increasingly important part in economic relations within and outside the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the modernisation going on within the Community on the one hand, and the fact that European competition policy now extends beyond Union borders.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, we need a more precise definition of the relevant market because, increasingly, the market is not the national market. We need to promote the citizens’ awareness of competition policy, so that they recognise the advantages. We also need to step up debate in the European public arena on the relevant proposals, because they are frequently misunderstood. What I mean – and this is directed at the public, not the Commission – is that its decentralised application must not lead to renationalisation, but must instead lead to Europeanisation. When you delegate responsibility, you must take care not to surrender your key responsibility!</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, boosting the citizens’ autonomy must not create legal uncertainty, rather, European competition policy must well and truly leave its mark on the thoughts and actions of the people beyond the institutions. We still have a lot to do on that score, Commissioner! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is certain, but if each and every one of us is honest, we have to admit that in our public life we have often defended state aid when an undertaking has required it in order to establish itself, for example, in our constituency, or in order to prevent it from closing.</p>
<p class="contents">I began by saying this in order to highlight what is associated with some positions and to point out that when we are trying to issue a European Parliament opinion on the annual report on state aid, the Group of the Europe People’s Party tries to conduct an ideological debate in this House on state aid in which it aims to go further than anyone and to demonise all types of aid. This happened last year with the Jonckheer report, and this year, despite the more flexible position adopted by Mr Evans, it has continued to arise, perhaps in order to present the Socialists as some sort of outdated interventionists who use measures that are as damaging for the market as state aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already had the opportunity to express that state aid is a transfer of public money to private companies and, therefore, that as Socialists we should also be against it. However, we cannot deny the obvious and we should recall that the Treaty does not forbid all types of aid, so some types that are aimed at objectives such as social cohesion, regional cohesion, the environment, etc. should be permitted. If that is the case, and it is, why does the Group of the Europe People’s Party refuse to accept amendments that cover that point? The same occurs when the report insists, following the Commission’s line, that aid for coal did not serve to secure the future of the industry, but in the same paragraph they refuse to accept a sentence, also from the Commission, saying that this aid was necessary in order to mitigate the social and regional impact of the restructuring of the sector. In this respect, it is difficult for us to agree with a report which, although it reflects part of the truth, refuses to include another part of the truth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In future we must remember that there are national aid schemes, in respect of internal competition, for example, which are especially important and valuable in countries with low population densities and where distances are long. I wish to raise one issue in this regard, that of transport aid. I am thinking here of my own country, for example, where the distances are long. In the north the price of fuel is 0.2 euros higher than in southern Finland. In addition, shipments of raw materials, animal feedingstuffs and similar goods are especially important as far as internal competition is concerned and issues of major importance in order that state aids may continue to support them. They are especially significant with regard to the regional economy and employment, and I hope that in future this can be made clear, so that these aids, these internal aids, which affect regional development and the regional economy, in which transport aid is a key example, might continue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Without a properly administered competition policy, neither the European Union’s economy nor its external manifestation, in the form of the euro, will ever be able to achieve its full potential. Only a company that is competitive in the Internal Market without State aid can also be competitive in the global market. However, in shaping European competition policy we have to ensure that it does not limit the opportunities for companies to succeed in the wider, global economy as well. As Mrs Riis-Jørgensen quite rightly emphasises in her report and speech, there is a danger, particularly with regard to the small Member States, that too narrow a concept of the market is used to define a dominant market position, which makes it harder for companies in small Member States to become sufficiently large players in the area of global competition. Besides, a dominant market position is not even a problem unless there is evidence that this position is being abused. Only if the dominant market position leads to adversity with regard to consumers and competitors must we tackle the situation using stringent measures, as you, Mr Monti, have done. As Mrs Riis-Jørgensen states in point 15 of her report, we have to focus on the harm caused as a result of measures restricting competition, and not so much on what sort of economic players are involved. Special account must be taken of the position of small and medium-sized enterprises. Small-scale State aid might be more harmful to an SME than people think if the market is a small one. For that reason it is good that this report of Mrs Riis-Jørgensen’s also emphasises the importance of this.</p>
<p class="contents">In his report, my colleague, Mr Evans, thanks you, Mr Monti, for having got to grips with the issue of State aid policy. Massive amounts of State aid are still a problem in many sectors. Although State aid may, on the surface, seem a good solution, when viewed in the longer term it very rarely produces lasting positive results. I certainly do not want to condemn all State aid. There is also aid that is necessary, as laid down the Treaties. In the long run, however, levels of State aid will have to fall. State aids lead to the postponement of inevitable structural change, to the distortion of competition, and breed inefficiency. In a sense, State aids prop up Potemkin villages, which at some stage will come crashing down. Then it is the private consumer and the taxpayer who foot the bill. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Hearing him deny the fact that state aid was reduced in the period 1994-1998, even though the Commission itself acknowledges this reduction, is already bizarre, to say the least. It is all the more serious, however, to see him, in an almost obsessive way, stressing the exceptional nature of state aid, even though the Treaty itself provides for the use of such aid in order to achieve the objectives set by the Treaties, such as in matters of the environment or social cohesion, and even though the European Commission itself recognises that some policies cannot be sustained solely by market forces. These, I feel, are adequate reasons for me not to support the report as it stands.</p>
<p class="contents">And, even if I can relate to the demands for increased transparency on the subject of state aid, and for Parliament to be kept informed with regard to the monitoring of aid approved by the Commission, I shall nonetheless continue to argue in favour of maintaining state aid in order to develop social cohesion, research, innovation, environmental protection, in order to compensate for shortfalls in the market, in order to promote European competitiveness in the world, in order to combat the fraudulent machinations of competing countries, such as Korea in the sphere of shipbuilding. Let me add that state aid must be supervised strictly according to the terms of the treaties and not in accordance with the prevailing liberal ideology.</p>
<p class="contents">Between the omnipresent State, which no one wants any more, and the completely absent State, which is nothing more than a modern-day law of the jungle, this concept which many term the European social model forces us to continually seek a balance between those things that can be governed by the market and those which public authorities have a duty to regulate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore particularly apt to acknowledge three things in this debate. Firstly, the fact that a European Charter of Fundamental Rights has now been drafted, Article 16 of which establishes the right to entrepreneurial freedom. Of course, this right demands strict competition law, because only this will guarantee fair competition. It protects consumers and investors.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is only right that we should acknowledge the highly commendable book by Karel van Miert, which tells us about the means employed by entrepreneurs to bring pressure to bear on other entrepreneurs. Thirdly therefore, I would like to congratulate the Commission and its staff on the actions and decisions they have taken in the field of competition law, previously under Karel van Miert and now under your overall control, Professor Monti.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, you have reworked a communication on services of general interest and set out the legal situation once again. This statement contains three important messages. Firstly, the Member States have the right to define everything that belongs under this heading. Secondly, the Member States have the right to inject supplementary funding if it would otherwise be impossible to maintain these activities. And thirdly – and this is highly relevant to this debate – there must of course be no areas which are exempt from competition law. It is therefore possible to see why renationalisation would spell trouble. It must not annul the general validity of Community law. Hence those articles in the motions for resolutions which point to this fact, including the need for transparency, are particularly valuable.</p>
<p class="contents">Professor Monti, I would like to make a suggestion in this respect. You really ought to clarify, at an earlier stage, that start-up aid – the administration of which varies substantially from Member State to Member State, in the sphere of renewable energies for example – will enjoy confidentiality protection, at least for the duration of its lifetime, even if, in the meantime – which is what I am hoping will happen – the Union as a whole upgrades its support measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, I would like to welcome the work done by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, with whom I have had an excellent and constructive relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">And obviously, Mr President, although my opinion refers to the Commission’s 29th report on competition policy, it is inevitable at such a time that we will look to the past, but for no other reason than in order to learn for the future. It has been said – and I am only going to pick up on what has been said so far – that competition is presently the big word in our society, it is the great catalyst for the development of our society, particularly of our European society.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, we see that industry entered into competition following the Treaty of Rome, that this competition was also extended to services on the basis of the single market and that, with the euro, it extended to financial services. We see that now, driven by international competition and by the new technologies, the large telecommunications sector is being dealt with. Finally, even royalty sectors, the real enclaves of sovereignty, of State royalty activities, are coming under competition policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, we need to recognise that, with Member States that are ceasing to be producers and becoming regulators, the Commission policy needs to change, and in this sense, this report is part of that important development.</p>
<p class="contents">In its opinion, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market did nothing more than highlight something which has been said and repeated: that we need clear rules, because this is the only way of knowing what the rules of play are. We cannot leave everything to the market with no regulation at all. What we need are clear rules and – I stress – rules that are of a sufficient level or category. In any event, interpretations or interpretative communications are no good.</p>
<p class="contents">And also, of course, that the Commission’s policy, which we welcome and support in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, should not be shaped, in this process of decentralisation, to the detriment of small and medium-sized businesses, to the detriment of the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end with a phrase from John Rawls, the philosopher of law: inequalities are always justified when they increase the level of the system and support the weakest without affecting fundamental rights. Commissioner, knowing how far this goes in the universal service, in public service, is the great challenge for the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Monti, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Parliament in general for the great interest that it has once again displayed in matters of competition. Mr heartfelt thanks to Mrs Riis-Jørgensen for her valuable contribution as rapporteur of the XXIXth report on competition policy. A big thank you to Mr Evans as well, for his excellent report on the rules governing State aid to the steel industry and on the eighth survey on State aid in the European Union. All three reports assume considerable importance in the light of the efforts the Commission has made to increase the transparency of its competition policy and to explain what it is doing to the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of explaining competition policy, I would like to say that I am extremely pleased with the success of the first two European Competition Days, which were held in Lisbon on 9 June and in Paris on 17 October this year. The idea was conceived in this Parliament and developed by Parliament and the Commission. My feeling is that, together, we are making progress in helping the citizens to understand this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that I fully agree with much of what has been said and with very many of the points contained in the resolutions. Mr President, in the time available to me, I would like to focus on the following three points: the modernisation of Community competition law, the practical application of competition rules in 1999 and State aid.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of modernisation, I will attempt, within the constraints imposed, to respond to some of the extremely interesting points which have been raised. The annual report on competition policy emphasises the need to modernise the legislative and interpretative framework of Community competition law in the areas of both monopolies and State aid. I will not go into the details of the reform projects which have recently been completed or are still being developed, for they have already been the subject of a specific consultation process between the Commission and Parliament, or will be in the future, in the constructive dialogue which is so valuable.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to State aid, in my opinion, the entry into force, in 1999, of the Rules of Procedure was a considerable step forward. They increase transparency and establish the deadlines for adopting the decisions on State aid. As far as monopolies are concerned, the Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation on the matter on 27 September last. A great many observations made by Parliament during consultation over the White Paper were taken into account even as early as at the stage of drawing up the proposal. Particular attention was paid to the concerns expressed by Parliament regarding renationalisation and legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to assure Mrs Palacio, Mr Karas and the other Members who spoke on these points that the regulation takes their concerns into ample consideration. I am now waiting for the commencement of the second stage of dialogue between our two institutions on these legislative proposals and I am sure that it will be as constructive as the first stage.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, on 9 and 10 November, the Commission and Parliament are jointly organising a conference on this reform in Freiburg, a conference proposed for the first time precisely in your resolution on the White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is the application of the competition rules during 1999. In the year in question, there were an unusually large number of cases requiring the use of considerable resources and which were closed by formal decisions. One of the things I appreciate is your call for an increase in human resources. The Commission has continued to intervene resolutely, particularly where cartels and abuse of a dominating position are concerned. As in the debate on mergers, since time is limited and I prefer to attempt to answer some of the specific questions, I will not mention the major – albeit numerous – interventions we have made.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is State aid. I am happy to note the support which Parliament continues to lend us in relation to the eighth survey too. I welcome Parliament's proposals on the future development of these information tools, which will include the register and the scoreboard as well as audits. I confirm to Mr Evans and the other Members who have spoken on this subject that we will be ready to present the initial versions of the register and the scoreboard – Mrs Riis-Jørgensen also upholds this idea – before June 2001, and I am confident that transparency will be an important additional tool for the application of the legal instruments governing State aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would now like to focus on at least some of the specific points raised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Several Members – Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, Mr Schmidt, Mr Blokland and Mrs Kauppi – have posed the problem of large companies operating in relatively small countries. Could we not relax the definition of the relevant market there, when it comes to merger operations? Well, if the relevant market, on the basis of the analysis conducted, happens to be national in scope, you must realise that doing what you suggest would amount to discrimination against the consumers and customers in those national markets. What we have to work together for is to gradually establish in the marketplace the reality of a single market going beyond the national market. Otherwise we would be serving our purpose of helping competition and the consumers in a perverse way.</p>
<p class="contents">I add, in relation to the specific Volvo-Scania case that I am sure underlies many speakers’ remarks, that both companies have been able to reach solutions that make their own further international growth compatible with the protection of the interests of competition and consumers in those markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Should we introduce a panel of independent experts to assess mergers? The recourse to external expertise can be useful and already takes place in a number of cases. But the Commission should not and will not give its ultimate responsibility of taking decisions to an external body. It belongs to us. It may, on occasion, be uncomfortable, but this is our task.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the problem of one DG Competition official who resigned, I have already expressed my regret about that resignation. Further increasing the right of defence, the transparency of the procedures, including the enhanced position of the hearing officer, is something to which I am very much attached and upon which I am reflecting, taking into account several inputs including the useful ideas provided by that official before he resigned.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Korea is concerned, Mr Lamy, who will be coming here during the course of the week, will be better placed to update you on the latest developments. I can only, for my part, state my conviction that any extension of operating state aids to shipyards would not be the appropriate response to a situation that requires other types of intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Evans, I very much share your concern on the issue of state aids to financial services. We will pursue that point with determination.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rapkay, it has been extremely important for the Commission to have the support of the European Parliament in pursuit of its competition policy and I do not feel that this support may fade away. Looking at the resolutions we are discussing today, I see the Commission’s policy as very much in line with a vigorous implementation of those resolutions. In the area notably of state aids, it must not be thought that the Commission believes in a pure or ultra-liberal policy. State aids have their place but it is a fact that in many cases the concrete manifestation of state aids goes well beyond what the Treaty allows and what the guidelines allow. But believe me, I certainly see competition policy as an instrument of a social market economy. The stronger the implementation of competition the better the market tends to be. There is full scope for social aspects provided they are not mixed up in a non-transparent way with the functioning of the market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Della Vedova, the presence of public companies raises competition problems and – although it is possible and I have, of course, to confirm that the Treaty provides for neutrality with regard to private or public ownership – it is possible to intervene in the event of distortion: the instruments are those which you mentioned, the instruments on the control of State aid and on the abuse of dominant positions. You mentioned<span class="italic"> Deutsche Post</span>: for example, procedures are currently in progress at the Commission on <span class="italic">Deutsche Post </span>in respect of both these areas, and I can assure you that the Commission does not intend the Protocol annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam on public television broadcasting to create a condition preventing appropriate control of State aid on this matter as well. In this regard, and as far as State aid is concerned, I refer you to the Communication adopted by the Commission on 20 September on services of general economic interest.</p>
