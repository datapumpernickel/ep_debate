<p class="contents">The Euratom loan instrument was set up in 1977, pursuant to a Council decision. It is a mechanism enabling the Commission to award loans to help finance nuclear power stations in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, the Commission broadened the scope and the loan instrument in 1994. The intention was to contribute to financing projects aimed at improving the safety and efficiency of nuclear power stations in the aforementioned countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It was stated clearly that permanent closure of facilities was eligible for funding. The hope was that this instrument would encourage the countries concerned to undertake the necessary improvements regarding nuclear safety. The maximum Euratom contribution was set at 50% of a project’s cost.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the 1990s agreement was reached on a loan to Bulgaria and Ukraine. As the sum involved was close to the maximum permissible for Euratom loans, the Commission found it necessary to inform the Council of the need to present a proposal to raise that limit.</p>
<p class="contents">Romania recently applied for a loan. The Commission is due to consider the application this month. Should it be approved, the current limit on loans would be reached. There would be no further opportunities for finance and the Euratom instrument would cease to be operational. Consequently, it is not possible to accept any loan requests on that basis at present. Nonetheless, there are important sectors in which the instrument could be helpful to the Commission’s policy on nuclear safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the safety of eight nuclear power stations in three candidate countries is giving cause for concern. The Commission has called for their closure at the earliest possible stage of the enlargement process.</p>
<p class="contents">Another possible important measure concerns first generation nuclear reactors in Russia. The Commission could play a part in their closure. It could also help to improve the safety of a number of Russian plants where work is not proceeding to plan due to lack of funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, another project that could potentially benefit from Euratom funding involves improving the safety and efficiency of 14 plants currently operational in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">Every one of these projects concerns improving safety and facilitating the closure of unsafe power stations. If you, honourable Members, bear all these ventures in mind, you will readily understand why the Commission is calling for the Euratom mechanism to be increased by EUR 2 billion. The proposals would ensure that the countries joining the Union this year plus the remaining candidate countries could continue to apply for loans to improve safety and efficiency and also for loans to fund permanent closure following accession. Our proposals would ensure these safety projects would still be eligible for Euratom funding in an enlarged Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposal is as follows. We wish to raise the maximum level of loans, and modify the scope and the instrument. It is not, however, proposed to modify the scope of loans to Member States, as that would require changes to the Euratom treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">New investment in the Member States is not formally excluded from the proposals. Nonetheless, the Commission believes priority should be given to nuclear safety and permanent closure. The Commission will have the opportunity of assessing the individual merits of applications when it studies each of them in turn. It would be prepared to combine both proposals if agreement were reached with the Council. I would, however, encourage the House to express its support for the Commission’s general guidelines on the proposals before they are submitted to the Council. The guidelines should encourage the Council to adopt the proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Breyer (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, in November 2002, the Commission proposed that an additional EUR two billion in credit should be granted to Euratom, thus raising the amount already loaned from EUR 4 billion to EUR six billion. At the same time, because of the enlargement of the EU, the Commission changed the purpose for which the loan was made and the conditions to which it was subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Euratom loans were first set up in 1977, and the amount has since been increased five times. The last time this was done, in 1990 – when the amount was increased to EUR 4 billion – the decision was taken that the credit limit of EUR 3.8 billion had to be reached before any increase could be considered. It is unfortunate that the committee has to date had no response to its query as to how much had actually been spent. The Commission’s calculations included EUR 688 million for the completion of K2R4 in the Ukraine, although it had to admit last October that this was not the amount spent on completing these reactors and that the Ukraine would be drawing on an amount of at least EUR 175 million, and at most EUR 500 million.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it very important that we bear in mind the fact that this change in the situation regarding the K2R4 reactors is not in accordance with the 1990 resolution, especially in view of the potential legal difficulties. Even though the Council debates the amount of the Euratom loans and the use to which they are put, Parliament has not, officially and formally, been consulted about the EUR 2 billion increase.</p>
<p class="contents">This enormous increase in credit has been the subject of critical debate, and my report gives expression to the regret that Parliament has not been consulted about it or about its potentially adverse effect on the European internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">My report, moreover, calls on the Council to consult Parliament in the event of any substantial amendment to the Commission proposal, especially in view of the fact that the Commission’s proposals are combined in a single document. It is precisely because the Council is working on a single document, discussing both the amount of the loans and their conditions, that it would be most regrettable if this House were, today and tomorrow, to be giving its opinion on a document that is utterly obsolete – as will quite conceivably be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask you to revisit this subject, for it would be a waste of our institution’s time and derogatory to this House’s dignity for us to hold a debate and vote on an utterly obsolete document, one that is currently being debated in the Council in a quite different way. We in this House expect the Commission to be honest about this.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been said many times over, the Commission proposal contains two decisions, and what this means is that the Commission is taking the proposals apart, while we in this Parliament are not consulted about the increase. It also means, though, that the Commission has not incorporated in its proposals the resolutions that this House discussed in the course of the debate on the Convention’s draft for a constitution, in which we urged that the Euratom Treaty should expire in 2004, by analogy with what had happened with coal and steel. I think you should bear that in mind as well, Commissioner; Parliament has urged this on many occasions. Earlier in the debate, you yourself said that renewable energies are practically going without, so it is the case that only one source of energy receives loans of this sort.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by saying something very briefly. I am aware that what I say in my capacity as rapporteur has to reflect the position taken by the committee. In committee, there was a very close vote on the amendment from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which provides for loans to be made only for plant already in operation and only outside the European Union, to avoid competition being distorted. Quite apart from the fact that the committee rejected that only very narrowly, we must, tomorrow, be very careful to bear this issue in mind when we vote. Having only recently debated and adopted the directive on the European internal market for electricity and gas, we should not tolerate any distortions of competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is something quite tremendous and quite new, for which, Commissioner, many heartfelt thanks; Mr Linkohr knows what he is talking about when he says that the Commissioner has put her head a long way over the parapet.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the Breyer report, let me say, as the Committee on the Environment’s rapporteur and also with real conviction, that we cannot imagine this House approving these proposals in their present form. The granting of Euratom loans for new nuclear power stations cannot be accepted under any circumstances. We all know that Euratom loans support the nuclear industry in a way that distorts competition; with their more favourable interest rates and their high political risks covered, nowhere in the whole of the energy sector is any other form of investment even comparable. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has made it abundantly clear that, of the European Union’s fifteen Member States, six have never taken up the production of nuclear energy, and six have decided to abandon it, which leaves just three Member States. That is something that must be borne in mind. We have also made it very clear that the issue of the final storage of nuclear waste remains unresolved until it is resolved worldwide. We may well know where we would like depositories to be, but we will not have them for another twenty years, so the building of new nuclear power stations is simply not acceptable. Funding should be given solely to projects to improve nuclear safety and to decommission installations, and not, as the Commission proposal envisages, to plant already in use. That is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">We do, though, want to have research projects, into pilot installations for safe final storage and into nuclear plant, and we want to see these supported. The introduction of uniform and binding safety standards throughout the EU is unreservedly to be welcomed, and for that thanks are due to the Commissioner. This standard is to reflect the state of the art. I believe that we are doing much as people did in the Middle Ages, when they dumped their ordure on the streets and wondered why they got ill. In that we have no final depositories, but merrily go on producing waste, we are still in the Middle Ages. I believe in human intelligence; we should do our research, look for solutions, and only when we have them should we produce. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sometimes it seems that the meaning of the word ‘loan’ was forgotten whilst the analysis was being conducted. The other theme has been the market distortions that result from systems of financial support. How much are renewable energy sources being subsidised? Are we actually talking about loans, where every cent is paid back with interest? There has been talk of the existence of other kinds of facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Euratom loan scheme has served us Western Europeans for very many years. In recent years the benefits have been channelled mainly in the direction of the candidate countries. It is true that in the 1970s and 1980s nuclear power plants were built in Western Europe with the help of these loans. Loans for building new capacity, however, have not been used for a long time. The best example of this is funding for a new unit to be constructed in a certain country in northern Europe. Private investors were interested in building new nuclear power facilities so that a 1 600 megawatt unit would have had funding for the construction of a facility with 2 500 megawatt capacity. This is indisputable proof, if ever there was any, that Euratom loans are not needed to finance new capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">There is nothing wrong with nuclear power plants in the candidate and other Eastern European countries receiving funding in this way to improve the safety of installations. It is interesting to hear Mrs Breyer encourage the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to adopt a campaign against nuclear safety.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of the Euratom loan scheme continuing. It is important for improving standards of safety in nuclear installations in third countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that is right. If you put that in terms of kilowatt-hours, in the case of nuclear power, the amount is down in the one-thousandths, whilst, with renewable energy, we are talking about tens of cents. I am not saying that I am against it; I just want to make the proportions clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, the issue of the Euratom loans will probably boil down to the question of whether we should support nuclear power stations in the course of construction or those that are being used, on which subject the only thing I have to say is that we are indirectly supporting nuclear energy in Russia by buying more and more gas from the Russians. Russia will be unable to supply much of this gas in future unless it cuts back on gas at home, which will be replaced by electricity from coal-fired power stations and from nuclear power stations that are being built. Perhaps we should give some thought to that when we talk about a European energy strategy. Our increased use of gas does, it is true, mean that we are improving our record on CO2-emissions, but elsewhere, more CO2 is being produced from coal-burning power stations, or nuclear power is being promoted. That is something else we should bear in mind; it shows that our own energy strategy is not always consistent.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we should vote in favour of these Euratom loans, quite simply because of the improvement in safety. It was for this reason that the Council of Ministers, after Chernobyl, increased the funding for Euratom loans. I believe that the argument still holds water today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This loan has been increased about five times since it was set up in 1977 and is a thinly veiled attempt to promote the nuclear industry: whilst asking for the extension of the loan, it also changes the condition and type of project to be funded in light of the expansion of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">This is akin to Enron's creative accounting. Indeed, we could even call it fraudulent accounting practice. You will get a similar, Enron-style scandal as a result of all this. It is compounded by questions of transparency and whether the proposals are not already obsolete. In addition, questions about the distortion of the market, particularly in regard to plant construction, have been raised. I am not satisfied that these loans are for safety as opposed to plant construction purposes. Indeed, I have evidence that construction activities are taking place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That would allow both ceilings and conditions to be combined. In principle, there would not be a problem over this, provided Parliament agreed. The Council would have to give its consent, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">What is at issue here is facilitating the decommissioning of a number of power stations and improving the safety of others. Essentially, it all relates to the countries due to join the Union in four months’ time on 1 May. It also concerns the candidate countries and potentially Russia too in certain cases.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to assure Mrs Matikainen-Kallström that the European Union is currently making a great effort regarding renewable energy. It must be said that this effort has certainly intensified over the last four years. I am very proud of that, because I believe the Union has to promote renewable energy as much as possible. This does not mean it is not also bound to ensure the maximum possible nuclear safety across the European Union, as I stated just now.</p>
<p class="contents">I admit I am capable of making mistakes, as are all of those who are present or absent today. Nonetheless, I am certainly not prepared to lie or to disregard the responsibilities incumbent on us all. To mention just one such responsibility, each and every one of us is responsible for ensuring not just the safety of supply, but also maximum safety for the citizens. Further, we are all responsible for ensuring compliance with the commitments entered into under international agreements such as the Kyoto Agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
