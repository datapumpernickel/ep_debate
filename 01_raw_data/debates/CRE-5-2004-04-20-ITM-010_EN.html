<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hatzidakis (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, I must say that today's debate on the third cohesion report, for the fourth community support framework, is basically much easier than previous debates which we have held on the same matter in the European Parliament, and I think that one basic reason for this is the personal contribution to it by Commissioner Barnier, in the sense that he started the dialogue on the new 2007-2013 programming period very early, making it possible, thanks also to the assistance of the European Parliament and thanks to the fact that he also listened to the views of the European Parliament, to achieve a broad consensus on this very difficult issue. We therefore need to give him credit and to note, of course, that Commissioner Fischler, who is present here, and Commissioner Diamantopoulou helped him in this. I should also add that this endeavour was complicated by impending enlargement, with many new countries covered by the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, and by the fact that the regional policy of the European Union basically needs to be reprogrammed from its foundations.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that both the third cohesion report, as presented by the European Commission, and the position of the European Parliament clearly demonstrate the usefulness of this policy. I also think that the first message which needs to be made clear from this debate here is that the European Parliament and the European Commission are against any thoughts of renationalising this policy. This policy has European added value, it has visible results in the regions, especially in the regions which have problems, in the poorest regions, and it must continue.</p>
<p class="contents">Another thing I should like to add is that this policy, especially with enlargement coming up, must be given material support from the point of view of funding, which is why Parliament is also reiterating once again its position that funding for it cannot be below 0.46% of gross national product. Consequently, we agree with the European Commission which, in all events, has adopted a European Parliament proposal on this. The European Parliament welcomes the fact that the lion's share from the point of view of funding is going to what has been known so far as Objective 1, the 'convergence objective' as it is to be known henceforth, and we consider that the problem created in areas which fall victim to statistics needs to be addressed effectively. These areas also need to be integrated into Objective 1 and to receive substantial financial coverage and, furthermore, we consider that the areas which fall victim to statistics – and here we disagree with the European Commission – should be integrated from the point of view of state aid into the provisions of Article 87, paragraph 3a of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament also considers that it is right to simplify the approach to Objective 2 and we also consider it right that the initiatives we have known so far – Equal, Leader and Urban – are being integrated into the basic programmes of the European Union and that the only Community initiative left, as a new Objective 3 if you will, is the Interreg initiative on cross-border cooperation, which we see as an addition to cooperation and development at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say that particular importance is attached in our report to individual sectoral problems, such as the problems of rural areas, on which we accepted numerous proposals by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and of towns. As an MEP from Greece, I want to focus in particular on the problems created by permanent geographical structural disadvantages and refer to areas such as islands, mountain areas and, of course, the sparsely populated areas of northern Finland and Sweden. We consider that there should be special policies not only within the framework of regional policy, of cohesion policy, but also more generally in the other sectoral policies of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the European Commission's efforts to simply procedures with the principle of 'one fund per programme', but we shall wait to see the details and we want the role of the European Parliament from now on, especially as regards the drafting of the European Commission's strategic documents for the new programming period, to be substantial and for the European Parliament to have a right of codecision.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, my colleague Michel Barnier has been appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs of the French Republic and has consequently had to leave the Commission. Until his successor is appointed, President Prodi has asked me to look after the structural and regional policy portfolio. I therefore welcome the opportunity presented by Mr Hatzidakis’ report today to debate the principles of future policy on the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the Union. Let me also thank you, Mr Hatzidakis, for your interesting report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Third Report on Economic and Social Cohesion was adopted by the Commission on 18 February and was presented to Parliament by Mr Barnier on that same day. The presentation of that report is to be seen in the context of the proposal for the financial perspective, which we had also adopted in February before the cohesion report. The Commission is calling for a new partnership for cohesion. It must be our common will not only to build a Europe based on the common market but to build a Europe characterised both by a keener competitive edge and by more solidarity, a Europe that is more capable of achieving the aims set at Lisbon and Gothenburg, namely sustainable development and a knowledge-based economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The imminent enlargement on 1 May, which will integrate many economically weak regions into the European Union, makes it even more urgent and even more crucial that Europe should pursue a robust policy of economic, social and territorial cohesion. The Commission has made strenuous efforts to respect the wishes of the various European institutions and regional and local authorities as far as possible in its proposals for the next planning period from 2007 to 2013. The report, in other words, does not simply reflect the ideas of a single Commissioner but is the product of a comprehensive broad-based debate, to which the European Parliament has also made significant contributions. I refer in particular to the two major reports by Mr Mastorakis and Mr Pómes Ruiz which you adopted in September 2003 and to which Mr Hatzidakis also refers explicitly in his report.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the debate, particularly among the Finance Ministers and the Heads of State or Government, as to how ambitious our cohesion policy should be has only just begun. Since these deliberations will undoubtedly be difficult, the report you have presented today provides valuable backing for the sort of ambitious cohesion policy that the Commission is also proposing.</p>
<p class="contents">How specific are our proposals? Firstly, there is a convergence target for those regions with a <span class="italic">per capita </span>GDP of less than 75% of the Community average. Secondly, account is to be taken of the particular situation of the regions hit by the so-called statistical effect deriving purely from enlargement. Thirdly, the Cohesion Fund is to be integrated into both of these measures. Fourthly, a new target is to be introduced for the improvement of regional competitiveness and employment. The fifth and last proposal is that the measures for the promotion of interregional cooperation should be restructured on the basis of our experience with Interreg.</p>
<p class="contents">In general terms, I can only agree with the rapporteur when he calls for radical simplification of the administration of the cohesion funds. Here too, we have already drafted precise proposals, which we intend to pour into a legal mould in July. This applies to all areas, not just to Mr Barnier’s portfolio. For example, in the realm of rural development, for which I am responsible, we want to do some pruning too.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall press, firstly, for the creation of a single fund for rural development which would consolidate all the resources that exist at the present time. Secondly, there should be a single regulation in which all the measures for the development of rural areas are defined, and, thirdly, due priority should be assigned to rural development in the financial perspective. The same applies to the sphere of responsibility of my former colleague, Mrs Diamantopoulou, and to the portfolio for which Mr Barnier has hitherto been responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">We have reached the level at which the aim is to develop a single instrument for the planning and funding of programmes with an appropriate set of common control mechanisms. I believe that would constitute major progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with Mr Hatzidakis’ view that 0.41% of Community GDP – 0.45% if we include the resources for rural development – ought really to be regarded as a minimum for an effective cohesion policy. Mr Hatzidakis also expresses certain fears and concerns in his report. Some of these relate to the thorny issue of the definition of cohesion policy and to the system of regionally targeted state aid, to which he referred in his speech. I also have a personal interest in the question of the contribution made by rural development to a policy of compensatory regional planning, and this House can rest assured that we shall continue to focus on the necessary measures in their entirety and that, as I have said, we shall be working on specific proposals for a regulation that we can present to Parliament during the month of July. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is obvious that economic and social development, which is now geared to the notion of a knowledge-based economy, depends on overcoming the syndrome of peripherality and making full use of the regional comparative advantage, innovation and research. In order to find their way, the regions need to stop treading the traditional path and focus on the increased economic importance of new branches of industry, such as the eco-industries and cultural industries, which can provide new jobs and, at the same time, overcome geographical limitations. Economic and social cohesion requires new ideas, inventiveness and innovative methods, not just funding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also thank Mr Hatzidakis for his excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">We have specific concerns relating to the European Social Fund under the competitiveness objective. First, the wider approach to social inclusion appears not to be supported to any substantial extent. We fear that many valuable projects will be lost. We hope that there will still be room for such projects, provided that they support the employment strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, national planning of programmes could prove counterproductive to addressing regional and local circumstances and involving local stakeholders. We call on the Commission to ensure genuine decentralisation in the development and implementation of programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the disappearance of the Equal programme may lead to a loss of impetus and we wish accordingly to see a requirement for gender mainstreaming at all programming stages. Similarly, we hope for continuing availability of innovative measures as currently allowed under Article 6.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we look forward to structures that will allow us to address genuine areas of need wherever they may be located. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The biggest-ever enlargement of the European Union is about to take place, and in two weeks’ time we shall have ten more Member States. If economic and social solidarity is to be achieved, an efficient cohesion policy will be indispensable. The structural support provided by the European Union contributes substantially to the development of rural areas. The common agricultural policy alone, even with its second pillar, is not able to perform all the tasks on the agenda. For this reason, it remains essential that we have adequate resources at our disposal over and above the CAP budget.</p>
<p class="contents">We really must ensure that the rural-development programme is a sharply delineated instrument and that it is tied to the CAP and hence to active, productive agriculture. Rural areas will account for most of the territory of the Union in the enlarged Union too. I believe that rural areas must be active and appealing if they are to be capable of creating new jobs, more output and income opportunities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We pooled our efforts to defend the European Union’s principles on regional policy and territorial cohesion. I would like to thank Mr Barnier for mentioning my name, and I wish him every success at the helm of the French Foreign Ministry. I should also like to thank the former President of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Mr Hatzidakis. His excellent term as President is crowned by the report he is presenting today on economic, social and territorial cohesion in Europe. I feel it appropriate to take him back to the basics of cohesion. The latter is a long-standing principle. It can be found in the Treaties. Nowadays, we refer to territorial cohesion as well as to economic and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic cohesion may be achieved in a number of ways. It can be achieved through fiscal policy, by making those who have more pay more. Social cohesion is achieved through other methods. One of these is combating social exclusion. Another is establishing the principle of equal opportunity for all citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Territorial cohesion has long been the subject of debate. There has been much discussion of areas with permanent structural difficulties that make it difficult for them to compete in this market. It has been stated that such areas should receive aid and solidarity from the remainder, regardless of the level of their GDP. This applies to agricultural policy, as Commissioner Fischler is well aware. When we help agriculture we do not enquire whether a particular farmer is rich or poor. We simply help agriculture. We wish the whole sector to be competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">Territorial cohesion policy must be based on this approach too. Islands have to be helped. They find it difficult to compete on equal terms with large urban areas, because the latter always attract those people with the highest level of income. The sparsely populated areas of northern Europe have to be helped, as must the mountain areas. The latter need a wake-up call, to ensure the Pyrenees do not become depopulated. People living in areas with geographical difficulties must not be forced to emigrate.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, it would be appropriate to send out an appeal to the new Europe created by the accession of ten new Member States. It has to be borne in mind that our contribution to general cohesion must remain at 0.46% of GDP. Parliament and the Commission have reached agreement on this. It is incumbent of the Council to do so too.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of initiatives have been very successful. I have in mind programmes such as Equal, Leader, Urban, Interreg and especially the Cohesion Fund. To date, four countries have benefited from the latter, namely Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland. These four countries have proved that when they grow, the whole European Union grows too. It is essential to keep in mind that the extra effort needed to receive the ten new Member States should not be borne entirely by the four countries that have benefited from the Cohesion Fund so far. Solidarity is called for. We must all work together to support the newcomers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We value his work greatly. I should like this to go on record. I therefore formally endorse the statements made by previous speakers.</p>
<p class="contents">Essentially, we agree with the basic approach drafted by the Commission further to Mr Barnier’s proposal. We agree with the minimum 0.45% for the three objectives. We agree with bringing Lisbon-Gothenburg and employment under cohesion. We also agree to the College of Commissioners’ 1.24% proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur represents the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. It is regrettable that he is not prepared to defend the 1.24% proposed by the Commission. Our proposal is therefore lower than the proposal made by the College of Commissioners. I find this most disappointing. I simply cannot understand why this is the case, when we tabled so many amendments on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">There is agreement in principle with the Commission’s proposal. I should like to emphasise two key issues. The first concerns the ultra-peripheral regions. It is important to try to ensure these regions retain substantial aid, regardless of their per capita income. Seventy-five on mainland Europe does not mean the same as 75% at a distance of 3 000 km from the mainland.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to emphasise how important it is for this House to stand up for fair criteria. A case in point is the need to ensure that the statistical effect does not have a negative impact on any institution in receipt of European funding. We have argued this strongly. Indeed the College of Commissioners made a proposal along these lines for the regions. Parliament has no objections. Anyone who maintains the opposite is not speaking the truth and is sending out the message that the statistical effect cannot affect Member States reducing the Cohesion Fund either. I know of one country at 83% of average income. This is set to change to 92% because of the statistical effect. The limit is 90%.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge you to be flexible between now and when the vote is taken, Mr Hatzidakis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also want to thank the Commission for having drafted its proposal along the lines Parliament requested earlier on.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group supports the committee’s line, that there should be adequate funding for cohesion policy and reviews made of state aid policies, that there should not be any renationalisation of regional policy and that areas with permanent difficulties, islands, sparsely populated and mountainous regions, and regions subject to the statistical effect should receive special treatment. An effective regional policy, however, means that other policies have to support its aims alongside aid policies. A certain freedom is also required in regional development, for example in state subsidies, without competition necessarily becoming endangered or distorted.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that progress is being made in the simplification of administration. Let us make the Member States responsible for functioning effectively. It is especially important to maintain the good practices we have learned from the Leader, URBAN and EQUAL Community initiatives. To justify the work of the EU there is an urgent need for a certain regional approach to issues and an understanding of the user’s point of view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report largely endorses the Commission’s proposal. It does not, however, go beyond that. Essential aims for which Parliament has been campaigning are underemphasised, aims such as sustainable development or consistency between structural policy on the one hand and environmental legislation and the Commission’s environmental targets on the other. The Commissioner distinctly emphasised – and I certainly registered this – that Gothenburg ranks alongside Lisbon. I consider that very important, and I would be pleased if the Commission actually succeeded in having it enshrined in the regulation on the structural funds. To give but one example, the common policy on climate change must be a component of the future cohesion policy, and this must also be reflected in the choice of projects.</p>
<p class="contents">The increase in unemployment and emigration from disadvantaged regions must be halted. Here too, clear differentiation is essential. The regulation on the structural funds must not be organised from above – and this is particularly important, in my view – but in cooperation, on a basis of equality, with local players. Lastly, I very much hope that the Commission will really keep the Commissioner’s promise and enshrine binding rules on partnerships in the regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We owe it to his tenacity and his great powers of persuasion that we can justifiably say that the logic of a policy of mere renationalised charity confined to the poorest has not carried the day. While recognising the need to give priority to the least developed regions, this progress report and the Hatzidakis report largely agree that all the EU’s regions potentially have a need for convergence, competitiveness and cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">A policy of achieving economic, social and territorial cohesion by 2013, as required by Article 3 of the draft constitution, therefore seems within reach. This policy is part of the idea of the EU bringing old and new members together in a common project. Even on the territory of the present Union of the 15, there are still areas deserving of aid from the Structural Funds and they must still be shown such solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Structural Funds’ involvement in the French overseas departments until 2013 strikes me as generally encouraging, but I await the forthcoming report that the Commission is to adopt on the implementation of Article 299(2); this will provide greater detail on the specific funds and the action plan for the <span class="italic">grand voisinage</span>, which ought to benefit the outermost regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The battle of figures that some are beginning to use polemically in fact masks a fundamental debate about our ambitions for Europe, something which requires a constructive and rational interinstitutional dialogue. That debate cannot be confined to setting a particular ceiling for Community resources; we must calmly reach agreement on the European Project’s actual purpose. Our common objective must therefore be to commit the EU to a sustainable regional policy, as opposed to one which is strictly in response to economic circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No-one can deny the benefits funds have brought to poor communities in industrial, urban and rural areas. The Hatzidakis report and the Commission proposals prove that the Jeremiahs who say that enlargement is bad news for UK regions have got it wrong. I want to congratulate the Commission in coming forward with proposals which, in a spirit of solidarity, provide funding for those areas of the EU-15 – including the UK – that are still in need.</p>
<p class="contents">The devil will be in the detail, of course, and we still have a long way to go to agree a new round of regional aid programmes. However, this report and these proposals indicate that our poorest regions could win twice over from enlargement, with a bigger internal market and a continuation of regional aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Labour MEPs have worked closely with our regional representatives, with local councils and with trade unions to identify our priorities. We welcome proposals for the convergence fund, in particular the inclusion of so-called 'statistical effect' regions, and we hope that regions being phased out will not be left high and dry, but will find a soft financial landing.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the proposals to assist regional competitiveness in former Objective 2 areas and we look forward to hearing more details on how this will be allocated and on the indicators used to identify those areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commission to further elaborate on its proposals, as requested in the Hatzidakis report on state aid. It is important that we have equality in the provision of state aid for all convergence regions, including the statistical effect areas. We need a reform of state aids which enables more public private partnership activity in regeneration, particularly of urban areas, of derelict land sites and of buildings.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish today to endorse Mr Hatzidakis' proposal. I hope that Member States, the Commission and Parliament will now come up with a comprehensive budget and a regional aid package which will be a good deal for taxpayers and a good deal for our poorest regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will be drastically impoverished.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, following enlargement and if the financial perspective imposed by the Council for the period after 2006 remains in place and even if the financial perspective submitted by the Commission is implemented, the funds earmarked for education policy per capita in objective 1 territories will be only 50% of those applied in the Union of Fifteen. I would recall that, with the enlargement to ten new States, the population living in territories with a per capita income of less than ...% of the Community average, will rise from the current 73 million people, or 19%, to 153 million people, or 32%, of the Union of twenty-seven Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This round of enlargement will increase the population by 28% whilst GDP will increase by only 6%. For those of us who believe in the need for a Social Europe, and for me, as a Galician, this is totally unacceptable – all the more so because income in the enlargement countries stands at only 40% of the average income per inhabitant of the Fifteen and because in the current Member States there is still a clear need to maintain the Structural Funds levels of previous years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that 78% of the financial resources for the reduction of disparities and the improvement of competitiveness factors have been earmarked for the least advanced regions shows that this is a move in the right direction – away from the scattergun approach to support funding towards the targeted use of resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally right is the decision to accord equal treatment to the regions that are subject to the statistical effect in the framework of the new convergence objective. We particularly welcome this proposal, provided that it also guarantees adequate funding as envisaged in the communication from the Commission for the period after 2006. For the sake of fair treatment of the areas subject to the statistical effect in relation to the traditional Objective 1 regions, there must be no further budget cuts or dilution of support.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore wish to refer at this point to last September’s parliamentary resolution based on the Mastorakis report. The resolution not only emphasised the need to pay special attention to the level of support given to those regions suffering from the statistical effects of enlargement but also stressed that the Commission should focus the same attention on the administration of aid to these regions. Parliament voted by a large majority in favour of aid under Article 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty, and that should be taken into account. We therefore expect the Directorate-General for Competition, even before presenting the drafts for the regulation on the structural funds, to present its proposal for guidelines on regionally targeted aid, which should take due account of the parliamentary vote, for we must beware of narrowly focusing aid and support measures on the acceding countries, which would ultimately subsidise tax dumping in those countries and would only lead to job losses in the existing EU Member States as companies moved their production facilities from the West to the new Member States in the East. It would be unacceptable to invest European resources if a one-sided aid regime meant that the only return was the relocation of existing jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It remains true, though, that they also harbour many fears, and we must take those fears seriously and allay them wherever we can. Regional policy is an important means of dispelling such fears. It can and must help to prevent or eliminate inequalities, injustices and anomalies within the EU. It must not, however, encourage or sow the seeds of new injustices. For this reason, we take a similar view to that expressed by the previous speaker, Mr Berend, in opposing any European regional policy that simply induces companies to relocate. People will not understand or support a Europe that rewards companies for shifting jobs from one region and then only providing the same number of jobs elsewhere because we are subsidising the relocation.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point we have to bear in mind is that EU support funds must not be used to subsidise drastic tax cuts in recipient countries. Solidarity is a noble value, but it must be mutual, and some of us will quickly recognise that, by promoting tax dumping, we could well besawing off the branch on which we sit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to congratulate you once again on your report, Mr Hatzidakis. You must be aware that we are 99% in agreement with you. In particular, I must thank you for keeping your word and ensuring that ageing will be taken into account somehow in connection with the development of funds. It has yet to be determined exactly how this will be achieved. I see Mr Pomes Ruiz is at your side. This issue is mentioned in the latter’s report also. It appears, therefore, that you are both fully aware of what ageing and low population density can entail.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, there can be no cohesion without development. There can be no development without a productive population. There cannot be a productive population if there is low population density and ageing. Ageing is not a territorial problem. It is a horizontal problem affecting all regions of Europe. It affects all Member States too, and will become ever more significant in the years to come. It is a major contributory factor to lack of development in regions where this is the case. I therefore call on the Group of the Party of European Socialists to withdraw Amendment No 8, as this amendment could make it difficult for ageing to be taken into account as a negative factor as far as development is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is very positive to note that our Parliament accepts by an overwhelming majority firstly, that any renationalisation of regional policy would be devastating even to the very existence of the European Union, of which it is a basic connective fabric, secondly, that the so-called statistical effect of enlargement – of any enlargement – would be addressed in such a way as to ensure continuing support for the regions for which it was considered necessary before enlargement, in order not to interrupt their progress towards development, thirdly, that the special regions from the point of view of natural disadvantages will also need to receive special treatment and finally, that the cohesion policy, which is indeed an essential tool to enable the Union to achieve the Lisbon objectives, has provided important results to date.

<p class="contents">Thirdly, the sparsely populated regions in the extreme north of Sweden and Finland lose their Objective 1 status under the proposal, and this must be called into question, as their geographical disadvantages exist regardless of the situation in the rest of Europe. We must ensure that these parts of Europe obtain the aid they need.</p>

Despite the work done by our rapporteur and our committee, one crucial point is still outstanding: the amount of funding to be allocated to this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that the future expenditure ceiling should allow this policy to be strengthened after enlargement. There is a very great difference between the Commission’s proposals for 1.24% of gross domestic income (GDI) and the 1% proposed by six States, and regional policy runs the risk of being used as a balancing item for European politics.</p>
<p class="contents">We remember the commitment shown by Mr Barnier, who steadfastly opposed the six countries that want a reduced European budget. Now that Mr Barnier is a government minister, I therefore hope he will continue to show in the Council the commitment he had as Commissioner and that he will be able to get all his colleagues to change their position with regard to the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Structural Funds are in fact essential to European solidarity. The Union needs a real cohesion policy, the financial resources to implement it and therefore income equivalent to at least 1.24% of GDI. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We shall certainly endeavour to ensure that, when we formulate the specific legislative proposals we have undertaken to deliver in July, various additional points will be taken into account if possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I intend to be brief and address only a couple of points, one being the question of how we propose to deal in future with the so-called Community initiatives. The idea is that the number of these Community initiatives is to be reduced, which will naturally mean that various specific programmes, such as Leader or others, will no longer be available. This does not mean, however, that the measures covered by these programmes will no longer exist. The intention is that measures previously implemented in the framework of individual Community initiatives will be integrated into the mainstream programmes. In this way, we can ensure, for example, that the Equal programme or measures designed specifically to promote equal treatment of both sexes are given their rightful place in the main programmes. As far as the outermost regions are concerned, there are, of course, specific treaty provisions of which due account must be taken in the implementation of the relevant measures. I know that Mr Barnier always attached great importance to the task of looking after the outermost regions, and I can guarantee that they will continue to receive the same level of attention.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of the territorial aspect of state aid and the necessary definition of areas eligible for support is indeed a highly sensitive issue, and then there is the concern in some quarters that there could be difficulties in areas bordering on supported regions. The Commission will devote particular attention to this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, however, I cannot subscribe to the view expressed by one Member that our policy will lose its cohesive character after enlargement. That is quite simply untrue. Care will still be taken to ensure that the cohesion target we have set ourselves is actually achieved. Indeed there will also be more funds available for that purpose. It is not as if all the resources were to be taken from the present 15 Member States and given to the new Member States. There will be more money.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with you that we still need a European – and I emphasise European – cohesion policy. A mere financial adjustment of the type that some are seeking or have mooted will not, in my opinion, achieve our aim. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It does, however, deem 0.41% to be an acceptable minimum level for the allocation.</p>
<p class="contents">The report insists on retaining the 'expenditure target' system and on the N+2 rule, it issues warnings about industrial restructuring and relocation; it states that companies that have benefited from Community aid should not be entitled to receive new funds when they relocate, and that State aid should not be an incentive for companies to relocate. It also calls for more effective monitoring of the ways in which the Funds are used and for a more focused strategy with regard to industrial restructuring and its social impact.</p>
<p class="contents">It confirms support for regions that have suffered as a result of the ‘statistical effect’, it has adopted amendments that we tabled to eliminate the expression ‘temporary phasing-out’ and to provide phasing-out support for current Objective 1 regions; it calls for the special status of the outermost regions to be preserved and for specific programmes to be kept on, even if they are no longer in Objective 1 regions. It has adopted our proposal for regions that suffer permanent handicaps. It seeks to ensure specific proposals and suitable funding for employment as well as support for small and micro-businesses and for training, particularly for adults. We insist that the ‘statistical effect’ should be extended to the Cohesion Fund. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
