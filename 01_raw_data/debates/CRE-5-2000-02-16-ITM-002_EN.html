<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Amado,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, it is a great pleasure for me to address you for the first time on behalf of the Council presidency, particularly in view of the very important role that the European Parliament is bound to play in the near future, given the need to strengthen development policies at European Union level. The subject of the statement that I have the honour of presenting to you today, is the coherence of different Union policies with development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall, of course, give the Commission an opportunity to add to some of the observations that I shall be making. I would like to start by emphasising the need we all feel, at EU level, to reconcile the extraordinary development and progress that we have seen in many areas of life – not least because of the marked technological impetus over recent years, which has benefited people in all walks of life, throughout the world, in terms of well-being and improvements in living conditions – with the fact that, at the same time, there has been a substantial increase in the pronounced imbalances between some regions and geopolitical areas of the world. This endangers the stability of the international system and jeopardises peace. We are all therefore duty-bound to seek to match our policies better to this objective of achieving greater stability and greater balance in the various parts of our planet.</p>
<p class="contents">The consequence of all this is a reassessment of development policies in response to the globalisation of economic and financial markets. A serious imbalance in the functioning of these markets has emerged, which has of course made it necessary to make important adjustments, which in turn inevitably mean new options as regards development policies. We will therefore find ourselves on the threshold of a new model for development policies which – and I would like to stress this – will require action on our part in four essential areas:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there will be a need for more concerted action between all international players, by which I mean donors, requiring greater coordination, greater coherence and improved links between humanitarian aid and development policies; it will also require strengthening of the multilateral system and greater attention being paid to indebtedness and to financing and development problems. At the same time, however, there will have to be some changes in the framework within which those countries now receiving aid operate, particularly the need to fight corruption and to maintain democracy and good governance as fundamental principles in developing their political systems, together with a need to focus special attention on these countries’ own policies for reducing poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect of this new model for development policies relates to the need for a more integrated approach to development. This means not just an approach limited to development aid as the sole element of this policy, but a policy that also increasingly takes account of the role of other policies in the spheres of finance, trade and investment. Furthermore, this new model must respect the need for this integrated vision of development to be approached both from a global policy angle and also in the light of the various donor countries’ own policies.</p>
<p class="contents">A third aspect of this new model that I would like to emphasise is a policy aimed at achieving our objectives. Since 1995, following a concerted international effort between the main donor states, involving in particular a reflection paper produced by the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee, it has been possible to establish some important objectives by way of guidelines for development policies, both at national and international level. As you will know, the aim of these objectives is to cut poverty by 50% by 2015, by increasing compulsory schooling, by significantly reducing child mortality rates, and by implementing a raft of social welfare measures with a view to effectively achieving this objective. This would mean moving away from the situation of extreme poverty in which more than a third of the world’s population lives, and moving away from the extremely poor living conditions suffered by over a billion people. This is an extraordinary state of affairs, which certainly means that if this objective is to be achieved the international community as a whole will have to participate and intervene actively.</p>
<p class="contents">And that brings me to the fourth aspect of this new development model that I would like to emphasise. Particularly in recent years, development policies have been regarded as an increasingly global matter, and yet there is apparently a lack of strong international leadership. The concerted actions of the United Nations institutions have played an important role here, as has the Bretton Woods system. I have in mind, in particular, the important impetus given to this debate by the World Bank, especially through its Comprehensive Framework document, and by the International Monetary Fund, where, for the first time, an institution of this kind has put the problem of reducing poverty at the centre of its policy guidelines and has forged a hitherto unimaginable link, for a body of this type, between debt relief and poverty. This new role for international organisations on development issues is also a good reason for us to consider the role of the European Union in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">The Portuguese Presidency has highlighted the need for the European Union to combine its highly important international role as the main donor with a leading role – and a more active one – in this movement to reform international development policies, and to create greater scope for coordination, in particular with the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods system.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to strengthen the European Union’s role in international development policies, we believe that it is basically necessary to take three kinds of action. Firstly, we need to make the EU’s development policy more effective. As you know, an exercise was carried out in 1995 involving an overall assessment of development policies, and the results of this overall assessment exercise were presented during the German Presidency. The main conclusions emphasised the need for a more coherent EU policy and a more strategic overall EU approach to development issues. The key aspects were the need for greater coordination and greater complementarity between policies, the need for harmonisation and simplification of the present organisational framework for the Union’s present cooperation policies, the need to make the EU’s aid management more efficient and, in particular, to review its mechanisms for intervention, and also the need to reinforce the assessment system and to introduce greater transparency into the process for granting aid.</p>
<p class="contents">A second aspect worth highlighting underscores the need for EU policy and the policies of the Member States to complement each other more. It is widely known that a significant proportion of aid is today granted under the Member States’ national policies, which are not always complementary or well coordinated. A great deal of the waste and inefficiency associated with aid from the European Union and its Member States is the result of precisely this lack of coordination and complementarity between the actions of individual Member States and the proposals and actions of the European institutions. In this respect it is also absolutely vital that we should do our utmost, as soon as possible, to create stronger mechanisms for ensuring that the policies adopted by the Member States and European Union policies are coordinated and complementary.</p>
<p class="contents">The third aspect I would like to highlight is the strengthening and coherence of EU policies, the central theme of today’s debate. Firstly, we are all aware that it is not enough just to improve aid conditions and that there is a need for better coordination with other European Union policies, so that development objectives can be achieved, not merely through aid and support, but also, first and foremost, through a more integrated approach to the various different policies that contribute to the objectives of development. As you know, a Council Resolution was approved, in June 1997, under which the Commission was required to present evaluation reports. The first such report was presented to the Council in May 1999, and it referred to certain aspects of policy coordination, notably in the fields of peace building, food safety, fisheries and migration. But as you will also be aware, we are waiting for a Commission communication on coherence, together with the communication on development policy. Over the coming months, that is to say during the Portuguese Presidency, this debate will of course be enriched by the contributions that the Commission has undertaken to present to us.</p>
<p class="contents">It is evident that the scope for achieving coherence between policies will always be limited and it is only natural for there to be some contradictions between policies as these are means of balancing and weighting the contradictory and conflicting interests within the European Union. Only in this way is it possible to manage some degree of contradiction between policies. But, quite apart from this, we would like to emphasise that, if we are to strengthen the coherence of European Union policies in the present circumstances and in the economic situation currently facing the Union, we need to give serious consideration to various issues associated with the dynamics of the European Union itself. By this I mean, of course, the internal dynamics of the European Union. We know that the European Union has its own dynamics, which stem above all from the Treaty of Amsterdam, which has reinforced its political dimension. This inevitably has important consequences for the proposal for coherence in policies relating to development. We will also have to await the outcome of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference as regards enlargement, to see to what extent the internal dynamics of the European Union are directed towards increasing the coherence of its policies, and, as regards development in particular, to what extent it also contributes to appropriate institutional arrangements for achieving this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect that we need to consider, in relation to the coherence of policies, is development policy in the context of the Union’s foreign policy. We know that the Union has entered a new era as regards its foreign policy, and we know that, with the creation of the High Representative, of the Rapid Reaction Force and of the military crisis management capacity, there is a whole trend towards confirming the status of the European Union that we should not underestimate when we consider the role of development policies. We also know that there are issues associated with political dialogue, with the adoption of common positions or joint actions, with the preparation of joint strategies, with preventive diplomacy, and with the development of regional capacity for crisis prevention and management. There can be no doubt that implementing and developing all these aspects will inevitably make an important contribution to strengthening the role of development policies in the context of the European Union’s foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said that, in approaching development policy in the context of foreign policy, the European Union is bound to go down the same road as many Member States have done with their own development policies in the context of their individual foreign policies. The success of this is bound to involve a need to strengthen decision-making mechanisms and institutional structures relating to the common foreign and security policy, so as to secure better coordination between instruments of development policy and instruments of foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, we are convinced that we need to move away from the post­colonial model towards to a truly European model of development aid. I say this because we know that, in Europe, development policy has been very much shaped by the policies of certain Member States, in view of the post-colonial concerns of those states.</p>
<p class="contents">The third aspect that needs to be considered is European Union policy and Member States’ policy. Coherence of policies at European level certainly means better coordination of Member States’ policies with the European Union’s development policy. If we do not establish improved mechanisms to ensure coherence between national policies, it will certainly be more difficult to deliberate against a background of greater coherence in European Union development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the fourth and final aspect that I would like to draw to your attention, regarding development policy, is, of course, the Development Council. There have been discussions, especially in recent months, about the role the Development Council could play in relation to EU policies. As you know, there is a glaring difference between the status of development policies and other EU policies – you only have to look at the difficult circumstances surrounding the EDF’s financing, or rather lack of financing. It is difficult to imagine achieving greater coherence in the European Union’s policies without the Development Council playing a more active and interventionist role in relation to political decisions, which clearly come under the development banner and which are being dealt with in other Councils, in other decision-making forums, ranging from the Agriculture and Fisheries Councils to the Environment Council. Up to now, the Development Council has not had any opportunity to make its voice heard or to intervene in relation to these decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">So without a more active role for the Development Council in the overall coordination of political decision making which, although it directly impacts on the European Union’s development policy, is largely being dealt with outside this decision-making forum, it will certainly be difficult to establish a more coherent European Union policy on development objectives. The views of the European Parliament on this issue too, will certainly be both timely and welcome.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span><span class="bold">.</span> – Let me start by saying something about the successfully concluded negotiations between the EU and ACP countries. I would like to remark that it was a very positive experience taking part in those negotiations. I saw Member States working as a team, which was indeed a wonderful experience.</p>
<p class="contents">There was also deep satisfaction on both sides when this was over, not just because it was over, but because we all knew that we had achieved something together, the EU and the 71 ACP countries. That is something that the world needs and is a very good signal in the framework of the whole discussion of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall outline some of the major innovations in the new agreement. We explicitly address corruption; we establish a framework for dealing with the problem of immigration for the first time ever. We promote participatory approaches, we ensure the consultation of civil society on the reforms and policies to be supported by the EU. We refocus development policies on poverty reduction strategies. We base the allocation of funds not only on an assessment of each country's needs, but also of its policy performance. We create an investment facility to support the development of the private sector. We rationalise instruments and introduce a new system of rolling programming, allowing the Community and the beneficiary country to regularly adjust their cooperation programme. We decentralise administrative and, in some cases, financial responsibilities to local level with the aim of making cooperation more effective. We improve the policy framework for trade and investment development. We enhance cooperation in all areas important to trade, including new issues such as labour standards and the linkages between environment and trade. After Seattle I am sure you will appreciate the significance of these agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to some of the more important points. Firstly the agreement on political issues. The new agreement will entail a firm commitment on both sides to good governance as a fundamental and positive element of the partnership, a subject for regular dialogue in an area which enjoys active Community support. Secondly, a new procedure has been drawn up for cases of violations of human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law. In comparison with the current procedure, the new one puts more emphasis on the responsibility of the state concerned and allows for greater flexibility in the consultation process, with a view to conducting an effective dialogue leading to measures to be taken to redress the situation. In cases of special urgency involving serious violations of one of these essential elements, measures will be taken immediately and the other party will be notified.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the EU and the ACP have also agreed on a new specific procedure to be launched in serious cases of corruption. This is a real innovation, both in the EU/ACP context and in international relations in general. This procedure will be applied, not only in cases of corruption involving EDF money, but also more widely in any country where the EC is financially involved and where corruption constitutes an obstacle to development. It is thus not confined to EC activities. This is a very important aspect, taking into account the fundability of public finances. By adopting such a provision in the partnership agreement, the EU and the ACP States are together sending a clear and positive signal that will doubtless be appreciated by European taxpayers and hopefully also by European investors.</p>
<p class="contents">Another new theme in the ACP-EU agreement is migration. We have reached a balanced agreement on cooperation in this area. This new dimension to the partnership agreement reflects the guidelines espoused by the EU in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam and with the conclusions of the European Council in Tampere in Finland in October 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union undertakes to develop and implement an immigration and asylum policy founded on the principle of partnership with the originating countries and regions. The agreement concluded with the ACP countries paves the way for new initiatives, in particular on the rights of third country citizens within the EU, and measures facilitating their integration. We also agreed on provisions to address questions related to illegal immigration. The EU and the ACP states will initiate the process aimed ultimately at defining, within a framework to be negotiated with each and every ACP country, the ways and means of repatriating immigrants illegally present on the territories of each party. This also covers persons from third countries and stateless persons.</p>
<p class="contents">These very innovative approaches provide a good opportunity to improve governance. The agreement also offers a good framework to underpin the mutually reinforcing effects of trade cooperation and development aid. We have agreed on a process to establish new trading arrangements that will pursue trade liberalisation between the parties and to formulate provisions on trade-related matters. We have met the concerns of the ACP states as far as the time-frame of the trade negotiations is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Negotiations will start no later than 2002. This two-year preparatory period will be used to strengthen regional integration processes and the ACP countries’ capacity to conduct trade negotiations. A six-year period is programmed for these negotiations. We will take account of the economic and social constraints of the ACP countries in two ways: firstly, through human and social development policies to accompany economic and trade reforms and, secondly, by helping the ACP states to become active players in the international economic and trade system through capacity-building and cooperation in multilateral forums.</p>
<p class="contents">This approach will lead us to a fully WTO compatible regime. Economic operators will be more inclined to establish closer relations with their ACP partners. Domestic and foreign investment will grow and more know-how and technology will be transferred, all of which will boost the ACP countries’ competitiveness and ease their gradual integration into the world economy. In addition, the agreements with the EU will act as an anchor. They will lock in the economic reforms, just as national and economic reforms will be stabilised by both parties’ commitments under the agreements. The rationale behind this new approach is also based on the idea that open trade policies combined with social development policies will lead to economic growth and poverty reduction.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important aspect is the improvement of the EU’s trade regime for all least-developed countries, 39 of which are actually in the ACP group. This process will take place in the coming five years so that, by 2005, the LDCs’ exporters will have free access for essentially all their products on the EU market.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the volume of the next EDF, the EU has made its financial proposal. It is based on the principle of reconciling the need to maintain a substantial amount of financial resources in a period of limited official development assistance budgets with the need to make Community aid more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Today about EUR 9.5 billion of previous EDF resources are uncommitted. The EU is committed to mobilising these remaining balances, plus the new EDF resources, over a seven-year period, that is to say, before the entry into force of the next financial protocol. This will enable the Community to substantially increase annual flows of commitments and payments during this period. We are thus not moving into a period in the coming years of reduced activity, we are moving into a period of increased activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a commitment entails an in-depth reform of procedures and implementation modalities on both sides. There is a very real link between the reform process in the Commission as such, and our ability to deliver on the ground which is the basis of the deal with the ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to our development policy, I would say that the global context has changed drastically. The marginalisation of many economies, increased poverty in the world, the need for better management of environmental interdependence, the destabilising effects of migration and the worrying consequences of armed conflicts and pandemic diseases are all major concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">It is within this changing global framework that we have to position ourselves. Fortunately evaluations of EC aid give us a meaningful tool to improve what we are doing and also hopefully to meet the challenges I have just mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">To focus on the input coming from the evaluations, I would mention the following problems: the objections of Community policy are too numerous and too vague and this adversely affects coherence. This is due to the complexity of our own structures, but also to very real inconsistencies between sector policies and interests in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has an aid system that is too complex and fragmented in terms of instruments, procedures and institutional mechanisms. Often policies are more determined by the instruments available, than by policy objectives and clearly-defined priorities. Human resources are too thin in relation to the volume of aid that we are supposed to manage. On average, to manage $US 10 million of aid there are 2.9 staff at the Commission, compared with 4.3 at the World Bank and between 4 and 9 in major Member States. This is a real problem: there are too many different financial instruments, each with its own characteristics and in particular a series of different budget headings. This is difficult to reconcile with the needs of an effective management system.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to face and solve these problems the Community needs to engage in an effective dialogue with Member States and Parliament. It is absolutely crucial that we tackle the coherence issue in a realistic and pragmatic way, which means holding the debate in the appropriate institutional framework, that is, the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The lack of concerted action among the 15 Member States themselves and between them and the Community also needs to be addressed. By focusing the Community's development policy on internationally agreed targets and strategies we will pave the way for better complementarity with the Member States. This is very much the line also just presented by Minister Amado. When we talk policies nowadays, we engage in a process of convergence. This is part of the solution.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in the process of formulating new policy guidelines and we need to identify priority areas for Community action. Everything has become more and more complex. This is also true of development cooperation. No single donor is in a position to address the whole spectrum of themes, ranging from macro-economic issues to the regulatory framework or from sectoral policies to a variety of new cross-cutting themes such as gender, environment, good governance and institutional reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to find flexible mechanisms that accommodate a division of labour according to the expertise and capacity of the various donors in each developing country. This should be done at Member State level and should lead to the formulation of sector policies for Community action. This is where we want to go.</p>
<p class="contents">To identify the EC's priority areas of support, account has to be taken of the Community's specific features in relation to the Member States and to international institutions. I will mention just a few: our ability to combine development policy with trade policy and to ensure synergies between aid and economic cooperation; our neutrality and defence of overall Community interests; the fact that we represent a critical mass and are able to do relatively large jobs compared to what individual Member States can normally do. Also, our presence on the ground: basically, I find the biggest value we represent is the very fact that being a successful regional cooperation endeavour ourselves, we are seen as a neutral, welcome partner for this experiment world-wide – something which nobody else can claim to be.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital to make Community policy more effective and to develop a more operational strategic framework. It is this dual challenge that the Commission has to take up, by framing in the months ahead a proposal for a general policy statement. We will launch a broad and open consultation process in order to get the views of all the different parties interested. I see the process not quite but almost as important as the content and we will put all our resources into participating actively and we invite everybody to participate.</p>
<p class="contents">Parallel to this we have also embarked on the process of improving coherence and clarifying and bringing to the surface and into the open the real or imaginary problems we are having in this respect. This will be an ongoing process which I see as a kind of continued quality control effort and I invite Parliament to participate in this ongoing effort to improve the coherence of what we are doing.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maij-Weggen (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Amado and Mr Nielson. I am pleased that Mr Amado talked about the EDF. The problem, however, should not be sought within this Parliament or the Commission; it is the Council that needs to make a decision on the EDF budget. This sermon, therefore, really belongs in the Council. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I thank Mr Nielson. He has talked extensively about the new Lomé Convention, although this is not really the topic of this morning’s meeting. We want to talk about coherence. This is the topic. Ever since the early nineties, the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council of Ministers have recognised that this coherence of European policy is leaves something to be desired, especially in the field of development cooperation and in other EU policies. </p>
<p class="contents">This problem has been highlighted on several occasions, to whit in 1992, in 1995 and 1997. The examples are all quoted in a resolution which lies before us. I have raised questions regarding this issue for years now. In fact, the obligation for coherence of policy was even included in the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997. In 1998, it was agreed that the European Commission should publish an annual report which highlights any improvements. But what have we seen since then? Fine words, as is the case again today, but no report. It is too crazy for words, really. It is a fact that we are dealing with contradictory policy. Time and time again, good intentions are formulated but nothing is implemented. It is, therefore, with good reason that we bring this up here today. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to give you a few examples to illustrate these contradictions. A number of developing countries grow sugar cane for sugar production. In the Union, sugar is produced from sugar beet. In order to prevent this cheap sugar from the developing countries from competing with the more expensive EU sugar, a considerable import levy is imposed on cane sugar. The result is that the export of cane sugar from the relevant countries to the Union is significantly restricted. At the same time, we give these countries an enormous amount of development aid. A Minister from one of the Caribbean islands which produce sugar cane once told me: If you just allowed our sugar access to the European Union, we would not need your development aid at all. </p>
<p class="contents">Another example is cacao. The European Union intends to permit 5% of alternative fats in chocolate in order to harmonise the internal market. This could just as well be 0% – the internal market would still be harmonised. By pitching the percentage level at 5%, which is now likely to be the case, it is almost certain that hundreds of thousands of small cacao farmers in developing countries will be put at a disadvantage. It seems to be heading this way nevertheless. What are we actually doing then? This is also typical of a policy which makes citizens wonder what Brussels actually does? It seems that European industry is more important here than our own principles, our own coherences and the interests of the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also shocking examples in terms of sanctions and embargoes. Why institute an oil boycott against Haiti and not against Burma, where an elected President is imprisoned, parliament has been sent home and some of the MPs have been put in jail or even murdered? Why not institute an oil boycott against Sudan, where a great deal of the fighting is still going on, with weapons, no less, funded by the oil companies which are based in the same areas where the refugees are? The inconsistency is astonishing. </p>
<p class="contents">Here too, Mr Nielson mentioned another good example regarding the new Lomé Convention. If the new Lomé Convention is simply put into operation, without eradicating all these inconsistencies from the policy, the policy will then be built on shifting sands – to use a biblical expression. The Council has quoted examples of inconsistency time after time: in agriculture, commerce, in conflict prevention, in the peace operations, in the fisheries sector, migration and environment. Mr Nielson, what we are waiting for is a good report on these inconsistencies and a number of specific proposals to eliminate these from the policy. Once again, all your fine examples, your marvellous policy – and I include the Secretary of State in this – will otherwise be built on shifting sands and will not really come off the ground. This is also at the request of the citizens. We have been saying this ourselves since back in 1992: this is the topic of this debate. I hope the message strikes home and I really hope that you will soon produce a report which contains measures. </p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van den Berg (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following the same line as Mrs Maij-Weggen, I believe that we have a number of representatives here who all feel passionate about contributing to this debate. The topic touches the very core of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me begin by specifying precisely what we are debating. Article 178, Title XX of the consolidated Treaties of the European Union reads as follows: “The Community shall take account of the objectives referred to in Article 177 in the policies that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries”. What are the objectives which each EU policy needs to take into account? Article 177 specifies these objectives as “sustainable economic and social development of the developing countries, and more particularly the most disadvantaged among them”, the “smooth and gradual integration of the developing countries into the world economy and the campaign against poverty in the developing countries”. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, these are no arbitrary objectives. These are articles, statutory articles, which form part of the European <span class="italic">acquis</span> established by law with which the European institutions and Member States must comply. Every statutory article should, of course, not just be judged on its regularity, but also on the importance of its contents. </p>
<p class="contents">I am of the opinion – and luckily I am not alone in this – that the principle of policy coherence is essential to every government which aims to be a credible servant of its citizens. The interests of the citizens are only served by a credible and reliable government. This is important if the government wants to gain the trust of society, and also important from the point of view of effectiveness, for coherence is required in order to use the restricted means efficiently. </p>
<p class="contents">We should not make reality out to be more rose-tinted than it really is. Reality is obstinate. It is up to the government to deal with this fact in a transparent and open manner, without any backhandedness. The government is obliged to show up any of its dilemmas, and to show where, when and why, problems occur with coherence of policy, rather than sweeping it all under the carpet.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are talking about here today is not an issue which can be toyed with at leisure. Poverty in the third world is a harrowing problem that demands urgent attention. It is only natural that we in Parliament guard the interests of our citizens, but it is also in the interest of our citizens to live in a stable, international environment, in which the goal of human safety is pursued. This is a moral interest, a safety interest and is, ultimately, even in the interest of our economy. </p>
<p class="contents">In whose interest is it really if European taxpayers’ money is used to support economic development in Namibia, and if, at the same time, the economic activity of poor cattle farmers in the same country is drastically undercut by rigorous export subsidies, financed by the same tax payers? We are all acting as if this is not really happening, but we all know that it is. </p>
<p class="contents">It is not our task as MEPs to adopt an ostrich policy and bury our heads in the sand. The general interest of policy coherence is, therefore, a responsibility of the Commission as a whole, of the Council, and of the European Parliament. This responsibility cannot only be borne by the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, however much we like to see him or hear him talk, or by the Development Council or the parliamentary Committee on Development and Cooperation. What we need here is an integral approach. After the lucid and closely reasoned explanation of this approach presented by both Mr Amado and Mr Nielson, I would like to note that we are very much looking forward to the proposals, not only by Mr Nielson, but by the entire Commission, in order to make the policy coherent as a whole. </p>
<p class="contents">This is why we urge the Commission, in this sharp and clear resolution, to develop specific instruments. We need to pinpoint, and draw up an inventory of, the problem areas for coherence. We need to make it evident which problems we are solving and which we have not yet solved. This is why I advocate a monitoring centre for coherence which makes this apparent. This is why we need to set up inter-service task groups in the Commission, in the Council and in Parliament which can police the attainment of coherence. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if our neighbour’s roof is leaking, we can lend him pots and pans to collect the water, but it is, of course, more effective to help him plug the leak in the roof. The crisis in last year’s Commission has been solved today, but the Commission must now produce a policy in which we get full support for a coherent approach, which, no doubt, the entire Parliament will soon demand in the resolution. </p>
<p class="contents">I would wish the Commissioner all the best in his battle within the Commission and wish Mr Amado the same within the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rod (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, let us be clear from the outset: when it comes to cooperation, coherence is far from being the watchword. The Treaties provide for the European Union to help developing countries to develop but, as the previous speakers have explained so well, there are various distortions to these declarations.</p>
<p class="contents">The first area of incoherence is the lack of consultation between the Union and the Member States on individual cooperation policies. This gives rise to serious malfunctions, because some Community programmes duplicate national programmes, whereas they might have helped other projects about which nothing is done. And let us not forget that the de facto neo-colonial policy of certain Member States does nothing to help the countries which they are supposedly helping to develop.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area of incoherence is aid to authoritarian regimes. We state that good governance and an end to corruption are mandatory but we continue to pour hundreds of thousands of euros into Swiss bank accounts via the portfolios of a number of Heads of State.</p>
<p class="contents">The third area of incoherence is human rights. We say that we want to protect human rights. We encourage developing countries to respect human rights. We even adopt numerous resolutions condemning every violation of human rights. We ally ourselves with demonstrations and international campaigns. And yet, at the same time, we allow the arms trade to proliferate and do not even attempt to limit the trade in the most atrocious forms of arms such as anti-personnel mines. Nor do we do much to really prevent human rights violations.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth area of incoherence in the European Union’s cooperation policy is this: how do you expect to help development by pillaging the natural resources of the people you are helping. The European Union must leave fish for local fishermen to feed local populations instead of systematically destroying maritime resources through intensive fisheries. We must leave raw materials so that local manufacturers can process them. I will not even mention oil; we are all aware of the policy of groups such as Elf and Total in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, and this will perhaps soon be the fifth area of incoherence, we demand respect for biodiversity, for example so that everyone can produce from their own seeds and preserve the richness of nature; but at the same time, and this was apparent during recent negotiations, we force ACP countries to sign TRIPS agreements. These agreements risk being extended to living organisms, which would mean the death of biodiversity and the return of de facto slavery for small-scale farmers in the south, at the hands of the multinationals.</p>
<p class="contents">And yet, and this is the sixth area of incoherence, we do not defend the application of the current Treaties. On the one hand, we vote for a budget line for the fight against AIDS and, on the other hand, we do nothing to ensure compliance with mandatory licences within the framework of the very same TRIPS, despite the fact that this would allow developing countries to produce their own medicines and halt the AIDS massacre.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, during the WTO negotiations, at a time when, to quote the second paragraph of the Schwaiger report, “the current trade liberalisation process has not yet brought significant benefits for large parts of the population of developing countries, especially the poor”, the European Union continues to defend the liberalisation of trade and intends to put an end to the system of favouring ACP countries, albeit with a transitional period of several years, instead of strengthening it, especially for the poorest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The eighth area of incoherence is of a political and practical nature. We are always saying think globally, act locally. And yet we disregard local development agencies and prefer to negotiate with national governments and subsidise northern NGOs at the expense of local programmes and southern NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">And what about agriculture and the environment? Still more problems, still more areas of incoherence which I might have highlighted, not to mention research, emigration or health. In short, we claim that we want to help developing countries and, at the same time, we encourage the liberalisation of trade, which we acknowledge runs counter to that very objective. I say it again, the European Union’s cooperation and development policy is not coherent. and on behalf of the Green Group I call on Parliament, the institutions and the Commission to make a joint effort, at long last, to put some coherence into our policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Seattle was a failure, and north-south relations were in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. The meeting held in that North American city demonstrated that globalisation is having seriously unbalanced and negative effects on poorer countries. The Tenth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development is being held right now in Bangkok, and is suffering the consequences of that failure. In the meantime, however, as has already been mentioned, the negotiations on the future of the Lomé Convention have been concluded. This goes to show just how topical this subject is. We could also add to the list the next EU-OAU summit which it has finally been agreed to hold in Cairo in April.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would also like to add that any analysis, no matter how superficial, inevitably leads us to the conclusion that something – or even a great deal – is amiss with north-south relations, including those between the European Union and the less developed countries. You only have to realise that the category of “least developed countries” has grown from 25 to 48 countries over the last 30 years, and now represents 13% of the world’s population, yet this category only accounts for 0.4% of world exports and 0.6% of world imports or be aware of the unfortunate fact that official development aid from rich countries has fallen by around 23% since 1990. Furthermore, the recent Community budget cuts in this area, for the present financial year, are part of this trend, as well as sending an undesirable and misguided political message.</p>
<p class="contents">Michel Camdessus, a fair man who is still director of the International Monetary Fund, said in his speech at the opening of the UNCTAD conference, and I am now quoting, that the international community gives with one hand and takes away with the other. He was of course talking about the aid granted by developed countries to less developed countries. It may seem ironic that this statement should come from someone in his position, but he did indeed say this, and I heard it with my own ears. This comment certainly seems to me to reflect the current situation, and I accordingly wish to stress that it is vital to rethink north-south relations and break the mould. In particular, we need to reconsider the role of the European Union in this area, as I am certain that one of the Union’s strategic objectives must be to promote a new and more equitable world order. It is therefore essential to review the present process of globalisation, bearing in mind the underlying approach and dominant interests on which it is based, and to consider the enormous and damaging effect that it is having on the less developed countries, particularly in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">A new agreement has been reached with the ACP countries. This is a positive development in itself, especially given the pressures to terminate it and the fact that various Member States did not wish it to continue. We will have an opportunity in due course to consider the exact terms of this agreement in greater depth, but meanwhile there is no doubt that the European negotiators were more timid and failed to live up to the proposals that we formulated at the appropriate time, even if the new agreement does include some new and innovative points. Certain politically important aspects of the new partnership agreement will have contributed to these. This was without a doubt the result of a complex negotiating process in which both parties made major concessions, and this is certainly true of the European Union, especially in the field of good governance and trade. But it was above all the result of a stronger ACP group, which obviously found new courage following the events in Seattle. I particularly wish to stress that a new way of looking at these issues seems to be emerging, especially as regards trade, and it is certainly necessary to tackle this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we need to go further in our development aid policies towards developing countries. I have in mind budgetary and financing aspects, indebtedness, assistance in sensitive areas such as food safety, humanitarian, educational and health-related issues, and also fields such as the environment, investment and access to information and new technologies. This also applies to the sphere of trade, where we need to ensure real coherence between development policies and other Community policies, and also between both types of policy and corresponding policies originating in the Member States. We cannot simply forge ahead with something that in the past has shown itself to be inappropriate and wrong-headed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yes, it does say: ‘Coherence of different Union policies with development policy’. But we have not heard a single word on this subject, and I find that deeply embarrassing. We have been waiting for a report on coherence for years. It ought to have been here in writing today and, after having heard Mr Nielson’s speech, I can well imagine that he is up against a lot of powerful opposition in the Commission. I know that the Commissioner himself has some strong and extremely reasonable opinions on coherence, and these are what I should like to have heard expressed here today. Because the joint motion for a resolution proposes a range of effective mechanisms for ensuring coherence, I shall use the very short time allotted to me here just to mention one more such mechanism, namely obliging the Commission to carry out an evaluation of new, relevant legislation from this aspect. I also want to focus on the catastrophic effect the EU’s common agricultural policy has had on developing countries: dumping of beef in Sahel and South Africa, tomato purée in West Africa and milk powder in Jamaica. The examples are, I hope, all well known. In any case, they are known all too well to the producers in the ACP countries who are affected by these measures and who have to destroy their products because they cannot compete with EU-subsidised products. European taxpayers contribute EUR 40 billion per year in support of agriculture in the EU. This is money which is helping to impede the development of the agricultural sector in the developing countries, which accounts for 69% of the total work force there compared with 1.7% in the EU. Add to this the fact that the agricultural sector accounts for 34% of the developing countries’ gross national product, compared with 5.3% in the EU. There is neither coherence nor human decency here. Why will neither the Council nor the Commission admit the fact?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and his Foreign Secretary yesterday made statements on their policy in regard to the voting system within the Council. They pointed out that the UK, France and Germany far exceed the other countries of the European Union at present in terms of population. They then drew the conclusion that population size should be reflected in the voting system and that the United Kingdom would not surrender its veto.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Council discussing this issue? Is it prepared to maintain a democratic veto based on population strengths or is it still moving towards a simple majority vote of Council members, rather than a vote reflecting the population in Europe which they democratically represent? Have the UK representatives indicated to the Council their decision and proposal and what, if any, consideration has been given to it?</p>
<p class="contents">As this voting matter is vital to the democratic future of this Union, surely it should receive priority consideration. How decisions are made is all-important.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Much as I agree with the requirement to hold a debate on the coherence of different Union policies and development policy, I question whether today is the time to be holding it. However, the Council statement gave me hope for the future. It is quite obvious to me, as someone who specialises in development policy, that there are many areas where lack of coherence is dramatically affecting developing nations. I will give some examples shortly. However, I remind this House that, back in June 1997, a Council resolution acknowledged the fact that there is a serious lack of coherence in some of the EU policies in relation to its development cooperation policy. This was followed by a request from the Council to the Commission to provide an annual report, the first of which was to be discussed in 1998. We still await the first report, and that is why I believe this debate was premature, as the Commission had little to say on coherence this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">The areas identified by the Council are specific areas where policy coherence is particularly important, such as peace-building, conflict prevention and resolution, food security, fisheries and immigration. Some of these issues have been discussed in depth. I personally feel that issues such as peace-building and conflict prevention and resolution are very much the domain of African Heads of State, with capacity support from the European Union and the OAU acting as arbiter.</p>
<p class="contents">The issues that are really affected by lack of coherence are in areas such agriculture, trade, environment and biodiversity, but herein lies the real problem: these are the highly sensitive areas of policy within the European Union as a whole and in this Parliament in particular. Members of this House will have differing views, even within the same political parties, depending on (a) which country they come from or (b) which committee they sit on.</p>
<p class="contents">There are areas of coherence I would like to see as a member of the Committee on Development that would probably horrify some of the members of the Committee on Agriculture or Committee on Fisheries. As a lack of coherence, one can cite as Mrs Sandbæk did, the exporting of milk products to Jamaica at prices far below production costs there which has almost ruined the Jamaican dairy industry. We have beef exported to southern Africa, to Namibia and South Africa, which then sell their indigenous beef to Swaziland, so that Swaziland can fill its export quota back to the European Union. Remember too, some countries blocked an agreement with South African trade for four years.</p>
<p class="contents">If we simply import raw materials from these developing countries, rather than allowing them the add-on value of producing their finished articles in their own country, we deny them the very poverty-eradication that we have set as our top principle in helping developing nations.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not surprised the Commission is having trouble producing a basic document for discussion on sustainable and social development. There is a natural resistance in the developing world to anything that would lower standards of living and create further unemployment. I wish the Commission well in its task of producing that basic document.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore thank the Commission and the Council for having made a statement on the coherence of Community policies in relation to development, because this demonstrates a will to make policy in this area more effective. However, if we are simply carrying out a diagnosis of the incoherences in our policy, we will end up totally frustrated and, furthermore, the result will be negative.</p>
<p class="contents">As with the systems of forces which are studied in basic physics, it makes no sense to implement policies which will cancel each other out. The result of this absurd game is not zero, but rather a minus number, as a consequence of the material, financial and human resources thrown away in a pointless enterprise. With regard to policy, this minus number is multiplied by the number of results which are not achieved each time one measure cancels out the intended effect of another. In today’s globalised world, this fact is all the more obvious. There are no boundaries for Community policies. I am therefore glad that the Commission and the Council are once again taking an interest in the coherence of Community policies, and that, together with complementarity between national and Community policies and coordination between the services of the Commission, they intend to shape the policy on cooperation in accordance with the development of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency of the Council state, in their respective working programmes, that they wish to give coherence to those policies which have a very important impact on the developing countries, but they do not specify concrete measures aimed at introducing this coherence. Both institutions identify the most important areas where this idea should be applied. For example, the Commission, in its long term guidelines, says that the objective of sustainable development must be based on a strong sense of solidarity, supported by a commercial policy which takes common interests into account. The Commission is addressing a very important area, that is, commercial policy. However, this Parliament wishes to add policies to aid development, agriculture, fisheries policy, immigration, our position in international financial institutions, the common foreign and security policy and aid for structural reform.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council – and Mr Luis Amado has said this this morning – has spoken on different occasions of the need for coherence – the last time, it is true, being in November 1999, and also on other occasions, such as the Development Councils of May 1999 and June 1997 – but with no concrete results. Since the Development Council is in agreement with what he says – and this is very significant – there is little we can say, as some previous speakers have pointed out. However, as Parliament, we wish to propose – as others have said and as the resolution states – the creation of an inter-service working group consisting of the people responsible for all the policies mentioned and the establishment of a monitoring centre for the coherence of the different Community policies, which is capable of anticipating the effects of each policy on the developing countries and amongst themselves. What we really want, however, is to be realists and not hide away from the fact that the achievement of these objectives of coordination, complementarity and, the most complex one, which we are discussing at the moment, coherence, will require a more developed policy than the one we currently have in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope – and we do hope – to be guided by the winds of change created by the Intergovernmental Conference, the reform of the Commission – which will also affect the development services –, this new legislature and the prospects for enlargement, to perfect a more coherent political union.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore hope that the Commission, in the report it is going to present to us on global policy, will also address the question of coherence as an integral element in the efficient use of Community resources and the specific management of public interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But we who sit here in Parliament do not doubt for a second what the reason is. I should therefore like to discuss something more general and begin with a couple of, in my view, useful figures. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, real per capita income in the world’s richest countries was three times higher than in the poorest countries. In 1900 it was ten times higher and in the year 2000 it is 60 times higher. And there is no sign of this trend’s being reversed. On the contrary, it looks as if we have entered an exponential curve which is widening the gap still further. This is shown by the following figures: the income gap between the richest and poorest fifths was 30:1 in 1960, 60:1 in 1990 and 74:1 in 1997. These figures are from before the Internet revolution took off. In other words, there will have to be a quantum leap in development policy if the rich countries, including the EU countries, are not to surround themselves with barriers to prevent immigration on a massive scale. In a global village, major discrepancies in the world will not, in the longer term, be tolerated by the poorest section of the village. At some time or another, there will be a revolt, and it will be fully justified. </p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore urge the Council’s Presidency to set the promised debate in motion as quickly as possible and, above all, to conclude it in such a way that we all of us, including the people of Europe, realise what globalisation means and understand that a central element will have to be radical changes in the nature and the level of the development aid we provide. The EU on average is far from providing the pledged 0.7%. It may well be that others are worse, but that does not place us in any better a light. Above all, however, we should give the countries concerned the opportunity to trade with us. As far as I could hear – but I may have missed something – the President-in-Office of the Council did not mention the word “trade” at all. I would just say to the Commissioner that I hope his proposal will be successfully adopted by the Commission and the Member States. I would also ask the Commissioner to give some concrete examples of sectoral interests which are holding matters up, not only in the Commission but also in the Member States. I should also like to say that, in my view, what would be most effective would be for Parliament to call for proposals from, respectively, the Development Council and the Commissioner for Development. In that way, we should perhaps have a basis for discussion, instead of receiving proposals from all the governments and from all over the Commission, which is scarcely likely to produce results. I shall conclude with a few words about the Internet revolution. As Commissioner Liikanen keeps saying on his travels, we have a head start here in Europe in the area of mobile telecommunications. Let us use this not only for the benefit of our own populations but also for that of the developing countries. This technology can facilitate that necessary quantum leap forward in development policy to which I referred and, in this connection, the EU can set the agenda, leave its mark on development and honour its global responsibilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For we cannot build something up on the one hand, only to tear down the product of our labours soon thereafter on the other! Unfortunately, it has to be said that, for the most part, EU policies are far from coherent.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">This is particularly true of agricultural policy. For the European Union continues, on account of its aggressive export policy and market intervention tactics, to impede both the independent agricultural development of developing countries and their endeavours to see their products adequately represented in our markets.</p>
<p class="contents">This kind of agricultural policy does not just harm the small and medium-sized producers in these countries but has the self-same effect on producers in the European Union. They are being played off against each other. It is time that someone made this perfectly plain here. When I see, Mr President-in-Office of the Council Amado, that a country such as Brazil, which has a surface area of over 8 million square kilometres, now has to import basic foodstuffs, and that almost 40 million people are still undernourished and starving, then I am bound to say that this also has something to do with the way we pursue our agricultural policy, inasmuch as we produce our beef mountains with the soya from this country, only to store them in cold-storage again!</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore quite clear that the policy must change, and of course that the developing countries must also implement changes that will benefit regional structures. What will also be of decisive importance in the future is the kind of policy the European Union intends to pursue, which will be of benefit to the countries of the south in the World Trade Organisation in particular, how it intends to set about giving these countries a voice, an appropriate amount of say, and of course, how the European Union intends to open up its markets to these countries. For it will not do for us to ask the developing countries, of all countries, to open their markets up to us, while we carry on building fortress Europe over here. The TRIPS regulation also fails miserably to accommodate the resources in these countries, for under its terms they would have to pay dearly again for their basic products, which will have been patented by us beforehand. </p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to make another point on coherence within Parliament. Votes are often taken in the most diverse committees, as well as here in plenary sitting, which in itself is not coherent and does not accord with the tenets of development policy. Therefore, as a sector, development policy ought to cut across all committees, and it should not just be discussed once a year, like today, when it happens to be convenient. The policies of the 15 EU countries must also be coordinated accordingly, for it will not do for us to carry on making development policy foot the bill for national interests and attaching conditions to development aid such as, “If you buy our arms, you will get more development aid!” This situation cannot be allowed to continue in the future. There is an urgent need for more coherence, and this does not just apply to the European Commission, and to the Union, but to us here in this Chamber too! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People may say that the elimination of poverty is the common denominator but that is more of a pipedream than reality. The fact is that over the past 20 years the number of poverty-stricken people has not fallen, rather it has increased to 1.4 billion. </p>
<p class="contents">An honest appraisal of North-South policies cannot get away from the fact that the gulf between the richest and poorest countries has grown wider. Instead of describing this as a direct consequence of neoliberal politics, emphasis is placed on the need to define the concept of “good governance” more clearly, where development aid is concerned. Nevertheless, I ask myself what moral right or claim we have to do so, when the necessary criteria, those of democracy and rule of law, are taking a few knocks themselves in the EU Member States?</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Corruption is flourishing, party coffers are being plundered, and EU funds are presumably being diverted into election campaign coffers. We need to take a long, hard look at ourselves before we are in a position to establish realistic criteria. Nor should we forget that the EU Member States are not getting closer to making 0.7% of GNP available for development aid, on the contrary, they are getting ever further away from this goal.</p>
<p class="contents">It also seems to me to be regrettable that the report does not say a word about the arms trade – others have already mentioned this. In plying this trade, not only do the industrialised countries, in conjunction with the ruling castes in many ACP countries, stand to make huge profits, but a vicious circle is also set in train that we ought not to forget. Firstly, weapons are delivered, then violent conflict breaks out until, ultimately, troops from the states supplying the arms are deployed, and then everything starts all over again. </p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly like to support the observation Mr Corrie makes in his report to the effect that we have good reason to see that Cuba is given a fair hearing regarding its application to join the ACP states. The report underlines the changes that are beginning to take place there. We should not take our cue from the USA on this issue, rather we should rely on our own instincts more, and not create new and higher hurdles. </p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, it is a good thing to demand and achieve coherence of policies. However, we will also create coherence if the Commission does its policy work in conjunction with Parliament, and this, to my mind, is where there are major tasks in store for us, which I intend to involve myself with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is just a quote from a newspaper article which appeared last week, commenting on the Union’s development policy. </p>
<p class="contents">This is not new. Ever since we have attempted to do something about development cooperation, its effectiveness and quality have been called into question. Hope of improvement threatens to be nipped in the bud if the Commission keeps refusing to look into the mirror. Why was the critical report on the coherence of development policy not disseminated externally? </p>
<p class="contents">One of the major conclusions of this report concerned the European policy’s internal conflict. In terms of trade and agriculture, in particular, the European policy is in conflict with the development policy. We seem unable to make a serious contribution to the development of the least developed countries. This has everything to do with the difference of opinion which exists among various countries within the Union regarding development cooperation. We should no longer view development cooperation as an instrument of external and foreign relations, but as a policy in its own right. </p>
<p class="contents">I advocate transparent, joint and efficient development policy. As long as the European approach to the development issue creates more inefficiency and wastes more money, it remains appropriate to apportion a larger role to the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to ask the Commission to send the document I referred to to the European Parliament as soon as possible, so that we can help think of possible solutions in a constructive way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are talking in general terms – and this is more serious – about contradictions between our economic and trade policies and our defence policies. So there is a whole raft of contradictions. </p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, these contradictions are not all that serious in terms of Community policies. They are, if anything, more serious as regards certain objectives and industries in some Member States. We have to be aware of this. We often adopt resolutions on peace processes in other parts of the world, as was recently the case with Indonesia, when we protested at the top of our voices only to discover subsequently that some European countries had been supplying them with arms and military equipment. For me, these are the most serious contradictions in all this, more serious than the contradictions inherent in any incompatibility between sectoral policies. We obviously know that, even within any one country, there are always contradictions between various policies. That is a fact of life. And we must also be aware that there will be contradictions between the various Community policies, in this case development policy. We have to be aware that these contradictions exist and that we need to minimise them. The underlying reason for presenting this resolution is that the objective of minimising these contradictions is a fair and wise one. I believe that it is both proper and fitting to set up a centre for monitoring this coherence between Community policies and development and cooperation policy, and that this monitoring centre’s sphere of activity should not be limited just to Community policies, but should also cover Member States’ actions and policies, including the actions of economic groups, which I think are also important. This monitoring centre should draw up an annual report on developments in these policies and on their impact and interaction.</p>
<p class="contents">I have left to the end a question that I regard as fundamental and which I think needs to be noted and approved by this House. Our objective of minimising contradictions between development and cooperation policy and other policies has to be a valid objective, not merely within the European Union, but also at world level, given the increasing globalisation of the economy. If we want fair world trade we will have to gain acceptance for this principle during the next WTO round of multilateral negotiations, because it would be contradictory if the European Union imposed a rigid but fair discipline on itself, only for the United States and the other major powers to do the opposite and to take advantage of our restraint. That is why I consider it to be essential – and fair – for these principles to be established at the next WTO round. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Never mind that the Commission’s requirement to produce an annual report, set out clearly in the Council resolution, has produced only one “non-paper”, the real problem here is that at the time of rising world poverty this particular horse is climbing uphill and the cart of other EU policies is so heavy that development policy is actually being pulled slowly backwards.</p>
<p class="contents">Time after time development policy is forgotten or is an afterthought when the major policies of this European Union are considered. Take the new chocolate directive, which shows that EU countries spend more on chocolate every year than on development aid. There has been no proper development assessment of this directive which the producer countries, 90% of which are our ACP partners, estimate could cut incomes to cacao farmers by at least 15%.</p>
<p class="contents">Take the fishing agreements, where we recognise the unsustainability of current fishing practices within the EU waters. We are, at the same time, negotiating joint ventures allowing increased access for Europe’s large-scale fishing vessels in developing country waters at the expense of 190 million small-scale fish workers in those countries world-wide.</p>
<p class="contents">Take the trade agreements. As Mr Nielson said this morning with regard to Lomé, preferential access is only for “essentially all the products of the least-developed countries”. In other words, when EU commercial interests are concerned, poverty considerations go out of the window.</p>
<p class="contents">In the stance that we took at Seattle, why such a silence on the EU’s failure to implement the trade concessions for developing countries already agreed in the GATT, including for the crucial textile sector?</p>
<p class="contents">On the common agricultural policy, the biggest culprit – no development impact assessment of the Agenda 2000 CAP reforms. Everyone now knows of the scandal of the export refund scheme which dumped 54 000 tonnes of excess subsidised beef on West African markets, slashing prices for local cattle farmers by half. Today beef stocks stand at 300 000 tonnes. Who will be next, quite literally, for the chop?</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome Mr Amadeus’ statement this morning, which acknowledged the difficulties of non-budgetisation of the EDF, which called for a more active role for the Development Council and which called for development priorities to be central to the EU’s emerging common foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome too the Council declaration of 1992, its resolution of 1997 and successive changes in the Treaty of European Union. Action simply has not been taken. That is why we want annual reports, we want an annual inter-service group and we want a complaints procedure, to make sure action is actually taken. I ask Mr Nielson, in his summing-up, to directly address those points in the resolution.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Over the past couple of years, a considerable share of the funds has been channelled towards the development of agriculture and cattle breeding in the developing countries and, more especially, the Lomé countries. The results are certainly not what we expected. What could be the cause of this? </p>
<p class="contents">I think that the cause should first and foremost be sought in the lack of clear agricultural policy in the various developing countries, barring a few exceptions. I think that the Commission could do a great deal there to help this develop. No farmer, anywhere in the world, will produce something if prices are too low. The governments in the developing countries are always faced with a difficult dilemma: whom should they support, the farmers or the people in the large cities who want cheap food? </p>
<p class="contents">This fine balance must be struck in conjunction with the Commission, and not by the Commission on its own. In most countries where the Commission is active, development aid is also granted by the Member States themselves. It should not be the case that the policy of the Member States contravenes that of the Commission. It is up to the Commission’s delegations in the developing countries to assume a leading role in the development of this political dialogue and to ensure that all countries follow this line of approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Special attention is also required for the costs of the means of production. Far too often, artificial fertiliser, veterinary medication and a host of other items are provided to farmers free of charge. Once the project comes to an end after five years, the policy of free gifts also ends. I think, therefore, that the cost element should be built in right from the outset in the policy of all projects, and as far as I know, this is not the case by any stretch of the imagination. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wonder whether the funds could not be put to better use. Every year, I notice in the budget of the Commission and in the European Development Fund, that they are far behind in spending the funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should really talk about coherence in the development policy in the presence of Mr Prodi, for example, who has missed a great chance right from the outset, for he has allowed the development cooperation policy to fragment over three Commissioners – and this is better than four, I have to admit – but this does not really make for a coherent policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We also note that, as before, there are still various DGs which stifle this policy with often very conflicting procedures and arguments. The President-in-Office of the Council came up with a good suggestion, namely to budget the European Development Fund. Parliament would, of course, welcome this with open arms. If this were possible, it would be a huge, historic victory. </p>
<p class="contents">Since Amsterdam, three terms have taken centre stage: complementarity, coordination and cohesion. I believe that very little has been achieved in these three fields. If a request is made for a report on the progress made on cohesion, if a request is made at all, then drafting such a report cannot be very difficult, unless one simply admits that there is no cohesion at all. I would prefer it if a report were to be written on the present lack of cohesion, and if a systematic strategy were to be developed to reach a certain level of cohesion, for it is a long way off yet. </p>
<p class="contents">One thing shocked me in the speech of the President-in-Office of the Council. He stated: “Contradictions in policy can lead to balance.” It is indeed the case that what one hand gives can be taken away by the other hand, and vice versa. But this leads to status-quo and self-deceit, and globalisation as a whole has so far only led to changes, indeed, but changes which have only made poverty worse. This is supposed to be our priority, would you believe. </p>

<p class="contents">The first is concerned with conflict resolution. For many years, I have tried, through the Council and the Commission, to find out why none of the institutions is actively participating in, and working for, conflict resolution in the Western Sahara, which is occupied by Morocco. The UN has a peace plan. We ought to seize this opportunity and bring the last colonial episode in Africa to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to take up the subject of migration. I am anxious about the new stipulations in the partnership agreement with the ACP countries, which might make it easier to expel immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees on flimsier grounds. </p>
<p class="contents">I really also want to see the EU pioneer patents on living organisms. We now know that at least one person in the world dies of hunger every four seconds. Three quarters of those who die are children under five years of age. This is not because of a lack of food, but because of what we have talked a lot about today, namely increasing poverty. Food safety and the guarantee of biological diversity must take precedence over commercial interests. I believe that patents on living organisms are designed only to control the global food supply, specifically for commercial purposes and for no other reason. </p>
<p class="contents">I also want to see something about women in the report I hope the Commission will produce. Women appear to be completely absent from all areas, especially development policy when, of course, we are not in reality absent at all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The level of aid is naturally important, and the level of aid contributed by the rich countries as a whole ought to be increased. This ought to be done with, in particular, a view to combating poverty and through investing in the development of capacity. However, the level of aid is only one of many instruments which significantly influence the development of poor countries. </p>
<p class="contents">A number of colleagues have today pointed to areas in addition to aid which are important and where contrasts and conflicts between different policy areas are very serious indeed. The latter include trade, agricultural and fisheries policies. Other important areas are, of course, the flow of private investments, cooperation on research and technology and the way in which the welfare state deals with, and finances solutions to, a variety of global problems which affect us all. These problems include questions of climate, health issues, biodiversity etc, and the problems are clearly exacerbated by globalisation, that is to say the new economy which is developing. In this economy, the connection between different policy areas is that much more marked. In my opinion, what we are discussing here today is partly the EU’s contribution to the debate about the opportunities and risks of globalisation and about the rules there must be in order to give poor countries a decent chance. </p>
<p class="contents">The report, or survey, which Mrs Maij-Weggen has demanded, showing how the various policy areas fit together and what the aforementioned conflicts appear to be, is naturally quite crucial. I cannot help but wonder why the Commission has not done more. The Commission is new and has to be given time, but the absence of such a survey suggests that there are powerful tensions within the Commission. I can only hope that Mr Nielsen will be successful in the forthcoming discussions within the Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">In addition to a report of this kind, I should like to see a more positive analysis which could be ongoing in character. An analysis of this kind should look not only at the flow of aid but also give comprehensive consideration to all the different types of aid and transfers of resources which influence poor countries. These include technology, trade, cooperation in the field of research etc. It should be an extremely constructive contribution to the debate we are conducting. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Parliament recommends, in paragraph 6 of the draft resolution, that a working party should be established in order to bring about coherence. I believe it is only a coincidence, but the Commissioner for the Environment is also, of course, to participate in this group. </p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope that the debate in which we are now engaged will prove to have been a watershed. Policy so far has been characterised far too much by a process of giving with the one hand and taking away with the other. There are a lot of people who will be watching further developments with great interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Yet we might consider the rate of economic progress and the rate of eliminating poverty in countries such as India and Tanzania over the 40 or 50 years since they became independent. There the theory went that protectionism and state intervention would preserve jobs, allow industry to adjust gradually and without pain. It did not work; poverty became worse than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">The medicine may not taste too good in the short term, but opening one’s economy to competition at home and abroad forces optimal application of resources and leads to a higher standard and quality of life in the not so longer term.</p>
<p class="contents">Is that not the lesson of the European Union itself and of the single market in particular? As Mr Nielson said, this is a fine example to those countries and regions aspiring to greater prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet preaching the benefits of free trade to the developing countries is not enough. We also have to practise what we preach in our own accessibility for imports from these countries. Parliament’s resolution on the WTO negotiations advocated a free import policy by the EU. Eliminating all remaining barriers to imports, tariff barriers and quotas and, just as important, non-tariff barriers, such as Mrs Maij-Weggen mentioned in her speech – eliminating these barriers would do more than any amount of development aid to secure for developing countries the economic progress which both we and they desire.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite clear that a lack of coherence of development policy with trade policy diminishes our development efforts and must also diminish the political regard of the developing countries for Europe and our fine words.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is one relatively small area of activity with enormous public visibility which would be a litmus test of the Union’s ability to match words with action. I am referring to the continuing tragedy of anti-personnel landmines which present an obstacle to so many development programmes, to post-conflict reconstruction, and which ruin the lives of many of the most vulnerable in some of the poorest parts of the world, particularly in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Over recent years the Community has spent some EUR 200 million in mine clearance, assistance to victims and related activities. The Member States have spent similar amounts. But there is still enormous inefficiency and a lack of will to implement a strategy agreed with other members of the international community to overcome the anti-personnel landmine problem within a finite time span.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Nielson identified the problems of lack of concerted action and the need for better complementarity with Member States. This has been talked about for years. The Commission needs to carry out internal organisational changes, strengthen the coherence and effectiveness of its actions, ideally with a properly resourced central mine action policy cell. It would also need more rapid contractual and implementation procedures and an enhanced multiannual budget line and much improved management of its programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">A proper stock-taking of the effectiveness of mine action programmes needs to take place in each of the countries seriously afflicted by landmines. It seems to me that the landmine issue encapsulates so many of the organisational, procedural, financial management and operational difficulties which have afflicted the Commission and the Union. Are these afflictions of the past, or will we find that in this relatively compact and limited area the European Union is still unable to meet its aspirations?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And it is to be welcomed that criteria such as human rights, democracy, rule of law, and good governance are more firmly anchored in this new treaty than they were previously, and that earlier colonial relations no longer shape most of our relations to quite the same extent, rather, we now set greater store by these political criteria in this respect. For these are prerequisite to any development. If these criteria are not adhered to, then development does not stand a chance</p>
<p class="contents">The same goes for Cuba, Mr Modrow. I welcome the fact that Cuba is getting closer to joining this process. But for this to happen, there are also going to have to be a few changes in Cuba. After all, we are all familiar with the reports from Amnesty International. It may well be that you, having belonged to one of the last Communist dictatorships, view the situation somewhat differently to the majority of people in this Chamber, and that you have problems where good governance is concerned. Nonetheless, these are important criteria for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a second issue I would like to raise. We are discussing coherence here. Many speakers have cited examples of the extent to which the various policies are not coherent. In my view, however, the development policy itself needs to be more coherent too. There is no coherence because there is still no effective coordination with the Member States and there are some projects being carried out by the Member States and the European Union in the developing countries which are very much at odds with one another. Nor is there coherence vis-à-vis the European taxpayer when we draft a development policy which is accommodated in the Union’s budget but the EDF remains outside it. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if in future you succeed in making this EUR 13.5 billion subject to the supervision of the parliamentary Committee on Budgetary Control, and to bodies such as OLAF, then I believe you will raise the level of acceptability. This, to my mind, is also something that we should call upon the Intergovernmental Conference to do, i.e. establish the EDF firmly in the budget of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, the Committee on Development and Cooperation advocates the communitisation of the EDF; clearly that is misguided. In our view, cooperation is, and should remain, an intergovernmental exercise. With Europe preparing to enlarge, communitising the EDF would make it easy to hide a lack of commitment behind the screen of the Community budget, quite apart from the fact that we would be wasting a fruitful and promising opportunity of associating our southern partners with our cooperation policy. Lastly, the Commission has, in the recent past, had trouble managing the funds for development and humanitarian aid transparently, as Mrs Maes has just reminded us so opportunely. Why should we add to them?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we find it most regrettable that Mr Corrie’s report should mention the trade and development agreement with South Africa because, in the final analysis, this report is typical of the amateur diplomacy to which the European Commission is taking ever more frequent recourse. It is perfectly astounding that the Union could have negotiated an agreement on behalf of the Member States in which a fundamental section is quite simply left blank. And let me say in passing, it is even more astonishing that the Council allowed it to.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, we are now in the absurd position of negotiating from a position of weakness on vital aspects such as wine and agricultural production within the framework of an agreement which we have already signed. The part of this agreement which blocks negotiations could mean that the Union ends up paying producers to stop producing sherry, port and a whole host of products which are purely and simply copies under international commercial law. Imagine the potential cost of such a precedent.</p>
<p class="contents">It is proof, as if we still needed it, of the fact that immature diplomacy, which defends no interests, unless of course they are individual interests, and is caught between the dogma of free trade and pressure groups and more or less friendly NGOs, is not just inefficient, it is positively dangerous.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a word on the general thinking behind the Corrie report. Nowadays, let us face it, the Joint Assembly is seen as an obstacle to free international trade by the dogmatisers in Geneva and Washington. It was a chance to reiterate that our original and exemplary mode of cooperation with the southern countries should be developed and strengthened. The Corrie report missed this chance and we must, regrettably, punish it for losing so much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Amado,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span><span class="bold">.</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, by way of both a conclusion and a summary, I would like to highlight three key aspects of this debate. First of all, many speakers stressed that globalisation accentuates regional imbalances and social inequality, and increases poverty. This suggests that something must be done, failing which tensions will be aggravated and conflicts jeopardising international peace and stability will arise or worsen. Secondly, it will be important to approach development policies from a different angle in this context, taking advantage of their capacity for correcting imbalances and reducing inequality. I believe that the importance that everyone has attached to the European Union’s role in international development policies is significant. Everyone recognises, indeed this was the theme of today’s debate, that, if the European Union is to play a more active and leading role in development policies at world level, it will have no choice but to enhance the coherence of its own various development-related policies. I note that some speakers also emphasised that responsibility for coherence in EU policies is not a matter for the Council, for the Commission or for Parliament alone. Quite the contrary – it will have to be the subject of a concerted effort in terms of discussion and legislative and institutional preparation, be it on the part of the Commission or of the Council, or even on the part of the European Parliament itself, and some Members have in fact already suggested that a monitoring centre or a working party could be established to monitor the impact of various policies in the specific area of development.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to emphasise that it is also important – and this is one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency’s programme – to note the view that it is necessary to recognise the value of development in the European Union’s policies, and in particular in the context of its foreign policy. We believe that this is absolutely vital, failing which we will be unable to take any consistent action as regards the coherence of policies, and we cannot do this without giving development policies their rightful place as an instrument for upholding the principles and values underpinning Europe’s status in the international system. For this reason it may be necessary, as I have stressed, to change the model and move away from the post-colonial model towards a more European approach to development policies. In this respect I believe – and some speakers here have also commented on this – that the adoption of the new convention, which succeeds the Lomé Convention, is an important instrument of renewal, and represents a new approach to a partnership with such an important group of countries from the south at a time of considerable instability in the international negotiating process, as demonstrated by the first negotiating round in Seattle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span><span class="bold">.</span> – I sense some degree of frustration in many of the contributions to this debate. I have given you a statement on behalf of the Commission which I think provides a useful background to this discussion. We will furnish more detailed material relating directly to all the issues concerning coherence. This discussion is not new. We are currently working on it in the Commission and when that work is done I will report on it, as many have been asking if it will be possible to see the report on coherence.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no doubt that as a result of the increasing political attention attached to these problems – something which has clearly been reflected in the debate today – it will be easier for the Commission and the DG on Development to bring coherence to the forefront of our working agenda. This also calls for the introduction of further new mechanisms in the Commission system which may very well include, as suggested by some of the political groups in Parliament, the setting up of a special intra-service working group and the establishment of a kind of coherence watch in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I have read – and heard in the debate – that coherence is being used as some kind of a miracle formula that takes care of everything. I think it is important to keep it as a relatively clearly defined discipline of trying to reduce inconsistencies where they really exist, and we certainly do have them. Much of this has to do with real disagreement between sector interests in each and every Member State, as has been very honestly said here in this House: people more or less identify with their spheres of interest, and all this is legitimate. I would, however, warn against the illusion that incoherence is the product of some kind of a mechanical deficiency in the system. This exists, but it is only a small part of what we are discussing. The major part of it has to do with well known established differences of interest between sexes and so on, and this is the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mulder mentioned that no farmer will start producing anything if the price is too low. This is true in our part of the world, but our partners and beneficiaries in Africa have a slightly different perspective. They farm, not just for a living, but in order to live, and this makes a difference. Subsistence farming is not based on price calculations, it is based on the hope of rain in the next season. This does not apply to all farming in developing countries but to the poverty-focusing which we need to deliver better than so far. From that perspective, what I am saying here is of deep relevance.</p>
<p class="contents">Other issues have been mentioned: cattle-farming in Namibia, tomatoes and milk powder in the Caribbean. We should not be too masochistic. There is a limit to how useful that is. All these cases are characterised by the fact that they have been taken care of. The intervention prices have been regulated, and the problems we had with beef in Western Africa and in Namibia were actually solved by reducing the intervention support. These are real problems, but they have all been dealt with.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the issue of cacao, chocolate: I repeat that the 5% has to do with creating a basis for a living in the neighbouring countries. What we are talking about here are the local nuts which are as important to the people collecting them and making a living out of them in Burkina Faso as coconuts for farmers in Ghana. This is not a clear case of incoherence, it is more a case of a competition between suppliers.</p>
<p class="contents">What was mentioned concerning sugar in the Caribbean is more complicated. In the Overseas Countries and Territories Framework the accumulation of some of these trade aspects represents a complicated problem, but it may be that what we are talking about here has more to do with promoting the interests of some European companies than with generating income in the Caribbean. In any case, this is a matter which we are currently dealing with.</p>
<p class="contents">I am committed to try to create a balance in all these issues and I would mention the achievement of the trade development and cooperation agreement with South Africa. In all modesty, I would claim that this is something that documents that the Commission is willing to walk or fly the extra mile in order to ensure coherence between the perspective of development cooperation and the perspective of trade interests. We certainly have done our share to solve that problem, and I sincerely hope that we now will have a soft landing and a peaceful implementation in the forthcoming years of that agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I thank you again for this debate. We will come back again with material on these issues, because these problems, in one way or another, are here to stay, simply because development cooperation represents basically doing something in the world that is different from taking care of traditionally-defined trade interests, etc. We have to reconcile those different approaches.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
