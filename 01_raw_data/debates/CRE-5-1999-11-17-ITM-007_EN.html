<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dimitrakopoulos (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to publicly thank my co-rapporteur, Mr Jo Leinen, for his cooperation. I believe that the report you have in front of you reflects two things in particular. Firstly, this report is an attempt to condense a range of views of a large majority, not only of Parliament, but of all European citizens, and secondly, it shows how the European Parliament invariably aims to play, and does indeed play, a role in taking big decisions and in procedures to further improve the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that the next Intergovernmental Conference will become directly involved in perhaps the greatest challenge facing the European Union, i.e. enlargement. Amongst other things, this means that the Intergovernmental Conference must aim to improve the institutions, the way in which they function and the European Union’s policies, before we can allow new members in. </p>
<p class="contents">This particularly difficult process means that the next Intergovernmental Conference must proceed on a two-tier basis. The first tier, which I shall not say anything about since, when we divided up responsibilities, Mr Leinen assumed responsibility for that, concerns how we should introduce institutional reforms, how far we need to go with the reforms and what the actual goals of these reforms are. The second tier concerns the equally important issue of European Union policies. The European Union is having to cope with an increasingly wide range of topics on a daily basis – topics which are particularly important for the citizens of the Union. Clearly, it would be very difficult in the limited time we have to address them one by one in a parliamentary discussion. </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the first issue the conference should address as regards policies is the external representation of the European Union. This is an issue which has quite rightly concerned us on many occasions. It is therefore necessary for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to aim to improve those policies which lead to a more unified European policy on security and defence. The second issue to be addressed, which is also an important one, concerns the future of Europe on a global scale. It is quite similar but it has an added dimension involving external economic relations, an issue which we have been discussing a great deal. The third issue, together with the economy, is that of a “Social Europe”. It would be tragic if we forged ahead with developing European Union policies without giving consideration to such an important area which encompasses the bread and butter concerns of European citizens. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in such a report, we found it neither feasible nor necessary to introduce concrete political proposals. These proposals do exist but this report is more to do with the agenda of the IGC and how it should be followed, and contains a very specific proposal from the point of view of Parliament. For this reason, I am calling on you to vote in favour of the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Leinen (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has discussed this report thoroughly at several meetings, and I believe we are presenting plenum with a report of substance concerning the reform of the Treaties. I have my colleague, Mr Dimitrakopoulos, to thank for collaborating so well and for distributing the work in such a way that this extensive task could be carried out. We are agreed that, before the European Union is enlarged to include new States, there must be a basic reform to maintain the efficiency of the European Union and also, I would say, to improve the transparency of decisions on European policy and the ability to supervise these. </p>
<p class="contents">We in Parliament urge that the reform now pending should go above and beyond the three Amsterdam left-overs. True, these are important, but they are not enough. I want to mention five points in connection with which demands are being made in my part of our report. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly: we demand the reform of all institutions and of all organisations including, therefore, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. All these institutions must be subjected to scrutiny. Central to all this is the reform of the Council. Parallel to the Intergovernmental Conference, the Council of Ministers must carry out an internal reform, as demanded in the Trumpf-Piris paper, and the essence of the reform must be to have majority voting in the Council as the rule and, as a concomitant of this, to have codecision making by this Parliament in the case of all legislative acts. I believe that Parliament will judge the Intergovernmental Conference according to whether this reform of the Council is successful. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: the Intergovernmental Conference must make a contribution to the democratic supervision of European politics. Parliament must have better opportunities to supervise the Commission and to hold it to account. In this connection, we demand that the President of the Commission should have the ability to ask this Parliament for a vote of confidence and that the so-called Prodi procedure, whereby the President is able to dismiss a single Member of the Commission, should be incorporated into the next Treaty. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: we think that the reorganisation of the Treaties, leading to a situation in which the European Union would have something akin to a constitution, has now become a matter of importance. No citizen, and no expert either, understands the Treaties as they stand at present. They are unreadable. If we are to remain close to our citizens, we need to have the Treaties combined into a single text and divided into two parts – a constitutional part, and a second part which would then also partly have to be subjected to a simplified revision procedure. </p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly: reform of the Treaties requires not only that these should be ambitious in content but also that a new method of reform should be employed. Negotiating behind closed doors should be a thing of the past. Nor is it any longer acceptable. Parliament must be involved in all phases of preparing for, and holding, the Intergovernmental Conference. We request that the Community method as per Article 48 be used; we expect a concrete proposal from the Commission which will form the basis for the negotiations; and we also expect to reach a consensus with the Council and the Commission concerning the agenda and the procedure for the next Intergovernmental Conference. </p>
<p class="contents">This Article 48 itself belongs on the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference. We think that account must be taken of the European Union’s double legitimacy as a Union of States, on the one hand, but also as a Union of the Peoples on the other, while Parliament obtains the right, when it comes to future negotiations for the purpose of revising the Treaties, to participate in decision making whenever it is the content of the future Treaties which is being negotiated. </p>
<p class="contents">We here in Parliament are prepared to collaborate on a comprehensive reform of the Treaties and to ensure that, even following enlargement, our European Union is still able to take necessary decisions and, at the same time, also remain transparent to our citizens so that the latter understand this Union and also accept it. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission presented its proposals last week, and now Parliament is doing the same this week. A lot of colleagues wanted to go much further, to the point of demanding that a European constitution be drafted. We have imposed a discipline upon ourselves and remained within the broad framework of what has been demanded in terms of institutional changes. Now, it is up to the governments, meeting in Helsinki, to have the insight and also the courage to decide upon an agenda whose subject is that of sound reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I pointed this out on Monday and I reiterate my protest.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case I am taking the floor on behalf of the Committee on Budgets in order to mention the main points which that Committee considers to be important at the Conference on the reform of the Treaties, based on the principle that, in politics, it is a mistake to ignore budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">I will list the points very briefly: the reform of the budgetary procedure, involving its updating; the extension of budgetary codecision; the integration of the peripheral institutions into the Community system; the consolidation of the financial perspective in the form of a genuine medium-term financial programme; the reform of the own resources system with a view to ensuring the financial autonomy and efficiency of the Union, on the one hand, and the transparency of the Community budget on the other, which means that there will be codecision in the determining of the overall level of own resources; the introduction of the possibility of creating fiscal instruments at a European level; the possibility that the budgetary authority may intervene every year in relation to the mix of different categories of sources of revenue; and the extension of legislative codecision and decision making by qualified majority for financial regulations in all programmes or instruments which involve Community expenditure, the CAP regulations and any act which creates an executive agency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Without going into all the details, the framework has now been outlined for the challenge which the Europe of the near future has to meet if it is to be better understood and accepted by its citizens. </p>
<p class="contents">The biggest challenge is undoubtedly presented by the enlargement of the Union, which is something we affirm and want to see. This enlargement to include more than 20 Member States – perhaps 30 in a number of years’ time – could lead to a strengthening of the Union but also, instead, to its weakening; to its strengthening because Europe is reinforcing its identity on the basis of its political and cultural history. At the same time, however, such an increase in the number of actors on the European stage would throw up institutional problems and produce considerable operational weaknesses if relevant measures and radical reforms of the present system were not implemented in good time before enlargement. </p>
<p class="contents">The danger of crippling the decision-making ability of the legislature – of the Council and Parliament – as well as of making the Commission unable to translate the laws into effect is a significant problem. A further problem lies in the difficulty of knowing how the Treaties are to be adapted to the ever more rapid development of Community realities. The two rapporteurs have quite correctly set out these problems and linked them to specific areas of policy. </p>
<p class="contents">By means of the opinion it has delivered, the Committee on Budgetary Control wishes to answer the question of whether a further development of supervision, together with effective protection of Community finances, should be approached through the creation of a European public prosecution service, established on the basis of corpus juris but according to the spirit of subsidiarity, as also explained and clarified for us last week by Commissioner Barnier at the part-session in Brussels.</p>

As such, the European Parliament needs to be able to take part in the preparations from close by and has to get involved in the drafting and approval of amendments to the Treaties in order to reinforce the democratic character of this procedure. We should also consider a possible simplification of the Treaties. </p>
<p class="contents">At the Cologne European Council, it was stated that “during the Conference, other necessary amendments to the Treaties arising as regards the European institutions and in implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam, could also be discussed”. So this also includes the Court of Justice. </p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I emphasise that the organisational and procedural framework of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance is due for an overhaul in order to digest the current backlog. This should, in my opinion, go beyond the redistribution of chambers and increasing the number of judges. After all, the sound and timely administration of law forms a key component in each and every constitutional state and we need to ensure that within the European Union, the essence of the prejudicial procedure and general legal protection continue to be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">Other proposals which have been tabled, such as the question as to whether the European Parliament should be involved in the appointment of judges and whether the authority of the Court of Justice should extend to the third pillar, are under examination.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, all Treaty amendments have increased the power for Parliament. This should also be the case now. The Committee on Legal Affairs proposes extending the codecision procedure to all areas of the internal market, with the Council still deciding by qualified majority. In these areas, it could even be considered whether Parliament and the Council could acquire the right of initiative with regard to amending existing legalisation. The introduction of a clear hierarchy of legal standards should, after all, ensure that a clear distinction can be drawn between all the various legislative and implementing decisions. Mr President, these were some of the first proposals tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs in its opinion. The remainder will follow in a more detailed report next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Industry Committee deems it extremely important that at the next review of the Treaties, improvements will be made in two areas, namely trade policy and energy. Regarding trade policy, the Commission’s authority to deal with the WTO or in other forums on behalf of the Community should be extended to all services and rights regarding intellectual property. In addition, Parliament must be able to monitor the Commission more closely, both before and during the negotiations on trade agreements. It may be true that the contribution of the NGOs to the negotiation process is steadily increasing, but this could never replace parliamentary control. Democracy cannot, and should not, be left to NGOs to deal with. </p>
<p class="contents">Including sustainable development as an objective in the Treaty of Amsterdam requires an integrated approach to energy and environmental policy. This is why the Industry Committee is pressing for the inclusion of an energy chapter in the Treaty. Alongside this, the European Parliament should acquire more influence regarding the Euratom Treaty. Unfortunately, both rapporteurs and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs refuse to adopt the amendments tabled by the Industry Committee on energy policy and Euratom.</p>
<p class="contents">You will understand that I very much regret this as draftsperson of the opinion, all the more so in view of the fact that EUR 1.3 billion of research funding is tied up in the Euratom framework programme. This is why the liberal group has now resubmitted my amendments. My group supports the ambitions of the Industry Committee in terms of energy. Indeed, now is the time for Parliament to give the appropriate signals to the Council and the Commission for an integrated energy and environment policy. I do hope that the rapporteurs will still adopt these amendments.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is necessary because of the forthcoming enlargement. The reform is also necessary, however, due to the fact that now, for the time being, eleven countries have a common monetary policy. This necessitates the Member States’ at least pursuing their economic policies on the basis of common principles.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic system prescribed in the Treaty of Rome has remained the basis of the Community’s economic policy. It is a system of open markets. In a number of Member States, one particular concept has been adopted. It bears the name “social market economy”. I would recommend that this concept of the social market economy be incorporated into the Treaty. That is also the view of the majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy. </p>
<p class="contents">A significant part of the Member States’ economic policy revolves around tax policy. Here, through Europe’s internal market, competition between the economic systems has arisen which, in the area of VAT, for example, has led to tax rates’ converging. However, the internal market in this area is not complete because the anticipated changeover to the country of origin principle has not yet taken place. This is one example of why the requirement of unanimity in the Council has led to paralysis in decision making and therefore to a reduction in economic performance. As a result, our economic growth is lower and unemployment higher. That is why it is necessary, at least when it comes to the procedures for collecting taxes effective across national borders (VAT in particular), to permit qualified majority voting in the Council. </p>
<p class="contents">A further problem area is Parliament’s still inadequate participation in the legislative procedures concerning competition. Competition is the key to our industry’s competitiveness and therefore a prerequisite for Europe’s ability to embrace the future. We therefore demand, where legislative procedures in this area too are concerned, that the European Parliament be involved in the decision-making process. </p>
<p class="contents">What we request is that, in a number of areas in which, in full adherence to the principle of subsidiarity, the Treaties now already accord Europe a key role, the role of Parliament should be strengthened and the principle of majority voting established in the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will have an important part to play in preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference, and I have to say that I agree wholeheartedly with the general aims set down in the report to make the Union more effective, transparent and democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me speak, however, of the progress that has been made during the Finnish Presidency in preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference in 2000. A month ago, Prime Minister Lipponen came here to present you with an account of the outcome of the European Council in Tampere and, in so doing, he also touched on the IGC preparations. It is now three weeks until the Helsinki Summit conference, and IGC preparations are entering their final stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Union enlargement will mean the reform of the institutional system. The EU must freely acknowledge the fact that enlargement will bring about the need for changes that we have to resolve within the EU. We must be politically courageous enough to seek far-reaching solutions and institute the reforms the Union badly needs.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will certainly recall, at the Cologne Summit at the beginning of June, the next country to hold the Presidency, Finland, was charged with the task of preparing for the next Intergovernmental Conference. During the autumn, technical IGC preparations have been made at the permanent representative level. Now we have moved on to the political level, and we are having bilateral discussions at different levels with the other Member States, the European Parliament and the Commission. Next week, Prime Minister Lipponen is to begin the traditional tour of the capitals preceding the European Council meetings. Preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference in 2000 are one of the main issues connected with this tour. The resolution by the European Parliament thus comes at exactly the right time, also in light of this tour.</p>
<p class="contents">We have based these preparations on the Cologne mandate which, in practice, addresses three points in particular: the size and composition of the Commission, the re-weighting of votes in the Council and an increase in qualified majority decision making. In addition to these three areas, there are institutional matters that are closely associated with them.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU debate on reform has got off to a lively start, and this autumn there has been much heated discussion surrounding the IGC in the various forums. A month ago the Group of Wise Men, set up by Mr Prodi, published a report that called for a broad set of institutional reforms. On the basis of this report, the Commission last week laid down its own views on the Intergovernmental Conference in 2000, and what areas the IGC should handle.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, too, in the European Parliament the Intergovernmental Conference has been on the agenda in many committee meetings. We are aware that there are plenty of real IGC experts among you, and we value Parliament’s contribution to the debate. Tomorrow you will vote on Parliament’s position on the year 2000 conference. I promise we shall look closely at the views you adopt then.</p>
<p class="contents">The way the European Parliament participates in the Intergovernmental Conference is a very important question. I have heard from different quarters very positive comments on the invaluable and constructive cooperation offered by MEPs Elisabeth Guigou and Elmar Brok with regard to the IGC in 1996. Regarding the Intergovernmental Conference in 2000, the Member States have not yet settled on the form the European Parliament’s participation will take.</p>
<p class="contents">Preparations for the conference have included, in particular, discussions on the scope of the agenda. In addition to the three subject areas mentioned in the conclusions reached at Cologne, various parties have raised the following issues for debate, among others: the European Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the distribution of seats in the European Parliament, flexibility and the division of the Treaties into parts. We will present our own views in our report, after we have had discussions and listened to all points of view, on what we consider to be possible and desirable.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many points on which all those involved in preparations for the conference are effectively united. Firstly, whatever opinion we have on the scope of the IGC agenda, the main theme must be enlargement and the reforms that this necessitates. Secondly, nobody is questioning the fact that Europe must gain strength through enlargement. Decision making in the European Union and its potential for action cannot be allowed to weaken as a result of enlargement. Thirdly, all parties involved wish to commit to a timetable, meaning that the talks would be drawn to a conclusion by the end of 2000, during the French Presidency. We must achieve unanimity on the reforms whilst adhering to a tight schedule, so that enlargement is not delayed due to internal problems with the timetable in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I have focused in my speech only on the changes required by the IGC. We must bear in mind, however, that the institutions can also be reformed without amending the Treaties. In my opinion, these reforms must be carried forward coherently and effectively at the same time as the IGC.</p>
<p class="contents">I venture to hope that modernising the institutions and changing the way we do things could bring the European Union and its citizens closer to one another. Finland, as the country to hold the Presidency, has emphasised the need to improve the Union’s efficiency in its work, as well as its transparency. During our Presidency, we have taken a step forward in this area. Since its Presidency Finland has put into effect those recommendations in the <span class="italic">Trumpf-Piris </span>report that do not require a separate decision by the Member States. We have tried to improve transparency in the Council and make it easier for people to have access to documents. As an example of concrete action, we have made public the agendas and schedules relating to meetings of both the Council and the working parties. We have also made a proposal that all agendas of meetings relating to Council legislation be made public.</p>
<p class="contents">This, then, has been a brief overview of the situation regarding preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference in 2000. Next week I will have the opportunity to discuss the matter with you in more detail when I speak in Brussels to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the progress being made in preparations for the IGC. We once again have before us important decisions to take on the future of the Union. Making these decisions and eventually implementing them will require smooth and selfless cooperation on the part of all the institutions. For my own part, I can confirm the Council’s desire to cooperate with the European Parliament to make the forthcoming conference a success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We feel that this is not the right time to hold this debate. And this, Mr President, is because this debate is very important, not only for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, but also for the Union in general and for those people who want Europe to be effective, more democratic and more just.</p>
<p class="contents">Just the other day, another MEP asked me: “What solutions does the European Parliament propose for the Intergovernmental Conference?” And I answered in the same way as I will today, that this is not the time for solutions or proposals, but rather the time to decide what the Intergovernmental Conference is going to deal with and what method it will use in its work. And that is what the report drawn up by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen has done, and furthermore it has been a good illustration of how two intelligent people can reach reasonable agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the resolution tabled by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is politically intelligent; it deals with the issues and takes a very clear and decisive political line. And what is that line? Well, Mr President, it is one which is dictated by common sense.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Amsterdam did not resolve the issue of the institutional questions facing us. And the signatories of the Treaty recognised this since they added a protocol, the protocol concerning the institutions in preparation for the enlargement of the European Union, specifically to see how these questions should be resolved in the future. That protocol envisaged a dual institutional reform. The first one for a European Union of less than 21 Member States and the second for when it has more: an initial mini-reform and a second broader one.</p>
<p class="contents">The logic of that Protocol on the institutions tallied with the Commission’s Agenda 2000 document, which envisaged an initial enlargement which we will call 5+1. Now President Prodi’s new proposal breaks with this logic, because there are no longer 5+1, but rather 12 in the race. This new thinking has now broken with the thinking of the Protocol on the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, that first small reform, in which we only had to consider the Commission and the weighting of votes in the Council and to which the Cologne Declaration has also added the possible extension of qualified majority voting, does not make much sense and responds to a different political logic.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore we are talking about the second part of the Protocol on the institutions; we are facing a more profound reform of the European Union, which prepares it for enlargement. To this end, Mr President, I think that we should combine this demand, which before I called common sense, with what the President-in-Office of the Council said: that which is possible. But I believe that the Presidency of the Council has a great responsibility at the moment, because assessing what is possible should not prevail over the dictates of common sense.</p>
<p class="contents">We already know that, as a general rule, the governments do not want to change things too much; they are happy to make do with what we have. However, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we must push them a little bit, because otherwise, what I fear you understand to be “what is possible” will be too little for the needs of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the report by Messrs Dimitrakopoulos and Leinen is full of good ideas, is absolutely reasonable and establishes the points which, in our opinion, should be considered at the upcoming Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">My group, on whose behalf I am speaking, is very much in agreement with this report, but I am going to mention three amendments which may be added to it and whose vote I will request in this House:</p>
<p class="contents">My group’s Amendment No. 18 which requests that Parliament be consulted on the annual economic guidelines, the decisions involving budgetary short-falls and any other important decision which has to be taken within the framework of European Economic and Monetary Union, of course leaving to one side the independence of the European Central Bank. It seems to me that this is an issue that this Parliament should be involved in.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No. 26 in which we also incorporate, with regard to the distribution of competences, the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally any of the Amendments, Nos. 47, 26, 27 or 28, which talk of flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we should open the debate on flexibility. But all of this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, should take into account an essential element: we should not forget what the European Community has meant over all these years nor the thing which is most important to the Community, which is the principle of integration. That is what we have to preserve and that, if we do not carry out the appropriate reforms, will be very difficult to preserve in a Europe of 28. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, first of all, in relation to the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen report, I would like to welcome the work of the rapporteurs, who I believe have produced a piece of work which reflects not only our concerns but also an approach which is very pertinent and reasonable with regard to the objectives which the Union must have. The intention is to set a sensible attitude on the part of the Council, which would try to resolve what remains after Amsterdam, against a sort of Christmas card on the part of Parliament. I would like to say that Parliament, as it did before the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam, has opted for a line which consists of a short and precise list dealing with fundamental issues. I believe that our ambition should be, firstly, to create a Union that works well and, secondly, we should be in a position to enlarge that Union. It is simple: we cannot say that we need a small reform when this Union was designed for six and now, thanks to its success, has fifteen Members and we are willing to allow 25 or 30. This cannot be sorted out by moving the furniture around. We will have to take a radical approach. Therefore, I understand that the fundamental questions – and I have listened attentively to the President-in-Office of the Council – will raise other questions and this requires an Intergovernmental Conference, which must be sufficiently ambitious.</p>
<p class="contents">The second comment I wanted to make, Mr President, relates to the method. We talk a lot about transparency and contact with the citizens. It is difficult enough to explain an Intergovernmental Conference to them, but it is even more difficult to explain it if it is done behind closed doors. At a time when we are trying to popularise the Euro and gain greater support for the Union, and when the Council – and I welcome this initiative – is embarking on the task of writing up and debating a Charter of Fundamental Rights with the participation of the European Parliament and the national parliaments, it seems rather shocking that a closed door procedure is being considered in which the Council has still not said whether the European Parliament will be represented. I draw your attention to this issue because it seems absolutely contradictory and opposed to our own interests and needs. We have to open up to civil society, we have to involve national parliaments and there must be an open debate within Parliament, otherwise it will be very difficult to gain sufficient support.</p>
<p class="contents">And the third consideration, Mr President, concerns the tasks which face us, because they cannot be left until the end of the Intergovernmental Conference. We are carrying out a reform of our institution, for example with the work on the Statute for Members – and I welcome the Council’s good will – and also the reform of our Rules of Procedure. The Commission is committed to a reform programme. I believe that the Council – which of all our institutions is, in a way, the one which has been most fragmented by the increase in specialised Councils and a myriad of related committees – must lead by example. But it should not only think of the future but also of the need for a democratic and effective Community. To this end, I welcome the words of the President-in-Office of the Council and I hope that, while we prepare the Conference, we are capable of advancing along this road. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I trust that these separate but closely related processes will galvanise the IGC, just as the drive towards the single currency stimulated the Maastricht conference. We certainly need stirring up. At present, despite the good work of the rapporteurs, Parliament’s draft position is in danger of being more conservative than the Commission’s, and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has tabled various amendments to seek to sharpen the focus of the report and to speed up the development of a parliamentary Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we want a real process of conciliation between Parliament, the Commission and the Council in preparing the IGC. Secondly, we wish to change the Treaty revision procedure in those areas where power is already transferred to the European level. It is crazy for us to be obliged to undergo this ponderous and protracted Treaty revision procedure when we wish merely to reform a common policy. It is also wrong for Parliament to be excluded from that process. Thirdly, we wish to improve access of the citizen to the European Court so that the citizen will be a privileged litigant with ourselves, Member States and companies. Fourthly, we want a further look at the flexibility clauses so that certain Member States are able in practice to deepen their relationship without threatening the <span class="italic">acquis</span>.</p>

Unlike the Millennium Round, we have still not managed to stimulate public opinion, non-governmental organisations or even the MEPs on this subject, which remains fairly far removed from the thoughts of all of us. However, we have an opportunity and we must make the most of it. On the other hand – as emphasised in the report by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, whom I would like to thank here – we are talking about how to turn this muddled machine into a modern democracy, how rights, policies and decisions can be made transparent to everyone and how this European home can become more open and welcoming. </p>
<p class="contents">With this resolution, the European Parliament has decided to embark upon the process of revision and the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference. Frankly, I do not know if we shall succeed. Parliament is in a position of objective weakness in the dialogue with the governments, and it is therefore not very easy. My group considers, however, that some things must be explained more clearly and has tabled some amendments to this end, which I hope will arouse the interest of this House. </p>
<p class="contents">The governments must not be the European Parliament’s only partners in dialogue – as they often are for the Commission – and Parliament must therefore try to open and introduce a perspective of a, shall we say, constitutional nature, so that the instruments for an efficient democracy are clear for all and not just for a few specialists. As for the method, we do not believe that sending two observers is sufficient: two MEPs who observe a diplomatic conference and who, furthermore, are bound by an obligation of discretion, cannot be anything other than an alibi displaying weakness and modest ambitions. If the objective is to start the intergovernmental process, we must move towards a political agreement on the contents of the reform between Parliament, the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the agenda must not be restricted to technical points and to the issues not settled in Amsterdam. Codecision with the European Parliament and majority voting must become the rule, even in difficult sectors such as agriculture and taxation. The citizens must emerge from the fog they now find themselves in. Besides, I wonder, why mention specifically in the report the need to keep unanimous voting? There is no need. What we want today is greater democracy, greater codecision and majority voting in the Council. There is no point in reassuring the governments: they do not need to be reassured because it is they who decide in the end. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, even if today talking about defence is very fashionable, my group, albeit with its differing opinions, is convinced that discussing security in an exclusively military context is not positive. At the Intergovernmental Conference, if discussions are limited to the best way to integrate fifteen armies, then they will hold very limited interest. We think that we will only be able to talk about security and defence within the context of a general communitisation and democratisation of foreign policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have certainly carried out a complicated and difficult piece of work. I think that Parliament, as the representative of our citizens, will continue to have some intensive work to do within the framework of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference so that it might in actual fact do justice to the high expectations of people both in the European Union and also in the applicant States. </p>
<p class="contents">Our Group will actively involve itself in the debate by making a number of proposals of its own. We are fighting above all for the creation of a genuinely social and democratic Europe, a Europe which retains the European model of the social State, a Europe in which public services are not deregulated away and in which everything is done to prevent social dumping. It is clear to us that the Amsterdam left-overs ought not to remain the only subjects of the Intergovernmental Conference. In view of the enlargement which we all want to see, the European Union and its Member States must finally summon up the courage to undertake radical reforms so that a still politically divided Europe might grow together democratically and in terms of the social contract between citizens. </p>
<p class="contents">What is unsettling, indeed thoroughly alarming, is what has been set in motion in the field of foreign and security policy and the vehemence with which hitherto civil European integration is being shelved and a military Union is being created. In Parliament’s report, for example, it is proposed that the European Union must finally acquire the ability to act – an ability to act based upon credible military resources. I would ask you all, please, what are credible military resources supposed to include. Personnel mines, tanks or even nuclear weapons? </p>
<p class="contents">On Monday, in Brussels, the foreign and defence ministers defined where we are headed. This was an historic step. By 2003, a rapid strike force is to be created under the umbrella of the EU, in effect a European army of 50,000 men for crisis operations in and around Europe. Yesterday, the German daily newspaper, “Die Welt” characterised the plans as follows: the traditional defence of Europe would remain solely the responsibility of NATO; the EU strike force is not to compete with it but instead become its new trump card. </p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, our Group had already submitted a motion to the Committee to the effect that the European Union should repudiate war as a means of solving international conflicts. I find it downright incomprehensible that this proposal should not have found majority support in the Committee. Our Group will again submit this motion tomorrow in the Plenum. We shall request a roll-call vote for we are of the opinion that citizens are entitled to know who in this Chamber regards war as legitimate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One is the issue of the so-called institutional triangle, a question that was not answered in Amsterdam. The other issue concerns enlargement into Eastern Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it is crucial that the reform that is drafted is democratic and that it has a democratising effect. In other words, that it subordinates bureaucrats to elected officers and subordinates the latter to public opinion in each country, and that its democratic legitimacy is strengthened through the participation of national parliaments and is not replaced by organisations of dubious representativeness or by supposed wise men. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are fighting for an institutional reform in which there is a balance, not just between the Community institutions, but between the Member States, and for this balance to be expressed in the durability of this reform. We therefore think that adopting new federal powers at Union level will do nothing more than highlight this imbalance and increase the distance between the Union and its constituent peoples, as happens a little with each reform – and the high rates of abstention throughout Europe in the European elections show this to be true.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also opposed to the idea of the constitutionalisation of the Treaties as well as to the integration of a future Charter of Fundamental Rights in some kind of European constitutional process because we still think that European citizenship merely complements national citizenship and that therefore, the definition of the duties and fundamental rights of each nation’s citizens falls to the citizens of that nation. </p>
<p class="contents">Respect for the European people’s will leads us to state with complete conviction the need to institutionalise the Luxembourg compromise. We do not really see how we can increase the range of matters that can be decided by qualified majority unless the Member States, especially the smallest, have the means to oppose them by invoking their pre-eminent national interest. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we share the conviction that with the forthcoming enlargement into Eastern Europe, the Union can continue to create the right conditions for the States to enrich each other instead of causing the ruin of some in order to give others more help in succeeding. </p>
<p class="contents">We think that the economy and the competitiveness of European countries can be developed in a context that favours the modernisation of social systems without giving up the fundamental requirement of solidarity. We even think that Europe could acquire an external political dimension which matches its economic importance, and that this can be done whilst respecting the national interests of each Member State. </p>
<p class="contents">However, the construction of Europe does not mean taking away from peoples and nations the scope for autonomy that enables them to control their own destiny. By this I mean that we can only undertake this construction if we support respect for national sovereignty, if we support approval by the people, social and political consensus, the openness and transparency of the processes and respect for all the constituent countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Laws are not sacred cows. They are texts which can be changed by a new majority in Parliament. The voters always have the final say. That is the case in all our countries but, when we legislate in the Community, democracy goes by the board, so that the voters no longer have the final say where the laws are concerned. Officials and ministers have taken over from the legislature. Each new majority decision in the EU is an erosion of parliamentary democracy, and that is why, yesterday, we set up an intergroup for parliamentary democracy. Its working title is SOS Democracy or Democracy First, and we shall be gathering people together from every group for the purpose of securing democracy in the next Treaty and of bringing about complete openness within the EU. The intergroup is broadly based, its members ranging from British Conservatives to left-wing socialists. We have members from all political groups in this Chamber. We vote differently here on most questions, but we are in agreement about the fact that our differences should be settled in democratically elected parliaments and among the electorate. Officials and ministers should not decide which of us are right. We do not accept that a Commission in Brussels should decide whether or not elected representatives of the people can receive a proposal for debate. We certainly cannot accept that the EU Executive should now be preparing for another Intergovernmental Conference whose essential aim is to shift power from the voters and their elected representatives to behind the closed doors of offices in Brussels. There is a need for SOS Democracy because democracy comes first. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like, however, at the same time, to point out to Mrs Kaufmann, who has just quoted the class enemy’s newspaper, “Die Welt”, that the party to which she has belonged was the only German party following the Second World War to issue the order for a war of aggression, namely against Czechoslovakia, and so one might do well to refrain from making remarks such as she has made. </p>
<p class="contents">This Intergovernmental Conference has a very difficult timetable to comply with, for the Conference must be completed within the period prescribed, so ensuring that enlargement of the European Union is not delayed. At the same time, it must equip the European Union for the enlargement. In other words, it is subject to strict time limits and is faced with a great challenge. Equipping the Union in this way means tackling not only the Amsterdam left-overs but also many questions concerned with foreign and security policy, a lot of issues which my colleague Karl von Wogau may have addressed in relation to monetary union, and much more besides. </p>
<p class="contents">The question of majority voting is the key issue for the success of this Conference if our European Union is to be in shape for enlargement and if our European Parliament is also to agree to enlargement. There must therefore be clear definitions in a range of areas as to where majority voting is necessary. There must be majority voting in the field of tax policy, but not where all taxes are concerned. There must be majority voting in the field of social policy, but not for social policy in its entirety. This must be clearly laid down, just as it must be made clear that, when it comes to the European Parliament’s participating in decision making on agricultural policy, not all agricultural policy really constitutes legislation in any material sense, but only a small proportion – perhaps 20 or 30 – of the 3,000 legal documents. In those areas, however, Parliament must obtain the right to participate in decision making and, in addition, the right to full decision-making powers where the agricultural budget is concerned. </p>
<p class="contents">In the field of structural policy, it is, for example, becoming clear that the more Member States there are, the less likely it is that we shall make sensible decisions on the basis of the principle of unanimity and so ensure that scarce funds and resources are invested in such a way that they benefit the really poor regions and poor groups of this European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">In the area of foreign and security policy, too, we need rights of supervision, but we must find out – in the framework of implementing the Cologne decisions – which areas may still lead to changes to the Treaty. Here, I should like to mention in particular that incorporation of the WEU into the European Union cannot be agreed before Article 5 has also been put in order. Out of consideration for our neutral Members, Article 5 may only, however, be regularised in the framework of a protocol to the Treaty so that each country can decide for itself whether or not it wants to accede to this part. </p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that the European Union essentially needs new powers but, in connection with the powers it has, it needs the tools really to avail itself of these. Only then would we be in a position to combine transparency, efficiency and democracy, for these three things combined are the conditions of acceptance by the population of Europe. As proposed in the Dehaene report, the Council of Ministers would be divided, as part of this process, into an Executive Council of Ministers, which could meet behind closed doors, and a Legislative Council of Ministers, which would have to meet in public. For it is not acceptable in a democratic community that a legislative body should shut itself away from the population. This is a unique situation in the world and it is no longer acceptable. </p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that the proposal to divide up the Treaties, as presented by Mr Dehaene, is important. In the spirit of transparency and efficiency, we ought to combine the constitutional parts of the Treaty, including the regulations relating to the powers which can be exercised, and combine the remaining parts in another Treaty of lower status. This too is important so that citizens can see how this Europe of ours is organised. Here, there may perhaps in the longer term be a point of contact with the convention which is to draw up the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and this convention might perhaps develop into a constituent assembly, for a constitutional Treaty must be the goal for which we are striving in the longer term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, it makes the case for a wider IGC than the three so-called Amsterdam left-overs. Although those are key points, crucial points, we believe that it is right that the IGC ranges beyond just those three issues.</p>
<p class="contents">This view is indeed gaining ground, thanks partly to the Dehaene report and the Commission’s own proposals – and I pay tribute to Mr Barnier who is here with us – but it is also gaining ground and rightly so among the national governments. Nobody wants an all encompassing IGC dealing with every subject facing the Union in the Maastricht style, but there is a strong case to add to the agenda half a dozen key subjects which must be resolved if our Union is to work efficiently, transparently and democratically and is to be capable of facing up to having nearly 30 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason is that it makes the case for more democratic procedures. Amsterdam was already better than previous IGCs to a limited degree, in that it was prepared by a reflection group in which Parliament participated and which published its full report, in that every proposal tabled in that IGC was published and put into the public domain and in that Parliament was able to send two representatives to at least some of the meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">The time has now come, though, to be able to send Parliamentary representatives to all the meetings and to participate in the IGC on the same basis as the Commission, as a Community institution, to make our case, to advocate our proposals and at times to argue against the proposals made by others.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, my group has tabled only two amendments and two requests for a split vote on this report. That is because in the main we think this report strikes the right balance between ambition and realism. One amendment seeks to re-establish in the report a request that the IGC should re-examine the issue of flexible cooperation. It is unthinkable that we should move to nearly 30 Member States without the IGC re-examining that question. With nearly thirty Member States we need a clause on flexible cooperation that is actually workable.</p>
<p class="contents">The second amendment looks at the issue of having two parts to the Treaty: the constitutional part, looking at the main principles and the institutional provisions, and the small print dealing with policies. This idea has widespread support. Views differ, however, as to whether that second part should be amendable by a simplified procedure. Our amendments suggest that sections of that second part should be amendable by a simplified procedure – maybe not all of it, that may cause insurmountable problems, but at least part of it. There are many cases in the existing Treaties – different protocols, parts of the European Coal and Steel Treaty for instance – that are amendable by simplified procedure and the IGC should look constructively at this.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Treaties are the European Union’s constitution. They need to be made clearer, more transparent, more effective and more democratic. The IGC must take on board that challenge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It finally became possible to unify Europe and to create a broad, pan-European partnership, founded upon freedom and democracy. A week ago, we commemorated the fall of the Berlin Wall. The tenth anniversary reminded us that it is high time that we got to grips with the enlargement of the European Union and sped up the process. It has already taken far too long.</p>
<p class="contents">For us liberals, there is nothing more important than creating a unified Europe in which we solve problems together in a civilised way. Enlargement of the EU is a moral imperative. Enlargement, but also the fact that our citizens have a crisis of confidence in the EU, are factors which demand reforms of, and changes to, the European institutions. All too many people feel that the EU does not engage hearts and minds. The mistrust is sometimes almost palpable. We need to take this state of affairs very seriously. The Intergovernmental Conference ought therefore to have the ambition of thoroughly reforming the EU institutions. Simplification, openness, clarity and public scrutiny must be the watchwords. If a Union of 30 members is going to be able to function, it must concentrate on the genuinely cross-border questions and only act in those areas where European cooperation produces the best results.</p>
<p class="contents">A careful review of the division of labour is required, and this will require courage and a willingness to roll up our sleeves and set to work, in other words vision but also pragmatism. The debate ought not however to be carried on in isolation behind closed doors. All democratic forces must be involved and citizens must have the opportunity to participate and say their piece. They are entitled to expect results and also to demand that they be achieved. If we fail in this, they may perhaps turn away from the European project, which would be a major catastrophe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sometimes I doubt it. When I see, in the text of the report, that we are capable of pushing absurdity to the point of deliberately limiting the number of our own representatives at the debating table to two, I say to myself, there are definitely some people in this Chamber who are scared of their own shadow. This IGC, however, opens up a narrow historical window enabling what is essential to meet up with what is possible. Because, in the face of the challenges that the new century will present, morally we do not have the right to be satisfied with the off-cuts of institutional reform that are the left-overs from Amsterdam. Codecision must become the general rule. Our Parliament must obtain, as in any democracy worthy of the name, full budgetary authority over expenditure as well as over revenue. We must equip Europe with the tools of equity, security and solidarity. Let us say it: it is high time that we committed our continent to a constituent process. </p>
<p class="contents">The only real limiting factor is not our democratic imagination, it is our House’s political will. And if we were not really capable of freeing ourselves from the yoke of the current regulations, then any further reform would become impossible. Without real reforms, Europe, which is often helpless with fifteen Members, will be sterile when it has thirty. As Commissioner Barnier understands perfectly well, today’s developments must facilitate tomorrow’s developments. And who else but us, MEPs elected by direct universal suffrage by the European people, could have greater legitimacy for conducting and concluding this tremendous process. Parliaments often vote on laws, but more rarely do they write history. Because this honour has been granted to us today, I ask that we prove worthy of it. I ask that we show political courage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If seats were to be left empty in this Chamber to represent all those who did not vote, 322 places would be unoccupied. </p>
<p class="contents">This just goes to prove that democratic support for the European Parliament is weaker than that for the national parliaments. In spite of that, the report which we are discussing proposes that precisely these national parliaments are to lose a very great deal more influence over both their own national policies and over the EU’s treaties and policies. Power is to be transferred to bodies for which democratic support is weaker, for example, the European Parliament, or else non-existent, for example the Commission or the European Court of Justice. We on the Nordic left are therefore going to vote against most parts of the motion for a resolution which demands, among other things, that more decisions should be made at supranational level, that national influence over the Treaty should be limited and that the dominance of the big States should be increased. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Strangely enough, many still fail to learn any lessons from this. The greatest enlargement of the Union is pending, but with this report, Parliament is further progressing towards reinforced integration in Europe. Nobody has given me any arguments as to why a stronger Europe should involve its citizens more in policy. </p>
<p class="contents">This report should turn the IGC into a success, but it overlooks the notions which are fundamental to Europe’s future. A thorough discussion regarding subsidiarity is urgently needed. This is why we have resubmitted the amendment on this topic. Only the clear demarcation of the Union’s tasks is a basis for a correct distribution of power. The policy should be drafted as closely to Europe’s citizens as possible. </p>
<p class="contents">We welcome a broad IGC agenda, although it is difficult to tie up the loose ends of Amsterdam. The right of veto for matters which affect national sovereignty remains necessary. We find it unacceptable that enlargement would be postponed because the Union has not put its own house in order. This enlargement is the very reason why a dynamic approach should be adopted. </p>
<p class="contents">We do not deem it necessary for there to be a proposal from the Commission for the IGC agenda; they have more than enough to deal with. Following consultation with the Commission, it is up to the Council to draft this agenda and to make its own preparations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, he confirmed the continued cooperation between the Council and the European Parliament and his forthcoming visit to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. But he also confirmed that in the IGC enlargement would remain at the core, at the heart of the envisaged Treaty reforms and, secondly, that the timetable would be adhered to. I believe both of those are important aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, on enlargement, we are talking here about enlargement of a very different scale and nature to anything that has happened before, and that has implications for the nature of the IGC which prepares for it. We are talking in the main about countries from Central and Eastern Europe which have enjoyed, as we all know, 40 years of dictatorship when civil society was emasculated, driven underground and destroyed. Although ten years have elapsed and great strides have now been made, I believe that a good deal of confidence-building is still required and that we need the openness that many of us have called for in the preparation and the implementation of these reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">As the IGC takes place there are two aspects, therefore, that we in the European Parliament should remember. One is that in the past, IGCs have not prepared public opinion until the Treaty reforms had actually been agreed, particularly in reference to Maastricht. This had unfortunate consequences in a number of Member States. I believe we should learn the lessons from that mistake of the past and realise that the importance of this particular enlargement, the re-uniting of the European family, is something which our public at home needs to be made aware of while the IGC is actually taking place. And I believe that openness should also extend to the applicant countries themselves. It would be most unfortunate if we as the institutions of the EU saw this merely as a bureaucratic or a constitutional exercise to our own interest and our own advantage. It is specifically for the purpose of enlargement that openness is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore I believe that, where possible, not only should our own domestic public opinion be engaged at all stages but also the public opinion of the applicant countries in Central and Eastern Europe. I appreciate that that is a break in tradition from the nature of a governmental conference as we understood it in the past. But as I say, this is a very different type of IGC and therefore we have to be imaginative in the way that we present ourselves to the public. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, this is a significant confirmation of those shared Europeanist objectives that have, in the past, characterised the European Parliament in its relations with the other Community institutions, with national parliaments and public opinion. We have played – and we have shown that we wish to continue playing – an important part in supporting the process of European integration, and its continual and coherent development. </p>
<p class="contents">The political tensions that characterised the start of this parliamentary term are therefore not obstructing the necessary agreements between various, important – the most important – parliamentary groups on the subject of consolidating the Union, its institutions and its policies. It is important to agree, at this time, on the proposal that must be drawn up on the reform of the Treaties, on the convening of the new Intergovernmental Conference and on the drawing up of the agenda and the method. </p>
<p class="contents">The positions taken in the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report have been supported by those in the communications by President Prodi and Mr Barnier on behalf of the European Commission, explained to Parliament the day after the vote in our committee. This is now a sure point, which everyone must take into account: Parliament and the Commission are moving in the same direction and are equally convinced that the Intergovernmental Conference must not restrict itself to a limited horizon, simplified guidelines or a minimal agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The wide-ranging discussion in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs showed that Parliament is concerned with being, at the same time, far-sighted and realistic, demanding and practical. We should stop seeing Parliament as if it were advancing goodness knows what dangerous demands and impossible requests. Our proposals are not a reflection of an abstract scheme and are not a luxury, but reflect objective, inescapable requirements for a comprehensive reform of the institutions of the Union. We need to go beyond Amsterdam and look further in order to be able to realise the historic commitment to enlarging eastwards, and to guarantee further progress in the integration process that is working against the risks of dilution and stagnation. </p>
<p class="contents">No one can overlook the problems of strengthening the political side of Europe and institutional change but, in addition to this, we have had to deal with the launch of the euro and the European Central Bank, the lesson to be learnt from Kosovo, the widespread aspiration for a guaranteed area of security and justice and the disenchantment of too many European voters. This is an appeal we are making, in particular, to governments and national parliaments, with whose assistance we must build a stronger, more united and more democratic Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barnier,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, thank you for having given me the floor for a few moments at this point in the debate during which I have been able to listen closely to the rapporteurs whom I had already heard, but also to the representatives and the speakers of the different groups that sit in Parliament, that is to say, many of you. I hope that the speakers I will not be able to hear due to the way this debate has been re-organised as well as to the constraints of my own schedule, will forgive me. I can only promise them that I shall remain attentive to what is said throughout the debate today and of course later. </p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, Mr President, institutional reform is not a political project. It is a tool. Our project, as many of you have said, and it underlies our thoughts today, is the uniting of the peoples of European States in a political, economic, social and cultural Community. The great political project for the very start of the next century is therefore the welcoming of many new Members. This is why the distinction made in Amsterdam between limited adjustment, minor enlargement and a broader reform is already an outdated distinction. </p>
<p class="contents">You are already aware of the Commission’s contribution to the preparation for this Conference. I am delighted today, as was President Prodi, to see the contribution your Parliament has made and to note, and I would like to thank your two rapporteurs, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen most sincerely for this, a broad convergence of views, at this stage, between our two institutions. And I think that this convergence of views is a major trump card that we should hold on to both in terms of the issues at stake in the reform and of the working method that we should adopt. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a few words about the issues involved in this reform. As your two rapporteurs so aptly emphasised, this forthcoming Conference must concentrate on institutional issues, on all institutional issues with the notable and politically necessary exception of the discussions currently taking place on a European security and defence policy. I think that if institutional reforms are to succeed, they must be placed, and I say this to you, bearing in mind my experience of the last negotiations, in a broader political perspective, and they must together attempt to provide an answer to the fundamental question, “How should we speak to each other? How should we work? How should we move forward and take decisions in a Union which will contain 27 countries?” Because that is what there will be around the table. And that is the only question that we should be asking as we seek answers, all the answers, whichever institutions and processes are affected by seeking this answer. </p>
<p class="contents">The first issue that we have identified together is that of functioning well when there is a large number of states. Just now, I heard the President-in-Office of the Council mention enlargement which, he said, means “change”. And, in direct response, I shall reply to him that what we are dealing with is a major enlargement, not a minor adjustment. And we must respond to this major enlargement with real reform which must first, therefore, address the decision-making process. This is why I believe that the majority of us will agree on making it clear that qualified majority voting within the Council should become the rule, with exceptions limited to a few fundamental and very sensitive issues. </p>
<p class="contents">As many of you wanted us to, we have also put it in writing that where an issue of a legislative nature is concerned, the qualified majority must be linked to a codecision procedure between the Council and the European Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is that of developing the Treaties. I mentioned this idea during my hearing in your Parliament. It has been taken up and stressed in the report by Jean-Luc Dehaene, President von Weizsäcker and Lord Simon and it merits being dealt with in more depth. It consists in fact of reorganising the Treaties by separating the basic texts on the one hand and the implementing provisions on the other. This reorganisation would allow the Treaties to continue to develop because the implementing provisions could, if necessary, one day be amended by a simplified procedure. </p>
<p class="contents">I think that this new revision procedure could contribute towards linking the European Parliament more closely with the revision of the Treaties. I would like to say however that I do not think that this reorganisation should lead to a change in the Union’s or the Community’s current competences. </p>
<p class="contents">Another point is the representation of the States in the Council. The decisions of the Council should be more representative of the relative weight that the Union’s different Member States carry. Whilst respecting the spirit and the balance of the Treaty of Rome, decision making itself should also be made easier. </p>
<p class="contents">And then there are the other institutions. With enlargement, we will have to define the number of elected representatives from each State within your Parliament. The Commission, with its power to issue guidelines, the new authority conferred on its President, will have to preserve – I hope you do not mind if I say that it will not be easy, now that I am a Member of the Commission – its collegial character, its efficiency, and its decision-making process which requires a simple majority of its Members. The Court of Justice or the Court of Auditors will have to adapt to enlargement. </p>
<p class="contents">By mentioning all of these institutions, I am attempting to show that there are many answers to the fundamental question that I raised just now, that is, how we will work when there are 27 of us, and these are answers that must be looked into at this Intergovernmental Conference. The functioning of the institutions does not necessarily imply a revision of the Treaties. In their daily work, there are important reforms of internal structures for the European Parliament, for the Commission and especially for the Council, which must be implemented before enlargement. </p>
<p class="contents">The second major issue, Mr President, is to prevent the risk of dilution; the risk of dispersion that enlargement entails for us all. I repeat that when a risk presents itself, it can either be overcome, accepted as if it were inevitable, or prevented. We hope to prevent this risk of dispersion. The Treaty of Amsterdam has established the legitimacy of certain forms of cooperation between Member States within the Union’s institutional framework in order to move beyond the level of integration that has already been achieved. </p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Commission, I shall say quite clearly that the acquis must, under no circumstances, be considered to be a form of strengthened cooperation between the Fifteen Member States. The objective is really to improve the current conditions of strengthened cooperation and to make them easier. If we do not achieve this at this Conference, the current right of veto would only encourage the States that would like to achieve a deeper level of cooperation between themselves not to do it within the Community framework but to do it more and more outside this framework. In order to strengthen the Union’s coherence, the Commission, like your Parliament, hopes that the question of the Union’s external representation will also be raised. </p>
<p class="contents">The third issue is that of continuing the political construction of Europe and, when the moment comes, we will then have to accept the consequences for the institutions of the work in progress on the Common Security and Defence Policy. We are not forgetting that there is also the question of the way the Charter of Fundamental Rights relates to the Treaty. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to bring this intervention to a close by thanking you for your attention and by mentioning the preparations for the negotiations. Our objective is to bring these negotiations to a successful conclusion and to achieve this before the end of the year 2000 with significant results. Our objective is not to delay enlargement but to accomplish it successfully. This is why we hope that the procedure laid down by the Treaty, in Article 48, is implemented as soon as possible after Helsinki. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to express our agreement to the involvement of the European Parliament taking place in the best possible conditions, with greater participation than there was, as I can testify, when we were preparing for Amsterdam. </p>
<p class="contents">I would finally like to say that this reform throughout the year 2000 must provide the opportunity for genuine public debate between us, the institutions, but also with national parliaments and with our citizens. It is our place, and indeed my own, to see to it that we take part in this public debate. </p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is convinced that powerful institutional reform, adapted to the requirements of enlargement, can be achieved before the end of 2000. We know that the Union will emerge from this enlargement completely transformed. It must not emerge from it weakened. But we will only succeed if this reform is achieved with sufficient ambition and political will, which means that many of us will have to give priority to the long-term vision over caution or national interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I proposed that the outer circle of cooperation and integration would be the European Council, to which we could give new duties.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that this idea of mine has met with a positive response in principle. It has not had time, however, to be reflected in the amendments that our Group has tabled for this report. For my own part, I cannot support the report by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen. It is an attempt to continue to develop the Union into a federation, and it in no way takes account of how the robust enlargement process should influence the Union’s institutional development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But the European Union, far from rectifying the situation, seems to abide by the theory expounded by Livy, that is to say, it forgets what has happened and therefore can complain but cannot put anything right. In the texts which have been proposed for the reform of the Treaties and the next IGC, not even with the most powerful magnifying glass can we find a sentence which refers to the European peoples and regions and the role that they should play in the Europe of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time for the regional question to occupy the place that it deserves. The European parties which are stuck in the past have shown that they are incapable of overcoming the short-sightedness which makes them blind to the internal national and regional realities of the current Member States. When will we talk about nations such as Scotland, Wales, Galicia, Catalonia and the Basque country, which are not even allowed to sit together with the Governments on the Council? What is going to be done about regions such as Andalucia – with 7.5 million inhabitants – which is treated like a second class country, while representatives of Member States which are a twentieth the size sit in the Council?</p>
<p class="contents">New countries are going to join the Union, some of which are very small and we are in favour of their accession, but if it were not for their recent emancipation, they would not be candidates for Membership. The accession of these new countries, Mr President, will mean the under-representation of internal nations and regions of the current States.</p>

The reasons have been spelt out loud and clear. During this Summit, the accession, in the short-term, of four or five countries from Central and Eastern Europe was discussed. This number has since grown to ten or twelve. This has the immediate effect that a root-and-branch reform should be undertaken and this is more than a few institutional reforms. </p>
<p class="contents">As far as I can see, there are six points to this argument. Firstly, there are the institutional reforms as planned in Cologne, the make-up of the Commission, one Commissioner per Member State as far as we are concerned, the weighting of votes, which should be proportionate to the size of population and qualified majority voting. This should encompass the budget but also agriculture and legislation. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the integration of the second and third pillars, more integration in the Treaties. In order to achieve this, more of a Community approach needs to be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the new Treaty should contain a sound legal basis for a European regulation on the openness of government and transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we also need a legal basis for the European Union itself so that we can act autonomously in bodies such as the United Nations and the WTO. And I agree with those who say that the constitutional aspects in the Treaty should be separated from those components relating to the executive. I think this is a sound line to take. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this Charter of Fundamental Rights, to be laid down in future, should be embedded in the new Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">These seem to me to be the salient points. As for the procedure, our most important wish is, of course, maximum involvement of Parliament. Two MEPs seems just fine but they will need to be able to play a full part. </p>
<p class="contents">We give our full backing to the reports of Mr Leinen and Mr Dimitrakopoulos. They did a marvellous job and let us hope that the summit in Helsinki will indeed decide to incorporate the wider agenda we are proposing in the IGC </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is the issue of the reform of the Council, of the whole package of reforms which, we have been told, must and can take place in addition to a reform of the Treaties. Fine. Let us set out on this path, but let us do so with a reasonable timetable that is the same timetable that the IGC has. My group has tabled an amendment to this effect and I hope that, tomorrow, our Chamber will be able to vote for it. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the three “left-over” questions, do we think today that we are in a position to answer the question to which the Amsterdam Summit could not find a solution? What is this question? We must have the courage to ask it. It is perhaps less a question of how to function than of what it is that we want to do together when there are sixteen or twenty-seven of us. If we do not answer this question, we will not find a solution to the three questions “left over” from Amsterdam. </p>
<p class="contents">At any event, preparing the Union for the forthcoming enlargement opens up a question outstanding from Amsterdam, and that is the question of strengthened cooperation. Because, apart from the three institutional questions, which are already part of the IGC’s mandate, nobody in the context of the Amsterdam assessment has been able to tell us if the solutions that we had arrived at concerning the operation of this strengthened cooperation were satisfactory. </p>
<p class="contents">We must work towards a reform of this strengthened cooperation which will allow the Union to establish a real vanguard, open within the Union, in order to continue to make progress towards the security, democracy and stability of our continent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was partly for the purpose of establishing responsibilities but also because of the radical shifts in territory due to an almost 83 per cent increase in the area of Bavaria. The person with the big idea of having a constitution was the then Bavarian prime minister, Graf Montgelas, who did himself great credit by establishing a French administration in Bavaria. However, he was at the same time also the fiercest opponent of a parliament, because this could supposedly introduce unpredictable factors into politics. The arguments for and against went on for a further 18 years until at last the constitution was established and its opponents were finally quashed. And there were then already democratic elements in this constitution. </p>
<p class="contents">Now, something else that is astonishing: the basis of the constitution was, at that time, a preamble which was drafted in 1799 and which was to set out the fundamental rights, and all this 200 years ago! I think the parallels between then and now are quite amazing. History shows that the doubters’ arguments, both then and now, are almost the same. Let us learn from history not to allow further decades to go by before Europe has a constitution. This is something for the future that we must prepare for. </p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to encourage the Council not only to respect Parliament’s proposals but also to make them its own. We need a Europe which is able to act and which can also take necessary decisions. For we must also take democracy seriously, and the responsibilities which the national parliaments have given away must pass into the hands of the European Parliament, that is to say become part of the process of codecision making. We need codecision making by the European Parliament, for the European Parliament is the biggest factor favouring the integration of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can be all the more hopeful in that the involvement of the distinguished figure of Commissioner Barnier bodes well for cooperation between Parliament and the Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">As regards the draft:</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it maintains political consistency in Parliament’s views in that it adopts the position taken in the report written by Mr Méndez de Vigo and myself that the European Union is both a union of peoples and a union of states. The survival of European integration depends largely on the balance between this dual legitimacy. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the draft quite rightly calls for the adoption of qualified majority voting as regards decision making in the Council, provided, however, that we adhere to the unanimity rule for constitutional matters and for other absolutely fundamental matters, i.e. those which have a bearing on the sovereignty of the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, for the first time, the draft proposes a cogent argument for a foreign policy in that it sets two essential conditions: firstly, that it guarantees the external borders of the Member States as borders of the European Union and secondly, it proposes that any State<span class="bold"> </span>which is directly affected should have the right to object.<span class="bold"> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, on the sensitive issue of flexibility, for which, in my view, appropriate arrangements were made by the Amsterdam European Council, a consensual solution is being sought through amendments. However, I would like to appeal to Parliament to tread cautiously here. Experience shows that the sole, or even the main, danger for the European Union is not from dissenting Member States blocking actions, but from the lax regulation of this flexibility which can lead to a two-speed Europe or worse. </p>
<p class="contents">I strongly recommend that Parliament votes by a large majority in favour of the excellent Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, at the moment, we are not fully aware of what issues will feature at the start of the forthcoming IGC and these are issues that must be discussed, particularly with a view to achieving efficiency and with a view to an enlargement that it is thought will happen and which is greatly desired. I would like to say here that reforming a Treaty with a view to achieving efficiency strikes me as a very unambitious exercise for the European project, and I fear that this exercise may be nothing but a power game which will allow a small group of countries to set themselves up as a board of directors and to lead and direct the European project. </p>
<p class="contents">A Europe led by a board of directors would be a negation of the stimulating process of European integration that we have had – it is true that it has its imperfections, but all countries have taken part in it – and, in our opinion, strengthened cooperation must be the exception and not the rule in the European Union. This is because often, the political will to cooperate exists, but the conditions are not right from the economic point of view or from some other point of view, in order to achieve this very will for strengthened cooperation. </p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, let me give you an example of this: if there were a change to the weighting of votes within the Council, which would mean that the countries with a higher population as well as the larger countries would in fact have more power, and if the extension of qualified majority voting, extended to the codecision procedure, meant that this tendency in the European Parliament also became more marked, my question is: what role will the European Union’s small or weak countries have in Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">I prefer cohesion to efficiency, and as Commissioner Barnier raised the issue a while ago of there being 27 of us in Europe, I would like to say, Commissioner, that I think that in the decisions of this Europe of 27, it is more important that all countries feel involved in the decision-making process, than discussing whether, when there are 27 of us, it will take us one hour, less than two hours or three hours to take decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Cohesion is more important than efficiency if we are in fact to have a European Union with as cohesive and generous an enterprise as the one that we have seen and in which we have participated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that credit must be given to Messrs Dimitrakopoulos and Leinen for laying the first foundations of a new <span class="italic">foedus </span>(treaty), a kind of pact on European unity which is organised around differences and which attempts mediation and, in particular, to find basic principles and unities. Europe still has a lot of work to do in order to build a democratic future. However, some points have now been identified: a foreign and security policy needs to be a truly common one. Indeed, I think that, in addition to banks, the economy and social and structural policies, the common foreign and security policy will be another driving factor towards true integration. We need a European Parliament that is the general legislating body of the Union – like the Council – that participates fully in appointing members of the other institutions and is able to establish a relationship of trust with the European Commission, which is no longer weakened by the double qualified majority now necessary for a motion of censure. We need a Council of Ministers that decides by a majority. I think that other issues, such as the greater integration of the national parliaments in the Community’s decision-making process, are useless elements that just complicate matters. </p>
<p class="contents">Local regions and communities should also participate with more dignity at the stages of creation and implementation of Community law. The part provided for by the provisions on the Structural Funds could become the basic principle for the new European construction. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must play a truly constituent part, and continue the spirit of Alcide De Gasperi, Schuman, Adenauer and Kohl to stay in the tradition of a people’s Europe – but it has had important supporters in other political families as well, such as Altiero Spinelli, François Mitterrand and Henry Spaak. We are approaching a time that will be decisive for Europe’s survival as an entity and as a model. The attacks are no longer military, but economic and political, and the adversaries are no longer those of the Cold War. If we want to equip ourselves in order to overcome the challenge of the new millennium, then we will have to equip ourselves with the necessary legal and institutional instruments, in the belief that Europe will remain Europe only if it is prepared to carry out self-examination and accept this giant leap towards the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In accordance with the Treaty, the principal players at this Conference will be the governments of Member States and then the national parliaments. But the other institutions, the European Parliament and the Commission will not, for all that, be resigned to the role of mere onlookers. Parliament, by means of its resolutions or through its two representatives at the Conference, will have to lead the project in an ambitious direction. This influence will only meet with success if the European Parliament concentrates on the essential points, “the priorities”, and if it deliberately refrains from presenting a long wish list of points which are as unrealistic as they are unlimited. Our two rapporteurs have attempted to avoid this trap, although I must say that they have not entirely succeeded. </p>
<p class="contents">As we are developing in the constitutional area and as the Treaty represents the highest standard of our internal laws, in the future, we will have to force ourselves to be more precise in terms of the law. A constitution cannot be produced on the spur of the moment. For example, when, on the issue of qualified majority voting, we have to say precisely to which articles of the Treaty the general rule is to apply and for which ones exceptions can be made, you will realise that the current Treaty leaves very little room for manoeuvre. </p>
<p class="contents">That is why, once we know the European Council’s mandate, we will have to go back to this document and make improvements to it. As the President of our Committee, Mr Napolitano, pointed out, it is not a question of dividing ourselves into extremists and reactionaries, but of being perfectionists, whilst remaining progressive as far as the future development of the European Union is concerned </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like here to seize quite specifically upon one particular point. I was particularly pleased to see that the report has dealt not only with the reform of the treaties and of procedures, and therefore was not just worded in general terms, but has in the last analysis declared itself in favour of setting and specifying priorities to the effect, for example, that progress must be achieved in the interests of the security of Europe and its citizens in connection with the further development of the area of freedom, security and justice, and that relevant procedures must be established so that this becomes a reality. In that way, citizens will be given a signal and main focus. </p>
<p class="contents">In the report, a goal is also formulated which I consider to be particularly important, namely that Europe must be seen by its citizens to be transparent and to be conducting a more open debate. This, too, I consider to be absolutely necessary, as well as being a good opportunity, especially in connection with the development of the area of freedom, security and justice. We can show here that, in circumstances where the Member States are at their wits’ end, Europe can, in the last analysis, be helpful to the individual. </p>
<p class="contents">If it is a fact of life that organised crime earns billions which, by being introduced into the legal economic cycle, damages our legitimate systems, indeed society as a whole, then we need Europol and we need European cooperation in the field of justice. If the drug trade already constitutes 8% of the volume of trade worldwide, then we must develop Europol as a European institution. If 400,000 asylum seekers are already coming to Europe each year, then we need relevant European regulations. By that, I mean that this report addresses something very real and contains elements which signify a genuine opportunity for the Helsinki Summit. We shall see whether, at this summit, Europe’s representatives can in actual fact avail themselves, in the interests of our citizens, of this chance to create more transparency and more opportunities for the individual. We can only hope so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In that way we would surely be in a position to deal with the circumstances, with the real demands and we would be able to respond to the challenge of restoring the citizens’ interest in the European construction process, an interest which was statistically proven to be low after the poor turnout at the elections of 13 June.</p>
<p class="contents">To accompany the undeniable success of Monetary Union, we must also make progress with Political Union and in fields which broaden the competences of the European Union in order to prevent the current imbalances; I would describe these imbalances as enormous.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference must go much further than the fine words of Amsterdam, even though they are very important. I talked before of constitutionalisation and, personally, I believe in a federal perspective. The Treaties should also include that Charter of Fundamental Rights which is to be drawn up in the coming months; lay down majority decision making – as a general rule – and, logically, and simultaneously, the codecision procedure. It should also increase the powers of the European Parliament, for example granting it the power to ratify all the international treaties, whatever their type or nature may be, and, of course, ensure that the coming reforms are carried out according to a method which is much more open, transparent, democratic and participatory than the current one.</p>
<p class="contents">However, when we talk about methods and institutions, we must not forget politics. For example, we must integrate the functions of the Western European Union into the Union in order to prevent new Kosovos, but we must also promote the coordination of economic policies, fiscal harmonisation and the creation of employment and a genuine social Europe which will allow us to confront the concerns of the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The current method is rather worn out but, in any case, it is essential that the Council commits itself to taking appropriate account of the proposals which the Commission and the Parliament make in turn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But, in addition to these main objectives, without whose attainment an enlargement of the European Union would scarcely be conceivable, a number of basic questions, relating naturally to policy on fisheries, ought not to be forgotten. With the Amsterdam Treaty, no satisfactory solution was found for the fisheries sector. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I demand – as I also did in 1996 – that fisheries be mentioned specifically in the Treaties. Fisheries must no longer be regarded as a mere appendage of agriculture. The importance of fisheries as one of the few existing sectors for which there are Community policies must at last be emphasised by fisheries’ being given their own chapter. This chapter must state the goals of the common fisheries policy, its principles and, above all, the legal procedures governing its regulation. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Parliament must be more thoroughly involved than it has been so far in defining the most important themes in the fisheries sphere. I demand genuine decision-making powers in connection with the basic aspects of the common fisheries policy and the regulations governing, for example, market organisation, the preservation and management of stocks, supervisory regulations and the tools of structural policy; in other words, nothing less than codecision making by Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is also necessary in the field of international politics to strengthen the role of Parliament and to introduce the procedure for agreeing to the conclusion of all international fisheries agreements. My final point is that Parliament’s participation is also to be desired at meetings of bodies forming part of international organisations. </p>
<p class="contents">The points mentioned, which take account of the importance of fisheries in Europe, must therefore be picked out as central themes at the next Intergovernmental Conference when the role of Parliament is being considered. Happily, I have just heard from Giorgos that a compromise Amendment is being submitted which also refers to the subject of fisheries. Thank you for that. I trust that the House will support this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Finland’s Portugal’s and France’s Presidencies of the Council are to be requested to comply with the proposals in this report which is quite rightly based upon the criticism, partly by this European Parliament, of the decisions in Amsterdam. For no other reason than that Mr Tsatsos has again referred to the matter, I should like to emphasise that the proposal in subparagraph 5 is really of central importance. It is important that we obtain a package proposal for global reform in which the important questions relating to majority voting are dealt with just as much as those relating to reform of the institutions and other important themes. I think that the most important thing here is that we consider how the European Union might be provided with a constitution. This demand can hardly be emphasised enough, for Europe can only come of age when it provides itself with a constitution. </p>
<p class="contents">The purposes and goals of the European Union are too unclear at the moment. The European Parliament has quite rightly already submitted several draft constitutions, and I think that these ought to make it clear that Europe is more than a market. We must therefore be thinking in terms of a Brussels Republic, a unique community of States without historical precedent. </p>
<p class="contents">Whether the discussion of a European constitution will imbue Europe’s citizens with more enthusiasm for Europe is unclear. On account of the problems entailed in legitimising an area or a market without the structure of a State, the attempt does need, however, to be made to inspire such enthusiasm. This must also go hand in hand with the development of a European civil society and of a European public. We are seeing a change worldwide in the essential character of national sovereignty because States do not have unlimited freedom of action, either at home or abroad, and their ability to form policies and solve problems is limited by the realities of international relations and of trans-national forms of interdependence and interaction. This is particularly apparent in connection with the economy, trade and competition. It is precisely in this area, too, that it is very important to move from the principle of unanimity to majority voting. The European Union must become better able to act and it therefore needs a new separation of powers through a catalogue of competences. </p>
<p class="contents">In view of the changed circumstances, a new system for the separation of powers must be devised which augments the classical separation of powers as prescribed by Montesquieu with a new form of separation of powers at different levels. We need integrated multi-level decision-making processes. The coordination processes at present prescribed are inadequate to the task of organising European added value. That is particularly clear from the difficulties between economic union and monetary union and the difficulties between the political union and the economic and monetary union. Since we cannot boost democracy, through interinstitutional agreements in this area, we also, in fact, require a revision of the Treaty in this regard.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In view of the fact that the Commission – and I am very grateful to Mr Barnier for this – has accepted in its proposals a division of this kind for the Amendment procedures too, it would appear faint-hearted if now Parliament’s Committee on Constitutional Affairs were to accept the two-fold division but not the distinction between the procedures. It is also necessary to introduce different procedures because, following enlargement, the European Union would otherwise lose its ability to act. To that extent, I would thank rapporteur Leinen for his remark on this subject, but I cannot unfortunately find it in his report. </p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of introducing such a two-fold division of procedures, but only under a specific condition. It must be guaranteed that the abolition of the ratification procedure for specified areas of policy would not entail any weakening of the rights of the Member States and that the European Union would not acquire for itself a right to extend its powers at the expense of the constituent Member States. This can be guaranteed by means of a motion submitted by a number of colleagues and myself in which we conclude and demand that a catalogue of competences be incorporated into the basic part of the Treaty, clearly defining the competences of the European Union, clearly limiting those competences as well as encouraging application of the principle of subsidiarity. </p>
<p class="contents">Only in this way can the European Union, without at the same time eroding the rights of the Member States, become more able to act and efficiently limit its work to specified policy areas. I would therefore particularly ask the rapporteurs – partly in order to ensure that their report obtains a broad majority in the House – to examine these two motions sympathetically. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Budget policy, trade policy, tax policy and competition policy have been mentioned. Everywhere, in fact, there is a need for reform; to that extent, Parliament was very focused. I nonetheless think that we ought to be as ambitious as the Commission and carry out a further two improvements tomorrow. The latter I am happy to take up – a duly facilitated revision of the second part of the newly divided Treaties and also a clause concerning strengthened cooperation in a Europe with 27 or 30 States. I also hope that this will obtain a majority in the House tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to thank the Commission whose demands are almost identical with those of Parliament.

I would therefore take the liberty of again reminding you of one aspect of what Mr von Boetticher quite correctly pointed out here, namely that it is also a part of this package that a clear framework of competences of the European Union is to be laid down in the general, basic part of the Treaties. </p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps the same is true of yourself as it is of me: through the opening of accession negotiations with a further twelve potential Member States, the scales have, as it were, fallen from our eyes and we have seen what immense consequences and effects the enlargement is going to have on the European Union itself. Basically, this is not a traditional accession of States. With the union of twelve new and fifteen old Member States, we are, rather, facing the situation of a re-establishment of the Union. The necessity of comprehensive reforms has therefore been emphasised quite rightly here.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to issue one warning. We ought not now to be tempted to repeat the old demands which we have always made, but now under the banner of the enlargement of the Union, for that would basically prevent us from seeing that we must consider completely new visions of our European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">I should like briefly in this regard to consider one idea. I am convinced that, with 27 Member States, it will be impossible for the European Union to be as active in the same breadth and depth as it is with the present fifteen Member States. We must therefore also concentrate on the key competences of the European Union and, in this connection, consider in which areas it is indispensable for the European Union to be active. I am certain that, with some good will, we can find a whole range of other areas where that is not the case. </p>
<p class="contents">I want to add one last remark. I should not like here to associate myself with the general European chiding directed against centralism, but I should like to canvass for a comprehensive, honest critique of the European Union’s tasks so that we do not need to be afraid that our achievements will be jeopardised through enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Until now, justice has been rather absent from the general debate. I believe that all political communities are judged by the justice they provide.</p>
<p class="contents">The reality is that our justice system is not sufficient for the competences which have been transferred to the European institutions, the Community competences, especially the competences which have to be reviewed from a legal point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore I believe – and this should include the strict current mandate for the Conference with regard to the revision of the institutions in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam – that we have to deal with the necessary and thorough reform of our Court of Justice and our Court of First Instance and the reform of the appointment of judges – in which the Parliament should have a significant involvement – as well as the reform of the distribution of competences between the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance, so that citizens may have an accurate and clear idea of what this European justice, which is their direct form of justice, really is, and the reform, finally – and this is another chapter – of the actionability of the acts.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by saying, Mr President, that all of this will become all the more necessary in view of the other great mandate, the launch of which will be the finishing touch of the Finnish Presidency – the excellent Finnish Presidency, whose many successes it is a great honour to recognise in this Chamber and which has been a turning point in the behaviour of the Council. There is a “before and after” of the Finnish Presidency with regard to the daily treatment of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">That other challenge is to launch the Charter of Fundamental Rights. There is also a problem here between the Court of Luxembourg and the Court of Strasbourg. Mr President, as I said at the beginning, a political community is judged by the justice it provides. Let us be aware of this and let us deal with this reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At 5 p.m. today, a text signed by Mr Barón Crespo and some of his accomplices requested that the debate on the Napolitano report that was due to take place at 7 p.m. should be postponed until tomorrow. It was asked, in the form of a topical and urgent motion, that a debate tabled for 8 p.m. this evening should be postponed until tomorrow morning. Kindly explain to us the reason for this urgency. Furthermore, this request was formulated according to Rule 112 of our Rules of Procedure which refers back to article 60 whereas Mr Napolitano’s report, as it is quite clearly stated in the legal grounds of the aforementioned report, is a report which is covered by article 181, since it concerns the internal Rules of Procedure of our Parliament. It is therefore not a legislative proposal or an assimilated text at all, as the justification made by Mr Barón Crespo claims. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barón Crespo has accustomed Parliament to his Stalinist methods, to this Soviet way of treating Parliament for fifteen years. What we want, apart from any fundamental issue that we will address tomorrow, is to try to enlighten MEPs about a mistake that has been made, so that we do not continue to make this mistake. We are driving ourselves into a dead end by flouting MEPs’ prerogatives, by flouting the European Union’s history of parliamentarianism and that of all its Member States. And because we do not want to rectify mistakes that we made six months ago, we are prepared to institutionalise informing within our Parliament, which allows any assistant or official in Parliament to inform on someone because he suspects that so and so’s brother-in-law’s cousin may have committed fraud! It is absolutely scandalous! I request that this decision by Parliament be revoked. It is unacceptable. I request, in accordance with article 115, that the debate be included in the agenda 24 hours after the different versions have been made available to MEPs, that is, not before mid-day tomorrow. </p>

In order, therefore, to safeguard the Rules of this House and the Rules governing every Member, to ensure that Members have the rights they enjoy under these Rules, the Socialist Group and the Liberal Group, with the support, as was announced earlier, of the EPP Group, requested that to make sure we were in conformity with our Rules, Rule 112 on urgent procedure should be applied. This will be put to the House tomorrow morning to vote on. It will be a sovereign decision of this House to decide whether we can apply urgent procedure to this report. There is nothing undemocratic about that. It respects the Rules of Procedure and it respects what the majority in this House wants.</p>

Rule 112 refers to Rule 60. Mr Corbett knows the Rules of Procedure too well not to know that this rule does not apply to modifications to the Rules of Procedure concerning the Treaties or the interinstitutional agreements. I therefore support Mr Dupuis’ request. I suggest that we return tomorrow morning having considered Mr Dupuis’ arguments and my own with the aim of deeming the request formulated by the three groups unacceptable. Mistakes can happen. By the way, the matter is obviously unacceptable because they are not basing their arguments on the Rules of Procedure but on a rather inappropriate interpretation of the rules governing Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
