<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bourlanges </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the main features of the report before us are its aim, its scope, its content and its orientation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards its aim, Parliament, through its Committee on Institutional Affairs, has chosen to interfere in something which is not really its concern. In other words, it has chosen to talk openly and transparently about another institution, namely, the Council. Some have taken offence at this. However, we consider that this is our duty because Parliament must be concerned with the institutional future of the European Union as a whole and also because scrutiny is always much more thorough when carried out by someone else. Personally, I would not have any problem with the Council preparing a report on Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to its scope, this report analyses the decision‐making process in the Council and, in general terms, the difficulties the Council experiences in its operation. It does not hope to lay down the full institutional history of the European Union for when this is eventually achieved, but it is not confined purely to the short term. We have tried to define certain changes that must take place in light of the three challenges facing us. These challenges are the political transition of the European Union, the euro, which requires an economic policy to be defined, and enlargement, which is exerting a quantitative pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of content, in certain sections, the report proposes and recommends institutional reforms affecting the Treaties. In other sections, less extensive interinstitutional changes and even administrative changes are suggested. We believe that the Council operates as a whole, regardless of the legal instruments used. There are certainly only a few reforms that affect the Treaties, but all the changes to be made to the Council"s operation are very important.</p>
<p class="contents">The final key feature of the report is its orientation. It aims to protest against certain drifts that are becoming evident, and I will mention two instances. The first is a drift towards paralysis, linked, in particular, to an increase in the number of participants without the necessary reforms. And this is related to the whole problem of qualified majority voting. The second is a drift towards the use of informal procedures, ad hoc committees and meetings between staff or between governments, which are tending to bypass the effective, transparent and democratic procedures laid down in the Treaty. What we want to see is more formality and stricter respect for official procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is divided into two main sections relating to structures and procedures. I clearly do not have time to go into them in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">However, with regard to structures, I must stress a point that Mrs Berès rightly made and that relates to the crisis of the General Affairs Council. The report recommends a very clear separation between the foreign affairs function, which must be carried out by the foreign ministers, and the general affairs function, which is a coordinating function to be carried out by ministers close to the coordinating authority. This is an important point. Indeed, there is nothing to prevent the foreign ministers from fulfilling this role, if that is what the Member States want.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the procedures, we are rather concerned about the limits on the extension of qualified majority voting. The report makes rather daring proposals on own resources and foreign policy which will perhaps not be accepted by our colleagues. However, we must realise that in the Europe of the future, everything subject to unanimity will be paralysed.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, the report calls on each of us to participate in the logical distribution of roles between the Council and the Commission. We are currently helping to create two parallel executive structures, which is not advisable. The Commission must be responsible for proposing and implementing in all areas. The Council must be responsible for making provisions but does not need to propose and implement, while the Commission must not assume parallel functions of government. Our message is that we must clarify this distribution of roles.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Corbett </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, there is no issue of greater importance for the future of the Union as we move to have over twenty Member States, as will be the case in the next few years, than the reform of the decision‐taking procedures within the Council. That is why it is legitimate for Parliament to examine this question. The very functioning of an enlarged European Union will depend on the answers brought to the questions raised in this report. We know that as we soon will have 20‐something states around the table of the Council any area that requires unanimity will be an area in which the European Union is likely to be paralysed. If it can take decisions, they will be slow, cumbersome and on the basis of the lowest common denominator.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why reform is essential. Any policy area subject to unanimity will be blocked. But on top of that the very functioning of the European Union can so easily be brought to a halt by a single government if it choses to do so. Take appointments: to appoint the President of the Commission, to appoint the Governor of the Central Bank, even to appoint a member of the Court of Auditors requires unanimity in the Council. A single government may well be tempted to hold the Union hostage. After all, we have seen this in the past. The former Conservative British Government, a few years ago, in the dispute over mad cow disease blocked all decision‐taking in the Council that required unanimity in pursuit of a particular dispute. Who is to say that when we have 20‐something states around the table that sometime some government or another will not be tempted to use a similar tactic?</p>
<p class="contents">We also saw the difficulty of wrangles over the appointment of the Central Bank Governor recently and over the President of the Commission four years ago. In both cases a single government was able to hold up proceedings to make the others pay a political price for an eventual concession that was made or a new compromise that had to be found. It was very difficult. Imagine that with more than 20 Member States. That is why the first and most essential reform is a massive extension of qualified majority voting. Without that, enlargement will be a hazardous exercise and risks bringing us to paralysis.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, we must look also at the question of the weighting of votes in the Council. There is a proposal to have a double majority system: a majority of votes and a majority of the population or a majority of states and of population. Mr Bourlanges' report underlines that that is not strictly necessary to avoid the possibility of a qualified majority being composed of states representing a minority of the population. Arithmetically that cannot happen. That is why I – and up until now – my group have always been very reticent about the idea of moving towards a system of double majority in the Council. The Council should have votes representing the states just as Parliament has a more proportional system representing the population of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report Parliament is fulfilling its traditional role of looking ahead, being a little bit adventurous, but looking to the future: as we did with Spinelli report that preceded the Single Act, the Martin report that preceded Maastricht and the Bourlanges report which preceded Amsterdam. We know that there will be new intergovernmental negotiations to reform the treaties on these points. It is right that we put something forward‐looking on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course there will be problems on specific points. My own group has problems and will be tabling amendments and requesting split votes on particular points. But if it is understood that Parliament is fulfilling its visionary role here, looking to the future, putting the problems on the table, pushing governments to go further rather than being reticent, then there will be an understanding of the role of this report and I congratulate the rapporteur for the tremendous efforts that he has put into it.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Méndez de Vigo </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span><span class="italic"> – (ES)</span> Mr President, Mr Corbett has given Mr Bourlanges" report the best possible praise by comparing it to the Spinelli report. I believe that the two reports have something in common: they both concentrate on the future and propose courageous solutions. And that is indeed welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, just as in the case of this morning"s report by Mr Barros Moura, what we are actually doing here before the Treaty of Amsterdam is ratified by all the Member States is looking to the future, which is one of Parliament"s tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the comments made here regarding the extension of qualified majority voting. That is the major challenge facing us, particularly since this report has been drawn up with an enlarged Europe in mind. Since the accession of the last three Member States the difficulties involved in decision‐making have increased. What will happen when Europe has 25 or 28 Member States? We must provide solutions, find ways of preventing paralysis and work to ensure that the European Union does not turn into an intergovernmental organisation. Our most important task is to defend the principle of integration. And when we eventually have 25, 26 or 28 Member States, the principle of integration will only be able to be maintained if decisions are taken by qualified majority. There is no doubt about this, and we will have to ensure that it happens one way or another.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I believe that the report by Mr Bourlanges hits the nail on the head in terms of the sensitive issues to be dealt with. I am sorry that the Council is not represented here because I think that it would learn from this debate and the points made during it.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of the weighting of votes is one of the areas included in the Protocol on the institutions in the Treaty of Amsterdam. In addition, the German Presidency seems to want to make some kind of proposal in this area. I believe that we must look at two possibilities: giving new weighting to the votes or creating a simple double majority system, as proposed by Mr Bourlanges. He is from a country that has always opposed this idea and I think it is admirable that he has considered it in his report.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, and because we believe that this is an important report, my group will vote in favour.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cardona </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I usually defend the unanimity rule, but not this time. The rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges, whom I respect, but with whom I basically disagree, declares in his latest report that this is a conservative report. In my opinion, anyone familiar with thinking on Europe will know that while he might be accused of a certain cautiousness, he can scarcely be labelled a conservative. That is why, now that the debate over who is pro‐European and who is anti‐European has become fairly meaningless, and now that Eurosocialists are asking for more Europe, we, who are neither on the left nor Socialists, are best placed to propose and actually achieve a better Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">A better Europe at institutional level – the subject of this report – quite simply means that the Council should be in charge of Europe"s political management, since that is where the Union of States and the primacy of sovereign States come together. It should be the European Parliament that supervises the executive actions of the Union, in a seamless and close connection with national parliaments. The Commission should, in our view, be given back its original implementation and administration role, instead of trying to grant it new tasks, new prerogatives and new powers.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur also claims that the European Council has become the vanguard of the European Union. We could not agree more. But here too the conservative side of this report gives way to the bolder side, with the suggestion that the European Council should meet, whenever necessary, as the Heads of State and Government, when for decision‐making purposes it should adopt the procedures usually followed at normal meetings of Councils of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">I am no Europhobe nor am I Euroallergic. I think that first and foremost we have to explain to the citizens of Europe, as a matter of urgency, the kind of Europe we have and the kind of Europe we want. I have already been called a Eurorealist for taking that stance, despite my optimism. That adjective is not to my liking – but I would rather be a Eurorealist than a Eurocentralist, Eurofederalist or, most certainly, a Eurosocialist.</p>

I entirely agree that we should be directing our efforts towards establishing a system that is clear and simple, and eliminating any ambiguity as to who has responsibility and authority. The present confusion over roles, which is all too obvious, is of course to be criticised. Informal networking and meetings behind closed doors with no democratic control is also unsatisfactory. Furthermore, we know that the second pillar is unsound, a situation which is totally unacceptable. On this much we are all agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">Might I be permitted, with all due respect, to call into question Mr Bourlanges's analysis of the situation and the basis of his reasoning? He considers that the Member States have reacted to the new challenges with an ‘excessively <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> approach to the institutional question ... this approach has led to the rampant de‐institutionalisation of the Union'. But is this really the case? On the contrary, I believe that the new Treaty and institutional arrangements go in quite another direction. However, a much‐needed reform which should be implemented is the apportionment of roles, in other words the allocation of decision‐making responsibility. In my view, we should return some of the decision‐making that is currently carried out at EU level to the Member States and the regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, there is no good reason why the European Council should play a less central role; nor would it be legitimate for the Commission to develop into a ‘European executive', as envisaged in Mr Bourlanges's proposal. The European Union is the sum total of its Member States, and even if unanimity has not always been an effective arrangement, the aim was that it should not just be effective, but also democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not say that the Committee on Institutional Affairs was wrong to take an interest in an area which does not really concern it, but let us accept this report for what it is: an intellectual exercise.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, on behalf of the ARE Group, I must congratulate Mr Bourlanges on his important work, particularly as he has managed to include in his report the essence of many suggestions made by his colleagues in the Committee on Institutional Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">My group therefore regards this report as an excellent starting point. There is currently a lack of transparency in the European Union due, for the most part, to the dual nature of the Council, which can meet as an executive body and as a legislative body. This situation poses a problem which could worsen with enlargement in that, in its legislative function, the Council operates more like the Congress of Vienna than a real legislative house.</p>
<p class="contents">Our fellow citizens must be able to understand the European Union"s institutional system. This is definitely not the case at the moment. Therefore, the Council must no longer be a gathering of national executives meeting in secret and deciding virtually everything unanimously. It must become a second legislative house, just like the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to find a new balance for the institutions and this will put an end to the constant strengthening of the Council and the European Council. The latter must extend its role of laying down general guidelines and providing political impetus for the Union without becoming a decision‐making body. The bases of this new structure mean extending qualified majority voting in the Council. In the Treaty, there are still no less than 40 articles on which unanimity continues to be the rule. This means that there are many areas in which, given the prospect of enlargement, the European Union is virtually condemned to paralysis.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that the report by Mr Bourlanges can be improved further. This is why my group has tabled two amendments which we would ask the rapporteur to consider.</p>
<p class="contents">The first amendment involves the urgent need to use the Community method to prepare the next revision of the Treaties. It became apparent during the negotiations on the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties that the intergovernmental method was unsuitable, ineffective and even out of date.</p>
<p class="contents">The second amendment relates to the opportunity we have to consider creating a new function, that of President of the Union, in order to add a degree of permanence and to allow greater visibility in an enlarged Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that these constructive proposals will be adopted by the majority of Members.</p>

The June Movement is opposed to union, so we are voting no. Mr Bourlanges wants many more laws to be adopted by a majority decision in the Council of Ministers, but that means democracy can be outvoted, because the essence of democracy is that you can go to the polls, elect a new government and change the law. The report's proposal means that we can go to the polls, but that we as Danish voters will never again be able to change the law. We can replace three out of 87 votes in the Council of Ministers. We can replace 16 out of 626 Members of the European Parliament, but we can never again as voters decide to bring in a new law. We can get new politicians, but not a new policy. We shall be transformed into an electoral district instead of a nation. We shall become a national minority, instead of an independent people.</p>
<p class="contents">The June Movement does not want to reduce democracy. Our mission is a Europe of democracies in which each country cooperates closely, but which only adopts common laws on issues which transcend borders. Air pollution and marine pollution are problems which we cannot solve individually. Here we need to have binding international cooperation, but they should be minimum rules, giving everyone the right to go further. The EU should not be able to forbid a country from banning pesticides and colourings which cause allergies. We want an environmental Europe, but not more union and certainly not a new state, so we are voting against the Bourlanges report.</p>

To Mr Bonde, I wish to say that he is at the wrong debate. We are not talking about Europe's general position; we are talking about the Council of Ministers. I welcome the excellent report produced by our colleague, Mr Bourlanges. It is consistent and very coherent. The institution where we find the greatest difficulties in decision‐making is not the Commission or Parliament – although there are a number of difficulties of which we are aware – it is the Council of Ministers. Mr Bourlanges spoke about the rampant deinstitutionalisation of the Council of Ministers and that is exactly right. The Council does not even follow its own rules. He spoke about the European Council as the ‘Tour de France broom‐wagon". Indeed, the European Council is becoming increasingly inconsistent, and it is against that background that I very much welcome the overall approach of Mr Bourlanges.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to make two essential points: the qualified majority is a problem and Commissioner Oreja is aware of how the Commission has been fighting to obtain the necessary changes here. The point about internal coherence relates to the fact that there are too many specialised councils, as Mr Bourlanges said, and the Foreign Affairs Council fails to play its proper role. The suggestion that we establish a real General Affairs Council strengthens coherence. I hope that the Commission will also stress this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we have the proliferation of committees. Unfortunately, we have a first, a second and a third pillar but as we move towards communitarisation, for instance in the area of Justice and Home Affairs, it makes no sense to retain a K.4 committee of some kind in the first pillar. It erodes the initiative power of the Commission as well as the role of COREPER, the central body that prepares the work of the Council of Ministers. I endorse that view also.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the political committee, we should move in that direction. But there everything depends on whether the CFSP finally becomes a real common foreign and security policy.</p>

Where do we stand, where do we want to go? We are about to see the conclusion of the ratification procedure and the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty. As we know, the last intergovernmental conference did not manage to resolve some of the important issues relating to the forthcoming enlargements.</p>
<p class="contents">So the German Presidency is seeking a procedural decision on the necessary institutional reforms at the summit this June, once agreement has been reached on the key questions of Agenda 2000 at the end of March. The European Parliament outlined the scope and direction of these reforms in its Mendez/Tsatsos resolution. In its programme of activities over the past year and a half the Committee on Institutional Affairs has clarified the direction to be pursued. The result is the three reports we are debating today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Bourlanges report contains a resolution that departs from the norm. It is not a list of demands but an important prospective document. Its key concern is the need to move to majority decisions in more areas and to adjust the voting procedures in the Council so that it will retain its ability to act even after the forthcoming enlargements. These tasks derive from the Treaty of Amsterdam and the positions the European Parliament has adopted thereon.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say openly that in my view the significance of some of the details of today"s resolution is a rather more illustrative one. In the current stage of the European debates, the general guidelines require political authority. In that way we and Jean‐Louis Bourlanges will live up to our view of ourselves as giving impetus to the European integration process.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows that the next European Parliament will also have to debate the next round of institutional reforms in more depth. Here we expect the Cologne European Council to consider our ideas too when it decides the timetable and methods of these reforms. Jean‐Louis Bourlanges has done very good preliminary work in this respect.</p>

Time forces me to confine myself to highlighting the effort to drive out the lethargy and to dispel the confusion which, over the years, have stood in the way of a coherent common foreign and security policy taking shape. Such a policy is a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> for what we have been rushing headlong since March to call the European Union to be a real union of states and citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only has the aspiration contained in the original Treaty not been fulfilled by the revision of the Amsterdam Treaty but it has, on the contrary, been undermined. It has become even more complicated and obscure. Since the enlargement procedure has begun, it would be dangerous to delay finding a solution to existing institutional indecision. It is quite symptomatic and yet sad that we have recently begun to hear nationalistic outpourings from heads of Member States. This regression simply means that individual interests are being supported at the expense of Community interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 24 of the Bourlanges report contains specific and unambiguous proposals to check this slippery slide. We may not agree with one or two technical details. What none of us can accept, however, is to allow the acknowledged inability of the EU to fulfil its supranational role of ensuring international order and peace to be concealed behind a wall of silence.</p>

However, only when the euro is a success and the national parliaments are prepared to provide a good foundation for the Europe of Nations do I believe the time will have come to take major new steps forward. In the meantime, it remains to be seen whether a common approach to crime, asylum for refugees, the harmonisation of fiscal policy and the creation of jobs is going to be successful. Nevertheless, European ideas for deepening European institutions and enlargement must be further developed. But let us not overwhelm the public with too many changes in too many different fields, as this obscures their control over and insight into their own sovereignty, and that is more likely to lead to a rejection of Europe than the contrary.</p>
<p class="contents">The Bourlanges report is an interesting intellectual exercise, but we must not force the pace with giant steps but rather take the slow road like Tom Thumb. That way we will keep the public with us. At present my group cannot support your report.</p>

In practice it simply means calling on the Council to reform itself. So I am not surprised to find it was not even present to listen to this appeal and that it seems to be fairly indifferent to Parliament"s reform project. The Council is the Achilles heel of European democracy, if not the black hole. That is because of its amphibious nature. As a European institution it is constantly distancing itself from the national parliaments and the national and European courts. It is constantly distancing itself from the European Parliament by presenting itself as a meeting of the Member States. That is why I do not have any real hope that this black hole of democracy can be closed, that we will finally see open legislation, majority decisions, the democratisation of the second and third pillar. This kind of governmental cooperation is increasingly becoming a democratic no man"s land.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the rapporteur on his attempts to at least sketch out the broad lines of reform here. I also congratulate him on the clever way in which he proposed a revolutionary shift of power in favour of the large states while presenting this as maintaining the existing balance. That is a particularly successful intellectual proposal.</p>

As I explained in the minority opinion attached to the report, the I‐EDN Group considers that such a development would be dangerous and that the Council must continue in its role as a central decision‐maker, representing the Member States, and as the hierarchical superior of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, one of the lessons we should draw from the recent debates on the motion of censure against the Commission is that the European institutions, which cover many countries, are particularly at risk of becoming cut off from the people. This is especially true of the Commission, which relies on a European civil service with fairly weak national links. The remedy must involve carefully strengthening the subordinating link by which Brussels serves the Member States. This link places the Council in a privileged position. This is why the individual voice of each Member State must be maintained in the Council by preserving unanimity and why every means must be used to strengthen the Council"s control over the Commission. On this essential issue, the Bourlanges report is silent. Therefore, the opportunity to solve one of Europe"s current major problems is being missed. In fact, Europe is heading in the wrong direction towards a superstate cut off from the people.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Barros Moura </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur who, in my opinion, has presented us with a magnificent report that offers a forward‐looking analysis of the institutions of an enlarged European Union and of issues that the Treaty of Amsterdam obviously failed to resolve. I think that his report"s strongest point is its defence of the Community method at a time when there are clear signs of a return to intergovernmental working in the European Union. I think especially that the rapporteur"s proposals on reorganising the Council"s business are a step in the right direction. Not only in terms of efficiency, by extending qualified majority voting, but also by restoring the institutional balance provided for in the Treaty, where there has been a shift towards a greater executive and governmental role for the Council, to the detriment of the Commission's roles in taking initiatives and acting as a political driving‐force, which are recognised in the Treaty and which it should continue to play.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I cannot understand the rapporteur"s detailed proposals on the weighting of votes in the Council. It is obvious that the demographic weight of the different countries should be reflected in their voting power and that a minority of the population should not be able to prevail against the majority. That would be undemocratic and would be rightly rejected by public opinion in the larger countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, however, it is in Parliament, with its legislative codecision rights, that the different demographic weighting of the Member States should manifest itself: we shall in any case soon have to change the current proportion of Members per country, in view of enlargement and the plans for a smaller Parliament with 700 Members. In the Council, given its governmental role, the original balance between small and large countries should be maintained. We should avoid giving the impression that we are setting up a directing board of large countries – especially four months away from the elections and in the midst of all the anti‐European propaganda that we have heard in today"s debate.</p>
<p class="contents">One last remark on the content of paragraph 33. I cannot accept this because it would give greater decision‐making powers on the budget to the bigger contributors and is totally at odds with the Community method.</p>

For many years Jean‐Louis Bourlanges has spearheaded the process of European integration. Looking at him, though, perhaps he is not quite as pointed as a spearhead.</p>
<p class="contents">But the Bourlanges report is also an important one. For it reminds us in good time that the Union is constantly facing two tasks: enlargement and deepening. We have spoken a great deal about enlargement over the past months. And we have repeatedly and rightly referred to the homework the applicant countries must do. Let me remind you, for instance, of the debate in this House prior to the Vienna summit. At the same time we must not forget to do our own homework here in this House and here in the Union. The European Union must remain able to act, or to be more precise, become more able to act. Amsterdam has brought some progress in this area, but the opportunity for progress at the last minute was clearly not taken.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the important questions of decision‐making in the Council have remained open. The Bourlanges report considers these questions and seeks constructive, forward‐looking solutions to them. By and large, I believe it has done so with great success, as many of the previous speakers have pointed out and emphasised. I believe there are still some question marks in regard to certain parts of the call – however right in principle – for the general introduction of majority voting in the Council. I am particularly sceptical about paragraphs 28, 32 and 33 concerning own resources and qualified majority voting.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me address a last point that was rightly raised in an amendment tabled by Mr Saint‐Pierre. We must also consider the method of the next treaty reform, and here it is the Community method that is the right one, not the intergovernmental conference method, which is governed only by the power of veto.</p>

The European Union is currently at a complex and difficult stage. It is going through a period of evolution, and a lot of balances are being undermined. So it is becoming one of the European Parliament"s essential tasks to debate the institutions and the way they work. I am tempted to say that in the absence of real reform and with all the institutional balances fluid, Parliament really must start thinking strategically about the development of the Union again. The Commission is being weakened. That is a fact. I cannot say whether there is also a political attack going on against the Commission, but it is certainly being weakened. The role of the European Council is developing in an anomalous way, as the Bourlanges report rightly emphasises. Parliament and the Council should legislate in parallel, but it cannot really be claimed that this is really what is happening. In essence, the whole way the system operates is changing, especially with the enlargement approaching and after the launch of the euro. The Bourlanges report confronts these issues head on, with a free‐ranging, imaginative approach to the institutions. There has never been a greater need for imagination about the institutions, inspired by a dynamic rather than a literal interpretation of the Treaty, and of course, as everyone knows, dynamic interpretations sometimes go beyond the legislative text. There has never been a greater need to highlight the institutional hypocrisy of those who claim that an enlarged European Union can continue to function without reform of the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many worthwhile ideas in the report but I am not going to highlight what is probably the central point, namely the redefinition of the role of the General Affairs Council, which Mr Bourlanges discusses. Instead I want to emphasise a point which, in my opinion, emerges from the interpretation of the report. I believe that attention should be focused on trying to restore the balance between the European Council and the Commission, the two authorities driving policy and legislation. The future progress of the European Union will largely depend on this balance. This is a fundamental point. I think the balance is currently being undermined by both the anomalous development of the Council and the weakening of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, I see this whole report as going beyond the old approach of intergovernmental versus supranational. Redefining the balance between the Council and the Commission marks the end of that approach. That is where I think Mr Bourlanges has made an extremely important contribution.</p>

I therefore see no need in repeating what has already been said. However, I must mention two points.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that it has been a matter of regret for a long time, and still is now, that the Amsterdam Treaty did not go to its logical conclusion and effectively prepare for enlargement. The European Parliament must take some of the blame for this because it did not propose any solutions because of the fact that it was still divided.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that this moment has arrived, I welcome the fact that the Committee on Institutional Affairs and its rapporteur have dared to put forward a solution. I feel that the most important point is that our hands are no longer empty. There may be better solutions, which must now be put forward, but at least we have a solution to offer.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that, through the debates within the political groups, between the small states and the large states, a fundamental element of the future of Europe has become evident: within the European structure, each of us as individuals is part of a minority and each of the Member States is part of a minority. We must therefore heed each other and develop this minority culture which is the future of Europe. To conclude, I believe that with a solution in one hand and a philosophy in the other, this process has indeed begun, and I welcome that fact.</p>

It is an amendment that will make it possible in the future for there to be formal Council of Ministers meetings involving the ministers responsible for women"s rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an important amendment as it deals with a key problem in Europe today: the traditional exclusion of women from the decision‐making process. I hope that the PPE Group will also support this amendment and that the Commission, which is represented here in this debate, will be sensitive to this issue and support this move.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, the ministers responsible for women"s rights cannot meet in a formal Council of Ministers. I therefore believe that by providing for this possibility, we are taking a major step forward in defending the necessary involvement of women in the decision‐making process.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and from a general point of view, I believe that it is not only advisable but also necessary for us to reflect on such issues given that the European Union is currently initiating a large‐scale process of enlargement. The report by Mr Bourlanges proposes undeniable improvements and I must say that, in my view, he also proposes the correct path to be followed in favouring a Community method that renders the traditional, and until now prevalent, intergovernmental method obsolete.</p>
<p class="contents">It is truly shameful that the Council of Ministers is not represented here when Europe"s elected representatives are debating something that directly concerns both it and all Europeans.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Paasilinna </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FI)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not rightly understand the meaning of all this paperwork and its timetable. Perhaps it is obvious to some, but to many of us it is not. There has been insufficient preparation for and discussion of this issue, yet it is a very serious matter. Nevertheless, I believe that an increase in qualified majority voting is appropriate if the work of the Union is to be more effective. The report contains some conflicting ideas, however, such as paragraphs 35 and 36. Paragraph 35 states that Member States with small and medium‐sized populations are over‐represented and this system should thus be replaced with a reorganisation of the weighting of votes and a double majority. However, paragraph 36 says that the current balance must not be overturned. This seems to be in conflict with the previous paragraph. It is perhaps due to the fact that the rapporteur is actually only referring to the balance that exists among the states with large populations.</p>
<p class="contents">At the time of the Amsterdam conference Finland put forward a preliminary proposal for a compromise, whereby all Member State votes would double in number; however, the larger countries would get two or perhaps more extra votes in the process. This would also be an acceptable solution for small countries. Such a model would possibly be a less destabilising solution than the current weighting structure, and would not be too much of an upheaval for the countries with small populations. The basic position here is that institutional reform will not succeed without also taking the share of the small countries into consideration when the number of votes is being weighted</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Oreja, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. – (ES)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the Committee on Institutional Affairs and its rapporteurs for their various reports on specific issues related to the application of the Treaty of Amsterdam or on issues that we will have to tackle in the near future in order to achieve a more effective, democratic and transparent institutional system.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mr Bourlanges fits perfectly into this context and the vast majority of speakers clearly recognised this. I would also like to thank him for the educational way in which he presented his report, outlining, as he did, its key aspects: its objective, in case we were in any doubt; its scope; its content; and its focus.</p>
<p class="contents">The report deals with an institutional problem that, to my mind, is essential in defining the future architecture of Europe and, more specifically, that of a Union that hopes to become the instrument that peacefully unites the continent. I am referring to the European Union"s decision‐making process in the light of enlargement, an issue that many speakers referred to.</p>
<p class="contents">Our task is to devise and build an institutional system that must be based on three key principles, in my opinion. The first is to ensure the continuity of a process and an institutional structure that has provided extraordinary results in terms of peace, progress and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is to adapt to a changing world that, even as far as public institutions are concerned, requires a high degree of flexibility. I agree with the idea put forward by Mr Izquierdo Rojo concerning formal meetings of the ministers responsible for women"s rights on issues that directly affect them and that must become a Community responsibility. This idea is very welcome and I have taken note of it.</p>
<p class="contents">The third principle is to ensure that we can organise an entire continent around a single system that must aim to be politically and economically coherent. I therefore believe that we must initially look at the various aspects of our system with a view to reforming it and implementing the constitutional mechanism that Mr De Giovanni mentioned. This mechanism is currently being discussed and is in need of clarification.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we can ask ourselves a series of basic questions here.</p>
<p class="contents">Is there confusion between the Council and its various formations, as mentioned by Mr Brinkhorst and other speakers?</p>
<p class="contents">Is there confusion between the institutions that have an executive role? This was mentioned by Mrs Cardona, among others. However, I must admit that I totally disagree with the idea that the Commission should merely play an implementing role. It has another key function, that of initiating legislation, and we cannot forget that.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, can we talk about excessive bureaucracy in the preparations for the Council"s political decisions? Should it not improve its capacity for action, as Mr Rack pointed out?</p>
<p class="contents">The report seems to respond positively to these questions. It also puts forward certain proposals that would undoubtedly improve the current situation. I entirely agree with the rapporteur"s opinion about the Council"s dual executive and legislative role. And in this respect, I understand the comments made by Mr Saint‐Pierre to the effect that the Council cannot merely be the sum of the national executives. In my opinion, this dual role – legislative and executive – is only possible from an institutional point of view if we also have a strong Commission. The Commission must be able to carry out its full role and exercise its right of initiative as well as monitoring the application of Community law and, where possible, its implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Without going into each of the specific proposals in the text, I would say that Mr Bourlanges" comments on the European Council should be given consideration. And in my view, the European Council must clearly continue with its role of providing political momentum and direction for the entire Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I also agree with the remark by Mr De Giovanni concerning the need to find a balance between the role of the European Council and that of the Commission. I recall that during the speech I made when I assumed responsibility for institutional issues, someone asked me if I thought that the Commission should only have a relationship with Parliament and not with the European Council. I replied that both should be given consideration. As far as I am concerned, there is to some extent a form of double legitimacy and it is therefore logical to have such a double relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to look at the issue raised by the rapporteur concerning the need to strengthen the legal aspects of the Council"s decision‐making process, including the decisions taken by the Heads of State and Government. I must say to Mr Bourlanges that I have some doubts here. Moves in this direction would undoubtedly eventually weaken the noble role of the European Council as an institution that is the driving force behind our major political and strategic orientations. It would risk becoming a body to which we referred even the most minor decisions, as happened in the 1980s. We must ensure that that situation is not repeated.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not need to remind you of the dangers that situation brought with it. In short, it is clear that we now need to strengthen our institutional system, although it has already reached a certain degree of maturity since its institutions are increasingly subject to the democratic control of this Parliament. Moreover, we need to clarify the responsibilities of the national parliaments within the Community framework. There are two roles here: the fundamental role of the European Parliament and the role of the national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Schörling said, we must do this in such a way so as to ensure that we know who does what. We therefore need greater clarification of the issues, something that is often lacking.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that it is of the utmost importance to do all we can to make the Council more coherent. This means that both from the point of view of the workings of its various formations and in terms of the participation of the governments, we need to ensure that we can guarantee that its positions in the various bodies are consistent. This is an issue that several speakers mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other points in the resolution that are particularly important. Firstly, I fully agree with the basic principle that the power of initiative should not lie with the Council. The Community system is based on the Commission"s monopoly of legislative initiative, and this is a system that, in general, has worked well. Despite certain attacks on the Commission"s monopoly, the negotiations during the last Intergovernmental Conference confirmed that this is not only to remain intact as far as the Commission is concerned, but that in certain areas – such as justice and home affairs – the Commission will automatically gain the monopoly after five years. This principle is probably the most original feature of our institutional system, and perhaps even its cornerstone. We must certainly not relinquish it.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards decision‐making in the Council, I am of course totally in favour of the extension of qualified majority voting. Most speakers referred to this issue, although some were naturally opposed to it. I believe that the extension of qualified majority voting does not mean that there will not be certain exceptions. There must be exceptions that are very clearly defined, specifically as regards what we could call constitutional decisions. The resolution considers these. In my view, they are only logical, as there are clearly some fundamental decisions that have to be agreed on by all the Member States. However, as Mr Corbett mentioned a moment ago, the most important question is: how will a Europe with 20 or 25 Member States be able to take decisions unanimously in certain areas?</p>
<p class="contents">It is extremely urgent to give consideration to the weighting of votes, to the composition of the Commission and to the extension of qualified majority voting. As you know, these issues were not resolved at the last Intergovernmental Conference, but we need to find solutions to them in order to comply with both the Protocol on the institutions in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the express wishes of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The report puts forward balanced proposals concerning the weighting of votes. However, I noticed that some speakers, such as Mr Corbett, for example, were rather reluctant about creating a double majority system. I have also noted the comments made by Mr Barros Moura in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by looking very briefly at two issues. Firstly, I believe it is important to ensure that the framework for the common foreign and security policy set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam is applied as soon as possible and as willingly and effectively as possible. However, I have noted that some people are pessimistic in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem relates to transparency. The Treaty of Amsterdam requires additional efforts in this area on the part of the Union and its institutions. Each institution must therefore review its procedures and eliminate a whole series of prejudices concerning confidentiality and the secrecy of deliberations. These are incompatible with legislative activity that requires deliberations to be made public. The Council needs to make significant efforts in this direction, as the Court of Justice has pointed out in recent judgments.</p>
<p class="contents">Transparency and the public"s trust in the institutions are an essential condition both for the very existence of the institutional system and to guarantee that it runs smoothly. And this is particularly true in an enlarged Europe. We can adopt the reforms we want to, but if we do so in secret meetings, or if we give the public the impression that we want to hide the reasons behind our decisions, we will come to realise that we are lacking the important democratic and public nature that all national democracies possess. This is something that we need to bring to European democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I will thus end with three words: democracy, effectiveness and transparency. And, as Mr Méndez de Vigo very wisely said, we must concentrate on the future and provide courageous solutions.</p>
