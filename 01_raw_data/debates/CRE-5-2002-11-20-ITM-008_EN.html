I greatly appreciate being given the opportunity to give an account of the Council’s proposal to the European Parliament so that we can have a constructive and open dialogue between the Council and the European Parliament on this important subject.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has raised some issues concerning the restructured FSPG and the European Parliament’s participation in the discussions on policy in the financial sector. I hope that these issues can be resolved before the report is adopted by the Ecofin Council on 3 December.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial markets are playing an increasingly great role in Europe’s economy.</p>
<p class="contents">They are an important factor in the creation of growth and employment, and financial integration in the EU and the realisation of a single market for financial services will make a substantial contribution to increased prosperity. A report published last week by the Commission shows that full financial integration in the EU will in the long term increase the EU’s GNP by 1.1%.</p>
<p class="contents">Increased financial integration, however, also creates a need for improved cooperation on financial supervision in the EU and greater vigilance as regards financial stability. The development of the financial markets in recent years has underlined these needs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ecofin Council therefore wishes to extend the structure for financial legislation, supervision and stability in the securities market on which the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed in February this year to cover all financial services. The interinstitutional agreements that were entered into in connection with the securities markets will naturally also apply in the extended structure. And the monitoring of financial stability in the EU will be similarly strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">For several reasons it is important and imperative that this new structure be extended to include the banking and insurance sectors:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the new structure will contribute to financial stability and effective harmonisation of financial regulation by creating a framework for effective cooperation and convergence between the financial supervisory authorities. The increasing integration and reciprocal influence of the financial markets in the EU makes this a necessity which must not be postponed.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the circumstances which gave rise to the introduction of the Lamfalussy procedure in the securities sector are also present in the banking and insurance sectors. The way in which rules are formed at present is inflexible, slow and ponderous – and I am fully aware that the Council can also be a delaying factor in the present process. The common rules are also implemented differently in the various Member States. The financial sector as a whole is developing fast, and rapid and effective cooperation on legislation and supervision is just as necessary for the other sectors as was the case for the securities markets. There is a need to be able to react faster than the current structure allows.</p>
<p class="contents">Initiatives for new directives such as the implementation of capital adequacy rules in the area of banking and the Solvency II rules in the area of insurance will require certain detailed technical regulations and it is therefore appropriate to apply a more effective legislative procedure in this area, such as that used in the securities market. The new structure also paves the way for drawing a better distinction between the heart of the matter, that is to say, what is politically central, and what can be left to implementing decisions that can be adjusted on an ongoing basis in line with changing market conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Commission is not expected to produce its proposal on Basle II until spring 2004, it would nonetheless be useful for the new structure to be in place at an early stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the new structure is necessary in order to secure efficiency in connection with the EU’s forthcoming enlargement. The new structure will be more serviceable and effective in an EU with 25 Member States. The Banking Advisory Committee, which currently carries out both level 2 and 3 tasks, has 3 members from each state (that is, one from the ministry, one from the supervisory authority and one from the central bank). Following enlargement it will have 75 members, plus a number of observers.</p>
<p class="contents">Harmonisation and convergence of European supervisory practice can best be promoted by establishing a uniform structure for all sectors. The structure from the securities market provides a suitable model here. The new supervisory structure will ensure that organisation of the exercise of supervision remains a national task and will create a more transparent committee structure without mixed mandates as is the case at present in the banking and insurance sectors. It creates a permanent and clear structure for cooperation across the various supervisory committees as well as for the relationship between supervisory committees and the ‘level 2’ committees. It thus establishes good cooperation on supervision across the sectors and creates a good and clear distribution of responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, therefore, we can state the following concerning the significance of the new structure:</p>
<p class="contents">There will be a greater degree of focus on political issues – and thus on the overall principles of the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The political and technical discussions will initially take place in separate fora, allowing the process to take place more quickly because work can be carried on at a technical level in parallel.</p>
<p class="contents">Greater openness and commitment will be created in respect of the financial sectors in many countries and the implementation of the rules contained in the individual directives in the individual states will be more uniform, creating a basis for more uniform supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, it will create a greater correlation between the rules in the individual parts of the financial sector.</p>
<p class="contents">It is necessary to find a good structure for the role of the European Parliament in connection with the devising of overall policy guidelines for the financial sphere and I am convinced that this will be possible. As a starting point, I imagine regular meetings between the chairman of the restructured FSPG, the Commission and the European Parliament in order to strengthen the dialogue on the main policy guidelines for financial services. However, a rejuvenation of the 2005 Group is also feasible if this is preferable; this is, after all, mentioned in the European Parliament’s decision on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the restructured FSPG and its role in the devising of policy in the financial sphere we would take into account the European Parliament’s concerns. The role of the restructured FSPG is not to be described as ‘devising of policy in the financial sphere’ (‘policy shaping’) as is stated in the text. Rather, the restructured FSPG would provide an overview and advise the Council and the Commission. This will be shown in the final report which is to be adopted on 3 December.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council notes that if the new structure is to be able to take effect the European Parliament considers it essential that the legislative system in the EU is altered such that a clear distinction is made between primary and secondary legal acts and that there are the necessary revocation clauses.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is aware that the Commission intends to propose to the Convention that Article 202 of the Treaty be amended so as to reflect the powers of the legislative institutions – the European Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As is well known, the Council cannot, as an institution, make decisions that impose obligations on the Convention or the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference. That is solely a matter for the Member States, which will define their own positions in the Convention and at the Intergovernmental Conference. As president of the Ecofin Council I can assure you that I both can and will encourage my colleagues to make their Heads of State and Government aware of the importance of this topic and at the same time call upon them to deliberate and discuss this issue during their preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference. We in the Council are aware that the role of the European Parliament must be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important that the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference give consideration to a legislative system that allows greater efficiency in the legislative process and respects the principle of subsidiarity and the powers of the institutions involved.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that a solution is found in respect of both the challenges faced by the financial sectors and the challenges faced by the Community as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">We must all be aware, however, that this is a broad issue which does not solely concern financial legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to express my hope that the European Parliament’s final position on this issue will take account of the actual opportunities open to the Council and the assurance of goodwill that I have given the European Parliament today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With your agreement, I shall first speak on the subject of the resolution and then come to the report produced by Mrs van den Burg.</p>
<p class="contents">As you may know, the ECOFIN Council has broadly endorsed the EFC reports on extending the Lamfalussy arrangements to insurance, banking and financial conglomerates. At the request of the Council and the Presidency, the Commission has organised a public consultation which ended last week. Overall the response of market practitioners, consumers and other interested parties has been supportive. We shall shortly make those responses available on our website, which is consistent with the open and transparent approach that Parliament wishes to be applied to the whole Lamfalussy procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission supports the Council in extending the Lamfalussy arrangements, fully respecting all aspects of our arrangements with parliaments and our agreement with this House. I believe it will, in time, bring real benefits as the legislative process becomes faster, more flexible and more transparent. Let us remember what we are trying to do. One of our aims is to encourage the convergence of regulatory structures which, for securities, is now beginning to happen. We strongly believe that this is needed in the other sectors as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I acknowledge your concerns about the lack of experience with the Lamfalussy approach hitherto. Inevitably this is a learning-by-doing process. We must examine any shortcomings, a task which has been specifically assigned to the interinstitutional monitoring group. But we still have to prepare, in time, for the decisions ahead, not least because we need time to put in place the framework and the structures to extend Lamfalussy. Moreover, whether or not we extend that process will also shape the type of directives we introduce in relation to banking, insurance and conglomerates. We must also take into account the need to establish efficient decision-taking structures before enlargement. We should not wait, therefore, until the year 2006 and beyond.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I fully understand the arguments put forward by this Parliament concerning the need for proper democratic and accountable standards and safeguards. The EFC's proposals have benefited significantly from the input of my services. In particular they respect existing interinstitutional political and legal agreements and the prerogatives of this Parliament. We have insisted on this throughout, as well as urging that the proposal should be submitted to public consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, I do not accept that handing over chairmanship of the financial services policy group to a Member State will weaken the Commission's role. The FSPG will have a forward-looking prospective and strategic role but the Commission's right of initiative and indeed its role in the comitology procedure will not be compromised. That is explicitly stated in the EFC's report.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noted Parliament's continuing interest in participating in the FSPG. But I should also like to note that the role of the FSPG is to advise the Council and the Commission. It is not an interinstitutional group. However, we have the 2005 Group – the President of the Council referred to that – within which the three institutions could regularly discuss strategic issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also noted Parliament's call for a clear and unequivocal commitment to reform Article 202 of the Treaty. As you know, the Commission has repeatedly stated that it supports the amendment of this article. President Prodi said just that in this House on 5 February 2002, when we agreed with Parliament the democratic safeguards for moving forward with the Lamfalussy procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also in the Commission's governance White Paper, in the Commission's communication on better regulation and in the Commission's contribution to the Convention, its communication of 22 May entitled 'a project for the European Union'. In all those documents you will find the same opinion expressed, namely that we support Parliament in its wish to change Article 202 of the Treaty. The Commission will shortly come forward, probably on 4 December, with its communication on institutional architecture. The content of that is yet to be finalised but I can say that we believe that both branches of the legislature – the Council and Parliament – must in future be treated in an equal manner as regards control of the Commission and the whole comitology process. That is clear.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would counsel against – and here I should like to end my comments on the resolution introduced by Mrs Randzio-Plath – is the adoption of a resolution today which you know in advance is politically undeliverable by the Member States. They cannot give their approval in advance of an Intergovernmental Conference that will not start until 2004. They cannot give their approval to a particular outcome. Surely the reasonable course of action would be to ensure that these important issues are firmly on the IGC agenda when it begins.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the van den Burg report, the Commission broadly welcomes this report. I should like to thank Mrs van den Burg for having produced a report which is indeed timely, given the current debate on extending the Lamfalussy procedure, a debate which is under way in Parliament, the Council and, as a result of public consultation, also among more widely dispersed interest groups.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view the report is very focused. It concentrates on the key developments in the financial sector such as the supervision of conglomerates, the globalisation of financial sector issues and responses to shortcomings in the American regulatory approach. It strikes a realistic note in recognising the different supervisory approaches adopted by Member States. The report calls on the Commission to act in a number of areas. Some of those suggestions are either being addressed or are in the pipeline. Let me mention four of them: firstly, a dialogue with associations representing the financial and consumer sectors; secondly, a dialogue with the United States; thirdly, sound regulatory and supervisory principles for the relevant authorities in the candidate countries; fourthly, impact assessments for new legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission may decide not to take forward all the suggestions in the report but we will certainly give them due consideration. I am pleased to note that the report is supportive of the Commission in a number of areas. For example, it reaffirms the Commission's leading role in framing legislation, enshrined in the Treaty as the right of initiative. Indeed it is a monopoly of initiative. The report also endorses the Commission's role as a fair power broker. It notes the important work the Commission services are doing on creating an integrated financial market which, as Mr Pedersen said a little while ago, is vital to the European Union's medium-term goal of creating the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy by the year 2010. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome this announcement. Better late than never, and I notice that similar steps are being taken in many other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It does look, however, as if each Member State is independently trying to re-invent the wheel. While we at EU level are busy integrating the financial markets under the inspiring leadership of Commissioner Bolkestein, the capitals are, in my view, overlooking the fact that a great deal of what goes on in the financial markets transcends the borders of Member States and also transcends the borders of sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">We began discussing the options for increasing the effectiveness of supervision and European cooperation in Parliament before the summer. Hearings were held with leading figures from the supervisory world and the report you have before you is a reflection of the discussions that we have held. Regulators and market players themselves are pressing for further European cooperation and integration. That is what struck me in this debate and I believe that as politicians we are duty-bound to react adequately to the new risks that are presenting themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">In my report I have opted for a pragmatic approach, as Mr Bolkestein said earlier, and proposed a great many practical measures, the details of which I shall not be going into now, but the intention is indeed little by little to work on better cooperation and integration. I have deliberately chosen not to give a blueprint of what an ideal situation might be, which would then have to be imposed top down, but to work mainly on the basis of current practice to lay the emphasis not on the interinstitutional debate, but in fact on the quality and the effectiveness of the implementation of supervision at the moment. I believe that this is an important starting point for the debate that we must continue to pursue. In this way we can work towards further European integration step by step.</p>
<p class="contents">What has struck me is that the debate in Brussels, and I am referring in particular here to the EFC report and the discussion in the ECOFIN council, has been about the institutional setting and the mutual balance of power instead of about strengthening structural cooperation and coordination at European level. Power struggles are being fought over chairmanships and secretariat functions, perhaps with locations already in the back of the mind. I do not find this sensible. In my report I have tried to keep my distance from power games of this kind and to focus on the substantive arguments.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bolkestein has already said, and for me it is beyond dispute, that we need a strong European Commission, which works from the perspective of an integrated market and fulfils the role of an independent broker capable of bringing providers and consumers of financial services together. For my taste, the Council is still basing this a little too much on the national level alone and I fear that this will lead to large Member States making up most of the team and in the process allowing other interests to weigh more heavily than the interest of better cooperation and more effective supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point of criticism is that the discussion within the Council and within the EFC has for the most part taken place behind closed doors, without any national parliamentary involvement. I think that it has been good that as a result of the debate in Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we have forced this situation into the open and also made it more transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, this discussion is by no means at an end as far as we are concerned. We call on the Finance Ministers to broaden the discussion. A number of ideas are being suggested for this, but, as I have already said, no final choices have yet been made in the resolution. This is precisely why this broader debate is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">What I really want to emphasise and also insist on in this debate is the ‘enabling clause’ we have included in the report to provide a legal basis for the possibility of the performance of European supervision at European level too. Perhaps this can be discussed at the IGC and perhaps also by the Convention. There is currently no provision for this in the Treaty, either for the ECB, nor for other possible regulators that we might imagine at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">We are leaving it entirely open as to how and when this issue might be raised, but we do think that it is important to make provision for it now, as a condition for such a development. Mr Bolkestein was evidently fairly surprised by this proposal when we discussed it in the committee. I hope that he has since given it some more thought and can now be rather more positive about it, because that is precisely what we have missed with the Lamfalussy procedure, namely that this has been considered in advance and that you must also make conditions for it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a word about this Lamfalussy procedure. I have to say that I myself have no objection to this extension to include banks, the insurance sector and the conglomerates and pension funds. This is what clearly appears in the resolution too, but I consider it highly essential for us to look at the conditions that have to be created to enable Parliament to play a full part. We shall, however, be taking a closer look at this in the remainder of the debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, we are very much in favour of a swifter, more flexible and more transparent procedure. That is why we are also in favour of the objectives of the Lamfalussy procedure. However, it needs to be said here and now that we would not have a problem either with the timing or with the content of the results if the Council were able to work as rapidly and in such a Community-oriented way as the European Parliament. By way of example, I would like to mention the pension fund directive on company pensions. Parliament presented its report in nine months, whereas the Council took twenty-six.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that all dossiers affected by the Lamfalussy procedure are covered by the codecision procedure for the European Parliament. It has to be said that rules concerning technical details are very often not without some political angle. Nevertheless, we welcome the objectives of the Lamfalussy procedure – there can be no doubt about that. Nor are we fundamentally opposed to extending it. But I hope you will understand if we say that we do not believe in giving blank cheques.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I admit to having some concerns that the Lamfalussy/von Wogau procedure was only ever regarded as an interim measure, a transitional solution, and never as the end product. The end product, the final result, must be parity between the European Parliament and the Council. And we have not yet achieved that final result. We therefore welcome the amendments presented by Mr von Wogau to the Bourlanges report in the Committee on Institutional Affairs. We support the motion for a resolution adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. We expect the Commission to take this point on board in view of the statements made by President Prodi and Commissioner Bolkestein in the ‘shopping list’ presented to the convention. We also call upon the Heads of State and Government to make a declaration of intent at the summit in Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to propose a joint hearing of the Commission and of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with representatives of the CESR and of the market participants' committee on experience with the Lamfalussy procedure in relation to the market abuse and prospectus directives. Part of the purpose of this is to take account of this experience, which is not entirely positive, when preparing the next steps.</p>
<p class="contents">We also welcome the van den Burg report, and not only because some of my own amendments were adopted! A majority of us will be voting in favour of this report. However, I would like to point out that we do not think that the time has yet come for determining the optimum format for pan-European financial supervision. We are therefore also advocating that the Ministers for Economic and Financial Affairs and the national supervisory authorities should be called upon to arrange a comprehensive dialogue with all the relevant actors on an integrated European supervisory system, taking account of the role of national supervisory systems and the responsibilities of the ECB. I also support the enabling clause in connection with the convention, because we do not want to tie our hands in the event of a different political outcome occurring. This is not about setting the EU and the Member States against each other, but about an integrated supervisory system suitable for a new internal market in financial products. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having said that, it is more important than ever to distinguish between the issue of supervision and that of regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I approve of the very open approach that Mrs van den Burg has adopted in her report. I also approve of the way she has accordingly examined the various supervisory models that we have within the European Union without prescribing a definitive model. I say that because we need to develop a common approach, we need to learn from our experience, and we need above all to endeavour to keep this debate free of any dogmatic or ideological attitude towards a single position. That is why I believe that this report provides us with a good basis for the dialogue with the other institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to concentrate on the problems we face in connection with extending the Lamfalussy procedure, as what we are chiefly dealing with here is regulation. Mr President-in-Office, you were quite right in saying how necessary financial integration is, but that financial stability is also necessary. This is an area in which Parliament will not let itself be trumped by the Council or the Commission, because we believe that financial market stability is a good thing for the public and that we as Members of Parliament need to champion the preservation of that stability.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, however, constantly ask ourselves whether the process selected will help to contribute to that stability. When I consider that just nine months ago I supported – with a very heavy heart – an agreement that meant the Lamfalussy procedure was introduced for the area of investment regulation, it seems rather premature for us to be discussing the ‘birth of the Lamfalussy triplets’, by which I mean the extension of the Lamfalussy procedure to the three new areas of banking, insurance and financial conglomerates, let alone support it.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue here is not only, as I see it, that we do not yet have any experience whatsoever in this area. You know as well as I do that the first Lamfalussy directive, on market abuse, is still a long way from being transposed and that the second one is still waiting for a common position. No, the issue here is that the Commission has very clearly conceded that we still have no idea what urgent legislative proposals we may have to deal with. That is why it is so important for us to obtain an assurance from the Commission and from the Council that the eleventh commandment, transparency, will continue to be respected in the event of any extension of the Lamfalussy procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I think – and I am saying this expressly on behalf of this House – that we have scored some successes here. Transparency is certainly a core issue for a properly functioning democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not, however, just dealing here with the institutionalisation of further transparency mechanisms. No, we are also dealing with how we can make further progress with legislation. I believe that we have still not achieved institutional balance in the legislative procedure, and that we need to amend Article 202.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bolkestein has on several occasions pointed out to us that Parliament always has the option of blocking a further directive through the codecision procedure. But it is not a question of us blocking anything. This is all about constructive mutual cooperation. That is why, Mr President-in-Office, I am expecting the Finance Council, and also the European Council in Copenhagen, to agree upon a political declaration on the need for a treaty amendment in relation to secondary legislation, in relation to Parliament's will as regards enablement, and also in relation to the right of call back, and that they will work to achieve this, not forgetting all the legal implications which are bound to flow from this. There must be parity between the Council and Parliament as parties to the codecision process. This is a core issue for the future of this parliamentary democracy, which at the end of the day we all wish to achieve through the convention and through the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, if she will excuse me, I shall concentrate on the Lamfalussy procedure extension. This group is in favour of extending the Lamfalussy procedure to banking and insurance. You have only to see the detail of the decisions being taken in Basle on banks' capital adequacy to realise that it would be a nonsense to incorporate them into primary legislation. Our American counterparts have already allowed the introduction of all the Basle decisions by secondary legislation and to delay unnecessarily would put European banks at a competitive disadvantage.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Council of Ministers sometimes seems to have forgotten two important things. First, that Parliament is fully committed to the democratic oversight of committees that establish implementing legislation. Secondly, that the deal on applying Lamfalussy committees to the securities market was a strictly temporary measure, which is why there are four-year 'sunset clauses' agreed by the Council in both the prospectus and the market abuse directives. Temporary means temporary. If our democratic role in monitoring is to be effective, Article 202 of the Treaty must reflect codecision over implementing committees, otherwise there will be always be a bias in this House against the delegation of powers that are necessary to deal with some extremely technical matters.</p>
<p class="contents">For the sake of good governance and democratic oversight, the Member States should commit themselves – whether in a Council declaration or elsewhere – to a revision of Article 202, which not only introduces equivalent powers for Parliament and for the Council but also ensures there is proper oversight by this House and by the Council. Then we can proceed to extend Lamfalussy, again on a temporary basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We could well ask ourselves whether the Lamfalussy procedure is the most appropriate method and whether it should be extended. The procedure rests on the distinction between framework legislation and secondary legislation. In principle, this is justified, but is does pose a fundamental problem for the exercise of democracy. As co-legislator, Parliament must be placed on a strictly equal footing with the Council. Accordingly, it must have a call–back power. Along with my colleagues, I therefore call for Article 202 of the Treaties to be reformed. I appreciate the Commission’s commitment on this issue. I have noted what Mr Pedersen has said, and I await confirmation from the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The quality of consultation is another problem that concerns democratic control. A meaningful debate has yet to be held on the legislative programme. There is now a better consultation of professionals, but much remains to be done to improve consultation with other sections of civil society, and satisfactory schedules have still to be established.</p>
<p class="contents">On the whole, I welcome the principle of the Lamfalussy procedure, but I hope the process will be improved before it is in any way extended. Indeed, I call on those involved to ensure this is done.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe I am right in thinking that the Council has already ratified the selection of Ecofin Council. Consultation played no part in this decision which appears to me to be a denial of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">On the substance of the matter, I have actually had the opportunity to hear Alexandre Lamfalussy spell out the concerns. These revolve around a significant difference between banks and insurers with regard to the market and the prudential imperative, which is of the utmost importance. We are, however, aware that the national regulatory structures are not just different but entirely out of line with each other. This being the case, I was very surprised to hear Mr Pedersen advocating that we should now establish a single FSA type solution, even before the matter has been discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">A much wiser approach is offered by Mrs van den Burg’s report. It aims to introduce genuine coordination. It also proposes defining the role of the European Central Bank, which has an essential role as a lender of last resort.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to discuss one of the problems relating to the rules. It relates to our readiness to align our rules with those of the United States, and to work towards an integrated transatlantic market. This is a crucial political issue that we have not yet debated. I agree with bringing our rules into line with each other, but we must work on the basis that we are devising our own models. Members of the European banking sector have already publicly and courageously raised the question of accounting standards. These professionals do not want to see their establishments and depositors threatened by insecurity, which would ensue if reference were made to market values in drawing up balance sheets. I have to say that the Council acted irresponsibly when it conferred full powers on the IAS board. When the fundamental rules and standards protecting the general interest of the people of Europe are at issue, the issue of democratic control should figure more prominently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The debate about enlargement and its consequences for existing and new legislation makes us aware of the differences that exist, alongside many similarities, between the Member States and the candidate countries. There is a major difference in the area of the social market economy and the independent supervision of its performance.</p>
<p class="contents">A social market economy in good working order is one of the conditions for accession of the candidate countries to the European Union. There is no precise description of what a social market economy in good working order is. What is apparent though is that our own market economy is not yet performing to optimum effect. A report has after all been written under the direction of Mr Lamfalussy with recommendations for the improvement of the financial markets.</p>
<p class="contents">A prime objective of the Lamfalussy procedure is improvement of the control and the supervision of the financial markets. I do however have serious concerns about the developments regarding independent supervision in the accession countries. The creation of frameworks within which the financial markets can operate is in my view a task for government. Given the development of the markets to a global size and a worldwide sphere of activity, it is very important that supervision and enforcement are organised effectively. In this way the citizen can be protected and undesirable excesses can be controlled.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the developments in the financial markets will have an impact on the countries that will be acceding to the European Union over the next few years. I should therefore like to ask Commissioner Bolkestein how he thinks independent supervision in the accession countries can be adequately achieved. Do you expect the candidate countries in the short term to be able to meet the guidelines that cover the area of the financial markets at the same level as the present Member States?</p>

Of course, the cases mentioned most often in the report – Enron and WorldCom, and Vivendi and others in other respects – force us to reflect on the effectiveness of the systems that protect the interests of savers and, in more general terms, market operators, not least in order to satisfy the interest of European consumers, users and investors.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it timely that the report points out that there is no evidence that Europe is immune to such dramatic crises. It is good there has been an Enron scandal, not so much because of the new laws that have resulted and will result from it, but because the scandal has made investors and pension funds more aware of the need for supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">Before we condemn the American system, we must first remember that the overall fall on the Dow Jones index this year has been 16%, while in the euro area the stock exchange indexes have recorded a fall of 34%. Savers have seen a far greater value knocked off their savings in Europe, therefore, than has happened in this <span class="italic">annus horribilis</span> for the United States – and in Germany there has been a fall of up to 40%.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as much prudence is needed, I believe (and the report gives a very well-balanced definition in this regard) when citing new rules as a panacea for the ills or difficulties that the markets may encounter, especially if public control is mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by mentioning a more specific point concerning the integration of the financial markets. I think keeping prudential and credit supervision at a national level, that is in the central banks, is more and more questionable, especially when – as is the case in Italy – the same institution, the central bank, not only deals with prudential supervision but also takes on antitrust functions in the credit market, thus creating a conflict of interests that does not encourage market efficiency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Villiers (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I support the extension of the Lamfalussy procedure in principle and I hope the interinstitutional difficulties can be resolved as soon as possible, so we can move forward and modernise decision-making structures in relation to banking, insurance and financial conglomerates. All the institutions need to work together to make this possible and I hope in particular that the Council will be able to make a declaration signalling its willingness to review Article 202 in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome significant parts of the van den Burg report: its focus on improved enforcement, its call for supervisors to be given some discretion and to be allowed to exercise judgement rather than inflexibly and unthinkingly enforcing rules and ticking boxes. We also support the call for a regulatory cost-impact assessment by the Commission and by Parliament for its amendments. We agree that there is a need for more cooperation between national supervisors and enhanced links and dialogue with the US.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of a single pan-European supervisor, we have some divergence of views within our group. We are united in our view that it would be wrong to set up a pan-European supervisor now or in the medium term. Some of us in the British Conservatives would rule it out in principle, others within the PPE-DE Group would like to keep the option open as a very long-term possibility. I oppose a pan-European supervisor because it would have too much power. The concentration of power in, for example, the UK's Financial Services Authority, is very daunting in itself. A European equivalent would be a bureaucratic behemoth, unable to keep up with the dynamism and innovation of financial markets. A pan-European regulator would not have the expertise to deal with transactions and markets as diverse as, for example, the London derivatives market and the many thousands of small German savings and public banks. An effective regulator must be close to and must understand the markets it regulates.</p>
<p class="contents">A single enforcer for financial services in the EU would have an impossible job, given the divergence of rules and legal systems across the EU. Financial regulators play a key role in prosecution and criminal justice, and these are matters which should remain within the remit of the Member States. There is so much other work to be done to create a single market in financial services and to really deliver those benefits that the Commission report talked about only a few days ago. EU decision-makers should accept that a centralised solution is not always the best solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Radwan (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, there is support for an integrated financial market in Europe, and to this end we must draft appropriate rules speedily and in line with the interests of the market and implement them in Parliament. This was why the Committee of Wise Men created the Lamfalussy procedure. The goal is to achieve faster and better legislation. That was the original intention, and that was why Mr Lamfalussy launched this project, which was then supplemented by the von Wogau report. In general terms, we endorse it. However, we must measure the process as a whole in terms of whether the objectives are being achieved. Fast and better legislation is the goal, as has already been stated. It is not primarily due to Parliament that the legislation did not go through as speedily as had been hoped, and the Council must certainly examine its own role in this context as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Before we deal with the issue of implementing the extended CESR-Lamfalussy procedure in other sectors, such as banking, insurance and conglomerates, we must ask one critical question first: how is CESR working today? Is CESR effective in the areas in which it operates? A great many questions and outright criticism can still be heard from various sectors of the market. I think that the first issue we should raise here is that of transparency, and of whether it is sensible for CESR to begin its work already, in parallel with draft directives. The question is whether we are willing to accept this in this form. I am in two minds here: on the one hand, I am fundamentally opposed to CESR working in parallel to a draft directive. We have this situation at the moment with the Prospectus Directive. Here, CESR should wait and see what Parliament and the Council decide before it embarks on its work.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I am actually quite grateful for the fact that CESR does work in parallel, because this means that we find out in time what is going on in CESR's minds and can put the brakes on during the legislative process if necessary. In this context, the issue of technical details undoubtedly arises as well. I almost have the impression that technical detail is regarded as almost anything which, from the Commission's perspective, an average MEP is unlikely to understand – which would cover quite a lot.</p>
<p class="contents">However, with regard to the technical details, we should not overlook the fact – and Basle II has already been mentioned – that there is of course political potential here too: there is conflict potential which will only become apparent over the course of time.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, it is not enough merely to review Article 202; it must be amended. I would have liked to hear braver words from the Presidency today. These brave words must be heard in Copenhagen, at the latest. We need clear words that send out a clear signal that the Council and Parliament stand side by side on an equal basis. There are constant calls to Parliament to the effect that the interests of the market demand fast legislation. There is general agreement with this position, but I urge the Council to take Parliament's arguments seriously. There will be discussions and serious debates, and we do not want any buck-passing on this issue. This is why Copenhagen will be a good opportunity to send out a clear signal on Article 202.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies – and I endorse Commissioner Bolkestein's comments on this point – to the future role of the Commission. The Commission must retain its central role, for it is the Commission which implements and monitors the interests of Europe as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me say a few words about integrated financial supervision in Europe. We must ensure that regional aspects are taken into account. For this reason, I broadly endorse my colleague Mrs Villiers' comments that we do not need an integrated financial regulator at present. We must, of course, also give some thought as to how large European companies will operate in this area in future. Here, I see positive models in the Financial Conglomerates Directive, which sets out a course which we can follow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Medina Ortega (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, to outside observers, this afternoon’s two issues could seem too esoteric and technical, but, as various speakers have pointed out, these are issues which are affecting the lives of the citizens and, at the moment, as a result of the great international scandals, they are affecting consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Enron case in the United States has been mentioned, but, in my country, Spain, for example, we have a great financial scandal going on, the <span class="italic">Gescartera</span> case, which has led to the resignation of several top government figures and which could threaten others – the Spanish Parliament is investigating the situation at the moment. When we talk about financial services, we are talking about something which affects the lives of ordinary citizens. It affects their pensions and the future of their savings.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently trying to create pan-European financial services, which transcend the borders of Europe. We are concerned to guarantee our companies the greatest possible freedom and the greatest possible opportunity to act within Europe, but, unless we establish a pan-European system of monitoring, so that the operation of these companies is controlled, we run the risk of the kind of frauds and scandals currently taking place on an exclusively national level taking place throughout the European Union. I believe that a system of liberalising financial services throughout the Community is inconceivable unless it is accompanied by a system of monitoring financial activities throughout the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">We all agree that this issue requires democracy. Democracy means ‘people’s government’, and this is only possible by means of parliamentary representation – in Greece direct democracy was possible because all the citizens met in a public square. The attempt to replace democracy with a system of public consultation, without recourse to the ballot box, by means of computers or public consultations for example – as Commissioner Bolkestein said – is deceitful. The only consultation there is room for today is a public consultation by means of the ballot box and by means of legally elected representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, for example, there is talk of a procedure according to which the Commission’s proposals could be blocked by a simple consultation with business sectors. I believe that nothing could be less democratic than to name the interlocutors who would represent that democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore move on to the final point: the proposals of Mrs Randzio-Plath. Co-decision is not something arbitrary, it is a procedure that has meant the participation of Parliament and is the result of a political process. It is true that there is an execution phase and a delegation phase, and that it could be argued that, since the execution falls to the Governments of the Member States, Parliament should get involved in this phase, which is outside the actual activity of control. But, in the legislative field, if we speak for example of delegated rules, I cannot see that it is possible to follow the Lamfalussy procedure unless we establish clear participation by Parliament, by means of the so-called call-back measures. In other words, Parliament, as the legally elected representative of the people, has the right and the obligation to participate in the monitoring of legislative development.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Randzio-Plath has pointed out, we have just adopted the Lamfalussy procedure, we do not yet have any experience of how it is working and we want to continue to restrict the possible participation of Parliament without verifying whether this procedure is working effectively. Let us see how it is working first, let us see that democratic guarantees are really maintained and, if they are, you may rest assured, Commissioner and Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that this Parliament will be prepared to participate to the full.</p>
<p class="contents">But democracy cannot consist of participation - for example – by companies, in arbitrary fora, in consultations of a particular nature. No committee can replace the will of the people and that will is only expressed by means of elections, Parliaments and parliamentary representation. This Parliament’s operating system can be improved, the parliamentary structures can be changed in the new constitution, but anything other than the adoption of legislation by means of an instrument elected by the people, with a normal electoral procedure, would be deceitful and would be a way to put decisions into the hands, perhaps, of the very people who would then act as predators to the detriment of the consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we must strengthen our monitoring procedure, strengthen our mechanisms and make them as flexible as possible, and this should be done by means of parliamentary participation throughout the legislative process, from top to bottom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is certainly a need to extend them to other financial sectors and to include appropriate provisions in the Treaty for this. But before taking this step, a proper assessment must be made of these measures in the light of experience.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of secondary legislation was also noted in the Convention Working Group on Economic Governance, of which I was a member. The Hänsch working group and later the plenary Convention meeting noted that this raises horizontal questions in the area of comitology, such as the role of the European Parliament, which go beyond the terms of reference of the Hänsch working group and should therefore be addressed by other groups. We are expecting the Convention to look at the issue in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Hänsch working group, MEPs like Mrs Berès and I tried to secure an agreement from the working group that the Treaty should be amended in order to give Parliament a formal call-back right within the framework of this procedure. I challenge Mr Bolkestein's view that it is impossible for the Council to give us a political commitment. If there is enough political will in the Council, anything is possible. It is nonsense to say that Treaty changes can only be made in the IGC. That is legal mumbo jumbo. If there is a real political will in the Council, it can be done. I still feel that Mr Petersen could be more precise in his words.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lamfalussy procedure should also be taken into account in the national development of the financial services sector. We also need more transatlantic dialogue in the financial services sector at a legislative level. That is very important. I would, in addition, like to emphasise the role of consultation. Consultation processes, as Mr Herzog said, must be formalised and as transparent as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I endorse our rapporteur's point about the enabling clause. If it were to be decided that we need a supranational financial supervision authority, that possibility needs to be provided for in the Treaty after the Convention at the next IGC. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Katiforis (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I would like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs van den Burg, for the excellent work she has done in preparing this report on the future of financial regulation in Europe, which is such a complicated and controversial subject.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise that after the global economic downturn which started through the collapse of the new technology market, what was stunningly shown in the United States was the danger of <span class="italic">laisser faire</span> regulation in a booming market. Would the financial accounting scandals have occurred had regulation been as intensive as it is now? I wager it would not. Of course this question can be countered by asking whether it would have been possible to introduce such strict regulations in a booming market. A booming market has been known to act as a great catalyst to taking liberties with the law and even with honesty. It is perhaps one advantage of the market slump that we have at the moment that we can use this opportunity to introduce the kind of regulation that will stand us in good stead when euphoria takes over in the financial markets again, as it inevitably will.</p>
<p class="contents">One can ask whether the down-turn would have been as steep had we not had wave after wave of revelations about the lack of internal controls and external oversight. Again, one would say no, but now is the time to strengthen the rules for when the good times return, in a reversal of the fat cows, lean cows story.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not arguing in favour of heavy-handed regulation nor for regulation that goes against the spirit of the internal market or the financial services action plan. I am quite sure that the vast majority of Parliamentarians are in favour of creating a single market in financial services in Europe, as we have shown over the past couple of years in the various positions adopted on financial services action plan legislation. I do not share some of my colleagues' compunctions about a European regulator. I do not see that the Securities and Exchange Commission has done any harm in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much evidence, including the Gyllenhammar report, supporting the benefits of a unified financial market and showing that the integration of the financial services market in Europe would bring substantial economic benefits. That is only to be expected. Anything that would prop up the investment process in our economy is bound to bring financial benefits because we are so weak in this area. According to the report, gains could be in the region of at least half a percentage point per annum in additional economic growth. One could also call upon the evidence of the results of the new survey published only last week by the Commission, which suggested that total European employment could increase by half a percentage point over the next decade as a result of financial markets integration.</p>
<p class="contents">One must accept that increased integration increases the responsibilities of the European institutions to actually discover the best form of regulation, to consult as thoroughly as possible, to implement and interpret legislation as consistently as possible and, when problems arise, to be flexible. So far, I fear that under the new Lamfalussy procedures there is not sufficient evidence that the Commission has been operating according to these consultation principles. Lack of initial consultation over the draft market abuse directive and last minute changes to the draft of the investment services directive are not good signs. I would argue, therefore, that we must be very cautious in extending the Lamfalussy procedures to other financial services fields. We must have time and the proper analysis of how the process has been functioning. The institutional monitoring group on the Lamfalussy procedure has not yet produced their first report. Under these circumstances I am against any hurried extension of the Lamfalussy procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as I can see, we agree on the essence of the problem that we are attempting to solve. We agree that there is a need for financial stability, for effective harmonisation of the legislation in this area and for effective cooperation and convergence between the financial supervisory authorities. I see too that note has been taken of the Commission’s report on the growth opportunities in the financial sphere through the introduction of the new structures, the inference being that we can contribute to growth and employment. The Council and Parliament have a common responsibility in respect of the major problems that we see in the Member States in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have a couple of individual comments, particularly to Mr Herzog, who says that I said, or let it be understood, that I was in favour of unitary supervision. On this point, I must not have expressed myself clearly, because unitary supervision is precisely what I am not advocating. We are advocating national supervision, that is to say a national solution, and then we must cooperate within the EU. It is not a case of unitary supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mrs van den Burg, I can say that I understand her views regarding the content. Regarding the comment that the Council should look more to a market structure, I can say that we would like to get out of the dilemma that has characterised previous attempts to solve problems whilst discussing market structures, for we wish to signal that we respect Parliament and the role of Parliament. We particularly mention this in order to put a stop to the eternal power struggle between Parliament and the Council. We each have our own responsibilities to deal with, whether we are elected to the European Parliament or elected in national parliaments and are members of a government. I can well understand Parliament’s various wishes. I would wish the same, were I a Member of the European Parliament. I consider them entirely legitimate. The problem is simply that if, like Mrs Kauppi, one says that the Ecofin Council can simply decide to amend the Treaty, that is not in fact the case. Moreover, it would be a poor principle if the Ecofin Council had those powers. Consequently, it is necessary for me to refer to the fact that it is for the Convention, and subsequently the Intergovernmental Conference, to amend the Treaty. What I am able to offer is the fact that we are taking these matters seriously and that we in the Ecofin Council are doing what we can but will also tell our Heads of State very clearly which attitudes prevail in the European Parliament, because the Ecofin Council does not have a vote in the Convention, but our Heads of State do, the countries do, and we should exploit this opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me on to say to Mr Blokland that the European Parliament is able to exercise influence, our wish in this connection being for the directives to be equipped with the same sunset clause as we are familiar with from the securities market. That means, moreover, that there must be a review in 2004 and that, if there is not then agreement on the Convention's conclusions or on the governments' conclusions at the Intergovernmental Conference, then these directives will lapse. Parliament is able to exercise that influence. I would simply call upon you to take account in your statement of what the Ecofin Council is able to do and deliver and refer to the responsibility that we have to get the capital markets to work effectively so that we each make a contribution to growth and employment in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my thanks for the debate. Thank you very much for your views, which I shall pass on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I gather from the various interventions made this afternoon on this subject that there is general acceptance of the extension of the Lamfalussy procedure into new areas such as banking, insurance companies and conglomerates. There are differences of opinion about how precisely that ought to be done, but the general principle seems to be accepted, which is a good thing. Many Members of this House have mentioned the matter of Article 202. This is only natural, and in my first speech this afternoon I indicated that the Commission agrees with Parliament on this point and that the Commission has been quite clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Having made these two points, perhaps I may go into further detail as to what the Members of Parliament have said. Firstly Mrs van den Burg said that she wants a practical approach – which is always a good thing – and I would certainly agree with her on that. She wants more cooperation and more supervision, but as part of a steady process and not all at once. Again I agree with her.</p>
<p class="contents">She supported the Commission, saying that it ought to be strong, and I would not disagree with that statement. Indeed, a strong Commission is necessary in order to preserve the institutional balance. She then mentioned the intriguing subject of the enabling clause, and whether there should not be an enabling clause in the Convention or IGC.</p>
<p class="contents">From the debate this afternoon I notice that there is a difference of opinion on that subject. Mrs Villiers is very much against. Mrs Kauppi is very much in favour and Mr Radwan, like Mrs Villiers, is also against, so the score is two against two – at least in this debate. We should follow Mrs van den Burg's careful approach because the present Treaty already contains points which may be used by the ECB to do a lot of important work in this area. These concern the interface between macroeconomic developments and microeconomic solutions and you will find the text in Article 105(6) of the EU Treaty. There is no obstacle, at least on the part of the ECB, to it doing this work. The whole subject will have to be thoroughly considered in the years to come and the Lamfalussy procedure is essential for that particular point.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel to that discussion, the supervisors must cooperate more actively than at present.</p>
<p class="contents">As for myself, I remain somewhat sceptical about that enabling clause. It does not commit you to anything. However, let us wait and see how these things develop. I am very much aware of the various sensibilities of supervisors in this area, so let us remember the good old British saying: that fools rush in where angels fear to tread.</p>
<p class="contents">I then come to Mr Karas, who unfortunately has had to leave. He calls the Lamfalussy procedure the Lamfalussy-von Wogau process. I shall allow him to attach the name of a member of his party to this process, although I would rather call it the Lamfalussy-Randzio-Plath process. However, that is a detail and I do not wish to be controversial. He said that it is a temporary solution. Mr Huhne also mentioned this, referring to the 'sunset clause' and so on. I agree. It will come under discussion again in the 2004 IGC. However, let us use the time between now and then to clarify our thoughts and to agree as far as possible on the best way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Randzio-Plath said that it is too early. That is an argument that she has used before. Let me repeat what I said earlier. It seems to me that we should start relatively soon to prepare for the decisions ahead. New committees and new structures will need to be set up. New legal acts will be required and all that takes time. As I have already said, it will also shape the type of directives which we aim to bring forward. We must also take into account the need to advance so that we have efficient decision-making structures before enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Randzio-Plath repeated the same arguments that other Members of Parliament have used, i.e. there must be equality between the Council and Parliament and the change to Article 202. I agree with her.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Huhne also expressed his support for the extension of the Lamfalussy procedure. He mentioned its temporary nature and pointed to the 'sunset clause'. He thought Parliament should have the possibility of calling back implementing measures. That hangs together with the equality between the Council and Parliament, and I cannot but agree with him.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Blokland asked me how I could be certain that there would the same independence of supervisors in the candidate countries as we have ourselves. He is right to say that independent supervision in all candidate countries is of great importance. Furthermore, we have been examining the systems and the organisations of the candidate countries with the supervisors of all Member States over the past four years with precisely that aim in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">May I also say that quite considerable progress has been made by the candidate countries. We must realise they have come a long way and made quite considerable progress, even though not everything is as it should be in certain areas. Therefore we must monitor the developments in the candidate countries because there is an essential need for an independent regulatory and supervisory agency there. We have organised a programme of cooperation so that we can help candidate countries improve the quality of their supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Villiers devoted much of her time to opposing the decision to steer the developments in the direction of having a single European supervisor. I have already spoken about that issue and, as far as the Commission is concerned, it will defer to Parliament and it can take a decision. The Commission itself would leave this matter somewhat in abeyance.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Radwan spoke about CESAR and asked how CESAR was working. To this I would like to say that CESAR is a new organisation which needs time to develop itself and to find a proper way of acting. As far as I know CESAR has already accomplished remarkable things in the short time it has been in existence. I have indeed heard some criticism and complaints about CESAR – I stress the word 'some' – which I have drawn attention to. The complaints basically refer to its lack of transparency and consultation. I have made those points and I remain convinced that CESAR will become a very useful committee which we can all make use of. This is also why we have the interinstitutional monitoring group. Mrs Randzio-Plath, myself and others have decided to establish this interinstitutional monitoring group so that complaints, such as those mentioned by Mr Radwan, can be dealt with in a proper manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Medina Ortega has made reference to certain scandals in the country which he knows best. He has said that only democratically elected representatives should have the possibility of calling back implementing measures. This is the same argument which has been made by others and, as I have said, I can only agree with him.</p>
<p class="contents">Then I would like to congratulate Mrs Kauppi on her use of language – the expression 'mumbo jumbo' is not often used in Parliament but it is very colourful and it explains precisely what she means. That is always a good thing, after all, what would we do if there were no clarity in what we said? She wants the call-back rights for Parliament which we discussed earlier. She also says that there must be a political will in Council. Let us not be distracted by 'mumbo jumbo' is what she has said. I must refer Mrs Kauppi to the President of Council, Minister Pedersen, present here tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">She also says there should be a more active transatlantic dialogue and I can assure her that dialogue exists and is active. In particular, the Director General for Competition, Mr Alex Schaub, has just come back from Washington today where he has these discussions on Capitol Hill in Congress about the so-called Sarbanes-Oxley Act which indeed presents a lot of problems to European auditing companies and other companies quoted on US stock exchanges. I myself will be visiting Washington in a few weeks' time and I intend to discuss these matters with the chairman or acting chairman of the securities exchange commission. This would be a continuation of the discussion we had with Mr Harvey Pitt in Brussels about a month ago. That discussion was very fruitful. Unfortunately, as we all know, he has now resigned and we shall have to pick up the thread where we left it when he visited Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I can assure Mrs Kauppi that this dialogue is essential because we want to achieve this great big transatlantic integrated market for financial services. We cannot do without it, but those relations should be on the basis of reciprocity and mutual recognition. I can assure all Members of Parliament that it is a top priority in my view to join with the United States in a programme of convergence. That is what I would like to say to Members of Parliament who have spoken tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr Katiforis has enjoined the Commission to be cautious. I am certainly cautious in all I do. So I would like to reassure Mr Katiforis in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
