<p class="contents">We talk of psycho-social occupational health and safety risks, which would include violence at work, harassment, bullying, stress and anxiety, as new emerging risks. I am beginning to wonder how long we can carry on describing them as 'new emerging risks'. I was looking back through some of my old papers recently and I saw that the group of trade union health and safety officers I was working with at that time, in the late 1980s, was already using that description then. Here we are, 15 years later, still using the same phrase and little, if anything, has been done at EU level to tackle these risks directly.</p>
<p class="contents">I also realise on rereading our question that at least one element of it looks a little silly, namely the part that asks: 'Does the Commission intend to act rapidly in this field?' The answer is clearly 'no'. The excellent report produced by Mr Andersson and adopted in 2001 made two calls for action. It called on the Commission to publish a Green Paper and action plan no later than the end of 2002. We are still awaiting a response.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the report called on the Commission either to extend the scope of the Framework Directive on Health and Safety, or to draft a new directive to combat harassment at the workplace. Again, we are still waiting for a response. We would like to know what action, if any, the Commission intends to take in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that many Members of this House are becoming increasingly angry and frustrated at the disgraceful way in which work by the Commission on health and safety matters has ground to a complete halt in recent years. The Commission's Health and Safety Strategy for the 2002-2006 period is proving to be the sham I suspected it would be. When I produced Parliament's report on that strategy, I was seriously considering recommending its rejection unless it was accompanied by a detailed action plan. We received certain assurances from Commissioner Diamantopoulou and, as a result, we adopted a report which was critical but fell short of rejection. I now recognise that it was a bad mistake. Exactly the sort of drift, devoid of action, which I feared has ensued. I do not blame Commissioner Diamantopoulou herself, but it is clear there are high-level officials in DG-Employment that take a different view. This policy area is completely sidelined.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy itself touched on risks in this area. Under the heading 'Taking account of new risks', it says, 'The increase in psycho-social problems and illnesses is posing a new challenge to health and safety at work and is compromising moves to improve well-being at work. The various forms of psychological harassment and violence at work likewise pose a special problem nowadays, requiring legislative action'. On the next page under the heading 'The Commission will', it says, 'examine the appropriateness and the scope of a Community instrument on psychological harassment and violence at work'. Well, we are still waiting. The work programme for this year mentions an instrument on violence but not on psychological harassment.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is this: I have heard it said that it is difficult to legislate in this field for the problem is too complex, diffuse or subjective. Two Member States already have legislation in this field: Sweden and Belgium. What that means is that it is clearly possible to legislate and that some EU workers have legal protection, while the vast majority do not. That is the clearest justification for EU-level legislative action. These risks are causing tremendous suffering and anguish among workers within the European Union. It is high time that the Commission acted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, first I should like to thank Mr Hughes, Mr De Rossa and Mr Andersson for their interest in the question of harassment at the workplace, which clearly helps the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that I do not accept Mr Hughes' overall criticism; I understand Parliament's reaction on this specific matter which, as Mr Hughes also admitted, is extremely complex and difficult, because the situation differs considerably from one country to another. Legislation on and the definition of questions of bullying are an extremely difficult issue, but to say that nothing is being done on health and safety is, I would say, a negative exaggeration. I should like to remind Mr Hughes that, during the last six Presidencies, there has not, I think, been one single Presidency during which legislation on health and safety was not adopted. I would remind you that the programme of the Irish Presidency contains 2 directives: one is being completed and for the other, which concerns problems in the field of optical radiation, a dialogue is due to start with the social partners, as is the first seminar of the Irish Presidency. Consequently, it is clear that the Commission has moved forward, especially on legislation which is both innovative, given that there is none in most Member States, and also very difficult to agree on, given that, as you know, the social partners do not generally agree.</p>
<p class="contents">I take your criticism about this specific area as very positive, but I would ask you not to generalise, given that, as you know, health and safety were Commission priorities during this period. The Commission presented a communication with a White Paper on health and safety for the years up to 2006, which clearly states that the Commission will examine the suitability and advisability of a Community measure on psychological harassment and violence at work.</p>
<p class="contents">At this specific stage, the Commission services are working on this particular problem, collecting and analysing the information available in all the countries. This analysis takes account, among other things, of the legislative and regulatory initiatives which are being approved or planned in each Member State, together with the results from and difficulties in implementing them.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that, within this framework, the resolution by the European Parliament on harassment at the workplace, to which Mr Hughes referred, the motion by Mr Andersson and the opinion on violence at work approved by the Advisory Committee for Safety, Hygiene and Protection at Work are closely related texts, which are being studied carefully and will support our efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hughes asked for a timetable. I must therefore say that the Commission will be starting its consultations on Community action in this sector with the social partners in 2004, in accordance with Article 138 of the Treaty and, as you know, these consultations are included in the Commission's programme of work for 2004, which has been announced. I should point out here that, depending on the reactions of the social partners to these consultations, the choice of specific Community legislation with the aim of preventing all forms of violence at work is one but not always the only action.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the new Community health and safety at work strategy for 2002-2006 refers to the possibility of using a combination of the means available, both legislative and non-legislative. Thus, in the aim of achieving efficient prevention of all forms of violence at work, other non-binding measures, such as recommendations or other non-legislative initiatives, such as guidelines, information and awareness-raising campaigns and enhanced training activities for employers and employees, may be complementary rather than mutually exclusive actions, in conjunction, of course, with a legislative text.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission considers that bullying and harassment are specific forms of violence at work. I must say that sexual harassment is also a form of violence, on which legislation was passed two years ago. That is why the aforementioned consultations with the social partners will cover every form of violence which undermines the health, physical and psychological integrity and dignity of employees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Anyone who, like Mr Andersson and myself, has concerned themselves with this issue, will have discovered the depths to which people can sink in their dealings with one another. Of all workers in the EU, 8% say that they themselves have been affected by harassment. That is what is officially recorded; the true figure may well be many times higher. The report discusses in depth the causes and effects of bullying and sexual harassment in the workplace and the circumstances that lead to it. The extent to which violence and harassment occur in the workplace amounts to an extremely serious problem. As the report describes, they result in extreme physical and mental stress, to the extent of making people seriously ill. It has an effect even on people’s private lives, is a burden on social security funds and hampers general economic performance. Combating this problem is an extremely difficult undertaking. It will scarcely be possible to come up with a standard definition of the phenomenon. It was the Commission that was given the task of bringing to light other factors that encourage harassment; only when we have a clear picture of the true extent of the problem will we be able to take appropriate action to deal with it.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission able to comply with this request within the foreseeable future? It is my conviction that combating harassment at work is a matter for the Member States. The social partners, legislators at national level, educational institutions and associations need especial support in their efforts to combat it. It would make sense for there to be a European publicity campaign to put this problem centre stage and rouse the public in the EU. That might put a stop to their indifference. Harassment, whether sexual or not, is not a trifling offence; it is a crime the war on which must start where the crime is committed. This means that it is doubtful that any European directive would be effective, but can the Commission put forward proposals as to how individual efforts in the Member States might be supported? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that this is a major problem. It is present in all the Member States and probably to approximately the same degree, as indicated by the studies conducted by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions<span class="bold"> </span>(the Dublin Foundation), which calculated a figure of eight per cent. This may be compared with the figure of four per cent for violence in the workplace and two per cent for sexual harassment. Overall, this type of harassment – outright violence, psychological violence and sexual harassment – is a major problem.</p>
<p class="contents">We may also assume that this is a growing problem. Why may we do so? Because there was a clear link between this problem and stress and tension in the workplace. We know how the labour market is changing at present. The labour market is changing, and working conditions have become uncertain. Job security also used to be very important. We now see a change when it comes to the organisation of working life. We have insecurity and less certainty in the workplace, which also means that this problem is probably becoming more serious.</p>
<p class="contents">On the earlier occasion, we demanded, firstly, an analysis in the form of a Green Paper providing us with a more detailed picture of the situation and, secondly, possible legislation too, but those were not the only instruments. So imagine, then, our frustration when we now perceive that nothing has happened.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I share your view when you say that it is now important to make contact with both sides of industry. It is also true that it is important to use a wide range of instruments, because the legal instrument is not enough. We probably have to work on issues relating to influence and the organisation of work and to review how matters operate out in the workplace, but we also need legal instruments. Now that measures are to be proposed and implemented to combat violence in the workplace, this is an excellent opportunity also to take account of psychological violence, including harassment, in the workplace. This is an opportunity to do just that. Legal instruments and best practice are required in relation to work organisation issues at European level. Nothing very much has happened at Member State level. In Sweden, we already had legislation, and Belgium has introduced legislation, but otherwise nothing very much has happened. Because this is a Community area, involving health and safety in the workplace, we and the Commission have a responsibility in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would agree, as I hope all sides of the House would agree, that harassment is a serious problem wherever it occurs. It may only occur on some occasions, in some companies, with some people, but whenever it does occur it is a serious problem for those people and must be deplored and indeed addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">By harassment at the 'workplace' we do not just mean at the traditional workplace, between employee and employee, or employer and employee, but also at places such as schools, between pupils and teachers, where cases of harassment and bullying are increasingly common. However, in all those circumstances I fundamentally disagree with Mr Hughes on his key point that wherever there is a problem the solution always has to be legislation, and that wherever there has to be legislation the solution is always legislation at EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">We need better management and we need to pay closer attention to the issue, but that does not mean we need a legalistic approach. We need a commonsense approach rather than EU law. I agree with the Commissioner and think she is right to reject the criticism that was made of her and should continue to do so. It is true, as Mr Hughes said, that some officials in DG-Employment take a different view. There are many people and, I hope, an increasingly large group of people who will take a different view.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and perhaps in a lighter vein, Mr Hughes talks about psychological harassment at the workplace. I face constant psychological harassment at my workplace, which is the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, mainly because I constantly have to address reports by Mr Hughes. I suspect that legislation is not going to stop that from occurring! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I still recall – as I think we all can – the initiative launched in Germany 30 years ago, which aimed to humanise the working environment and our recent discussion of a communication from the Commission on modernising the organisation of work. We also remember how the Belgian Presidency took an initiative to improve the quality of work, but all that was not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">I can understand you when you say, Commissioner, that the Member States assess and evaluate these things differently, but we cannot fail to see that all industrialised nations have the same problem. I agree with Mr Andersson when he says that this is not about the 8% of workers investigated by Eurofound in Dublin – amounting in any case to 12 million employees – but, unfortunately, about the way in which this phenomenon is on the increase and the figures are rising. The fact that people are working under greater pressure in many sectors, including the services sector, makes harassment a bigger and more difficult problem. I therefore agree with all my fellow-members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists on the need for a legal framework. Necessary though they are – I am in agreement with that – awareness campaigns are not enough!</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we know how bold you are when it comes to dealing with the inertia of certain Member States. We know that it will be more difficult to submit legislation on this than on such things as a ban on asbestos or protection against noise. We know, too, that many major companies have their own rules already – I know that Volkswagen does, and so do others. There are many of them, but most have nothing yet, and the majority of employers have not yet recognised how many euros they are losing as a result of time lost because workers are off sick, because of reduced motivation, because people become resigned to their lot, because they become less enthusiastic about work or lose their enthusiasm altogether – all of this caused by harassment. The fact is that if employers were to acknowledge this, we would not be having these problems. Since we do, though, we need to create a legal framework, and the protection of workers from occupational hazards is Europe’s responsibility. The task is ours, and we should get on with it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Essentially, we can say that amongst the basic elements of this conduct appear the intention to do harm – whether by an employer, by managers or by work colleagues – the causing of harm within the sphere of the most essential personal rights and its complex, continued, predetermined and systematic nature.</p>
<p class="contents">True harassment means hostile conduct against the personal dignity of the victim, insults, gibes, mockery, criticism, ridicule; these are hostile forms of conduct against their professionalism, which are manifested in monotonous, unnecessary, denigrating, abusive and disproportionate tasks. From time to time, we see in the media – and not just the sensationalist media – situations of this type, situations which, furthermore, occur directly or indirectly, that is to say, the creation of situations of ambiguity, the over-emphasis of errors and underplaying of achievements. These are situations that sometimes take the form of an externalised conflict and that on other occasions create or maintain a latent conflict, with repercussions for the person psychologically harassed, their family and their friends.</p>
<p class="contents">The existence of these situations is always difficult to prove or demonstrate, and often difficult to classify from a legal point of view or as an administrative offence. Article 31(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights lays down that ‘Every worker has the right to working conditions which respect his or her health, safety and dignity’, and, according to Article 1, ‘Human dignity is inviolable. It must be respected and protected’.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I believe that a great deal has been done during this legislature in the field of health and safety in the workplace, but the situation I have described, fortunately or otherwise, warrants our getting to work, because, just as on other occasions we have referred to the protection of dignity and the right to health and safety, in this case we must clearly confront the need to protect human dignity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the moral and psycho-social working environment, indeed the spirit of the workplace, are fundamental values that are deeply undervalued in the perhaps unduly soulless societies that our European welfare states have become. I believe it is completely inexcusable for employees to be harassed in their workplaces and not to be seen as employees and as the human beings they are, and to be fully valued as such. How we behave towards each other is a question of decency. It is also, ultimately, a question of civilisation and a question of how we see each other as people. I wish to thank you for being so positive in emphasising this important matter of the working environment. I believe, as previous debaters have said – and we are agreed about this here in the House – that this is an extremely important and undervalued area.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on, now, to your request, Mr Andersson and Mr Hughes, you seriously doubt that there is sufficient protection in national legislation. Are we certain of that? We can in fact have confidence that Swedish legislation, followed by Belgian legislation, can set a sound and healthy pattern in the rest of Europe. Let us not rule out that way, because it has still not been tried in very many countries. Hand on heart, is it really the case that, as a result of European legislation, this issue would be dealt with closer to workplaces and employees? Would European legislation make for a more effective solution to the problem? I am afraid that we would be distancing the whole problem and, instead of finding a solution to it, removing it too far from our workplaces. Let us try the route of national legislation in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I must take issue with the Commissioner. She says that my assertion that this policy area is sidelined is not true and then gives a number of examples of recent progress. I would remind the Commissioner that the dossiers on optical radiation fields and waves, vibration and noise all date back ten years. They were part of the original physical agents proposal. I am glad that there has been movement in Council, but these are very old proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say to Mr Bushill-Matthews that there are new and emerging risks in the health and safety field. In my report on the strategy I said that guidance, training, information and a whole range of options could be adopted as a response, but I believe that legislation also has to be considered as part of the mix.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it looks as though I am probably in line for a mention in his next book as well, so I would just give these words of comfort to Mr Bushill-Matthews: I am sure that if you simply agreed with me more often, the feeling of stress in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs would evaporate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would thus like to thank the Members.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not accept Mr Hughes' last comment. Yes, it was a very difficult directive, but it has been endorsed. It was not at all easy and the negotiations were a real marathon, but now it is a fact. We have already agreed on the Vibration Directive and now we are starting discussions on an optical radiation directive. Do you know many Member States that have legislation on optical radiation? With the combined efforts of Parliament, the Commission and the social partners, we have started to address the matter at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hughes said that nothing has been done and that the Commission has done nothing either. We all agree that it is a very complicated issue in terms of defining the problem, in terms of legislating and in terms of achieving an agreement between the Member States, because there are huge differences involved. I will not refer to the social partners here because consultation in that regard will start later in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us consider what is needed and what we have actually done over the years, particularly since the Andersson Report, which triggered many discussions and decisions. The European Agency for Safety and Health at Work in Bilbao has made it one of its main priorities. A study is already underway, the first part of which is about preventing violence and harassment in the workplace. A second research project has been commissioned. After much discussion and analysis and many studies involving experts, no real approach has emerged that suggests that the problems in question can be solved by legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2003 a campaign on bullying and violence at work was launched here at Parliament. There are websites for each issue, and on them you will find contributions from analysts, academics, national agencies and the social partners, each with very different approaches. It is not an easy issue at all. It is not only complicated, it is very controversial. Different trade unions, analysts and scientists all have different approaches. The Commission cannot just come forward with a proposal for a directive without taking all these analyses into account. And, moreover, there is not a great deal of scientific analysis on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">After all these years of work and data collection, and after working with studies, I do not accept, Mr Hughes, that nothing has happened. We have put the matter on the agenda for 2004 and we will launch this consultation with the social partners. One of the major issues of the discussion is the legislative approach. At the same time, we are going to work with all the other options, including recommendations, guidelines and an awareness-raising campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank Parliament. You are always the locomotive on this issue and that really helps the work of the Commission. However, please take into account the complexity of the issue. It is not only a matter of disagreements between the Member States: it is very complex and we have to take all the relevant issues into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
