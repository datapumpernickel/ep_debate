<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Robles Piquer </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (ES)</span> Madam President, in 1916, Thomas Edison, who knew a thing or two about electricity, wrote the following: ‘We should use the forces of nature to obtain our energy. Light from the sun, wind and the tides are forms of this energy. But no, we burn forests and coal as if we were burning the door to our house to keep us warm. We live like savage invaders of the earth and not as if these resources were ours forever."</p>
<p class="contents">In my mind, these dreadful words, written over 80 years ago in the middle of the First World War, are clearly an appropriate starting point for the debate on the three reports the European Commission is using to help fill the gap left by a lack of a Community energy policy. The Member States do not want this policy, even though the Members of this House and the Commission are in favour of it. I am referring initially to the report by Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz and to the report by Mr Stockmann – the first on energy efficiency and the second on the rational use and saving of energy. We will discuss these later.</p>
<p class="contents">My report, Madam President, is a report on the section of the new Framework Programme for Action in the Energy Sector that attempts to establish a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources. If we look closely, we find that this is the key element of the whole programme. In short, it is an attempt to strengthen, extend and improve the effects – I would say the positive effects – of the Altener programme, which has now become Altener II. The programme covers activities that seek to naturally maintain the ecological balance, to respect the environment, and to ensure security of supply while reducing energy import dependence, as the percentage of such imports is growing rapidly in the European Union. Also, by exploiting these renewable energies, it seeks to reach a certain balance with the technological advances made and to create jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">There are forerunners to these reports and to this situation. Firstly, there was Altener I, from 1993 to 1997, then the provisional form and the final version of Altener II that should take us up to the year 2002. Let me also remind you of such important documents as the Green and White Papers from the Commission and, if I may make a slightly more personal reference in this case, the 1994 Madrid Conference. In a week"s time we will reach the end of the first five‐year period since this meeting was held. I should like to remind you that the relevant authorities from Spain and many other countries were present, and also that my friend and, Commissioner, your predecessor, Commissioner Matutes, was present at that meeting and was actively involved. Mr Mandelis, now a minister and one of your fellow countrymen, was also present and, at the time, held the Presidency as it was the turn of the Greeks. Both these men helped us in a very efficient manner.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking here about wind energy, thermal and photovoltaic solar energy, biomass, small‐scale hydroelectric schemes under 10 megawatts, geothermal energy and, perhaps in the future, harnessing energy from tides. Recently, interest in all these forms has clearly increased, not decreased. A few days ago, a pun in a major French daily paper said that wind energy had the wind in its sails. Fortunately, t is not only wind energy that is doing so well, although this is the form that is experiencing greatest growth. I believe that on this matter you must choose between three attitudes. Either you believe that our efforts concerning these forms of energy are useless, or you think that these energies could replace conventional forms in the near future, or, and in my opinion this is the sensible position, you believe that we should slowly increase the percentage of energy consumption from renewable sources under the terms that have been laid out in all these documents. Of course, we still cannot describe such documents as satisfactory or definitive but they are an important first step. Many countries are already aware of the fact that this situation is changing. It would be difficult to list them here due to a lack of time but I will mention one simple figure: at this moment in time I can tell you that, in 1998, the amount of wind energy produced and consumed in the European Union increased by no less than a third in relation to 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish by saying that we must continue along these lines and that, as rapporteur, I recommend that we all vote in favour of my report as well as in favour of the other two. In the case of my report and that of Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, we should vote in favour of the amendments already accepted by the Committee on Energy, Research and Technological Development. I do not think that we need to include the others. In conclusion, I should like to congratulate my two colleagues whose reports we are about to consider.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bloch von Blottnitz </span> <span class="bold">(V), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Madam President, together with the Altener programme, the SAVE programme is our only weapon for achieving the 8 % reduction targets to which we committed ourselves in the Kyoto Protocol. This makes it all the more amazing and incomprehensible that we only intend to spend ECU 68.45 million on SAVE II over five years and ECU 281.1 million on Altener, also over five years, whilst in the same year we are throwing ECU 170 million at nuclear fusion for just one year! There is also something else that I find puzzling: how is it that when the Commission was evaluating SAVE I it came to the very firm conclusion that only legislative measures would help us to achieve our objectives, yet such measures are quite absent from SAVE II? I have also failed to find a clear list of what we actually want to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">However, one thing is certain: in Germany, for example, equipment in permanent stand‐by mode in homes and offices consumes the equivalent of the output of two 1 000 MW power stations. This is irrefutably stated in a study by our own Federal Environmental Agency. Furthermore, no one denies that if we finally started using energy rationally this would be an innovation that would create jobs, give us a competitive edge and preserve the environment. And I am talking about baseload electricity, because you would be saving power morning, noon and night, as everyone knows and as everyone keeps saying. We hear this day in, day out, like a hawker's sales patter, but no one is actually doing anything about it! I find myself becoming suspicious that big industry just does not want this to happen – they simply do not want it! If we could reduce baseload power consumption, and it would be quite a simple matter to save 30‐40 % straight away by using electricity rationally, and we could also generate a lot using renewables, that would enable us to decommission a good many nuclear power stations only used for baseload.</p>
<p class="contents">This demonstrates how woolly this policy is, and how much waffle there is: there is more talk than action. This policy will not enable us to achieve the reduction targets we are committed to, nor will it equip us with the sort of technology for the next millennium that would allow us to really boost our exports and achieve a presence on the world market, which in turn would allow us to create jobs and preserve our environment. This meagre programme really is not enough to achieve all that. If there is no money available, we should at least adopt legislative measures, quite apart from the fact that if we could finally agree on an EU‐wide energy tax that would be a real success story. There is no incentive to save with energy as cheap as it is now.</p>
<p class="contents">So I would like to ask the Commission when it finally intends to take some action – we have had endless discussions about this in the House, and we have repeatedly said that we need intelligent programmes for rational use. We cannot just carry on using the same old Stone Age methods as if they were good enough for us. We know something needs to happen, and we have the means to achieve it, and yet nothing is being done! What can you hope to achieve in five years with ECU 68.1 million? And that is supposed to include the EFTA countries as well!</p>
<p class="contents">Surely we cannot really intend to classify incineration of municipal waste as renewable energy, as proposed in the Altener II report. What does that suggest? Renewable energy means solar, biogas, hydro and wind energy, used rationally of course, the two things go hand‐in‐hand. The Altener and SAVE programmes are like brother and sister, but we need to have the political will to act and not hold back. The Commission has our full support on this. Why is it not making progress in this area instead of letting the Council dictate to it all the time? We all know that the Council does not want anything to happen. I have already explained to you why no progress is being made – there are many other parties involved who have nothing to gain from savings in baseload!</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am asking you today to make a little bit of progress in this field, Mr Papoutsis. SAVE and Altener are token programmes with very good intentions, but we both know that you can achieve nothing with so little money, none of us can achieve anything! We not only have our post‐Kyoto commitments, we also have a duty to future generations. So I hope that Parliament will accept my amendments to the legislative proposal, including the further 1.5 % annual saving that I have included, and not just the ridiculously low 1 % that the Commission has proposed!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Stockmann </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate my colleagues, and I think that we are all pulling in the same direction on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of energy efficiency seems to have lost its importance in the public's eyes in recent years, as confirmed by the International Energy Agency. This subject is regarded as irrelevant, quite simply because despite population growth and increasing energy consumption, there are sufficient fossil energy sources for the foreseeable future. And I believe that another reason is that the market has gone quiet – it is not giving any price signals. Quite the opposite in fact, crude‐oil prices are lower than before the oil crises. So who has any interest in improving efficiency? Certainly not energy producers, consumers scarcely at all and industrial consumers only within limits. It is we politicians who are most concerned, because we understand the link between energy consumption and CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions. And that is why we have committed ourselves to reducing Europe's CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions as compared with 1990, as has already been highlighted at Kyoto and Buenos Aires under the Convention on Climate Change, the Framework Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Another political motivating factor is that if we carry on in this way, the share of imports will rise from 50 % to 70 % by 2020, and with it our dependency on third countries. Yet there are enormous opportunities available to us. Of course, opinions differ on the extent of the technical and economic potential for energy savings over the next five years, but whether we aim for 18‐20 % or higher, the potential is still very great indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">If we take our political role seriously, it becomes apparent that we need annual efficiency gains of at least 2.5 %, instead of just 0.6 % at present. If we want to be consistent, these gains are necessary, and they are possible as well. The Commission is calling for 1.6 %, but there is scope for more. We can only achieve this if we agree upon a comprehensive strategy at European, national and regional level, and that is indeed what the Commission is proposing. This strategy must require Member States to commit themselves to binding national overall targets, it must include guideline targets by energy type and economic sector, and we ourselves want reports at three‐yearly intervals, starting in 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to certain priority individual measures. We need a directive on energy efficiency standards in public procurement. We need guidelines for the renovation of existing buildings. We should start with the European institutions themselves. We need guidelines for the award of contracts for buildings maintenance and for new buildings. And while we are on that subject – and this has already been mentioned – a consistent policy on renovating old buildings would also create new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, we need more targeted campaigns aimed at specific occupational groups and comprehensive labelling of all electrical consumer and capital goods. A start has been made, but something more comprehensive is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, we need to increase the use of combined heat and power, and we must be careful that this option does not lose out because of the liberalisation of the internal energy market. An 18 % target is sensible and this also has the Commission's support.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a financing programme for energy service companies or ESCOs. They have great potential for the future and could assist energy conservation.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, there is great potential for transport systems, leaving agriculture aside for the time being. Concepts such as logistics and intermodal transport serve to demonstrate just how much could be done in this field. Some initial steps have been taken under the fifth framework programme on research, but more needs to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifth, stand‐by losses need to be reduced. Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz has touched upon this already. We expect the Commission to bring forward a communication on stand‐by losses as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">My sixth point is that we of course need an EU‐wide energy tax. We need to tackle this old chestnut yet again, and I hope that the next Parliament will do something about this at some point. I hope there will be sufficient insight to achieve this. I am all too well aware of what happened to the Cox report.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if no one is going to win any political medals by fighting for energy conservation, increasing energy efficiency is and will continue to be the cleanest and safest source of energy that we have, and we should be focusing on that.</p>

These are renewable energy and energy efficiency. From an environmental viewpoint, they are two sides of the same coin. There is a need for both, because if the current trend continues, global demand for energy will double by the year 2020. We therefore need good plans and programmes if we are to meet our Kyoto targets. On the whole, it can be said that the Commission's proposal does not contain enough new thinking. It focuses too much on conventional energy solutions rather than renewable energy ones; on centralised systems rather than decentralised ones; on traditional, economic tools rather than new thinking; on purely technical measures rather than an holistic approach. That is just not enough, so it is wonderful to see the reports before us, which up to a point pull in the same direction as I have described.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of areas which I would like to highlight. Firstly, the administration of the programmes. There is a problem with these programmes like so many other EU programmes, which is that they are far too confusing for applicants, so many people have difficulty getting involved in them. The reason I am emphasising this is because the second point – involving ordinary consumers – is absolutely essential if we are to achieve the results we wish to see. Only through consumers can we get adequate local initiatives. On the subject of local initiatives, I would also like to mention the organisation of the tariff systems, which have to be adapted to the decentralised structure and cannot simply take priority over a large number of major areas and ideas. It is essential that the programmes are controlled at national level, where people have the greatest knowledge of their own environment. It goes without saying that different conditions prevail in different areas. Solar energy should be exploited where the sun shines and windmills should be placed where the wind blows, and the Member States themselves know that best.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Linkohr </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, the only thing you can say about these three reports is that they are acceptable, and we can vote for them – but that does not solve our problem. We have already made a great many declarations of this kind in the House. We always agree. It is hard to think of another issue on which Parliament and the Commission see eye to eye to such an extent as on promoting renewables. That is not the problem. And yet I feel powerless when I look at the figures, which almost drive you to despair.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take Mr Seppänen's report, for example. Mr Seppänen quite rightly says that if you exclude hydro‐electricity, renewable energy's share is only 1.3 %. If you include hydro, it is 6 %. We want to increase the renewables' share to 12 %, but there is little scope for a major increase in hydro – you cannot rape nature, there are limits. The other aspect of renewable energy is biotechnology. Hydro and biotechnology combined account for 95 % of renewable energy. Hydro is chiefly found in the northern countries and in the Alpine regions of Austria and France and so forth, and biomass is found in the same countries, but you cannot extend these sources of energy at will, unless you are willing to pay the price.</p>
<p class="contents">Extending the use of biomass, on the other hand, is bound up with agricultural policy. The fact is that a key omission from the proposals on agricultural policy in Agenda 2000 is a chapter on renewable energy. That really should have been included. I know that the Commission did some work on this, but in the end it was not incorporated, because the finance ministers did not of course want to pay for it: it would cost money. That is the crux of the matter. Fine, we want renewables, but we have to introduce them despite current market trends, because as a rule they are more costly than the cheap energy we currently have.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz is quite right: nothing will happen without legislative measures. The market will not achieve this by itself, otherwise this would have happened long ago. So we need prefinancing. In the longer term renewables will pay for themselves, but at this stage we need to prefinance them, and I therefore think that our biggest problem is not the technology itself – of course we want better and better plants, that goes without saying – but prefinancing. How can we mobilise private capital and public funds and persuade the banks to play a more active part in this field?</p>
<p class="contents">To my mind, that is the central issue with renewable energy. We once had a debate about feeding in electricity from renewables here. You will recall that the proposal I made at that time was rejected by a majority of Parliament. Well, perhaps that was not such a disaster, perhaps there are better suggestions, but we have not heard them yet. I would also like to ask Commissioner Papoutsis when a proposal along these lines will be brought forward, because at that point we were promised such a proposal before the end of the year. It is now March and we still have not seen a proposal. I grant you that this is a complicated field, and I do not envy you your task. I tried it myself and had no luck in this House. I wish you more luck, but we must do something. Do something better than I proposed. You will have my full support, but we must do something.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot wait for the market to solve this. There is also a link with energy prices. According to the Commission documents, energy efficiency has been increased by just 0.6 % per annum over this decade, because energy prices are so low. In the 1970s and 1980s the rate of increase was 2 %, because energy prices were high. That is an economic fact, so we need to get a hold on this problem. We have suggested energy taxation, which I know is not very palatable, but we need an honest debate about these issues, mere declarations are no longer enough.</p>

It is important that different sectors within the Commission move in the same direction, to conserve energy and exploit renewables. Even to achieve the aims of the White Paper, not to speak of the still more challenging aim put forward by the committee, there has to be growth in the biomass sector in particular. At present there are considerable amounts of biomass in certain regions, especially in northern areas of the EU, in the form of logging waste, for example, which remain totally unexploited. However, these areas lead the world in developing the kind of logistics know‐how for gathering this material, and growth in the industry is forecast.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise two points. Firstly, it will be vital, in my opinion, for us to be able to use the Structural Funds for projects relating to renewable energy in the future too, as there is a dearth of resources for other EU actions. Secondly, I would like to stress, as others have, how important the issue of taxation on energy is.</p>

Some of those here today have also come to the same conclusion. We should therefore have additional energy taxes at EU level. To me that seems obvious, and I am waiting patiently for a proposal from the Commission and for the Council of Ministers to approve it. Tough economic measures are required in order to promote renewable sources of energy, the efficient use of energy and, in particular, to ensure that the traditional, conventional, environmentally unfriendly, reactionary energy society becomes a thing of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Many fine words have been uttered tonight on the desirability of promoting renewable sources of energy, but nothing ever actually happens. Consequently, it is absolutely essential that we introduce tough economic measures to set us on the right track.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Commission and the Council of Ministers, together with an unholy alliance here in Parliament, continue to support the nuclear power industry and refuse to recognise that the modern sources of energy are renewable ones – a rational use of energy – which mean more jobs, a cleaner environment and healthier long‐term economic prospects. So why are so many people opposed to such an outlook? My generation and my political group most decidedly are not!</p>

All three reports demonstrate that Parliament has the will to make progress with a diversified energy policy which would encourage environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, that is the direction we should be heading in today. We need to encourage the development of energy sources which, although they at present only offer partial solutions to the various major challenges currently facing the European Union, nevertheless offer very real solutions. The first challenge is of course the environment. New energy sources, and in particular wind energy, hydro and solar energy, are clean sources of energy. In this respect we need to remember the commitments that we entered into at Kyoto in 1997. Furthermore, these new energy sources should also allow us to reduce our dependence on third countries for supplies of oil, gas and other energy sources. Fifty per cent of our energy comes from outside the Union. This percentage is due to rise to 70 % by 2020, which is not without its risks.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, although technological developments have certainly reduced the prices of these new energy sources, this reduction is still not enough, and we must therefore finance RTD programmes in this field. The recently launched fifth framework programme on research should enable us to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Madam President, I would like to remind Members, at a point when unemployment has been called the main enemy of the European Union, that these energy sources will generate many new jobs. That is a point that it was also important to mention this evening.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Graenitz </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Mr Stockmann sounded rather resigned when he said that the issue of energy efficiency is not exactly centre‐stage in political debate at present. However, I believe that energy efficiency is very much uppermost in the minds of people who are concerned about saving money. I have many contacts and discussions with industrial leaders who say that energy efficiency – and this applies particularly to the basic goods sector – makes it possible to use less energy, and to cascade energy, that is to use it two or three times. This does not just mean saving a great deal of money, but also making technological advances which ultimately mean that we develop new methods and that, as Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz said, we remain competitive on the world market and can create new jobs in new industries.</p>
<p class="contents">We have discussed the promotion of renewables in Parliament at length and in great detail, and I think that there is little new that I can add. We need to invest in renewables if we want to achieve the Kyoto objectives to which the EU has committed itself. I also expect, Commissioner, that during accession negotiations you will pursue a strategy of increased use of renewable energy sources, because the other countries have signed up to the European Union's Kyoto objectives and the first six applicants, which will already be Member States at the relevant point in time, will have to comply with these objectives in exactly the same way.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to these reports, on which I congratulate the respective rapporteurs, we will also have to make further efforts. Mr Linkohr has already mentioned that we are waiting for a proposal from the Commission on how renewables can be promoted now that the directive on feeding in renewables, which Mr Linkohr himself proposed, has failed to find majority support in Parliament. We need a proposal along these lines because it is necessary, when bringing renewables onto the market, to create a certain buffer, and to offer some support until they become commercially viable. We need to start by discussing energy taxation again, because the present situation is that the costs associated with energy production – and above all electricity generation at power stations with high emission levels – are spread equally, and not borne by those whose actions give rise to these costs. This cannot be allowed to continue if we wish to observe the polluter pays principle.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that in future the sun will play a greater role in determining where our energy comes from than it does today.</p>

That is why demonstration projects are incredibly important. The good results we obtain in demonstration projects are made available not only to our Member States in the EU, but also to the applicant countries and the third world, where the fastest growth in energy consumption is taking place. It is therefore amazing that so little money has been allocated to creating good, solid demonstration projects which can really show others the best way to do things. The most capable countries, the most capable institutions and the most capable industries are the ones who will show us the direction in which to go. We all know that today we are emitting twice as much CO<span class="sub">2</span> as plants can break down. And we know that the use of fossil fuels will double by the year 2020. We are heading for a very difficult period, and we should be deeply concerned about how our climate will develop and what burden will be placed on our ecosystems.</p>
<p class="contents">I see increased research and the development of new technology as the only way forward. In many places today, taxes aimed at modifying behaviour, or so‐called ‘green taxes', have simply become new taxes, thus creating a negative attitude towards them among the general public. In the long run, only an increased awareness of the problems through information and education will lead to responsible use of our limited energy resources.</p>

I have just returned from northern Austria, where 30 % of energy already comes from renewable sources and where there are more solar panels than the whole of Spain, despite the fact that there is less sun. At the same time as this meeting on solar energy was taking place in Wels, which followed on from the Madrid and Milan meetings, a major conference of the European Wind Energy Association was being held in Nice, which hundreds of people attended.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, as German magazines are reporting, we know that there is now something called the ‘German, Spanish and Danish model". This simply means that some governments are becoming aware of the issue and are beginning to grant significant amounts of aid to renewable energies. For example, anyone who has read the latest Spanish Royal Decree from the end of December will know what I am talking about as there is now something called a ‘feed in" system, to use our usual jargon, that redistributes the various renewable energy sources according to different scales. And there are many countries that take wind energy very seriously, such as Holland, Sweden, Finland and Greece, a country that is also covered in solar panels. A few days ago, I was in my home country where a day seminar on wind energy was being held, for the second time, in Santiago de Compostela. This form of energy is experiencing tremendous growth in Navarre, for example, a region that already meets 20 % of its needs in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission now wishes to begin an experiment with 100 local authorities that hope to be fully supplied and served by some form of renewable energy. I believe that this so‐called ‘campaign for take‐off" is proof of the fact that, in spite of everything, some governments are becoming aware of this issue and that binding legal provisions are beginning to emerge. And of course, the joint action of the Commission and Parliament has played an important role in promoting these new forms of energy and I believe we should be proud of this.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Papoutsis, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (EL)</span> Madam President, I would first of all like to congratulate the three rapporteurs, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, Mr Robles Piquer and Mr Stockmann, on their reports and on their excellent work.</p>
<p class="contents">All three reports are part of a broader Community initiative to achieve a cleaner and sustainable future energy supply. The promotion of renewable energy sources and increased energy efficiency are the keystones of our policy to tackle environmental pollution and to reduce CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Altener and SAVE programmes will make up by far the largest part of the framework programme for energy, which has been adopted and is already in operation as regards the remaining programmes. Following the adoption of the Altener and SAVE programmes within the next few months, the framework programme for energy will be able to operate as a unified whole and as an overall energy plan.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to talk about each of the reports in turn, starting with the report by Mr Robles Piquer on the Altener programme, which concerns renewable energy sources. The Altener programme is a fundamental instrument for the implementation of the Community strategy and action plan for renewable energy sources, through which we aim to achieve our objectives. Our aim is to double the share of renewable energy sources in the gross domestic consumption of energy in the European Union by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the Altener programme, the development of standards for the equipment needed in connection with renewable sources will continue, as will the development of strategies and the strengthening of those methods which will promote the market penetration of renewable energy sources. New production activities will strengthen the contribution of Altener to the ‘Campaign for take‐off", which was announced in the White Paper on renewable energy sources. In addition, thanks to the Altener programme, projects will be undertaken on a broad scale which will include technologies for renewable energy sources which are now ready to be implemented. Participation in this programme will also be open to the countries belonging to the European Economic Area, as well as the countries involved in negotiations to accede to the European Union. Before I move on to the amendments, I should like to thank Mr Robles Piquer, not only for his report, but also for his continuing support for the Community strategy on renewable energy sources over the last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the amendments, the Commission is able to accept 14 amendments as they stand. These are Amendments Nos 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23 and 24. In addition, the Commission is able to accept seven further amendments, but only after they have been specifically reworded to bring them into line with the White Paper. These are Amendments Nos 2, 6, 11, 14, 16, 21 and 22.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 3 refers to the putting in place of a Community plan of action which, however, has already been established. We would prefer a reference to the implementation of the action plan which was formulated in the Commission proposal. Amendment No 15 provides for a new programme objective 1a which is already covered by Objective 1, and also relates to the actions that are to be taken under Objective 2e. As regards Amendment No 26, I believe that Parliament has in mind here the Commission"s attitude that the committee procedure should not be changed. Amendment No 12 cannot be accepted because it refers to indirect costs and competitiveness, whilst the internalisation of the profits from renewable energy sources and the different ways and means of improving the competitiveness of renewable energy sources have already been elaborated at some length in the White Paper. In addition, the Commission is unable to accept Amendments Nos 27 and 28, because they go beyond the scope of this programme. Nor can we accept Amendment No 29, since we feel that the organic part of urban waste is a renewable energy source. Finally, we accept Amendment No 30 in principle, but we believe that this is already covered in the monitoring of progress of renewable energy sources which is provided for in Article 2.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I should now like to move on to the equally important report by Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz on the SAVE programme, which refers to the rational use of energy. I would like to thank the rapporteur warmly for the quality of her report.</p>
<p class="contents">We all agree that the contribution of the SAVE programme to the rational use of energy and to reducing CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions in the European Union is especially important. The SAVE programme does not serve that objective alone; it also aims to secure the Community"s energy supply. The European Union will continue to import large amounts of primary energies. The measures which aim to improve the way in which we use our energy sources would seem to have important implications for the lifetime of finite sources of mineral fuels, and will clearly reduce our dependency on imported energy. The SAVE programme will continue to support energy labelling and also the development of standards of energy efficiency for appliances which consume energy. We shall also continue to underpin the efforts of Member States to improve their energy efficiency, by exchanging information on the one hand, and by closely monitoring the performance of energy efficiency on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">A significant share of the budget will continue to be channelled towards setting up local and regional SAVE offices, and its effects will be multiplied in conjunction with investments from the Community Structural Funds. The countries belonging to the European Economic Area as well as the countries involved in negotiations to accede to the European Union will continue to be able to participate in the programme, using their own financial resources. At this point, I would like to express my agreement with the rapporteur, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, on the level of budgetary funding. I agree with her entirely that, for renewable energy sources as a whole, and for the saving of energy and energy efficiency, we need more resources. It is clear, however, that we are moving in an area of financial austerity and, unfortunately, the European Parliament and the Council have not allowed the appropriations for these particular objectives to be increased any further.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the amendments, I would like to say that the Commission is able to accept five amendments exactly as they stand, and these are Amendments Nos 2, 3, 7, 10 and 16. We are also able to accept Amendment No 8, subject to it being reworded. The Commission will put forward new legislative measures where these are fully justified at Community level and in cases where other means, such as self‐regulating agreements with the industry, have not yet proved effective. Moreover, initiatives by the Commission to take new legislative measures do not depend on the SAVE programme being adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 1, 6, 9 and part of No 11, which provide for the number of legislative initiatives from the Commission to be increased, are not appropriate in this specific context and, as such, cannot be accepted. Amendments Nos 13, part of 15, 9 and 20, in which additional areas of study and pilot actions are proposed, substantially limit the scope of the programme and also the flexibility of the initiatives, and cannot therefore be accepted. The part of Amendment No 15 which talks about improving energy efficiency by switching from one energy source to another cannot be accepted either, because it goes beyond the scope of the programme. The Commission is unable to accept Amendment No 4, because an evaluation of the SAVE programme by independent assessors has shown that the programme has contributed to a large extent to improving energy efficiency in the Community. Amendment No 5 and part of No 11 also cannot be accepted because the objective of 1.5 %, although desirable and although we could agree to it in principle, is nevertheless over‐optimistic in practice. Amendment No 18 cannot be accepted because it creates confusion between the SAVE and Altener programmes, and nor can Amendment No 12, because it too creates confusion between the SAVE programme and the fifth framework programme for research and technology. We are also unable to accept Amendment No 21, because we feel that the call for complementarity with the programmes that are being developed in the Member States makes our action more effective. By the same token, we do not accept Amendment No 22, because we consider it to be unnecessary. We want the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Cyprus and Malta to participate in the programme, but it is clear that funding their participation cannot be covered by the SAVE budget, because this would render the programme completely impossible to implement.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the call made by Mr Linkohr for a directive on the use and promotion of renewable sources of energy within the framework of the internal market in electricity, I should like to assure you that we are continuing our efforts and our consultations both with the German Presidency and the European Parliament to achieve the best possible outcome which the Member States could accept immediately, and which could be adopted immediately by the Council. I am bound to say that the Commission was prepared to put forward a directive. However, following discussions with the presidency, with certain Member States and also with the European Parliament, we realised that our proposal was a more ambitious one than the Member States were able to accept at this particular time. For this reason, we are proceeding apace with our efforts to devote all the time we have available to putting forward a proposal which could be accepted by the next Council of Energy Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to deal with the equally important and comprehensive report by Mr Stockmann on the Commission communication on energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of taking measures in the area of energy efficiency is set out using powerful and persuasive arguments, and the various actions are clearly defined.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that the Commission agrees to a large extent with the principles and the bases of the report by Mr Stockmann, and also with the measures he proposes. There is also a complete convergence of opinion as regards the importance the report attaches to measures to disseminate information in the most effective way possible, to improve and bring into line with existing guidelines the standards and guidelines for public procurement, and to promote combined heat and power. This is also true in respect of the priority given to energy efficiency guidelines which relate to the renovation of existing buildings and the awarding of contracts for buildings maintenance.</p>
<p class="contents">The measure proposed to promote energy service companies will be examined with particular care by the Commission"s services, especially now that we have a new sphere of activity as we move towards the liberalisation of the market. Against this background, your proposal could best be examined in the light of these new developments. The Commission also agrees with Mr Stockmann regarding the regular evaluation of the Member States" plans for energy savings. We must encourage Member States to promote national energy plans in this direction. I would also like to point out that the possibilities for improving energy efficiency which are put forward in the report by Mr Stockmann are to some extent greater, and the objectives somewhat more ambitious, than the corresponding objectives contained in the Commission"s communication. These greater possibilities and ambitious objectives are, of course, very laudable, but the Commission feels that they will be difficult to achieve with the existing Community funds. However, there is no doubt that they reflect the high priority given by the report to promoting action for energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I would once again like to thank the three rapporteurs for their excellent reports, which were of considerable help to us when we held our discussions, and which have brought us one step closer to attaining our common objective, which is nothing more than a sustainable future energy supply.</p>

Is the Commissioner refusing to accept Amendments Nos 6 and 11? If that is so, we might just as well go home now. If we just have your ECU 68 million over five years and no legislative measures – because you do not seem to want to take those on board – we will not get anywhere at all. That is quite obvious! So when are you finally going to present some legislative measures, because without them this charade will go on forever.</p>

We must move forward in this direction in any event. I do not accept them for that reason, and not because there is opposition to them in principle. It is not necessary to include the legislative initiatives in the SAVE programme.</p>
