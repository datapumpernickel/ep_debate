<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bogdan Klich (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(PL)</span> Mr President, it has been a pleasure to draft this report for two reasons. The first of these is the excellent cooperation on the part of both the committees that have delivered opinions, namely the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and on the part of the vast majority of political groups, in particular the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group. The second reason is that the Commission has made an extremely valuable contribution on points of substance.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Security Strategy states that there are currently a great many new threats and challenges to our security, the most significant of which include the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the spread of international terrorism. It is a fact of life that the kind of terrorism to which Europe grew accustomed in the 1960s and 1970s has been replaced by a new kind of terrorism that affects many more people and is far more deadly and dangerous.</p>
<p class="contents">What this means is that the objectives of maintaining public security and making our security and defence policy credible are hard to achieve nowadays without high-tech tools.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union currently invests four times less in the defence sector and five times less in research and development than the United States. The result of this is that EU Member States are not in a position to close the technology gap that exists between the United States and Europe in terms of defence potential and security.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, in response to this need for more effective security research, the Commission has proposed a European Security Research Programme, due to be launched in two years’ time under the umbrella of the Seventh Framework Programme. The European Security Research Programme will be based on a coherent, flexible and coordinated approach, and will focus on research projects that enhance our technological capabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The approach currently taken to security research at the highest EU level lacks coherence. This leads to extensive fragmentation and weak cooperation between Member States, and also makes such research less cost-effective.</p>
<p class="contents">The establishment of a European Security Research Programme will therefore facilitate both interoperability and cost optimisation by putting in place common frameworks and structures at European level. The Programme provides for the exploitation of synergies between defence and civil research, so it can be expected to boost the integration of these two sectors. What is more, Parliament’s adoption of the Programme, the proposed annual budget for which is EUR 1 billion in addition to any research funding already earmarked for this sector by the individual Member States, should serve to narrow the gap that currently exists between the EU Member States and the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Strengthening our research base and finding more innovative solutions is bound to enhance Europe’s competitiveness. It is anticipated that this Programme will be an excellent opportunity for European industry, and also for our research centres. I have in mind all such centres, academic, non-academic, civil and defence ones. The Programme will undoubtedly improve external border protection and make it possible to modernise the armed forces of the EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The report refers to several priority areas of interest, of which I shall only mention a few. They include the fields of C4ISR systems, or in other words command, control, communications, computing, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and also research in the field of biotechnology and space and IT technology.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also encourages the Commission to support research in the field of social sciences, without which appropriate planning of research into modern technologies is inconceivable. I have to say, and it gives me great satisfaction to do so, that this would appear to be the key contribution made by Parliament to the Commission’s proposal, namely that any discussion of advanced technological research must first focus on support for such research.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that defence-related issues are at the top of the political agenda, there is every likelihood that this Programme will enable us to increase security and make it easier to achieve the EU’s objectives. Mr President, I would therefore strongly recommend that the House vote in favour of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Security is an essential component of a number of different EU policy areas, including the common foreign and security policy and the area of freedom, security and justice. At the same time, however, security is also a basic requirement for prosperity and growth and, as such, indispensable for achieving the economic policy goals of the Lisbon Agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">We need the best tools available if we are to be able to meet challenges to public safety, and we also need a strong knowledge and technology base. Research at both national and European level is required to create such a base, and it was for this reason that the Group of Personalities made the following recommendation to the Commission one year ago; ‘technology alone cannot guarantee security, but security without technology is impossible’.</p>
<p class="contents">Security managers, industry and the public are among those who benefit from security research, and, in order to meet their high expectations, consistency must be achieved between its various facets. Firstly, this research must actively help to create a social and business environment which is conducive to positive economic development and which lays the groundwork for prosperity, as this will ensure that it acts as a driving force for growth and employment in Europe. It must also enhance the competitiveness of the European security industry, and in fact the European Security Research Programme will help create and extend a European market for security products. A further aim of the Programme will be to focus on civil security matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Although research of this kind falls within the remit of the European Defence Agency, those working in the field of civil security research maintain close contacts with the latter in order to address the dual-use aspects of security technologies. Finally, there is no escaping the fact that security research is a particularly sensitive sector with very specific requirements, which include intellectual property rights, the spread of information, cooperation with third parties – including those outside the EU – and the level of Community contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">Security research is one half of the two-fold thematic priority ‘Security and Space’, which falls within the specific programme ‘Cooperation’ under the Seventh Research Programme. Current proposals provide for an annual budget of around EUR 500 million. The Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament’s report calls for an annual budget of EUR 1 billion, as proposed by the Group of Personalities.</p>
<p class="contents">Security research under the Seventh Framework Programme will focus on the following areas; protection against terrorism and crime, security of infrastructures and utilities, border protection and restoring security in case of crisis. These four topics will be supported by a number of horizontal areas, namely systems integration and interoperability, security and society and coordinating and structuring research.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Security Research Advisory Board will play a leading role in helping to develop a longer-term vision, as it will act as a forum where users and the Commission discuss the structure of the Research Programme. As proposed in the report on security research, and in order to ensure that Parliament is properly represented, Vice-President Verheugen has invited five committees to appoint representatives to act as observers on the European Security Research Advisory Board.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has always backed the current Preparatory Action for Security Research, and this backing has been much appreciated. It is for this reason that we welcome the report upon which this House will vote, and which was drafted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs together with the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. I should also like to thank Parliament for giving its consent to security research in general during the debate on the Seventh Framework Programme, and in particular with regard to funding for the Preparatory Actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will be happy to continue submitting reports on the implementation of the Preparatory Action until such a time as implementation of the European Security Research Programme becomes possible under the umbrella of the Seventh Research Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Security research will focus on activities that provide a distinct European added value compared to national measures. This will allow us to take action at Community level that enhances the competitiveness of the security industry, allows us to progress towards the Lisbon goals and helps our society as a whole to feel and be safer. I should like to thank the rapporteur once again for his work.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our contribution fundamentally consists of setting objectives optimising resources, clarifying responsibilities, classifying security research as of public interest — a fundamental and extremely important issue — providing great impetus, by means of research, for interoperability, which is so necessary in crisis situations, not so much in terms of prevention but in terms of response to and resolution of those crises, and advocating the need for adequate funding, linking security research entirely to gross domestic product, hence taking account of the economic weight of States and not allowing research in this field to be subject to considerable fluctuations in available budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I believe that we will have a European programme for security research within the seventh framework programme and a plural, technical and political advisory committee. By means of these research formulae, we are going to improve one of our greatest weaknesses, the so-called C4ISR — control, intelligence and monitoring systems — and it can only be corrected by means of the correct application of European research policies, without any links to or dependency on third parties. It is essential to increase the efficiency of progress with the sensor system, biotechnology, space and communication technologies. I would therefore like once again, Mr President, to congratulate Mr Klich on having dealt with this report of such essential importance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When we attempt to formulate and define a policy of common security research, this does not involve irrational fears or ideology, but a very rational policy that will enable a higher degree of security for European citizens. The dangers and threats demand that the problem is dealt with on a European level. And security research, as set out, represents a tool for increasing European competitiveness and achieving the Lisbon objectives. Indeed it represents an area that signifies major research, innovation and technological potential for the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">In this light I would like to express great concern at the potentially fatal consequences that might be suffered by the area of security research if there is no suitable agreement on the financial perspective. If the Council does not follow the guidelines of Parliament and the original proposal from the Commission, there is a serious fear of the termination of new programmes that are now still included in the seventh framework programme. These new programmes include security research. It must be stated clearly that without adequate financial support, we cannot expect good results.</p>
<p class="contents">The Kok report has already set out the clear finding that responsibility for achieving the Lisbon objectives lies first and foremost with the Member States, both in decision-making at home and in decision-making on the European level. I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to give their determined support in the negotiations on the financial perspective to mechanisms that will enable the achieving of the Lisbon strategy, and thereby security research. This is indeed important for each individual Member State, and in view of the numerous synergy effects, also for the European integration processes.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Both the European Council, with the European security strategy adopted in December 2003, and the European Parliament, in its resolution in April 2005, have highlighted the need to combat international dangers and challenges by reinforcing European defence and security policy and the common foreign policy and defence and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the problem is not only institutional and political. It is, at the same time, operational. It is a question of the effective application of the decisions taken at the level of the European institutions. Consequently, it is also linked to the ability of the European Union to proceed more quickly in the sectors of research, technology and innovation for European security.</p>
<p class="contents">Our objective must not be blind competition with the United States. However, it is true that, when investment by the United States is compared with investment by the European Union in internal security and even in the arms industry and defence equipment, the European Union and the Member States are, unfortunately, much worse off.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must move forward, because it has every interest in avoiding dependence and, at the same time, securing its interests, the interests of the Member States and the security and protection of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also in its interest for the European Union to strengthen research programmes and policies and to contribute to economic development, to the strengthening of competitiveness and to the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy. The proposal to integrate this programme into the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union is particularly important, as is the proposal to give it an annual budget of EUR one billion.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Security Research Programme must not be one-sidedly orientated towards technology research. Balanced development of research is needed which will also cover the fields of political, social and human sciences. If they are to be combated effectively, the problems of international terrorism, organised crime and illegal immigration need a broader approach, not for research to be encaged in a militaristic or police-state philosophy.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the main goals of the Programme is the protection of outside borders and basic infrastructures. These are important goals which relate to the security of the European Union, because they strengthen the visibility of the Programme to European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe that we need to ensure, as the European Union, that security research does not undermine our collective principles and values about the protection of human rights and political and democratic freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Klich, and to say that our group will be voting in favour of his report tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Every measure we take against terrorism, which we cannot be sure will be effective against it, is by definition harmful to democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to deal with terrorists, we have made our life difficult and, at the same time, we demean the life of citizens: body searches, microphones, cameras; none of this promotes democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite its pretty words, this report also moves in the same direction. Terrorism started to show its teeth thirty years ago. Then we said that the Stasi, the KGB and Gaddafi were behind it. Remember the aeroplane hijacks. Now there is no Stasi, there is no Gaddafi, there is no KGB. How does terrorism develop? Who feeds it?</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue which it raises is why terrorists hit certain specific countries. Perhaps they hit the big countries? Then why do they not hit China, Brazil or Canada? Why did the last generation of terrorists choose to pick on Spain out of all the European countries? My country organised Olympic Games, squandered billions of euros of taxpayers' money and yet the terrorists did not hit us, which they could very well have done.</p>
<p class="contents">We need therefore to learn a lesson: violence begets violence. In order to stop terrorism, we invaded two countries: Afghanistan and Iran. As a result, opium went up in Afghanistan, the opium which is killing our children, including many in Greece, while in Iran oil went up from USD 20 to 60 a barrel.</p>
<p class="contents">We have new reports against terrorism and yet no report puts Mr Bush, who brought us to this point, in his place. Mr Blair, Mr Bush's field marshal, will be here tomorrow. So let us tell him that he owes us much more than he gives us, because the price of oil has risen from USD 20 to 60 a barrel, with the result that people are unable to pay and we are in this difficult position. Yes, money against terrorism but, above all of course, a policy for the people of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
