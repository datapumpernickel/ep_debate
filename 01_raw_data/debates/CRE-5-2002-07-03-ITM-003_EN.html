<p class="contents">At the end of a lengthy period of negotiations which failed to produce a result satisfactory to both committees, the Conference of Presidents decided at its meeting of 13 June to refer the proposal to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market as the committee responsible in the light of its powers and responsibilities with the proviso that the enhanced Hughes Procedure be applied between the Legal Affairs Committee and the Environment Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The Environment Committee has challenged this decision and requested that the matter be put to the House in accordance with Rule 154(2) of the Rules of Procedure, which it is perfectly entitled to do under the existing Rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Before we take a vote I shall give the floor to the chairs of the two committees concerned, and only to them, and then to proceed to the vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a rather exceptional vote because not only is the competence of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy at stake, it is, first and foremost, a question of consistency with the Rules of Procedure – as you indicated a moment ago – and with for the commitments we gave in the debate. There has been a clear pronouncement on the conflict – as you have reminded us – from the Conference of Presidents in favour of the Committee on Legal Affairs, for it is the Conference of Presidents that has to decide on conflicts of competence, as we established with the amendment to Rule 154. Mr Corbett himself made this proposal to the House and the House acknowledged it. Indeed, the Conference of Presidents has the tools to conduct an in-depth analysis, in other words to assess matters case by case, and to take a decision. By voting for the proposal, as I am asking, this House will, above all, be giving the Conference of Presidents the go-ahead to confirm the validity of the Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many factors that point towards giving competence to the Committee on Legal Affairs, and I should like to point out two of them. The Committee on Legal Affairs has been working on the subject since March 2000, when it was given the competence – kindly note – to deal with the Green Paper on legal liability in environmental matters, the consultation document that preceded the proposal for a directive that is the subject of the conflict. Today’s rapporteur on the proposal for a directive is the same person who dealt with the Green Paper, the extremely capable Mr Manders, who, over these years, has acquired a thorough knowledge of the subject. In addition, in accordance with the competence attributed to it, the Committee on Legal Affairs has already discussed the issue and, on 21 May, held a very important hearing. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the traditional competence of the Committee on Legal Affairs in matters of environmental liability is derived precisely from Annex VI to our Rules of Procedure, which makes this Committee responsible for matters of civil liability, regardless of the sector in question.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a proposal for a directive which clearly places civil liability on the polluter’s shoulders, and it is on the basis of these problems, these issues, that I now ask Parliament to vote for the motion and confirm the decision that the Bureau has made.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, it is based on a part of the Treaty dealing with environmental protection. It will be dealt with by the Environment Council. The Committee on the Environment is responsible for environmental policy; the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is responsible for civil liability law. In fact, this directive creates an entirely new instrument to combat general environmental damage to biodiversity, water and land, and puts an administrative burden on the public authorities in the Member States to help prevent and restore such damage. It is misleading shorthand to refer to it as an environmental liability directive. The proposal should be referred to instead as the directive on the prevention and remedying of environmental damage.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, three Vice-Presidents – whom we spent one and a half days electing two and a half years ago – decided unanimously that this report should be drawn up by the Committee on the Environment. I have nothing to do with two of those Vice-Presidents as they come from groups which are miles away from the British Conservatives. The third was Mr Provan who, for all we know, still has a hotline to Mrs Thatcher's handbag.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment therefore voted to sustain its objections to the assignment to the Committee on Legal Affairs although, I have to confess, that it voted by a narrow majority.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, our rapporteur, Mr Papayannakis, is already hard at work on this directive. We appreciate the work Mr Manders has done on the opinion on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs. However, I have to say to the Liberal Group that it has no chance of persuading Mr Papayannakis to give up his rapporteurship in favour of a Liberal.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">There is one simple reason for this: if the Liberal Group wishes to take over the rapporteurship in the Committee on the Environment, it is bottom of the list. The following groups have first choice: the UEN, the PSE, the EDD, even the non-attached, and the PPE are higher up the list than the Liberals.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one other possibility that nobody has thought of: what happens if there is a tie when we vote? I suggest that, in the event of a tie, we assign it to the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities which is looking for things to do.</p>

We have made quite a bit of progress here in that we have voted against the unauthorised GMOs, in other words, the kind of accidental contamination of GMOs. This is good because it was just going to leave the door open for multinational companies to use this as a way out.</p>
<p class="contents">The threshold has been lowered to 0.5% which is very good. The report also points out that if lower thresholds are technically possible then they should be achieved. The licensing procedure will now be for one year. The licence will last for one year and then be up for renewal, and this will give people time to consider whether the license should be granted a second time.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most disappointing aspects of today's vote was the fact that milk or meat products that have been derived from animals which have been fed on GMO products will not be labelled. The public have a right to know if the milk that they are drinking comes from animals that have been fed on GMO feed, or whether the meat that they are eating has been derived from animals which have been fed on GMO feed. There is definitely a clear link here between what people eat and what the animals have been fed. We can see this clearly with the whole issue of BSE. It is quite clear that what the animals were being fed had a very serious and negative consequence on the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">The consumer, therefore, has a right to know and a right to choose and it was disappointing that this point was not voted through in the report today. It is, however, a very substantial move forward. Europe is showing the United States in particular that we really put consumers first, multinationals do not have the right to dictate to consumers what they should or should not have, and consumers have the right to obtain information and to know clearly what they are purchasing and what they are consuming. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having said that, with all respect to the report, the Pensioners’ Party and I are in favour of GMOs. I am in favour of progress and progress cannot be halted.

But having said our ‘yes’ to transparency, openness and consumer protection we have not made as much progress as we had hoped. Instead of judging the acid test of a solution to be its practicality, the majority of this Parliament preferred an ideological solution. I believe that even the populist emphasis, which was supported so vehemently, does not solve the problem but rather creates even more uncertainty. Unfortunately, the approach chosen is, in my opinion, not very practical.

Its approval has, therefore, become of strategic importance, not only for the European Union, but also for its contribution to stopping the spread of GMOs in developing and least-developed countries. The amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party are to be regretted. What we clearly need to focus on now is avoiding the worst, given that the priority is to maintain the moratorium on new authorisations in the field of GMOs, because, as everyone knows, these are hindering future options since they are a dead end, with unpredictable consequences for the environment, for the economy and for human and animal health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite this, we should already take account of the possibility that life as a whole, as a result of cross-fertilisation, especially in plant life, will change as a consequence, and that diseases will emerge to which man and animal are not entirely immune. Instead of taking time to look into this properly, this Parliament decided two years ago to create scope for commercial applications. This means that some undertakings can make a profit in the short term using something which will at a later stage mainly generate costs. </p>
<p class="contents">Now that the first line of defence against the possible risks of genetic contamination has been removed, it is all the more important for the second line of defence to remain in place. Thanks to the labelling of genetically contaminated products, consumers are given the option of not buying them. This is preferable to placing ordinary natural products in an exemption situation by prescribing that they state that they have not been modified by genetic procedures. However, it is to be feared that as usual, many consumers, mainly those on a low income, will buy the cheapest products. For them, paying attention to possible negative effects is a luxury they cannot afford. Labelling, therefore, only solves a small part of the problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I welcome the legislation that we are approving today (on the traceability and labelling of GMOs), because it makes it possible to register and monitor the movement of GMOs on the market and of the foods for human and animal consumption made from them. This will enable consumers to make their choices and will make the process of product withdrawal easier, should this be deemed necessary. Nevertheless, we would have preferred these laws to be incorporated into a single regulation and not into two, which is what has ultimately happened at the proposal of the European Commission. What we have as a result is the unnecessary fragmentation of legislation on GMOs.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the proposal for a Directive contains provisions which, through an excess of zeal, could open the way to fraud and deception, to the misleading of consumers and to the distortion of competition. The rules must be clear and straightforward. I therefore support the proposals for amendments tabled by the rapporteur for traceability and consistent labelling to apply to GMOs and products in which genetically modified DNA or genetically modified proteins are detected. Extending labelling to other products containing no traces of genetically modified DNA or of genetically modified proteins would be extremely confusing to consumers.

On more than one point, the draft text reflects the pressure exerted by the agrifood lobby. It is particularly nefarious to propose an acceptable ceiling for the presence of GMOs in products on sale, given that GMOs are banned on account of the danger they pose! As Karin Scheele emphasises in her report to Parliament, such a measure “would undermine all the European Union’s legislation on biosafety”. As for the GMOs that are already authorised, the Commission proposes a very high threshold, below which there would be no mandatory labelling to inform consumers of the presence of those GMOs. We therefore support the rapporteur’s proposal that this threshold be lowered from 1 per cent to 0.5 per cent. Similarly, we support every amendment that strengthens the directive in terms of authorisation procedure and of the public’s right to information.</p>
<p class="contents">These seemingly technical questions of labelling and traceability have crucial political and democratic implications, which strike a particularly sharp chord in France at a time when José Bové, head of the <span class="italic">Confédération Paysanne</span>, has been imprisoned because of his campaign for a food-production system in which due consideration is given to the rights of producers, the health of the general public and the quality of the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We need more reliable information on origin than we have at present so that farmers can be sure about what the produce they buy, especially from outside the EU, contains. At the moment farmers cannot completely guarantee that the food or raw materials they produce are GM free. No responsibility can be taken unless raw materials can be comprehensively monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">To ensure that farmers and, at the same time, the others in the food chain are legally protected, it is important to keep the GMO labelling threshold at 1%. Any reduction in this will not significantly improve consumer protection; on the contrary, the system will be prone to incorrect labelling. Similarly, labelling eggs or milk, whose checking process has involved the use of GMOs, will be of no benefit, owing to the questionable degree of reliability involved. Farmers cannot give assurances using current technology regarding the GM content of the raw materials they use. Extending traceability to livestock products, where GM feed has been used in feeding the animals, is not a realistic idea. Traceability in such cases would in practice require the origin of all raw materials used in food to be monitored. The ten-year period for the maintenance of monitoring data, as proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, instead of the five years proposed by the Commission, is, in my opinion, unreasonably long. It will prove cumbersome and will not significantly increase levels of safety for the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">For the reasons outlined above I voted in favour of supporting the legal protection of farmers where it related to this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Extending the scope of the labelling and traceability requirement to include animals that, at some stage in their lives, were fed feedingstuffs which consist of, either wholly or partly, GMO or similar ingredients, or are produced using them, was more than one bridge too far.

This choice is not guaranteed at the moment, and that is a missed opportunity. We will now lead many consumers astray. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The company had applied for, and obtained, all the necessary licences, so nothing could go wrong. People living in the vicinity were not informed about the current use of the storage space, so nobody could become worried or ask for safety measures to be stepped up. Two days later, I asked the European Commission for maximum openness and the application of the Seveso II Directive. A few weeks later, along with three other Dutch MEPs, I had an interview with Commissioner Wallström, during which she committed herself to the proposal to step up the Seveso Directive, on which we are voting today. </p>

Unfortunately, we have now also observed that an opposing movement is at play. The Rotterdam municipality is complaining that its position as the world’s largest port is at risk because much shipped freight comprises a number of containers with Chinese fireworks which, further to new safety requirements, are no longer admitted. Antwerp is said to allow such ships to enter its port, upon which the fireworks are transported by lorry to Rotterdam, a process which is even more dangerous.

Extending the criterion of added Community value will prevent the outermost regions being penalised, bearing in mind in particular that it might be difficult to find outside partners willing to enter into collaboration with institutes based in outermost regions, whatever the quality of the projects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He believes the single currency will inject fresh impetus into the integration process, because it will make people “ask why it is possible to have a single currency but not to eliminate other barriers between the countries of the euro area”. He concludes that “European integration might become more of a ‘bottom-up’ process, initiated by the citizens of Europe, and less of a ‘top-down’ process driven by politicians and experts”.</p>
<p class="contents">This text contains two implicit admissions – firstly, the present institutional structure is unstable; secondly, the construction of Europe has hitherto been primarily a matter for “politicians and experts”.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the idea that the citizens of Europe might demand closer integration because of the single currency seems questionable to us. This is no doubt the wish of the Eurocrats, who would like the people finally to tell them how right they have been all along. But such a mood is certainly not observable on the ground at the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides, the process described by Mr Duisenberg is not really spontaneous but tends rather to be remote-controlled from above, through the existence of the single currency. Manipulation all the way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report ignores the current economic situation and once again calls for further liberalisations, privatisations, integration of capital markets and, obviously, more labour flexibility and considers the criticism of the ECB’s behaviour in relation to the Federal Reserve to be unfair, overlooking the fact that the deflationist policy pursued has contributed to unemployment, whilst the restrictive monetary policy has not allowed skilful use to be made of the period of economic growth in the second half of the 1990s.

The reason for transferring it from private to state ownership was that money circulation should be a democratically verifiable core task of the government. This pertains to the policy regarding exchange rates, interest rates, the extent of money circulation and the implications for employment, public goods, environmental protection and the prices of consumer goods. By disconnecting a centralised European circulation bank from political interference, the link between the electorate and this core government task is severed, and we are back in the old, unsatisfactory situation we were in a century ago. </p>
<p class="contents">The fact that every year, a report is discussed in this Parliament may be useful in order to air any conflicting views on the policy adopted in the past and to be expected in future, but the bank should not be concerned with this. There is even a tendency to blatantly do the exact opposite from what politicians prescribe. According to Mrs Kauppi, the bank has done a sterling job once again, but opinions may differ on this. The fact that the euro is achieving parity with the dollar again is caused by the tax level in the US which is structurally too low in relation to inevitable government expenditure combined with the waste in defence. I am only satisfied with the proposal to curtail secrecy by making the Minutes public. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Very heavy pressure was brought to bear on her to withdraw or compromise on her report. She is to be congratulated for standing her ground.</p>
<p class="contents">The report points out that abortion rates are high in countries with poor sex education and where contraception is not emphasised. Abortion, the report states, should not be used as a contraceptive. I am sure we all agree that this is a concern.</p>
<p class="contents">The report states that in order to safeguard women's reproductive health and rights, abortion should be made safe, legal and accessible to all. In Ireland, according to the Supreme Court decision some time ago in the "X" case, where there is real and substantial risk to the life of the mother and when this risk could only be averted by the termination of her pregnancy, such a termination is lawful. This means that abortion is, in fact, legal in Ireland but is not legislated for. This is of concern to doctors, who do not have a framework of legislation within which to work and therefore feel unable to comply with this Supreme Court ruling.</p>
<p class="contents">Access to abortion for Irish women is a concern. Over 6 600 women from Ireland had abortions in the UK last year. Recently, the formula under which EU citizens access health care in other countries which is not available to them on their home territory has been invoked. I would very much like an explanation from the Commission, under the subsidiarity rules, as to how this will operate in practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament should therefore not be debating reports that convey the impression that it does, and to do so raises unnecessary fears on the part of many European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is complicated further by the fact that Ireland will soon be holding a second referendum on the Treaty of Nice. Raising the issue of abortion in the European Parliament today gives oxygen to Irish Eurosceptics. They will cite today's vote on this issue as evidence that Europe wants to foist abortion on Ireland against its will and is, therefore, an undemocratic project. While this is patently untrue, today's adoption of this report, coupled with the proposed mid-term reform of the CAP, will now make it extremely difficult to secure ratification of the Treaty of Nice. Regrettably, if this happens, those who supported today's report will have won a Pyrrhic victory and must bear some responsibility if the Irish electorate rejects it again.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on parliamentary colleagues to cease compiling reports on issues for which we have no competence and instead concentrate on areas where we have codecision powers in framing European law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has no hesitation in interfering in the areas of competence of the Member States, and even in those of the candidate countries, giving advice on sex education and on legalising abortion.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of form, the text employs typical methods to extend European competences. Last night, Commissioner Byrne explained that, of course, ‘sexual and reproductive rights’ are not strictly speaking included in the treaties, but that, on the other hand, ‘reproductive health’ may be linked to public health in general, for which the Community has a few additional competences. In any case, in the absence of any genuine control of subsidiarity, the European institutions are free to say whatever they like.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of content, the Van Lancker report has dealt with the sensitive subject of abortion too superficially. Each country must be able to decide on the basis of its own values and its own approach.

The height of absurdity is reached when the Commission calls on Member States not to prosecute in cases of illegal abortions!</p>

This is one of the reasons why I have voted against. The European Union does not have competence in the field of sexual or reproductive health – as Commissioner Byrne clearly reminded us yesterday – which falls to the Member States. This is shown by the fact that the report does not make legislative proposals but restricts itself to making recommendations to the governments of the Member States and the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">But above all I have voted against the report because I do not agree in any way with its proposals. The value of human life must be preserved and not destroyed. It is one thing to promote appropriate sexual information programmes, family planning and contraception advice and sexual health services, and it is quite another to recommend the legalisation of abortion. The right to life takes precedence over any other right, including women’s rights, and its defence must be the main objective of the policies implemented by public authorities.</p>

There are indeed wide disparities between the various European countries but also between rich and poor within each country. The same applies to sexual violence, which is a real and widespread phenomenon. The report therefore calls on all Member States to establish a system for the distribution of free or very low-priced contraceptives, to legalise abortion, to develop proper information and education policies for young people and to support women who are victims of sexual abuse.</p>

None the less, it is an interesting and progressively minded exhortation that seeks to improve the situation for those thousands of women who are compelled to suffer abortions in sordid conditions, sometimes at the risk of their own lives.

I am referring not only to the vote on more than 400 amendments in various reports, which reveal a regulatory fury which is totally contrary to the concept of a simplified and simplifying European Union, the only kind of Union that will be able to move closer to the citizens. There is also the adoption of the Van Lancker report on rights in the field of sexual and reproductive health, which represents intolerable interference not only in the sphere of individual consciences but also in the powers of the Members States.</p>
<p class="contents">I have, therefore, voted against the report, not only because of its substance, which has been largely resolved in my country through a referendum, but also because of the intrusive method that this vote unfortunately used. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For the Left, the Right does not exist. Everything depends merely on the ideological cause that is being pursued. Ultimately, it is for this very reason that, by interfering in areas it is not asked to, the Union is becoming unpopular with many people, for a variety of reasons. However, if we really want to discuss who influences whom in the long term, I think it will be the humanist Portuguese legislation, which stands in opposition to the liberalisation of abortion and which protects the right to life that will be adopted in other countries in the course of the century. In the face of progress in genetics, in embryology, in fetology and in medicine, the twenty-first century will not be able to continue for much longer to deny what is increasingly well known, down to the last detail: in every abortion crisis, there is a human life waiting to emerge. This life is individual, unique and unrepeatable – with a dignity that must be recognised and fully protected. On the day when human dignity prevails throughout Europe and we are all States in which the Rule of Law applies to everyone, no one will take pride in the numbers revealed in the statistics of these decades. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The issue of abortion does not belong at European level, as public health matters fall within national competence. We Christian Democrats believe it would be wrong to allow the EU to take over from the Swedish Parliament and other national parliaments the competence to legislate on the legal protection of an unborn child. This issue is fundamental to the moral position of people and countries, their view of the inviolability of life and human value, and is so clearly linked to various national traditions that it must remain at national parliamentary level.</p>
<p class="contents">The report clearly states its position on the issue of abortion in item 12: “The European Parliament recommends that, in order to safeguard women’s reproductive health and rights, abortion should be made legal, safe and accessible to all.”</p>
<p class="contents">This item shows that the European Parliament is clearly not prepared to show any regard for the fact that a number of Member States, including Ireland, Portugal and Germany, consider that abortions directly contradict the principle of the State’s primary task of protecting life, especially the lives of the defenceless. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
