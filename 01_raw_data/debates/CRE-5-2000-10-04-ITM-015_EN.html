<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Evans, Robert J.E. (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, this report covers a very important issue and one that has been prominent in my post bag for nearly six years. If we are serious about the European ideal, we have to be able to ensure that it is easily sold to those who are convinced about the concept and those who are not.</p>
<p class="contents">I was a teacher for 16 years and now, as an MEP, I have spent a lot of time in schools, colleges, and at conferences arguing for just this sort of action. It links in with many positive initiatives over the last few years with which we are all familiar – Socrates, Youth for Europe, Leonardo and so on. Young people in general are very positive about the European Union. They do not have the problems often associated with other age groups. They are used to multicultural and diverse communities. But confronted, as they so often are, by factors that work against the European ideal, they rely on their own experiences. We have to ensure that the experiences of young people – students and others in the educational world – are positive. Nothing will be more damaging to their developing views, than if a report such as this fails to make progress or if it fails to deliver greater mobility or if it fails to at least start to demolish the barriers that confront educational mobility today.</p>
<p class="contents">Back to the beginning. When it first presented its report, the Commission accepted that its recommendation was less than satisfactory. I understand that it even considered withdrawing it. Since then, a great deal of work by my own staff, by Parliament's staff and indeed by the Commission's own staff, to all of whom I pay warm tribute, has presented us with what I thought, until today, was perhaps a worthy if not perfect report, certainly one that was satisfactory and would go some way to achieving my aims.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, and at the eleventh hour, the Commission have advised me, albeit indirectly, of its difficulties. Firstly, I understand that the Commission now believes that all references to researchers to be outside the legal base as provided for under Articles 149 and 150. I ask the question: why is this information only available on the 4 October? Why has someone waited until now to come up with this? Was this legal advice not known when on numerous occasions I discussed its inclusion with members of the Commission staff? Indeed, when Mr Mantovani and I and the whole Social Affairs Committee were encouraged to progress the case, why was I told that the researchers would be the subject of a later Commission recommendation if there is no legal base for it? And why in 1996 did the Commission publish a Green Paper – Education, Training and Research – if there was no legal base for it? Was that, I ask, not a waste of Commission and Parliament time and indeed money, then and now.</p>
<p class="contents">No-one has more respect than I for Mrs Reding and her Commission staff so I am sure that tonight in her response she will be able to address the particular points that I raise and that she will not present a prepared statement.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn to some of the particulars which I addressed in the report – details which were defined and honed in response to discussions with a huge number of parties, from students to ministers, teaching unions to government, representatives from several, if not all, the countries. The report seeks to remove legal and administrative, and indeed cultural, barriers to mobility. It promotes the wider use of a variety of financial means of assistance. It tries to promote an EU-wide area of qualifications and specifically to make the lot of third-country nationals easier regarding mobility. Specifically my report replaces the worthy international generalisations by, in effect, repatriating the decisions to the Member States. I tried to make sure that the report only covers areas over which Parliament and the Commission has jurisdiction. I have endeavoured to ensure the recommendations with any fiscal implication are limited to a bare minimum.</p>
<p class="contents">As with any Parliament report, experience has shown that there is little chance of anything happening, or at best little possibility of uniformity across Europe, if there is no monitoring. For reasons which I understand, but which will have the effect of neutering the whole report, the Commission will, I am led to believe, be rejecting Amendments Nos 46 to 51. Indeed, they have already press-released it to the effect that they are going to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I say to you that without an action plan, without any indicators to see who is doing what, and how well they are doing, without assessment of progress, there will be so many discrepancies, so many complaints, so many letters in your post bag, so many students and teachers knocking at your door, and indeed so many MEPs lobbying you, that I suggest you will wish, even allowing for the constraints under which you work, that you had accepted the amendments I proposed and which I hope Parliament will accept.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I was both pleased and flattered when this report was referred to by President Chirac in his speech to Parliament some weeks ago. If the French Presidency are now serious, then I suggest that Council will have to work very hard to salvage both their and the Commission's reputation as a matter of urgency for I suggest the failure to endorse this report in its entirety will send all the wrong, and very confusing, messages to important groups of our society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would especially like to thank Mr Evans and Mr Martens for their fruitful cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">During the nineties the Commission produced several recommendations on the issue but no practical solutions were found. I therefore hope that, this time, a solution will be found once and for all, so that mobility throughout the European Union – of students, young persons undergoing training, young volunteers, teachers and trainers – will become one of the crowning glories of the European Union, putting paid to that paradox whereby it is easier for goods, capital or services to move within the European Union than it is for the citizens themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems to be resolved vary from country to country: for example, regulations differ on matters of social security, study grants, right of residence and taxation, and there is no system for the mutual recognition of qualifications and work placements. Then there is a dearth of information on opportunities for mobility and there is the barrier of the lack of knowledge of languages.</p>
<p class="contents">I would draw attention, out of the amendments tabled, to the inclusion in this recommendation of the specific category of researchers, since this category was originally included in the Green Paper. I am firmly of the opinion that, rising above the problems of organisation and coordination, which cannot be avoided for they are a result of the reorganisation of the directorates-general of the Commission, it is vital to support and foster research in Europe, for research is a fundamental vector for the growth, international competitiveness and development of the Member States, particularly if we compare the situation with that of the United States and consider the negative implications of mobility problems which are driving young researchers to go to the United States rather than attempt to move within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the category of researchers should be included, Mr Evans. I therefore call upon the Member States to make every endeavour, alongside the Commission, to resolve the bureaucratic and other problems of mobility, and to set specific goals in the form of a two-yearly action plan and a final report. This is the very minimum necessary if we are to achieve that area of freedom which is the basic right of every European citizen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of all the petitions we receive, many relate either to mobility within the European Union, and in particular that of students, researchers and persons undergoing training, or to the recognition of qualifications. The difficulties encountered by the petitioners are due, on the one hand, to the lack, or the complexity, of legal texts and, on the other hand, to governments’ failure to respond to the seriousness of these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission needs to draw up a list of the problems encountered by European citizens, particularly with regard to the issues of freedom of residence and freedom of establishment and, most especially, with regard to their right to work, study and obtain recognition of their qualifications in other Member States. This list must be accompanied by practical measures such as the establishment of objectives to be achieved by the Member States and the obligation on the latter to prepare periodic reports on the progress achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Student mobility would be improved if the periods of study completed in each Member State, together with the qualifications and certificates acquired, were to be fully recognised within the European Union. The European Commission should take ambitious initiatives designed, in the short term, to provide for the reciprocal recognition of academic qualifications between Member States. By responding to the problems of daily life, this European Parliament and Council Recommendation should make it possible to bring Europe closer to its citizens, in particular its youngest citizens who should be the forces involved in creating a European identity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Four years down the line, we have to recognise that very little has been done. There are still major obstacles, for example in the field of social security, health cover, extending residence permits, taxation, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">I lament the fact that, as a consequence, young people are prevented from gaining experience – study, work or other experience – in another Member State. It is about time that Europe turned its attention once more to the sound implementation of programmes such as Socrates and Youth for Europe. It is thanks to these programmes that young people can come into contact with the thinking, the language and the culture of other countries. This is why these programmes which promote student mobility are so crucially important.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, the experiences which these people gather contribute to a broader understanding of European cultures, they enhance professional experience and the command of languages, encourage familiarity with the European patrimony and increase the chances of finding employment. This is why thresholds need to be lowered on behalf of students, volunteers, university teachers and researchers – yes, I include researchers in this as well. In line with the 1996 Green Paper on mobility, this group should also benefit from the recommendations in this report. I believe that the European Commission was wrong to exclude them.</p>
<p class="contents">As is apparent from the report by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, there are still many thresholds, and during my work visits in my country, I hear many complaints every time, not only about the obstacles to mobility, but also about the implementation level, the red-tape involved in applications, the number of bodies which carry out the same inspections and late payments. Some outstanding payments date back as far as 1996.</p>
<p class="contents">The French Presidency has prioritised improved mobility for this target group. Mr Evans has done sterling work and thanks to sound cooperation, the Culture Committee approved the report on mobility unanimously last month. This is a sign that the continuous obstacles to mobility which stand in the way of students, volunteers, university teachers and researchers should be swiftly removed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was given attention, for example, in Lisbon last March at the summit there, in which matters of employment, social participation and the information society were focused on. In the Lisbon conclusions, mobility was recognised as an essential element in the information society and in the promotion of lifelong training.</p>
<p class="contents">Robert J. Evans’s report therefore discusses an extremely important issue. The greatest credit goes to the rapporteur for an approach based on the point of view of the public and the practical problems involved. Mobility is not to be promoted by noble objectives but by removing the day-to-day obstacles. I hope that the main amendments adopted by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport will be received positively by the Council, as they deserve to be, and that legislation is speedily brought into effect.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to student and teacher mobility, experience shows that the real problems of mobility are not found so much in the area of educational administration, but with the social, tax and immigration authorities. Problems with regard to retaining social security benefits, transferring benefits, and taxation still hamper mobility within the Union. Questions of responsibility have also been raised, especially when it is a matter of on-the-job learning.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding our own problems in the education sector, we cannot steer away from the difficulties there are in approving study credits. Students are still pretty much dependent on the good will of the lecturers. If that is missing, study abroad might unduly extend the actual length of time a person studies.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very glad that the rapporteur pays attention in his report to the opportunities for nationals of countries applying for membership to be included in the recommendations on mobility. The most serious problems at present concern those coming from non-member countries. Improving their status will be an effective way of building a common Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What is also important in this report is the attention given to the equal treatment of those who are the most disadvantaged, for example, the disabled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is an important report, although it does leave major question marks and give rise to serious doubts in certain areas. This report is a natural full stop to the conclusions reached in the Green Paper, which highlighted the remaining barriers to mobility, mobility which is not, as Mr Mantovani said, simply a question of goods and capital but must indeed be mobility of persons, with all the spiritual, human and cultural wealth which they can take to the different countries and thereby enrich them.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group – the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party – has tabled amendments which include the category of researchers in the recommendation: we are therefore in favour of including researchers. Moreover, we would stress that, although the proposal is certainly a firm step in the right direction, in our opinion, there are certain gaps which will require us, or rather the Commission, to work on eliminating all the remaining barriers of an administrative, legal, linguistic and cultural, but also financial nature. At the same time, it needs to produce active measures firmly promoting the teaching of at least two Community languages in every country and developing and supporting the cultural and linguistic education of our young – and not-so-young – citizens. This should include the use of new methods and new technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree that there is a need to give all those who participate in this mobility system clear, comprehensive information regarding their social security rights. In addition, we agree that direct and indirect taxes such as the tax payable for renewal of residence permits should be abolished immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, as Liberal Democrats, we agree that this mobility system should be extended to include the candidate countries as soon as possible, and we would like to express our regret at the continuing delay in the mutual recognition of qualifications, an issue with which Commissioner Reding is quite familiar and which we know to be very important to her.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we call upon you to act incisively within the Commission on this unresolved matter, so that, in full respect for national powers and sovereignty, we will indeed be able to talk of a Europe of peoples, a Europe of citizens, but also a Europe of culture. For if Europe is not a Europe of culture, it will never be Europe! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is a very sensitive subject because, as my colleagues have already pointed out to the Commission and Council, a lot of hindrances are put in the way of students, lecturers, people undergoing training and volunteers with regard to mobility within the Community. Freedom of movement for persons, goods, services and capital is enshrined in our treaties and yet young people, who are the future of the European Union and perhaps have fewer prejudices than some of us adults are denied opportunities because of the bureaucratic barriers put in their way.</p>
<p class="contents">The SOCRATES Programme was mentioned as one example of this. A survey carried out by the Commission in 1998 on the ERASMUS Programme, covering 10,000 students, showed that less than 50% of the available places were actually taken up on a full-time basis and that over 60% of the students who took those courses encountered financial difficulties. What this highlighted was that unless some serious remedial action is taken on the financing of the ERASMUS Programme and the kind of support that is made available to students, there will be inequality between those whose parents can afford to send them and those whose parents cannot.</p>
<p class="contents">I spoke on this issue in this House in the last session, but I would once again urge EU education ministers to grasp the nettle and make sure that proper initiatives and proper funding are put in place. I would also call on the Commissioner to ensure that in the next round of proper funding is available for the ERASMUS Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">One point I would like to raise finally while we are on the subject of mobility is the ongoing case in one of the Member States of the European Union with which I have been involved for the last five years, namely the question of foreign lecturers in Italy. Despite several opinions from the courts, recommendations from Commissioners and actions at Council level, nothing has been done to regulate the position of these foreign lecturers whose status was reduced by the Italian education minister. Action needs to be taken to ensure that those inequalities do not continue. I would commend this report to the House and recommend support for the amendments put forward by Mr Evans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe this to be political honesty, even if it is not pleasant to hear.</p>
<p class="contents">We have spoken many times about mobility and the shortcomings that exist in its regard. I would say that in Europe we are currently living in a climate of considerable moral fraud. Fraud, not necessarily in the eyes of the law, but certainly moral fraud, because we are sending students to other countries and then we give no recognition to their studies and nor do we give them certificates. This is moral fraud, in which we are willing partners.</p>
<p class="contents">What can we do? I think that we can do a great deal. As the Commission and Parliament, we can demand compliance from programmes that are funded by the Commission. We cannot allow universities not to recognise qualifications. Europe’s universities, in France, Spain and elsewhere, are autonomous and have the power to decide whether they will recognise diplomas and the subjects that have been studied. Universities that do not comply, however, must forfeit their subsidies. There must be clear checks and monitoring, even if only of a sample, and above all, a web site, where students can register their complaints. This is not expensive at all.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not only protecting the rights of young people, since the same applies to researchers. It is pointless to talk about lifelong learning if we ignore researchers.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Reding, Mr Busquin and his Directorate-General are not doing anything about the training of researchers, nor about the recognition of postgraduate qualifications or about doctors’ training. This has today created a void in the European Union and unless the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport addresses the problem, Europe will probably not be in a position to compete in the media, in the cinema or in research in information technology. Our human resources are our only future in a world in which there is no more valuable commodity than knowledge. We cannot allow this field to be taken away from us, even if this makes things uncomfortable in terms of the European Parliament working closely with the Commission. I think we should ask Mr Prodi to do everything possible to ensure that young people studying abroad do not feel like orphans and that researchers are not left without support, at the mercy of what their rectors decide. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So we must make every effort to close the existing gap between words on paper and the actual, practical difficulties the European citizen still encounters every day.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, the European dimension in the field of education and training plays an important role. We must, therefore, ensure that the freedoms laid down in the Treaty such as the right of residence and free movement, do not remain empty words. Transnational mobility is not just an occupational and economic requirement but calls for a forward-looking basic approach. Precisely for that reason I am still very surprised to see how many obstacles remain to greater mobility and flexibility in Europe. We therefore call for research workers to be included in the scope of the recommendations. We call for measures to dismantle the existing obstacles and to ensure that persons undergoing training can enjoy social security and other benefits, to prevent the risk of double taxation, to promote the learning of at least two Community languages and to develop means of financial assistance. Finally, we call for measures to create greater transparency in the recognition of qualifications, periods of study and training. We call on the Commission to play a more active role in promoting the mutual recognition of training certificates, which advance mobility and flexibility, so that we really can achieve our declared aims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Believe me, I know what you are saying, and a lot more besides. It is through practical action and not through green or white papers or, for that matter, black or red ones, that problems are solved. And what we have here is practical action. Believe me, it is not easy. Do not imagine that, by setting a recommendation down on paper, there will be cheers of joy from all the Member States. No, a number of Member States will have to be forced to eliminate obstacles of a kind which may seem ridiculous. However, there are still definitely barriers to the removal of these obstacles, and I have not finished persuading all the Member States of the fact, but I am still optimistic.</p>
<p class="contents">I am an optimist for two reasons. First of all because, as a European Commissioner, if I want to make progress, I cannot allow myself to be pessimistic; and secondly because, in spite of all the problems of which I am aware, hundreds of thousands of students and hundreds and thousands of parents and grandparents thank me when I meet them and tell me that the experience they were able to have was terrific. Go into the street and ask young, and not so young, people which European programmes they have heard of, and they will tell you – Socrates and Erasmus.</p>
<p class="contents">So, in spite of the persistent problems, of which I am aware, these programmes are of positive value and contribute something to the people of Europe. I agree with you that the obstacles which still exist need to be removed. I would thank you for your cooperation on this matter. It is easy to talk in a speech about removing obstacles, but less easy to remove them in practice. What is more, most of the problems of which we are aware do not stem from the Commission but from the Member States and even the regions.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, is the state of play regarding the financial problems? Mrs Pack, you are witness to the fact that the Commission and Parliament had agreed between themselves to request more money because they knew very well that the Erasmus grants were not enough and that only those who received help from their parents or grandparents or who worked during their Erasmus studies had the opportunity of benefiting from these Erasmus grants. All right, what was given was given. You have to make do. That is why I have asked the ministers, since they have not given me any more money, to ensure that supplements to the Erasmus grants are offered in their countries, and this is something we are discussing.</p>
<p class="contents">Last Saturday, I was in Paris for a Council of Ministers for Education, exclusively on the issue of mobility. Things are moving, and not just in the abstract. The rapporteur quoted President Chirac’s words on mobility. The French Presidency wishes to make mobility one of the key issues of its term of office, and will go on to do just that. In November, the Ministers of Education are going to take a decision not only on this recommendation, which is a small step in the right direction, but also on an action plan to be implemented in order to facilitate mobility and turn this into a reality. At the Council meeting in Nice, mobility will be one of the items for discussion. So you see, things are moving. Not everything needs to be seen in negative terms, because there is a lot of progress. I would say to you, however, that, for things to continue to move, some pressure needs to be exerted. So, help me to apply some pressure. You are doing so today and will do so tomorrow. I should like to thank you right now for doing this.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say that the French Presidency is not the only one to have made progress in this area. The Portuguese Presidency did a marvellous and very useful job of preparing the ground, and I should like to pay tribute to both Presidencies for the way they wish to make progress. The Lisbon Summit was something of a point of departure for a long journey which we are only just beginning. Our Heads of State and of Government and the regional and national governments have realised that education has a role to play if we want to develop the economic and social sides of the European Union. The creation of a Europe of knowledge is therefore a very important step in the right direction, but we still have a very long way to go. I have no hesitation in telling you that we shall do more than just talk. We shall take practical steps, but it cannot happen overnight. We have to keep chipping persistently away at the issue and never give up applying the pressure. However, we shall get there.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendments, the following may be accepted: 4, 5, 11, 12, 16 to 18, 25 to 27, 28, 30, 31, 33 to 38, 40, 41, 44, 52, 53, 54 and 55. I am also able to accept the following amendments, as reworded: 7, 9, 13, 20, 23, 29, 32, 42, 52 and 57 on the basis of the English text. And, finally, I am able to retain the following amendments in part: 6, 10, 15, 19, 21, 22, 24 and 42. That is almost all of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us now turn to the amendments which present problems. These concern researchers. Ever since the beginning, it has been more or less clear that researchers could not be part of the recommendation. However, as is its proper role, Parliament has exerted pressure for researchers to be included in the text nonetheless. The Commission has responded to Parliament, and these problems were tackled in a communication adopted on 18 January on the European Research Area and, in the follow-up to this communication, Commissioner Busquin will be presenting a communication on the mobility of researchers. There will therefore be a specific communication on this subject, and I think it is partly thanks to the pressure exerted by Parliament that this is going to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me now to return to Amendments Nos 46 to 51 which, with a view to ensuring that the recommendation is followed up, request the Member States and the Commission to put in place a process which might be considered similar to the Luxembourg process in the case of employment. I agree with the objective, but there is an important reason why the Commission has adopted the position it has on these amendments, and that is because, by accepting them as they stand and in their present proposed wording, the same problem would arise as when we speak about the action plan which the ministers and the Commission want to have finished drafting by November. Considerable new human resources, which do not exist at present, would be necessary. I did not want to leave the matter as it stands. That is why I spoke about it this morning at the meeting of the Commission, and the conclusion drawn by the Commissioners was clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the communication of the 26 July on matching human resources to the institution’s tasks, the Commission cannot accept new tasks unless the budgetary authority allocates it the necessary resources for carrying these out. This is a position of principle, to be applied generally and not only to what is of concern to us now. It is a collegiate position adopted by the Commission, in view of the decisions taken, in view of the peer group and in view of staffing problems. From now on, the Commission will give the same answer on all topics. The budgetary authority will therefore have to ensure that we have the material resources for taking action.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, I should nonetheless like to remind you that the Commission already has a monitoring system which will be placed within the framework of the new open method of coordination, recommended by the Lisbon European Council. This open method of cooperation is based upon the assumption that European guidelines will be established, the implementation of which it will be possible to adapt in relation to regional and national diversity. It will also, however, enable monitoring to be carried out periodically so that the Member States can progressively develop their own strategies where mobility is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, Mr Mantovani, that, over and above the questions of principle that bind me to the Commission’s collegiate decision, there is an avenue to be explored here, and it might perhaps be necessary to look for alternatives in this area. In any case, I am happy to have a discussion with you to see what can be done in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission cannot adopt Amendments Nos 8 and 58, the former because the Lisbon conclusions, which have already been listed in recital 11, encourage the Member States to take the necessary measures to promote mobility, and I can assure you that the Member States are proceeding along the right lines. They demonstrated as much last Saturday in Paris when, for a whole afternoon, they discussed the issue in depth and made commitments to mobility. A good start has been made. Finally, Amendment No 58 cannot be adopted, quite simply because it duplicates Amendment No 37 proposed by Parliament on the same subject.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we are on the right road to reaching an agreement on the content, without necessarily having to resort to a second reading. This would allow the Education Council to adopt a text on 9 November enabling the French Presidency to present the Nice European Council with the ‘mobility’ package requested by the Heads of State and Government in the conclusions to the Lisbon Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We all want the same thing. We want there to be real progress on this issue in the real conditions in our regions and our Member States. I should also like to do much more when it comes to the recognition of qualifications. At the moment, and as the Treaties at present stand, it is a national responsibility, which is not to say that I am not doing anything. I am in constant discussion with ministers. I also know that account has to be taken of the autonomy and independence of universities but, by means of our network systems, we have brought the universities closer together, and they engage ever more frequently in joint ventures and recognise students from other universities and studies completed in those universities. Things are moving slowly, and that is frustrating because the objective can be seen there before us. It is a fine objective, and we should like matters to move more quickly. In politics, things do not, unfortunately, always move as quickly as one would wish. If, however, the pressure is kept up, we shall get there. So, help me to do just that.</p>
