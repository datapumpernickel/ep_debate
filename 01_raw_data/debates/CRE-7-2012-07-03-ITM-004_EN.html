<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Helle Thorning-Schmidt, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span>– Mr President, President of the Commission, distinguished leaders of the political groups, Members of the European Parliament and Members of the Commission, it is a privilege and a great honour to address this Parliament again. When I last stood here, back in January, I ended my speech by saying that the economic crisis had put the European Union to the test. That was when we took over the Presidency at a time of unprecedented crisis in the history of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The gravity of the situation, the depth of the challenge, the severity of the predicament facing our Union could not, and should not, be underestimated, and I said this right at the beginning of our Presidency – not to lower the expectations for the Danish Presidency, but rather to make clear exactly what is at stake as the EU tries to work its way out of this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">During the past month, the EU has been forced to take critical decisions which will lay the foundation for the Europe of tomorrow, of next year and of decades to come. This is no easy task in a Union as vast, diverse and complex as ours, but leaders throughout Europe must never lose sight of the core of the problem facing the EU today: that our very economic foundation, our future prosperity, the hopes and dreams and aspirations of our children are at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">The storm has not passed yet and we are still facing a number of different and intertwined challenges. So I am reminded at this time of the inspirational words of the first Chancellor of West Germany, Konrad Adenauer, who once said: ‘The unity of Europe was the dream of a few. It became the hope of many. Today, it has become a necessity for all of us’.</p>
<p class="contents">Those words have perhaps never been as true as they are today. The EU is a necessity to all of us. As representatives of the European institutions, we have and we feel an obligation to find the solutions which will bring our Union forward, and we know that we owe that to our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">When I stood here in January, I proudly stated that I am a European at heart, and the past six months have only reassured me in my belief in the European project. I believe in our institutions, our cooperation and our common responsibility. If we seek to ensure solidarity, growth and prosperity, we must seek it together through common solutions to common problems.</p>
<p class="contents">And that is what our Presidency has been all about: ensuring solidarity, growth and prosperity together. We took upon ourselves the task of proving that the EU still works and is still capable of delivering necessary results for our citizens, and we did this inspired by someone that we all know. In 1950 he said: ‘Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity’. Of course, it was Robert Schuman who said this, and the subsequent history of European integration has proved him absolutely right.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an unequivocal truth in Schuman’s words. Our Union is built from its very foundation with bricks made of solidarity. Some stones have been small, some have been enormous but, brick by brick, we have strengthened our cooperation and solidarity with one another. This is to me the essence of our Union: and this is what we have tried to do – to work inch by inch in creating results.</p>
<p class="contents">Jobs and growth, financial responsibility, a greener economy and a safe Europe: these have been the priorities of the Danish Presidency. But priorities without tangible results are just empty words, and I believe that Europe has, in fact, delivered over the past months. The Compact for Growth and Jobs adopted last week in the European Council is the perfect completion of our Presidency. The Compact does not solve all Europe’s problems but it is a light in the dark for the many European citizens feeling the harsh effects of the economic crisis. For those outside the labour market, for those without opportunities, for those facing poor prospects, including not least our young generations, we are presenting a way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a result of our persistent efforts to promote growth and new jobs in Europe but, of course, our work does not end here. We must be vigilant in transforming this Compact from a piece of paper into practical reality. We must find a way to ensure that together – Member States, the Commission and the European Parliament – we roll out the measures contained in the Compact.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a situation in which, for the first time in the history of the European Union, we cannot assume that the coming generations will enjoy more prosperity and better opportunities than we have enjoyed. That, of course, leaves us with a huge responsibility for the conditions of our citizens and businesses, which has been a top priority for our Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me highlight a few of the main results reached during our Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the headline of ‘a more dynamic Europe’, the Danish Presidency has pushed for robust EU measures in areas such as research and education, infrastructure and the single market, and we have done this to boost growth and to kick-start a job-rich recovery. I am particularly pleased that we have succeeded in achieving a historic compromise in the European Council on the patent reform, after more than 30 years of negotiations. This could mean drastic cost savings for businesses across Europe: savings that can be used to promote new jobs. We may not see eye to eye on all elements of this compromise, but I truly hope that we can work as colegislators to see the patent reform become a reality to benefit our companies.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very pleased that we have adopted the Roaming Regulation. This regulation will lower prices significantly for cellphone users in Member States and will reduce costs to and the burden on companies. In short, it can contribute to growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important result is the regulation on the European system of standardisation. The agreement reached here will modernise the single market. Furthermore, we have reached agreement on the proposal on venture capital and social entrepreneurship funds. This will boost access to funding for European businesses and social entrepreneurs. Of course, this is also an important step in trying to create growth in the EU. We know that the single market has been one of the greatest achievements of the EU and, in order to realise its full potential, we must continue to reform and modernise it.</p>
<p class="contents">The second main objective of our Presidency was to ensure a more responsible Europe. The need for fiscal consolidation and greater budget discipline is crucial if we want to safeguard against the financial crisis of tomorrow. We have also taken important steps in this field during the Danish Presidency. The Council agreement on the ‘two-pack’ will enable stronger European monitoring of budgetary plans being drafted by members of the eurozone. Stronger common rules will reinforce the vigilance of Member States in avoiding large imbalances and unsustainable debt levels. We have come far, and I urge a rapid agreement between the Council and Parliament during the Cypriot Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">A similar important step is the directive on capital requirements, on which the Council agreed its position last month. This directive will help minimise the cost and the risk of a financial crisis hitting us again as it did in 2008. Furthermore, we have worked for a stronger commitment by Member States to implement structural reforms. The completion of the first full round of the European Semester is a decisive step towards a more responsible Europe. All these results will help to increase confidence in Europe’s financial system, and I am in no doubt that these surveillance measures will lead to greater political accountability and stronger budget discipline.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have been working hard to streamline the next EU budget so that it helps to create growth in the Union, and we took an important step last week in the European Council. Here too, I would very much like to thank Parliament for its constructive cooperation throughout.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our firm conviction that we need to direct more funds towards growth-enhancing areas such as research, education, energy efficiency and green technology. That has to be the way forward for the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Measures that will inspire growth and stronger job creation’ has been the mantra for the Danish Presidency throughout these six months, and I am pleased to note that the European Council placed strong emphasis on this last week. As you also know, the transition to a green economy has been among the most important political priorities for the Danish Presidency, and I warmly welcome the common agreement reached on the Energy Efficiency Directive. This was a landmark result which required a good deal of flexibility, patience and hard work on both sides, and I would like to thank everyone here who was involved in reaching this significant milestone. Without you, we could not have done it.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is of key importance in our efforts to achieve our two inter-related goals, of transforming Europe into a competitive, low-carbon economy and increasing our energy security, all at once. In addition, the directive will create up to hundreds of thousands of new jobs in Europe and it will, of course, ensure that the EU gets much closer to our target of 20% energy savings by 2020. I consider this an excellent result.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to underline my appreciation of the dedication, high level of ambition, and willingness to compromise demonstrated by the European Parliament on this road to the green transition. Your continued engagement in making our economy greener will be ever more needed in the years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">Underpinning our aspiration for a dynamic, responsible and greener Europe is the need to ensure a safe Europe. Denmark’s Presidency has achieved a wide range of tangible results in this field. We have granted candidate status to Serbia and are opening accession negotiations with Montenegro, which will influence the regional dynamics and contribute to stabilising the Western Balkans. We have also reached agreement on essential elements of the asylum package, which will help ensure efficiency, legal rights and more uniform asylum procedures in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with Parliament and the Commission, we have managed to conclude a lot of important business. And today I am pleased to say that we were able to reach important agreements only thanks to constructive cooperation with you – the Parliament, with the Commission and, of course, with the Member States in the Council. As I see it, the achievements of the Danish Presidency are also the achievements of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We all play our part in realising the huge potential of the Community method. Having different responsibilities, playing different roles and, on some occasions, defending diverging interests, the Council and Parliament will not always share the same view. The heated debate on the legal basis of the Schengen evaluation mechanism was, indeed, a case in point, but I drew great encouragement from the fact that our negotiations over the past six months have been characterised by flexibility, a willingness to find common ground and, most importantly perhaps, a strong commitment to deliver on the needs and demands of the citizens. The relentless focus on results, stone by stone, brick by brick, represents the spirit of our cooperation within the EU. At the end of the day, as we strive to put Europe on a path for future growth and prosperity, we have to be guided by our vision for the society that we want to create. For me, this is what sets the Union apart and what makes our social model so unique.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what I believe in. That is what has made our economies so successful over the years and that is what we must fight to obtain and sustain and develop in the future. Moving Europe beyond this crisis is not about abandoning our social model. It is, in fact, the opposite. It is about bringing our countries through the crisis with our fundamental values intact – values such as solidarity, safety nets and equal opportunities for all. The difficult decisions we are taking today and tomorrow should not be a departure from solidarity. On the contrary, we are doing these things to protect our way of life, our European social model and our values, and we will continue to do so. The only way forward is through stronger cooperation among all of us. The answer to our current challenges facing the Union is more Europe, not less, and that has been the guiding principle for the Danish Presidency throughout.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, I would like to thank Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt and her whole team, particularly Europe Minister Wammen, for a very engaged and dynamic Presidency. The Presidency programme was called ‘Europe at work’ and I think it is fair to say that you were a Presidency at work. You made a real effort to contribute to ensuring stability for Europe in these difficult times. I particularly congratulate you, Prime Minister, for your personal commitment to competitiveness and growth and to the green agenda, areas in which your country, Denmark, is a great inspiration for many of us in Europe, and indeed in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of this work are, to a large extent, reflected in the conclusions of the European Council and cover the full range of the Union’s activities. Since we will be discussing the results of the European Council and the euro area summit in the following debate, in this speech I will only highlight a number of specific issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start with the economy. We have almost completed the second European Semester. Very serious and in-depth work has taken place on the Commission’s proposals for country-specific recommendations and I am satisfied with the consensus that has emerged around them. This work cannot, of course, be separated from our agenda for economic growth. As the Commission has made very clear, growth can be achieved only through the combination of structural reforms and targeted investment. The Growth Compact, which has now been approved, recognises this and, indeed, paves the way for determined pro-growth action.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore appreciate, in particular, the speedy and constructive manner in which the proposal on the pilot project bonds for transport, energy and telecommunications infrastructure has been handled. I am very happy that we have reached a final agreement on the Commission proposal. The initiative will stimulate investment in infrastructure at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">I also appreciate the efforts to reach an agreement on the so-called ‘two-pack’, which is a central element in the EU-level drive to strengthen economic and budgetary surveillance. This would also represent a first step towards implementing important elements of the fiscal treaty. Thus, I welcome the general approach in Council and I strongly hope that Parliament and the incoming Cypriot Presidency can come to a final agreement before the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally important is our progress in the area of financial markets and financial services. Agreement could be reached on our proposals on derivative markets and on the single European payment area. Very importantly, we are making enormous progress on the bank capital requirements package, as well as on credit rating agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">While the Commission proposal for a financial transaction tax has, unfortunately, not met with unanimous support from Member States, I would like to welcome the decision to start negotiations, under enhanced cooperation, for all Member States that wish to join the initiative. This is a very important development. After all, we have seen once again in recent months and weeks – both in the United States and in Europe, including in some of the major banking institutions – that practices which fuelled the financial crisis have not yet been eradicated from the sector. Once again, we have been confronted with reckless trading and market manipulation. It is time for these practices to stop once and for all, and for a sector that owes so much to taxpayers’ support to agree to hand back a fair share to society.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the very difficult negotiations on the proposed directive on energy efficiency, the agreement found by the colegislators at first reading will be a major step in delivering the objective of 20% primary energy savings in 2020. The Commission estimates that the outcome reached would allow the delivery of approximately two thirds of the total energy savings in the Commission’s original proposal. So, while we welcome what has been achieved, we must also say that further work on reaching our 2020 objectives will be needed.</p>
<p class="contents">I was very pleased by the agreement reached on the Roaming III Regulation. This is an example of legislation that truly benefits European citizens and consumers. The regulation entered into force on 1 July 2012. By putting a cap on data roaming, we are taking an important step towards protecting consumers against shock bills, and completing the digital single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe should be a global standard setter. Therefore, I also welcome the agreement reached on reform of the standardisation system, which will enable more efficient standard setting in Europe. Furthermore, the general approaches agreed in the Council on the accounting directives, on venture capital funds and social entrepreneurship funds, and on alternative dispute resolution will hopefully prove to be a good basis for reaching agreement with Parliament very soon. On the matter of professional qualifications, we could have wished for more progress, but work will continue.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, of course, necessary to make special mention of the debate on the European patent, something which has been under discussion for decades. There was a compromise on this between the participating Member States, but unfortunately it comes at the price of the deletion of important Community elements of the original Commission proposal. While recognising the great efforts made by the Danish Presidency on this difficult issue, and indeed thanking you sincerely for those efforts, Prime Minister, the Commission has therefore reserved its position, and I made this very clear to the Heads of State or Government during the European Council. The situation will now require an assessment by the three EU institutions. We are ready to work with you on this.</p>
<p class="contents">A central theme of the past semester was the effort made in bringing forward the multiannual financial framework (MFF). Last week, the European Council considered that the negotiating box prepared by the Danish Presidency provided a basis and orientations for the final stage of negotiation during the Cypriot Presidency, with a view to reaching an agreement by the end of 2012. In this respect, let me reiterate that the Commission is fully aware of and will call for full observance of the institutional prerogatives of all the EU institutions. It was the Commission, by the way, which strongly insisted on this point during the preparation for this European Council and, indeed, when its conclusions were adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate on the MFF will now enter its decisive stage. The Commission considers that the negotiating box is still missing some important elements or, in our view, is not the appropriate answer in some areas. While fully recognising the very serious work done so far, the Commission will therefore continue to defend its proposals under the incoming Presidency. I believe it is now clearer that the European Union budget is an essential instrument for achieving sustainable growth and jobs through investment.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly happy that we managed to agree on a new Financial Regulation. I want to extend my thanks to the relevant players in Parliament and the Council who have worked closely with the Commission. I know we went through a process of long and difficult negotiations. The final adoption of the Financial Regulation before the end of the year will allow for proper implementation of all the sectoral programmes of the MFF. Thus, I strongly hope that the Council and Parliament, with the support of the Commission, will manage to reach agreement on the MFF by the end of this year. The European Union needs to send a signal that, until the end of this decade, it will have a strong budget for growth and cohesion. The European Union needs to show that it is able to take difficult decisions in difficult times.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of justice and home affairs, there has been good progress on important issues. Let me mention the asylum package, notably the Dublin II Regulation and the Reception Conditions Directive. Negotiations have also advanced on the Asylum Procedures Directive, and reform of the Visa Regulation is on track.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the same cannot yet be said of another important issue, namely, the legal basis and nature of the Schengen evaluation mechanism. We are all aware of the sensitivity of this issue. As far as the Commission is concerned, we want solutions that can work. That is why we believe, together with this Parliament, that we need a Schengen evaluation mechanism with a strong European dimension. We are convinced that an intergovernmental peer review model does not deliver on the mandate set by the European Council of March 2011, and that it would have limited added value in practice. Since the Lisbon Treaty in particular, free movement of people has been a genuine Community concern. As I have said before, the Commission cannot accept the current outcome as final, and it will continue to work for a better solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me end with a look at the external dimension. The focus on internal European issues has always had to be combined with a broader perspective on Europe’s role in the world, and never more so than in relation to the preparations for, and decisions in, the Rio+20 Summit for sustainable development. Although a number of our most ambitious objectives were not fully achieved, the European Union remained committed and constructive throughout the negotiations, and our positions had a very important impact on the debate. I would like particularly to welcome the very good cooperation between the Commission and the Danish Council Presidency. In fact, both Prime Minister Thorning-Schmidt and I were present at this Rio conference. And let me tell you that without European leadership in this conference, we would not have achieved what appears to me to be a significant outcome. Green growth is now explicitly and formally accepted by the international community as an indispensable part of our sustainable development agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Important progress has been achieved during the past six months of the Danish Council Presidency. I wish to reiterate my thanks for what has been very good cooperation. However, we are only too aware of how serious the situation is and how much we still need to accomplish in the time ahead. I therefore count on the ongoing commitment and ambition of all the EU institutions in meeting our common challenges. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we are well aware, during the past half-year – and not only during that time – the main focus in general and the main subject of discussions in the press has been the financial and economic crisis. The Danish Presidency has been greatly tempted to devote all its energy and all of its efforts to these matters only, leaving everything else that is also important to us aside. However, it has not done so. Here, I have to say hats off (particularly considering that it is a small country) for being able to simultaneously devote attention to, shall we say, the main problems that we have, while addressing many other issues as well. I will not speak about the many other issues. They have already been discussed by Mr Barroso and will still be discussed by others; I wish to focus on energy in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Thinking about our interests in the future, it is, of course, very important that we are moving toward a single European energy policy. That will make our energy supply more secure, help reduce CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions and – very importantly – help reduce our import dependence. Under the leadership of the Danish Presidency, matters connected with energy efficiency legislation have been addressed, as have matters connected with the legislation on energy supplies from third countries, on which we shall not be voting in this House, in Parliament, until September. With regard to this legislation on energy supply agreements with third countries, the Danish Presidency met with absolute resistance from the rest of the Council. Essentially, most of the Member States of the Council did not wish to adopt this legislation at all in any wording, and, thanks to the leadership of the Danish Presidency, a compromise solution has been achieved on which Parliament will be able to take a vote in September, bringing us one step closer to a common energy policy. Therefore, hats off and my thanks to the Danish Presidency, which has devoted energy and efforts not only to solving the economic crisis, but also to other issues that are important to us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hannes Swoboda, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Prime Minister, many thanks for your Presidency and, above all, for the list that you read out today of everything that took place under the Danish Presidency. It is an impressive list, I really must admit that. Of course, the Danish Presidency was overshadowed by two factors that did not make life easy for you. First of all, there was the economic crisis. I am very pleased – and I am sure we will come back to this – that, in the end, at the final summit, we managed to take a few positive steps in the direction of growth, as that is absolutely essential if we are to overcome the crisis. Then, of course, there were the actions of the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Patents Directive has been mentioned. This House has been fighting for a European patent for years. The result will overcome the arguments and the animosities between individual countries. At the last moment, a few countries did manage to blemish this positive result, however. I actually find it very strange that, for example, the United Kingdom, which constantly criticises how we have three seats for the European Parliament, pushed for there to be three seats for the patent court.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That is clearly a position that is absolutely intolerable. What it does show us, however, is what many a government really cares about.</p>
<p class="contents">It was a similar story with the budget. Once again, the European Council got involved, although my fellow Members and the Danish Presidency managed to rescue the situation between them. The European Council – and I will also say this to Mr Van Rompuy – should concern itself with those things that are its responsibility. It should not be making out detailed legislation. That is not the job of the European Council – it is the job of the Council, together with the European Parliament, to legislate. That needs to be made clear at long last.</p>
<p class="contents">A second item that I would particularly like to emphasise is the Energy Efficiency Directive. This is not just a directive; it is a position, a direction. I am grateful to Mr Turmes and Ms Thomsen, and all those involved, for having fought for this in the way that they did. Of course, we wanted more – they also wanted more – but again, there were a few countries that prevented us from taking a really big step forward with this.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, however, that, with your ongoing support as Denmark, the Member State, we will be able to bring about this energy switchover, that we will succeed in creating these thousands and even millions of jobs, for which there is a potential here. We are all asking where the work is and fearing that we are running out of jobs. No, we are not running out of jobs; especially if we concentrate on the energy switchover, if we aim to bring about the greening of the economy. This is about creating many, many jobs in Europe and, at the same time, reducing the dependence on imports of oil and gas. We have produced a very significant achievement here, and I hope that many countries which, at the moment, are still providing resistance will come to see that, in future, we will have to have truly mandatory provisions on energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Prime Minister, I would like to congratulate you on your choice of Mr Wammen as your Minister for Europe, as he really did an awful lot so that the Danish Presidency was able to succeed in many areas. I would like to thank you for that, Mr Wammen. You set a good example of how to act European but nonetheless represent the interests of your own country. If the Danish Presidency has many successes to list, that is down, above all, to you. Thank you for all your efforts.</p>

That has been the distinctive line of the past six months: the link between solidarity and solidity. I would therefore have liked you to have said a bit more about solidity, Prime Minister, and to have talked about how we can exert better, stricter control over the situation that we are in – the debt crisis in the Member States that has dragged our currency down with it.</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned the ‘two-pack’, and that indeed took place during your Presidency. In the case of the ‘two-pack’, we, as the European Parliament, called for a debt redemption pact. I believe we need to take a brave step forward if we want to be successful here. However, the Council’s decisions of last weekend leave a lot of questions unanswered. Mr Swoboda mentioned the growth pact. I know that it is something he is particularly concerned about. <span class="italic">Der Spiegel</span> called the whole thing a sham. A total of EUR 50-55 billion is supposed to come from the Structural Funds, but even Commissioner Hahn says he does not know how such figures are arrived at. I am not convinced that it is genuinely solid, that it will restore confidence among our citizens. Liability and control go together; that is the really crucial thing.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to liberate forces for growth, we want the European patent. However, and in this Mr Swoboda is absolutely right, what the Council has decided is completely absurd. A court that sits in three different places – London, Paris and Munich – is downright grotesque, and it shows that quite clearly the Member States are not capable of coming to sensible decisions on such an important, innovation-driving matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one question. A new system of banking supervision is now to be established on the basis of Article 127(6) of the Treaty. I thought we had a European Banking Authority. Are we now going to have a banking supervisory authority with two seats as well? Are we going to get two different banking supervisory authorities? Precisely what form does the Council imagine this is going to take? You will find it pretty difficult to explain the proliferation of seats of various organisations to this Parliament and get support for it.</p>
<p class="contents">In other respects, I would like to offer my sincere thanks for your committed Presidency. There are some other matters that you have progressed with real success. I have not mentioned Schengen, which was undoubtedly a sore point in your Presidency. However, the enlargement policy in respect of Serbia and Montenegro is undoubtedly one of the positive aspects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have done a lot, it is true, and we have done it with zeal, but now we must tell you what is blocked’. The problem that we have here is that you had a proposal, but we still do not understand why it has not been possible to conclude it.</p>
<p class="contents">You spoke about the directive on energy efficiency. It is possible to lie to oneself? There are two countries who have blocked this: Germany and Poland. We must therefore look at how we can unblock Europe because while we are deluding ourselves by saying: ‘You see, we have done a good job, etc.’, we know very well that the decisions that we take are not up to the required standard.</p>
<p class="contents">The energy directive is a good thing but we all know that it is insufficient. It is not your fault, it is the way that Europe functions that is being called into question. There was talk of the patent. Of course it is absurd, but the public must really understand this. The problem is not simply what we tell ourselves here; it also what the public can understand. When you have this contradiction with Mr Cameron, who gives lectures to everyone, and who, in fact, is preventing Europe from developing, the European public must understand, taking the example of patents, what it is all about.</p>
<p class="contents">We could give other examples, in particular Schengen, which is self-explanatory, since, in the end, if we restore the opening and closure of borders, it marks the end of the European Community approach. It is very simple. All the interior ministers are responsible in this sense. Let us call a spade a spade, so that at least the public may understand what is at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">You talk about the integration of Serbia and Montenegro. Yes! Yet once again we are forgetting Sarajevo. We always forget Bosnia. Today, the only country that does not have a European perspective is Bosnia, a country that has previously fallen victim to nationalism in the Balkans. It is not sufficient to give ourselves gold stars – no doubt deserved – on the subject of Bosnia when we are talking about Serbia, because as long as we fail to find a solution for Bosnia, I personally will continue to have a guilty conscience. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, I want to wish the Secretary-General of Parliament a very happy birthday. I am sure he is delighted to be having to spend his birthday listening to us drone on in this Chamber. Secondly, and much more importantly, I would like to thank the Danish Presidency, their officials and ministers and all those whom we have dealt with over the last six months.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, Prime Minister, as a Socialist while I myself am a Conservative, I am sure there are many issues on which we would disagree. However, I would like to pay tribute to the typical Danish efficiency and practicality which has been sorely needed in the EU over the last six months. In particular, your Presidency should be congratulated for burying the financial transaction tax as an EU-wide initiative. It would have damaged many of the EU’s financial centres, and many ordinary savers and investors as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Your administration should also be thanked for refusing to reopen negotiations on the Pregnant Workers Directive, which would have raised costs for businesses, reduced women’s choice and made it harder for many young women to find jobs. You should also be congratulated as a member of the EU net contributors club for pushing for budget restraint within the EU as well.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, when I look at many of the policy areas, it seems there are many lessons that you could teach the wider Socialist family about the responsibilities of power should you ever choose to come back to this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the row over the Schengen evaluation mechanism, I have to say you have my sympathy on this. After all, the decision to change the legal base was made unanimously by the Council – a Council which, as Mr Daul and others often remind us, is made up predominantly of leaders of the EPP. I think it is very unfair that the messenger should be shot over this incident.</p>
<p class="contents">That aside, I think the Danish Presidency’s overall relationship with Parliament has been extremely good and I would like to thank in particular your Europe Minister sitting behind you, Mr Wammen, for all the work that he has done. He sat there tirelessly day after day in this Chamber, having to listen to a lot of brickbats and criticisms. I think he has done it extremely well, extremely courteously, and I am sure he has a great future ahead in your government.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister, overall, your Presidency has been a good honest broker between the institutions and we come away with a positive assessment of Denmark’s time at the helm. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, it is time to take stock, and it has to be noted that, in the short term at least, this promise has not been fulfilled. In fact, the opposite is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">We received the latest unemployment figures yesterday. They represent a human disaster – never in the history of the euro have so many people been unemployed – and this disaster is also a result of the EU’s demands for austerity, which the Danish Presidency supported from day one. Take Ireland as an example: on account of the fiscal compact, the Irish people will be forced to make excessive savings over the next few years. We are talking about savings that are so huge they will be equivalent to Ireland cutting out two thirds of its entire education sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The growth and jobs pact that the Council adopted last Friday will not fix these sorts of consequences of the austerity policy. It is like putting a plaster on an open fracture. We currently have more than 25 million unemployed in the EU, and the Council adopts a jobs plan without any concrete objectives with regard to the amount by which unemployment is to be reduced. It is simply not good enough.</p>
<p class="contents">When I spoke at the start of the Danish Presidency, I said that the people did not need more austerity measures dictated by the EU, but rather they needed jobs in order to improve our shared prosperity, and I said that the Danish Presidency now had to demonstrate whether it was part of the solution or part of the problem. Unfortunately, we have to concede today that, in this regard, the Danish Presidency was not part of the solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No one has ever before sold off the family silver on such a grand scale only to then throw the whole lot away. You said ‘yes’ to the fiscal compact. You declared yourself to be ‘European at heart’. You abolished border controls. You maintained agricultural aid. For six months, you ingratiated yourself with the EU’s non-elected elite. Nevertheless, your government has been booed out of the European Parliament. The other day, you had to cancel the referendum on the Danish opt-outs, and yesterday you threw out European patents.</p>
<p class="contents">What I thought would be an historic love story has turned out to be nothing but a soap opera. ‘Europe at work’, that was your slogan. Not since 1997 has unemployment in the EU been as high as it is today. The euro is not merely the Titanic after the iceberg; it is the Titanic at the bottom of the ice-cold Atlantic. Now the people of Europe are drifting around in the cold water in the hope that you, who sunk their ship, will come and save them. You will not do that, however, because you are fumbling around in the dark.</p>
<p class="contents">You have held 20 summits to rescue the euro, but the only thing you have rescued is a disgraceful monument to yourself, and you have left an economy in ruins. Therefore, let me say this very clearly – so clearly that even you can understand it: shame on you.</p>
<p class="contents">I have heard many people express their astonishment at the visionless Danish Presidency. You did not even meet your French socialist friends half way when they wanted to kick-start the economy. However, I know what lies behind this, because in reality, this has definitely not been an ordinary, proper sort of Presidency. It has been the longest job interview in world history – one long preparation for your pending defeat as Prime Minister in Denmark. In two and half years’ time, a new Commission and a new President of the European Council will be elected here in the EU. I am willing to bet that you will be a candidate for both posts. This is not for the power, but so that you can come home to your friends here in the EU. So watch out Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy, watch out all of you sitting here ruling and governing without any popular mandate whatsoever. Here is a woman who will stop at nothing to get her way. That is something that the Danish people have experienced in great measure over the past six months. I therefore believe that I can safely say that I speak for the majority of Danes when I say: ‘Ms Thorning-Schmidt, please go home to the EU at last and let us have Denmark back’.</p>

Firstly, there is the question concerning a referendum. I am a keen supporter of referendums, as Mr Rohde well knows. We insisted on one in connection with the most recent amendment to the Treaty, while Mr Rohde’s party insisted on the opposite. We insisted on one in connection with the Fiscal Compact, while Mr Rohde’s party insisted on the opposite. Therefore, now that we have the facility under the Danish constitution, it is actually not so strange for us to insist on a referendum.</p>
<p class="contents">I will turn, now, to the actual matter at hand. Well, our basic concern is the one that has also been expressed by the Association of Danish Patent Agents, and that is a concern about the rules on forum shopping. If it is the case that small patent holders can be forced to defend their patents at any national court, and from that court they cannot directly bring the case before the central authority, we have a problem in that this will potentially benefit the large corporations and their ilk, in other words, those that Mr Rohde will be keen to look after, but not the small patent holders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For example, we have achieved an agreement on NSI efficiency. We also have an agreement on the Financial Regulation, which is another important matter. And that is exactly what Parliament wants: to achieve results.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as coordinator of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) for regional policy, I see too little progress in the process surrounding the multiannual financial framework. If we fail to achieve an agreement by early 2013, we simply will not be able to apply the new regulations and, in these times of crisis, we will have achieved nothing by 2014.</p>
<p class="contents">I do have to say, and I am addressing this to the Council, that we have actually made progress in terms of the regulation on the general provisions applicable to the Structural Funds. However, there is a flaw there. There are important elements that fall under colegislation with Parliament and that have been thrown into the mix and addressed there in connection with the MFF. I am talking about matters such as the categorisation of regions, which is the competence of Parliament, cohesion representatives, the position of the common strategic framework, the performance reserve, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Look at Article 312 of the Treaty of Lisbon, as well as Articles 174 and 177, and you will see a flaw there, an architectural error. Since this will be important in the negotiations over the coming period, I ask the Council today: do you want to resolve this situation or will the consequence of it be the entire MFF falling under colegislation? A large group of members put questions about this to the Council on 18 June. You are not observing the Treaty of Lisbon and we cannot allow that! With the mandate of the Committee on Regional Development, after the 11 July vote, we want to get down to work straightaway in order to discuss issues over which we have the final say.

Several countries have been on the verge of serious economic collapse. Unemployment is alarmingly high and growth is worryingly low. At such times, the EU needs to deliver concrete results. At such times, the Member States need to stand together to create prosperity and optimism. It goes without saying that this is no easy task, but it is an important one, and it is a task that the Danish Presidency has successfully fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">Does this mean that we have saved the world? Does it mean that the crisis is over and that Europe is now fully back on track? No, of course not, but it does mean that, over the last six months under Danish leadership, decisions have been taken that represent major steps in the right direction. Under the headings of ‘A responsible Europe’, ‘A dynamic Europe’, ‘A green Europe’ and ‘A safe Europe’, the Danish Presidency has delivered concrete results, political agreements and compromises which have direct significance for all European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">With over 20 million unemployed in the EU, with an explosion in youth unemployment and with numerous reasons for despondency, it is the many initiatives for growth that are particularly impressive, the most recent of which, of course, is the European growth pact. This is a pact that will create tens of thousands of jobs, a pact that will set the wheels in motion, but that will do this in a way that does not detract from our responsibility and the need for economic consolidation. With regard to other concrete results, the Energy Efficiency Directive springs to mind. This is legislation that is not only ambitious from an environmental point of view, and it most definitely is ambitious – in fact, it is the most ambitious legislation of this kind in the world – it is also legislation that will create a huge number of jobs – getting on for 2 million by 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen more than 250 concrete results – 250 decisions that are important for European citizens. This is something that the EU can be proud of and that we here in the European Parliament can be proud of, and it is something that the Council, headed by the Danish Presidency, can rightly be very proud of. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this regard, I would like to take the opportunity to convey this to our capable civil service, but also to the Prime Minister’s Minister for European Affairs, Nicolai Wammen, who has done a huge amount of work here in Parliament, which I believe is appreciated by everyone here in this House, irrespective of their political affiliations.</p>
<p class="contents">Not everything has been worthy of praise, however. There are also a few questions to be asked, as there are some things that surprise me. One of these is that, in her speech, the Prime Minister quoted Konrad Adenauer and said that she is ‘European at heart’. She also used part of her speech to talk about solidarity. It therefore surprises me that, in the Danish media during the last week, the Prime Minister has been quick to distance herself from a fiscal union, to say ‘no’ to Denmark being one of the countries that are to be responsible for the debts of other countries, which, in reality, we already are of course, and spent the week cancelling a referendum.</p>
<p class="contents">May I remind the Prime Minister of her own words in a speech she made not so long ago, when she asked: ‘What international organisation in the whole history of human kind has ever been able to do anything like what the EU has done in the past six months?’ These are grand words, it has to be said. They are extremely grand words. I am sure that we could mention some events that were perhaps grander than what has happened here. How, though, does this fit with the fact that you do not want a referendum in Denmark? If we have taken such major decisions in the EU, then it should result in a referendum and not the opposite, Prime Minister. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last time you were here in this Chamber, you said something that I thought was very thought-provoking. You said that you had a very great understanding for the millions of young people who are battling with unemployment right now and with a lack of future prospects, just like your own generation did during the 1980s. The problem of youth unemployment has not gone away since January, but the good news is that, in contrast to only six months ago, there is now a much greater focus on creating growth and jobs for Europe’s young people. Six months ago, the mantra was cuts; now the mantra includes investment, growth and jobs. Now we also have a European youth guarantee included in the conclusions of the recent European summit. The Danish Presidency cannot take all the credit for this, but it can take some of it. Many thanks for that.</p>

The European debt crisis meant that Europe’s leaders were using all their energy to discuss a fiscal pact and a fiscal union. There was talk of treaties, pacts and institutional changes instead of focusing on strengthening the internal market, eliminating subsidies that distort competition and quite simply boosting growth. The working conditions for the whole of the Presidency have been difficult, however.</p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly like to thank the Minister for European Affairs, Nicolai Wammen, who has been very visible here in Parliament, and who has worked very hard to involve Parliament in the Presidency’s activities. Thank you for that, Mr Wammen. I am particularly pleased that the Presidency put antibiotics resistance on the agenda, and I am pleased with the Council’s positive conclusions. Of the most important results achieved by the Presidency, I would like to highlight the agreement concerning improved safety in relation to hazardous chemicals.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also a few flies in the ointment, however. I am disappointed that the Council has decided to reduce the Commission’s proposals for a reform of the common fisheries policy. The Council has, in fact, decided that European fisheries do not need to be made sustainable. I am deeply disappointed that this has happened during the Danish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, however, I would like to thank the Danish Government for a well-executed and professional Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this respect, Denmark’s attempt to restrict the right of access to the files of the administrative and governmental apparatus in Brussels would undoubtedly have been a bitter setback to efforts to achieve greater transparency. Thankfully, it was given up at the eleventh hour.</p>
<p class="contents">Talking of renationalisation in connection with the reform of Schengen is, however, undoubtedly an exaggeration, because ultimately, it falls within the competence of the Member States, which, in the final event, have to answer to their citizens in this regard. We are therefore not talking about an anti-European decision by the Council Presidency; instead, in this case at least, the craze for centralisation emanating from Brussels has been halted for once. However, Turkey should never have been granted visa facilitation as a reward for failing to cooperate on combating illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to allowing the EU Member States to set their own financial policy, however, Copenhagen – which has always seen itself as building bridges between the euro and non-euro countries – has given in to the mania for centralisation and paved the way for a debt union. While the Danish Presidency was thereby more or less digging a debt trap for the net contributors, it was taking great care not to fall into it itself. That is probably why the referendum on closer ties between Denmark and the EU and the euro has been postponed.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, it has to be said that all the efforts of the Danish Presidency towards sustainability will come to naught in a European debt union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, I offer my congratulations on its excellent negotiating skills which helped, albeit in a somewhat convoluted manner, to end the vulgar and absurd diatribe concerning the location of the European patent court.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I agreed, with regret, to postpone the final vote following the Council’s unilateral proposal to amend the proposal for a regulation, but I must point out that this way of operating is unacceptable. It seriously undermines the constitutional balance of the EU, especially in an area and a measure that are fundamental to boosting economic growth in the European Union in key sectors such as innovation. This is a measure in which Parliament took a programmatic, constructive approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to express my deep bitterness over what happened and call on the Council of Ministers, represented by the Cypriot Presidency that has now taken over, to find a solution with regard to the substance and the procedure as soon as possible. It will not be Parliament that causes a project that we have been working towards for over 30 years to fail, nor shall this Parliament allow the rules governing interinstitutional relations to be unilaterally modified by any institution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Six months later, however, while acknowledging the progress made in terms of energy and in terms of the response to the crisis, the evaluation of the Presidency cannot be a satisfactory one because a shadow has been cast over it by the decision adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council to re-governmentalise the Schengen evaluation mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">This means not only ignoring the area of freedom, security and justice as a European policy in which Parliament is the ordinary legislator; it also means ignoring the fact that Parliament represents 500 million people as the sole body that is directly elected by them; it also means ignoring the fact that, as was stated at the informal Justice and Home Affairs Council in Copenhagen, solidarity, which is enshrined in Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, does not consist of re-establishing the internal borders of the European Union but rather of helping to establish joint management of its internal and external borders.</p>
<p class="contents">I will therefore conclude by saying two things. The first it that this has affected the entire asylum package and the entire Schengen package. The second thing, however, is that political union cannot be identified with banking union or with guaranteeing deposits, but rather with rescuing the people, free movement of people and solidarity within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will miss you; we will miss your efficient negotiation. You have really served the financial interests of the European Union well. Thank you very much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Six months is a short period to meet such expectations, but recent developments, such as the outcome of last week’s European summit, give us reason to believe that with the political will and the necessary unity, much can be achieved. I am referring here to the investment package and the financial transaction tax. The Danish Presidency put investment, growth and competitiveness as priorities, and I believe that package should help meet those objectives. I would like to thank the Danish Government, and especially Minister Wammen, for their hard work.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight the commitments that the Danish Presidency has made towards gender equality. Progress has been made on some of them, such as increasing women’s participation in boardrooms. I regret, however, that despite the efforts of the Presidency, no agreement could be found at Council level regarding the Maternity Leave Directive.</p>

There was just one thing lacking in my opinion, and I also pointed this out a few times during the course of the Presidency. There has been a debate in Europe over the last six months, particularly in Germany, concerning how we can move forward and how we can create legitimacy among our citizens. I think it is a pity that the Danish Presidency did not really want to enter into this discussion. I had hoped that it would take the opportunity to engage in this debate, too. However, I can hope that, looking to the future – and the Prime Minister will hopefully confirm this – you will perhaps work together with Parliament in order to move forward in this discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Denmark sought to advance the candidature of Turkey, a country that is not ancestrally, culturally or religiously European. It sought to facilitate legal immigration, claiming that Europe is somehow in need of yet more immigrants. In January, it promised that immigrants would be ensured smooth and non-bureaucratic access. They have certainly kept their word about that. It has paid lip service to a returns policy for illegal immigrants, but we know from Frontex that they are not detained long but are released and given an order to leave that is neither checked for compliance nor enforced.</p>

<p class="contents">I think that the summit last weekend was, quite honestly, a disaster. It was appalling to witness the sort of unprecedented information war that various Member States engaged in from their own point of view, and in which they spoke of their own objectives. The messages that came out of the summit were highly contradictory. The worst of it was – and this has been evident here with regard to the patent issue, for example – that, once again, new policy was laid down on what were often very technical and detailed questions in the dead of night.</p>

When people take decisions after staying awake so long like this, these sorts of problems arise. For that reason, and as you are such a creative person so full of ideas, Prime Minister, what does your experience tell you about how practices might be improved in the wake of this summit? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that progress on many files was very clear, and we in the Commission highly appreciate that.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the efforts, it is clear that further work is needed on energy efficiency, the European patent and Schengen. In all of these very important areas, we need more ambition, more Europe, and a clear respect for the Community method. I particularly appreciate the Danish Presidency’s efforts and results, and the method used in organising the discussions and negotiations on the multiannual financial framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister, your Presidency delivered a ‘negotiating box’ which is a good base on which we all can work to conclude negotiations by the end of 2012. You have been very clear on the importance of close cooperation with the European Parliament delegation. You continued regular meetings which, I am sure, will pave the way for good cooperation on this very important file and increase the chances that we will be able to conclude these very important talks by the end of 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to highlight that with the opening of accession talks with Montenegro, the granting of candidate status to Serbia and the progress in cooperation with other Western Balkan countries, your Presidency sent a very strong signal of solidarity and cooperation from the European Union to the Western Balkans and showed them the way forward in mutual cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I appreciate the personal involvement of Minister Wammen, and the highly professional performance of the permanent representative, Jeppe Tranholm-Mikkelsen, because they helped me achieve progress on the file which has been on our table for more than three years, namely, how to better manage the agencies in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We worked very hard with the European Parliament delegation under the leadership of Jutta Haug and I am absolutely convinced that our common approach on the principles will help us to avoid the situations we are facing now with the European patent. We will be able to manage the discussion on what we will need to establish as regards agencies in the future in a much better and well organised way.</p>

First of all, allow me to thank you for your kind words, particularly to our Minister for Europe, Nicolai Wammen. I think that it is a very good sign that at the end of a Presidency, you are all on first name terms with Nicolai and appreciate the hard work he has done.</p>
<p class="contents">I have listened very carefully to your remarks and noted that we share the fundamental commitment of getting Europe back on track, a commitment to restore growth and create new jobs for the too many unemployed. Our Presidency has tried to do just that at a very difficult time, not least thanks to the work done in this House. We have taken big steps in the right direction and now we need to make sure that we continue to deliver together and we will continue our efforts in the Council to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">No doubt, when European citizens look at us – if they are looking at this debate at all – what they expect from us is that we will pull through the crisis together, and create new growth and new jobs in Europe. As I see it, this requires full use of the Community method. What does this mean? Well sometimes it means that we have heated debates about lines of division. That is how it will always be and this is how it has also been during the Danish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not be scared by that because that is how it is when you make compromises. Sometimes we agree, sometimes we do not. But we always share a common goal of serving Europe and serving its citizens. Let me try to address some of the main topics which you have raised today.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of you have rightly pointed out that we still are in a dire economic crisis, and you are right. It has been the case, and will continue to be so for some time, that we act every day against a heavy backdrop of the economic crisis, with thousands and thousands unemployed in Europe. That is why I am so happy that many of you have shared my concern in pushing for the implementation of the Growth and Jobs Pact. This is important. Some thought this Growth and Jobs Pact was not enough, and perhaps you agree, but nevertheless this is a small light in the dark that will create some hope that we can create growth and jobs in Europe again.</p>
<p class="contents">We discussed this also at the European Council on Thursday and Friday and, as I said there, I have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending to the Council that we strengthen cooperation with the Parliament in doing this: strengthen cooperation in terms of creating growth and jobs and perhaps fast-track some of the decisions that we need to take.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, of course, important that at every step we take in the development of the Union, we respect the role of the European Parliament, and I have stated this very clearly in the European Council. I hope that we can all agree to urgently deliver on this Compact. European citizens have the right to expect that from us.</p>
<p class="contents">I would very much like to thank some of those who have mentioned the multiannual financial framework and I would warmly thank everyone who has participated in this House in these discussions. We have had a very close and constructive dialogue on the negotiations, and we have had that throughout the Presidency at all levels.</p>
<p class="contents">We have done our utmost to fully respect the powers granted to the European Parliament and we have put great emphasis from day one on hearing your views and bringing them to the floor of the Council. I dare say that on this dossier, we have had the closest cooperation between any Presidency and the European Parliament ever seen. We all know that the negotiations ahead of us will be very difficult, but I hope that the involvement of the European Parliament will continue in the same constructive atmosphere as it has started.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you have mentioned the Patent Regulation and, of course, I have taken good note of your remarks concerning the patent. Let me remind you that Europe has waited more than 30 years for a solution, and when you wait for 30 years, you know that a solution will require a compromise. I understand that the European Parliament will continue to discuss this in September and I hope that the European Parliament will live up to its responsibility and help reach a final agreement for the sake of creating growth and jobs in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Some have said: ‘This is not good enough; we want it differently’. I have no problem understanding that this is the position of the House, but again I would urge that we do not end up in a situation where we make the best the enemy of the good.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the things I was particularly pleased to hear about in our discussion today was the many mentions of the green agenda. All of you here know that it has not been easy to push the green agenda in a time of crisis, but I am proud of the results that we have achieved together in this area, particularly when we talk about energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also extend special thanks to the Commission, to Commission President Barroso, when it comes to continuously promoting a green economy. He did that very well in Rio, he has done that throughout these six months, and I know that he will continue to do so. Mr Barroso’s devotion and commitment is crucial and I thank the Commission for it.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is the best framework imaginable to overcome the challenges facing us today and tomorrow. The crisis we have right now, and the solutions we find, show that, even though we did not always agree, we did not give up on each other. We showed solidarity and we should continue to do so. Everyone here knows that Europe still faces a severe crisis, but the decisions that we take together will lead us step by step out of the crisis to a better future.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we will be judged on our capacity to cooperate and find compromises. Political leaders of today are judged by their results, not their intentions, and what European citizens expect from us is results. They expect solutions and we have tried to live up to that obligation over the last six months. We will continue to do that in the future so that Europe, after the past gloom and pessimism, can again see an area of growth, progress and optimism.

Under the Danish Presidency, the anti-grassroots regulations on ‘enhanced economic governance’ were pushed forward and became euro-unifying legislation and the ‘fiscal compact’ was signed, adopting measures to abolish collective agreements, cut wages and pensions and increase retirement ages in all the EU Member States. EU/US/NATO imperialist intervention was stepped up in Syria and Iran, in order to exploit the wealth-producing resources and people in the region. This was the work of the ‘leftist’ Danish Government.</p>
<p class="contents">The interests of the monopoly groups were promoted, together with capitalist restructurings and anti-labour measures throughout the EU, and the last vestiges of labour, insurance and social rights were demolished, causing poverty and misery to increase day by day. This is how ‘leftist governments’ and the ‘leftist’ management of capitalism serve the plutocracy: by satisfying the requirements and aspirations of the monopolies, in an environment of ‘social peace’, self-delusion and hope that prove to be resoundingly false, leaving the workers at the mercy of fatalism, compromise and subjugation to the union of capital, to be delivered bound hand and foot to the barbarity of capitalist exploitation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Looking at Copenhagen’s achievements today, we can congratulate Denmark on its successes in many areas, such as the EU budget, the multiannual financial framework for 2012-2020, climate policy and energy policy. Denmark deserves recognition, in particular, for its superb work on numerous legislative dossiers related to the digital agenda and intellectual property rights. As rapporteur responsible for the report on permitted uses of orphan works, I can only report positive experiences from our work together.</p>
<p class="contents">However, recent steps taken by the Danish Presidency concerning proposals to reform Schengen and the possibility of the Member States restoring border controls have provoked considerable controversy in Europe, in particular, the proposal to deprive Parliament of its current right to vote and participate in the legislative procedure concerned. This matter is going to be given further consideration by the next Presidency, but it has cast a shadow over current perception of the results of Denmark’s leadership of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, bearing in mind the fact that the Danish Presidency came at a politically difficult time in the EU in connection with the economic crisis and the financial problems of yet more Member States – now to be joined by Cyprus – the results of Copenhagen’s achievements would appear, on balance, to be positive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
