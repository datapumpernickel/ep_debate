<p>The French newspaper 'Le Monde' recently featured a report stating that Albanian 'white-slavers' had taken advantage of the war in Kosovo and the illegal immigration networks operating between Albania and Italy and were sexually exploiting some three hundred thousand women - mostly from Kosovo, but also from Moldavia, Romania and Bosnia - in France, Germany and Belgium. The women are forced into prostitution by threats and violence, and the Albanian pimps often pretend to be Kosovars in order to acquire refugee status. Will the Council say what measures it is taking and what policies it is promoting to combat this phenomenon, whether it has any data on the increased movement of women from Eastern European countries, what results have been achieved by various programmes and what is being done to promote the harmonisation of the penal legislation of the Member States and to coordinate efforts to combat the trade in women?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>1. On 1 January, the Council and the European Parliament adopted a Community action programme on preventive measures for combating violence against women, known as the Daphne programme 2000-2003. This programme, based on Article 152 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, is another measure to be added to the series of measures that the Council has adopted since 1996 to combat the sexual exploitation of and the trafficking in human beings. Most notably, the Council has extended its definition of the crime of ‘trafficking in human beings’ in the Europol Convention, to include the exploitation of prostitution, other forms of sexual exploitation and the production, sale and distribution of child pornography.</p>
<p>2. With regard to cooperation with third countries, I would draw the honourable Member’s attention to the 1950 United Nations Convention, designed to suppress trafficking in human beings and the exploitation of prostitution. I must also point out that the International Organisation for Migration, based in Geneva, is extremely active in the prevention of trafficking in women and of violence against women throughout the world, including Kosovo.</p>
<p>3. The Council is fully aware of the problems the honourable Member has raised and of the need to take account of the extremely vulnerable position of victims and witnesses. Progress has been made in the Member States in reviewing current legislation and practices and in classifying these forms of behaviour as crimes, punishable by sentences which are specific, proportionate and which will act as a deterrent. It is hoped that the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, which is due to be signed shortly, will be a factor in making further progress.</p>
<p>4. The future stabilisation of the situation in the Balkans will contribute towards resolving problems connected to trafficking in women, to their sexual exploitation and to their illegal immigration.</p>
<p>5. The Member States and the European Commission are playing an active role in the negotiations under way at the United Nations for a protocol on the prevention, suppression and punishment of trafficking in human beings, particularly of women and children, which will complement the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0290"></a>

<p>On 29 February, the Constitutional Court in Bulgaria declared a Macedonian-based political party, OMO 'Ilinden' – PIRIN – unconstitutional. This party was registered in 1999 and took part in the municipal elections in October last year, when it elected five local officials. This decision could lead to an effective ban of the party, deprivation of its juridical person status, confiscation of its property and the impossibility to take part in elections. This party has always declared that it would respect the constitutional and legal system of Bulgaria and carry out activities peacefully.</p>
<p>Is the Council of the opinion that this decision violates the right to freedom of association and constitutes a discrimination against a national minority? Has the Council asked for any explanation to the Bulgarian authorities? If not, is the Council going to intervene?</p>
<p>Does the Council consider that such a decision is compatible with the respect of the democratic criteria established in Copenhagen?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council has been informed of the decision of the Bulgarian Constitutional Court to declare the party OMO ‘Ilinden’, PIRIN, unconstitutional. The official translation of the text is not yet available, however. The Council further noted the decision by Mr Singartiiski, the chairman of the political party concerned, to appeal against the decision of the Constitutional Court before the European Court of Human Rights, which has specific jurisdiction in the matter.</p>
<p>At the present time, for its own part, the Council can only reiterate the need for candidate countries to comply with all the political and economic Copenhagen criteria for accession to the European Union, and repeat its intention to continually monitor the way in which candidate countries apply these criteria and to take appropriate action should it consider that the principles of democracy and respect for human rights and minority rights have been contravened.</p>
<p>In this context, it should also be pointed out that the Commission will take all the political events of the previous year into account when drawing up its next periodic report, which will be presented to the Council, on the progress which Bulgaria has made in the pre-accession process. </p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0296"></a>

<p>Article 42 of the Europol Convention provides that in so far as it is relevant for the performance of its tasks, Europol shall establish and maintain relations with third countries. The Council has adopted a number of legal instruments in which the rules applicable to these relations are laid down. Those instruments are:</p>
<p>a) the Council Act of 3 November 1998 laying down rules concerning the receipt by Europol of information from third parties;</p>
<p>b) the Council Act of 3 November 1999 laying down rules governing Europol's external relations with third States and non-European Union related bodies; and</p>
<p>c) the Council Act of 12 March 1999 adopting the rules governing the transmission of personal data by Europol to third countries and third bodies.</p>
<p>On the basis of these instruments the Council, at its meeting of 27 March 2000, authorised the Director of Europol to start negotiations in order to establish formal relations with a number of third countries and bodies.</p>

<p>I am glad to be able at last to give a very positive report to the honourable Member, who, as we all know, has followed developments in EU-Croatia relations very closely over the last few years. Let me just underline that the change of policy on the part of the Union towards Croatia has been triggered by the recent political change in Croatia following democratic elections, and the firm commitment of the new Croatian leadership to push ahead with political and economic reform, and to respect fully its international commitments. We think that Croatia can become a catalyst for the region, and the Union has already taken very concrete steps to show its support for the new approach in Zagreb.</p>
<p>Hence, following the positive outcome of the free and fair elections in early January 2000, the Council, on 26 January and 14 February, when the new Croatian Prime Minister, Mr Racan, met EU Ministers, decided:</p>
<p>1) to invite the Commission to prepare a study on the feasibility of opening negotiations with Croatia on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement;</p>
<p>2) to put in place rapidly a joint EU-Croatia Consultative Task Force which will provide Croatia with expertise and technical assistance in all areas of common interest;</p>
<p>3) to send the Ministerial Troika to Zagreb as a further sign of support for the new leadership - the Troika was in Zagreb on 29 March and came back with good news on plans for the reform of election laws, the media, the return of refugees and cooperation with the War Crimes Tribunal.</p>
<p>In conclusion, EU-Croatia relations are presently being substantially upgraded, which is what both sides want. If the Commission's study, which is expected to be presented to the June GAC is positive, the Council will ask the Commission to prepare a mandate for negotiating a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Croatia.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0319"></a>

Given the large numbers of people, in both rural and urban areas, who are living close to poverty, perhaps because their skills are no longer required, what specific measures would the Council envisage to facilitate the full integration of the socially excluded into the workforce and to allow them to participate fully in the advantages of a knowledge-based society?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As the honourable Member pointed out, Heads of State or Government meeting in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March 2000 undertook to combat social exclusion. In the presidency conclusions various specific measures were cited, and, in particular, the following objectives were set:</p>
<p>- a substantial annual increase in per capita investment and human resources;</p>
<p>- the number of 18-24 year-olds within lower-secondary level education who are not in further education and training should be halved by 2010;</p>
<p>- Internet access for all schools and training centres;</p>
<p>- a European framework should define the new basic skills to be provided through life-long learning: IT skills, foreign languages, technological culture, entrepreneurship and social skills;</p>
<p>- promoting digital literacy throughout the Union;</p>
<p>- defining the means for fostering the mobility of students, teachers and training and research staff;</p>
<p>- developing a common European format for curricula vitae.</p>
<p>With regard to fighting social exclusion, the European Council deemed ‘the number of people living below the poverty line and in social exclusion in the Union unacceptable’; for that reason, the Council provided for steps to be taken to make a decisive impact on the eradication of poverty by setting ‘adequate targets to be agreed by the Council by the end of the year’. The Council further observed that ‘the best safeguard against social exclusion is a job’, and highlighted the need to ‘improve skills, promote wider access to knowledge and opportunity and fight unemployment’. Finally, the European Council believed that ‘policies for combating social exclusion should be based on an open method of coordination combining national action plans and a Commission initiative for cooperation in this field to be presented by June 2000’.</p>
<p>In particular, the European Council invited the Council and the Commission to:</p>
<p>- promote a better understanding of social exclusion through continued dialogue and exchanges of information and best practice, on the basis of commonly agreed indicators; </p>
<p>- mainstream the promotion of inclusion in Member States’ employment, education and training, health and housing policies;</p>
<p>- develop priority actions addressed to specific target groups (for example, minority groups, children, the elderly and the disabled).</p>

<p>In May 1999, the Development Council adopted a resolution in which it confirmed its sustained interest in fulfilling the European Union’s commitments to make a contribution to combating the destabilising accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons, pointing out that a lack of control has fuelled interstate conflict and constituted an obstacle to peaceful economic and social development. Furthermore, the Council made several recommendations relating to development cooperation, such as the inclusion of the small arms issue in the political dialogue with the ACP and the need to reverse the ‘cultures of violence’.

<p>1. I can confirm to the honourable Member that the Council remains extremely concerned about the destabilising accumulation and proliferation of small arms and light weapons. As the future agreement with the ACP countries, on which negotiations have been completed, provides for enhanced dialogue with these countries, the issue of small arms and light weapons could be part of the political dialogue with the ACP. I can confirm that the Council intends to review the progress made in implementing the Development Council Resolution adopted on 21 May 1999, on the basis of the Commission's report on the issue of peace building and conflict prevention as soon as this report is available.</p>
<p>2. As the honourable Member is aware, the EU Code of Conduct on arms exports was adopted on 8 June 1998 with a view to setting high common standards to be regarded as the minimum for the management of, and restraint in, conventional arms transfers by all Member States, and strengthening the exchange of relevant information between them with a view to achieving greater transparency.</p>
<p>Control of the end-use of arms delivered is provided for in Criterion Seven of the Code. A number of points are set out which Member States are to consider when assessing the risk that exported goods might be diverted to an undesirable end-user.

<p>At the meeting of the parliamentary Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs of 21 March 2000, the Commission representative stated that the Commission would submit an amended proposal for a directive taking account of Parliament’s amendments.

<p>In replying to the honourable Member's question, I would like to recall that the European Reconstruction Agency was set up by Council Regulation No 2454/1999 of 15 November 1999, the so-called ‘OBNOVA’ Regulation dealing with EC assistance to South-Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Article 17 of the Regulation sets up a Governing Board, which consists of one representative from each Member State and two from the Commission. The Governing Board is chaired by the Commission and takes decisions by two-thirds majority. The President does not vote.</p>
<p>As far as the language arrangements for the Agency are concerned, these are, however, according to Article 17, decided unanimously by the Board.</p>
<p>The Governing Board, meeting once a month, held its first meeting just before Christmas. It has adopted its rules of procedures, but not yet the language arrangements for the Agency. The President of the Governing Board has, in the meantime, at the meetings of the Board, introduced preliminary ad hoc solutions to the Board as far as language arrangements are concerned.</p>
<p>It is obviously necessary for the Governing Board to find a permanent solution to the language arrangements. At the same time, let us not forget, that the Agency has only just started its operations. The Council is confident that the President of the Governing Board will conduct business in a responsible manner and that a language arrangement acceptable to all will soon be agreed, which will allow the Agency to carry out its important task in a quick and flexible way, bearing in mind the urgent reconstruction needs in the region.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0340"></a>

<p>For this reason, environmental protection has been identified as high priority in the Accession Partnerships with these countries.</p>

<p>In October 1998, the European Parliament urged all Member States to grant visa-free access to holders of HKSAR passports.</p>
<p>However, thus far, a European Union’s visa policy has been subject to partial harmonisation only. The current regulation (No 574/99 of 12 March 1999) restricts itself to establishing a list of those third countries whose nationals must hold a visa in order to cross the Member States’ external borders and to stipulating, pursuant to the provisions of its Article 2, that it is up to the Member States to decide whether nationals of third countries which do not appear on this list are subject to the visa obligation or not.</p>
<p>With regard to the holders of HKSAR passports, Council Regulation No 574/99 provides in a footnote to the aforementioned list that ‘in respect of China, this does not include the Hong-Kong Special Administrative Region. Article 2 applies: ‘Member States may decide whether to maintain their visa requirements in respect of such persons’. Under these circumstances, by excluding HKSAR passport holders from the common list, and taking account of the limits inherent in any partial harmonisation, the Council may be deemed to have followed up Parliament’s request.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on 26 January 2000, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Commission presented a proposal for a Council regulation on the basis of Article 62(2)(b)(i) of the EC Treaty, establishing the list of third countries whose nationals are subject to visa obligations before crossing external borders, and the list of those third countries whose nationals are exempt. Amongst the territorial bodies and authorities for whose nationals the Commission proposes visa exemption are both the Hong Kong and Macau Special Administrative Regions. This proposal is currently under discussion in Council, and the European Parliament was consulted by letter of 16 March 2000.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0348"></a>

<p>A debate is taking place in the USA on MTBE, a substance which is added to petrol and which has polluted groundwater, in particular in California. It is added to petrol everywhere and began to be used as an octane booster when lead-free petrol was introduced. Under Swedish rules, petrol may contain 15% MTBE, but on average it contains 2-3%. The problem with MTBE and closely related ETBE is that they take longer to break down in water than the corresponding alcohols, methanol and ethanol. MTBE and ETBE, like ethanol and methanol, have been proposed as low-level petrol additives as a first step towards introducing renewable fuels into our petrol tanks without the need to change engines.</p>
<p>Is the Council aware of the increasing use of MTBE and ETBE and their relatively little known impact on the environment? Does it intend to regulate the quantity of these substances permitted in petrol?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission takes the view that the funds required for this important task may not be found solely by rejigging the external aid figures. Nevertheless, the Commission will schedule a transfer of EUR 1.6 billion from other external aid packages so as to provide aid for South-Eastern Europe.

<p>The Commission has decided that the Internal Audit Service (IAS) should report to the Vice-President for Reform in order to enable the President to maintain his impartiality. This is entirely in line with footnote 98 of the Committee's Second Report which acknowledges that the President may wish to delegate his competence vis-à-vis the Internal Audit Service to a Vice-President.</p>
<p>In addition, the fact that the IAS will be set up under the authority of the Vice-President for Reform does not mean that its own level of independence will not be assured. As stated in action 68 of the White Paper ‘Reforming the Commission’, ‘the Head of IAS will need to have the same independence as is currently guaranteed by the Financial Reform to the Financial Controller, thereby enjoying autonomy in the conduct of internal audits, the maintenance of professional standards and the contents of reports’. The Head of IAS will be independent of other services and will have access to the President of the Commission and the College whenever necessary (action 69 of the White Paper).</p>
<p>The role of the Internal Audit Service will be primarily to review the internal control systems within the Commission. It represents a key element in the Commission's new framework for resource management and internal auditing and will have to meet the highest standards in terms of management, competence and capacity.</p>
<p>As stated in the White Paper ‘Reforming the Commission’, each Directorate-General (DG) will set up a specialised audit capability, reporting directly to the Director-General, to carry out reviews of the internal control system of the DG as well as reviews of the management and use of Commission funds paid to external beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Furthermore, an Audit Progress Committee will be set up, chaired by the member of the Commission in charge of the Budget Commissioner and further made up of the Vice-President for Reform, two other Commissioners and an external member. Its job will be to monitor</p>
<p>- the control processes of the Commission through the results of audits of the Internal Audit Service and the Court of Auditors,</p>

<p>The consistent policy of the Commission has been in favour of merit and against discrimination between candidates on account of their national origin. That policy will continue.</p>
<p>Article 27 of the Staff Regulations stipulates that ‘Recruitment shall be directed to securing for the Institution the services of officials of the highest standard of ability, efficiency and integrity, recruited on the broadest geographical basis from among nationals of Member States of the Communities’.</p>
<p>The Article also specifies that ‘no posts shall be reserved for nationals of any specific Member State’.</p>
<p>The Commission fully observes those provisions, not only because they have legal force but also because it considers that high ability is essential for officials and, in a multinational public administration, it is sensible and necessary to seek to sustain reasonable geographical balance between the national origins of its staff.</p>
<p>As outlined in action 26 of the Reform Strategy White Papers, the issues of sustaining necessary geographical balance and ensuring proven merit amongst candidates for recruitment will be addressed by wide publication of the notices announcing competitions, and by ensuring that recruitment tests take account of the multicultural character of the European Union. In this way, equal treatment of candidates from all Member States will be reinforced and merit will receive full and effective recognition.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0285"></a>

<p>The Commission is, of course, very pleased that all of the Members of the Scientific Committee for Food have agreed to make their annual declarations of interest publicly accessible.</p>
<p>The Commission takes this opportunity to clarify the procedures for Members of the Scientific Committees declaring any interests they may have. This system is in place since 1997. The Commission has not taken any new or recent decisions concerning public access to the annual declarations of the members of the scientific committees. The situation continues to be as explained in some detail in my response to written question <a href="/doceo/document/E-5-1999-2148_EN.html">E-2148/99</a> from the honourable Member, in December 1999. The situation is essentially as follows and applies to all of the nine scientific committees that fall within my competence:</p>
<p>Members are obliged by Article 6 of Commission Decision 97/759/EC:</p>
<p>to act independently of all external interests;</p>
<p>to inform the Commission each year of interests which may be considered prejudicial to their independence;</p>
<p>to declare any specific interest at each meeting.</p>
<p>When establishing their own internal rules of procedure, all nine of the Committees agreed that annual declarations could be made public with the agreement of the individual member. This is consistent with Parliament and Council Directive 95/46/EC of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data.</p>
<p>As to the specific questions raised by the honourable Member, the Commission would make the following observations:</p>
<p>The declarations themselves are provided on a standard form for each committee. The form requires Members to explicitly state that they either:</p>
<p>have no declarations to make concerning potential conflicts arising from direct or indirect interests,</p>
<p>or,</p>
<p>to declare any interests as appropriate.</p>
<p>It has not been considered necessary to request information on the level of commercial involvement or the size of any remuneration associated with such interests.</p>
<p>The Commission has taken the view that the requirement for independence and transparency in the workings of the scientific committees are served by knowledge of the existence of a potential conflict of interest, not by its size.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0292"></a>

<p>The Commission would like to thank the honourable Member for asking its intentions as regards the reduction and, in the long run, the prohibition of antibiotics in animal feed in the Community, as well as the timetable foreseen.</p>
<p>The Commission has indeed announced in its White Paper on Food Safety that it will pursue the prohibition or phasing-out of antibiotics used as growth promoters, as part of its broad policy to control and contain antibiotic resistance.</p>
<p>The Commission submitted to the Council in December 1998 a proposal for a Regulation suspending the use of four antibiotics in feedingstuffs. As a result of this, only four antibiotics remain authorised as additives in feedingstuffs.</p>
<p>On 28 May 1999, the Scientific Steering Committee of the Commission adopted an opinion on antimicrobial resistance and gave recommendations to contain antibiotic resistance, which the Commission intends to follow.</p>
<p>As regards antibiotic feed additives, it recommends that the use of agents even from classes which may be used in human or veterinary medicine should be phased out as soon as possible and ultimately abolished.</p>
<p>The Committee recommends that the phasing-out must be progressive, in order to allow changes in animal husbandry practices to be put in place.</p>
<p>As announced in the White Paper, in order to follow the Steering Committee recommendations, medium-term action is needed from the Commission.</p>
<p>The honourable Member will understand that a careful analysis of the implications for third countries, in particular in the context of the World Trade Organisation, Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement (WTO)-SPS, has to be done.</p>
<p>It is the intention of the Commission to adopt, by July 2001 at the latest, a proposal for amending Directive 70/524/EEC on additives in feedingstuffs.</p>
<p>Besides other modifications, a change in the policy of additives in feedingstuffs, like a general ban on antibiotics, could be introduced, with provisions allowing a smooth phasing-out.</p>
<p>The problem of antibiotic resistance and its control remains a very important priority for the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0311"></a>

<p>Thousands of sheep were ritually slaughtered outdoors in France at the Eid-el-Kabir festival on 16 March 2000.

<p>Many of the animals at this year's Eid-el-Kabir festival were roughly and cruelly treated prior to slaughter. Moreover, the slaughter process itself was often brutal, with untrained people sawing backwards and forwards across animals' throats, often with blunt knives. All this is in breach of Article 3 of Council Directive 93/119/EC.</p>

<p>The Commission is very aware of the complaints about the treatment of the animals during this event. The inadequate slaughterhouse capacities in certain urban areas of France is one of the reasons for the observations made with regard to treatment of animals during the festival.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the French authorities must find practical solutions for the problem concerning slaughterhouse capacity. Treatment of animals which causes suffering during restraint and slaughter is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Member States are responsible for the enforcement of Community legislation concerning the slaughter and killing of animals in accordance with the provisions of Council Directive 93/119/EC on the protection of animals at the time of slaughter or killing.</p>
<p>The Commission has been in contact with the French authorities concerning the need to improve arrangements. It had received, prior to the festival, reassurances that the French authorities were taking a wide range of measures including close contacts with the different Islamic cultural groups to involve them more widely in discussions on this issue in order to improve the situation with a view to achieving better animal welfare and hygiene conditions.</p>
<p>Now that the festival has passed it is awaiting a formal report from the French authorities, which it has already requested, before deciding on any further initiatives including the opening of Article 226 of the EC Treaty infringement proceedings.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission would refer the honourable Member to its answer already given to the earlier similar written question no 381/1999 by Mr Alavanos.</p>
<p>The Scientific Committee for Food expressed an opinion<a href="#defann_27_1" name="refann_27_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> in January 1999 on caffeine, taurine and glucuronolactone as constituents of so-called energy drinks.</p>
<p>The Committee concluded for caffeine ‘that the contribution of energy drinks to the total caffeine intake does not appear to be a matter of concern for adults. For children however, who do not normally consume much tea or coffee, and who might substitute ‘energy’ drinks for cola and other soft drinks, consumption of ‘energy’ drinks might represent an increase in daily caffeine exposure compared with their previous intake. Such intake could result in behavioural changes, such as increased arousal, irritability, nervousness or anxiety. For pregnant women the Committee advised moderation of intake from whatever source of caffeine’.</p>
<p>Given the above the Commission, following discussions on the matter with the Member States, intends to put forward proposals for labelling provisions regarding the caffeine content of products.</p>
<p>As regards the other constituents evaluated (taurine and glucuronolactone), the Scientific Committee for Food was unable to conclude that the safety in use of these substances in the concentrations contained in certain so called ‘energy drinks’ has been adequately established.</p>
<p>Further research is clearly required in this area. Research projects on the subject would be eligible to be submitted to Key Action 1 (Food, Nutrition and Health) of the Quality of Life of the Research and technological development (RTD) Programme.</p>
<p>The Commission can assure the honourable Member that it will give its strong support to any such projects if they meet the scientific quality and other criteria required by that programme.</p>

<p>Two measures were adopted together in 1992 concerning the export and marketing of infant formulae.

<p>Directive 92/52/EEC is exceptional in that it renders Community rules on composition and labelling of infant formulae applicable to products manufactured in the Community and exported to third countries unless, of course, the third countries require otherwise.</p>
<p>Resolution 92/C 172/01 states that although the Community cannot legislate for third countries it will contribute to the application of appropriate marketing practices for breast-milk substitutes in third countries by Community-based manufactures. For this reason, and as required by the resolution, the Commission has instructed its delegations in third countries to serve as contact points for the competent authorities of the third countries to notify any complaints with respect to the marketing practices in their territory by a manufacturer based in the Community.

<p>Under the third and fourth framework programmes for R&amp;D, the Commission has financed a number of projects to identify the effects of electromagnetic radiation (radiofrequencies – RF) on health. The first was a COST action (COST 244 in 1992, followed by COST 244b in 1998) on the biomedical effects of electromagnetic radiation. This action is still underway. The BIOMED 2 programme also provided funding for two studies on the links between electromagnetic radiation and cancer.</p>
<p>The ‘Measurement and Testing’ programme funded a project to measure the electromagnetic radiation emitted by mobile telephones and relay stations, as well as to quantify human exposure. The results of this project will be useful in establishing standards for the measurement and evaluation of risks from mobile telephones and relay stations.</p>
<p>The total budget the Commission allocated to these studies was in the order of EUR 2 million. None of these studies (covering thermal effects and possible cellular metabolic disturbance due to the various types of electromagnetic field) has produced results demonstrating adverse health effects, but research must continue in order to allay public concerns.</p>
<p>Research into the effects of electromagnetic radiation are conducted under the fifth framework programme, and more specifically under the work programme for Key Action 4 (Environment and Health) of thematic programme 1, (Quality of life and management of living resources). Following the call for research proposals in 1999, five proposals were adopted, with total funding of approximately EUR 9 million. These projects have just been started, and the results will be available in 3 to 4 years’ time.</p>
<p>These projects include a large-scale epidemiological study (Interphone), coordinated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), to investigate whether the electromagnetic radiation emitted by mobile telephones may be carcinogenic. This study will include a breakdown of results according to the emission levels of each type of mobile telephone. The other projects are aimed at improving our understanding of the biological mechanisms by which electromagnetic radiation may have an influence on human health.</p>
<p>The Council recommendation of 12 July 1999 – (1999/519/EC) limiting public exposure to electromagnetic fields from 0 Hz to 300 GHz, including radiofrequencies – advocates basic restrictions and reference levels making it possible to protect the public from the scientifically proven effects of non-ionising radiation. This recommendation is based on the scientific data submitted by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) to the Commission and confirmed by the Commission’s scientific steering committee.</p>
<p>At present, we do not have reliable information to prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship between the level of radiation emitted by mobile telephones and any possible health effects. In the absence of standards describing the methods of measurement, the Commission has drafted a mandate to the European Standardisation organisations asking for general measurement method standards, generic standards as well as product standards for certain types of products. The generic standards will contain limits for emissions of electromagnetic fields (EMF) from apparatus, based upon a ‘backward calculation’ from the exposure limits given in the Council Recommendation of 12 July 1999. In the absence of accredited standards, it would be premature to label telephones with radiation emission levels.</p>
<p>The text of the Council recommendation calls for it to be revised within a maximum period of 5 years. The Commission, which is monitoring the situation closely, shall, if necessary, make use of its right to make proposals prior to this date if the results of scientific research in progress under its auspices should show that there is any risk.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0256"></a>

Can the Commission provide information regarding current legislation on payment of ‘secret commissions’, both to public officials and to private-sector businessmen in the other Member States? Also, does the Commission receive regular, detailed information from the Belgian finance ministry on the amounts paid in ‘secret commissions’ by Belgian firms and, if applicable, from the finance ministries of other Member States regarding payments of the same type? Would the Commission inform the European Parliament of these?

<p>The Commission has no intention to raise the question of reciprocal refund of sales taxes to tourists with the United States.</p>
<p>In fact, the Community VAT legislation does not provide any government mechanism for refunding VAT to tourists leaving the Community. Such a tax relief only exists for exports by traders or producers ensuring in this way competitiveness of Community-products outside the Community (– depending on the value of the goods purchased – they may be subject to customs duties and consumption taxes in the country of arrival).</p>
<p>However, tourists resident outside the Community, including tourists resident in the United States, may – indirectly – benefit from that general VAT exemption available to traders as the trader is allowed also to exempt goods that are physically taken out of the Community by such a tourist. In that case, the tourist will have to send back to the trader a proof of exportation – a customs confirmation – so that the tax exemption can be justified to the fiscal authority. This legislative framework leaves it for the trader to decide whether he wants to make use of this facility and, in the affirmative, by which of the legally possible mechanisms. In conclusion, the relief is not designed as a specific right for a tourist.</p>
<p>To be on the safe side, many traders prefer that their customers pay VAT inclusive at the time of purchase. To make use of the export relief they then offer to their customer the possibility to obtain partial cash refund on the presentation of the relevant export documentation at a private VAT refund agency that is located in the airport of departure.</p>
<p>As the Community based trader is the beneficiary of the VAT exemption there is no policy reason to introduce at this level any sort of reciprocity approach comparing the tax relief available in the United States – or other countries – and the Community.</p>
<p>In addition, we should bear in mind the very diverse situation within the United States where the application of sales and use taxes currently falls within the competence of the states. Five States, for example, do not apply sales and use taxes; most states provide the possibility to exempt transactions where the goods will be transported to a destination outside the source state, although the conditions attached to this facility are usually more restrictive than those applied in the Community.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0261"></a>

<p>The Commission did note that Parliament, in its opinion of 17 February 2000 on the draft convention on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, expressed the opinion that Article 18 should be deleted. The Commission did also note that this was founded on the opinion that Article 18 could restrict intelligence operations while, at the same time, authorising investigative bodies to carry out interceptions in another Member State without the latter’s backing and authorisation.</p>
<p>However, the article has been carefully crafted in Council in very lengthy discussions in order to ensure that it would not regulate intelligence activities and that only criminal investigations would be covered. For the latter, the consent of the Member State where the target of the interception is located is necessary. Given this situation, it does not seem useful to the Commission to propose to the Council that the mutual legal assistance convention should be revised in this respect.</p>
<p>Given that unanimity is required in Council in order to pass legislation in the areas covered by Title VI of the Treaty on European Union, such as the mutual legal assistance convention, and that all Member States have agreed to Article 18, one can conclude that no Member State is opposed to this article.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0267"></a>

<p>The leaders of four political groups wrote to the Commission on 23 February 2000 asking it to examine whether it should prepare a statute for European political parties which would, among other things, define under which circumstances such parties could receive financial support at the Community level. The Guidelines for the 2001 budget adopted by Parliament on 30th March 2000 also call on the Commission to act.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member is aware, the Court of Justice in its judgement of 12 May 1998 United Kingdom C-106/96 <span class="sup">1</span> has held that expenditure may be made from the Community budget only if a clear legal basis allows it.</p>

<p>The Commission is of the opinion that Article 191 of the Treaty, in its present form, does not constitute a legal basis for financing European political parties.

<p>If the Morrazo Peninsula is located within a zone eligible under Objective 1, then any of the Structural Funds may be applicable. As this is a region highly dependent on fisheries, it is the FIFG (financial instrument for fisheries guidance) which particularly comes to mind.</p>
<p>The FIFG may, in particular, cofinance individual premiums for fishermen wishing to convert to activities other than fishing off the coast (Article 12.3.c of EC Regulation No 2792/1999) and also programmes for the conversion of fishing fleets which have suffered from the failure to renew the fisheries agreement (Article 16.1.b of the same regulation).</p>
<p>Among the Community initiatives adopted for the period 2000-2006, there are two, which may be applicable to the area, in question. These are the Interreg programme, targeting development of the European territory, and the Leader programme, targeting rural development.</p>
<p>The region of Galicia is, in any case, involved in the Interreg ‘Atlantic area’ programme under current programming. This programme has funded studies on the subject of fishing. The region of Galicia should also be involved in the schemes of the forthcoming Interreg 3B cooperation programme for 2000-2006.</p>
<p>If it proves eligible, the plan drawn up by the mayors of the Morrazo district may, in principle, belong to the category of actions cofinanced by the Structural Funds. To ensure that this is done, the local authorities are responsible for outlining practical projects which integrate and satisfy the guidelines and requirements of the Community support framework Objective 1, and must submit them to the State and/or region.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0273"></a>

<p>The Commission's decision to halt the Volvo-Scania merger has raised a great many questions. Why is Sweden regarded as the only relevant market for Swedish-manufactured lorries and not the EU's internal market as a whole? Why is the EU's internal market as a whole regarded as relevant in the case of alcohol sales but not in the case of lorries? How can a small country ever be the base for a big, internationally competitive company? What is the significance of the Commissioner responsible having been a member of the Board of Directors of Fiat, a company which announced on the same day as the Commission's decision was made public that it was interested in buying Volvo if the Volvo-Scania merger was halted? Has the Commission considered whether the Commissioner responsible has acted impartially in this matter?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>Sweden was one of several markets where the operation would have led to the creation of a dominant position.</p>
<p>The question concerning restrictions on the quantities of alcoholic drinks that travellers can bring into Sweden coming from other Member States without having to pay excise duties there is a matter relating to the free movement of goods and a fiscal matter. It is not related to the question as to what is the 'relevant market' for sales of alcohol. Travellers entering Sweden are allowed to bring along any alcoholic drinks for their own use but, as long as the derogation lasts (until the end of June 2000, but a request for an extension until the end of 2003 was made) they have to pay excise duties on the quantities exceeding certain limits.</p>
<p>The harmonisation of technical requirements (trucks and buses) has been largely (although not yet totally) achieved. This has resulted in significant economies of scale and scope being achieved in the production of vehicles to meet regulatory requirements. However, even though it is, of course, important to look at the supply side, the definition of a relevant geographic market under the competition rules takes the viewpoint of the customer.</p>
<p>The relevant geographic market comprises the area in which the undertakings concerned are involved in the supply and demand of products or services, in which the conditions of competition are sufficiently homogeneous and which can be distinguished from neighbouring areas because the conditions of competition are appreciably different in those area. In other words, the relevant market is the smallest area in which a monopolist could profitably increase prices by 5-10%, without losing sales to neighbouring areas. The question is therefore to what extent it is realistic that, for instance, a truck customer would consider buying a truck outside its country if prices there were raised by 5-10%. The investigation has shown that this is not very realistic, for reasons of pre-existing price differences, national technical requirements and, not least, the fact that the ability to provide first-class after-sales service is an integral part of any sale of a heavy truck.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the role of the Merger Regulation is to ascertain that dominant positions are not created through industrial consolidation. In the Volvo/Scania case, it was found that a dominant position would have been created in several national markets (not only in Sweden, as suggested by the question, but also in other Nordic countries and Ireland) for the supply of heavy trucks (not of Swedish built trucks, as suggested by the question). The operation would also have created a dominant position in some countries for the supply of coaches, city- and inter-city buses. Given the gravity of these competition concerns, and the fact that Volvo was unable to propose undertakings that would have removed all competition concerns, the Commission had no other choice but to prohibit the merger.</p>
<p>Both Volvo and Scania are, individually, large internationally competitive companies, and achieve more than 80% of their sales outside the Nordic region. Their success has, to a significant extent, been due to the competition between them. If their merger had not caused competition concerns, they could have obviously merged regardless of whether or not they are located in a small Member State.</p>
<p>Firms based in smaller countries and which have high market shares in their home markets, such as Volvo and Scania, are certainly not precluded from expanding through mergers. Any such merger must, however, be arranged so as to avoid competition concerns, such as those that arose in the case of Volvo/Scania.</p>
<p>During his academic career prior to his nomination as Commissioner in 1995, Mr Monti had been a member on the boards of several companies (including FIAT from 1988 to 1993), as indicated publicly upon joining the Commission. Positions held in the past obviously played no role whatsoever in this or other decisions. It should be added that the decision on Volvo/Scania, proposed by Mr Monti as the competent Commissioner, was adopted unanimously by the College (and had been endorsed unanimously by the Advisory Committee on Concentrations). The issues on which the decision is based are objectively verifiable.</p>
<p>As additional information, it may be noted that, since Mr Monti took office as Competition Commissioner, several decisions concerning FIAT have been taken, upon his proposal. On 28 October 1999, the merger between Fiat's subsidiary New Holland and a US company, Case Corporation, was approved only after the parties had committed to very substantial divestments of production facilities for agricultural machinery, combined with transfers of brand names and other intellectual property rights. With regard to State Aids, the Commission recently adopted three decisions concerning FIAT. Regional aids planned by Italy in favour of the Mirafiori Meccanica and Rivalta plants, near Torino, were prohibited because it was considered that the envisaged aids were not necessary in order to achieve regional development purposes. In total, the payment of EUR 40 million was prohibited. Furthermore, the Commission decided to open the formal inquiry procedure against regional aid for the Melfi plant in Basilicata. In this opening of procedure, strong doubts were expressed about compatibility of the aid. The Commission is thoroughly investigating the case.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0278"></a>

<p>According to the information available to the Commission, the National Park mentioned by the honourable Member includes the wetlands of the Nestos delta as well as Lakes Vistonis and Idmaris. The Greek authorities classified these areas as special protection areas (SPAs) under the ‘birds’ directive 79/409/EEC<a href="#defann_41_1" name="refann_41_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and also proposed them as sites of Community importance (SIC) under the ‘habitats’ directive 92/43/EEC<a href="#defann_41_2" name="refann_41_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, for inclusion in the NATURA 2000 network.</p>
<p>There is no 'Community priority action framework' for this park. However, under the 1994-1999 CSF ‘Environment’ operational programme (3.2 ‘Biotopes’), projects for the ‘management of the Nestos Delta biotope’ and ‘management of the Lake Vistonis biotope’ are currently underway, with budgets of Drs 216 million and Drs 255 million respectively. Among other things, these projects include preparing management plans, in the form of ‘specific environmental studies’, as required by Greek Law No 1650/86, and schemes to protect and enhance the biotopes. Moreover, the above-mentioned wetlands, along with other sites, have received attention under schemes cofinanced by LIFE Nature, intended for the conservation of specific wild bird species.</p>
<p>There are at present 52 sites classified by Greece as SPAs under directive 79/409/EEC, which will form part of the NATURA 2000 network, in accordance with Article 3.1 of directive 92/43/EEC. A complete list of these sites is available on the Commission’s Internet website at the following address: http://europa.eu.int/comm/environment/nature/home.htm</p>
<p>As regards the SICs which have been proposed under Directive 92/43/EEC, these are the exclusive responsibility of the national authority, as the Community list of sites, required under Article 4.2 of the directive, has not yet been drawn up. The honourable Member is therefore requested to approach the relevant Greek authorities (Ministry of the Environment) in order to obtain the list of these sites proposed for the NATURA 2000 network.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission takes a great interest in matters of safety, including fire safety. The Commission is aware that effective fire safety requires that national or local authorities take measures targeting the whole range of factors likely to influence the development of fires, such as building regulations, requirements for fire reaction and resistance, evacuation conditions, the availability of fire protection equipment (sprinklers) and public information. A consistent policy can therefore only be implemented at an appropriate national level.</p>
<p>Criteria for flammable furniture are only one aspect of fire safety. As far as these products are concerned, in the absence of Community-wide harmonisation, it is the responsibility of the Member States to ensure the health protection and safety of property and of human beings on the basis of the national regulations adopted to this end. Moreover, with reference to the terms of the EC Treaty (Articles 28 to 30), the principle of the mutual recognition of products, tests and certificates makes it possible to avoid any unjustified obstacles to trade.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the CEN (European Standardisation Body) has developed methods for testing the flammability of furniture. We must be able to use these standards as a reference in the above-mentioned mutual recognition procedures. Finally, in its proposed amendment to the directive on general product safety, of 29 March 2000 (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2000&amp;nu_doc=0139">COM(2000)139</a>), the Commission proposed introducing the concept of the ‘presumption of conformity’ in order to ensure a consistently high level of consumer protection. So products which comply with the European standards issued by the European standardisation institutes authorised by the Commission shall be deemed to comply with the safety criteria required by the directive.</p>
<p>Taking into account the new provisions in the text of the proposed amendment of the directive on general product safety, the Commission intends to check whether it is necessary to produce new standards or to amend the existing standards, in various sectors of interest to consumer safety. The various aspects related to fire safety will also be considered. If it is shown that the subject raised by the honourable Member warrants a mandate, and if there is sufficient agreement on the subject among the interested parties, the Commission may consider proceeding to draw up a mandate of this type.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0305"></a>

<p>The question of the honourable Member refers to the work of the British Government’s Genetics and Insurance Committee, concerning the use of genetic test results for insurance purposes. This work is expected to be finalised by the end of this month. Additional time will be needed in order to enable the Commission to assess the impact of the use of any relevant genetic information on Community provisions in this field. In view of fact that no final decision has yet been made, only the following preliminary remarks can be made.</p>
<p>The main question concerns the consequences of an eventual general application to all Member States and the compatibility with single market rules with regard to insurance and data protection.</p>
<p>Concerning the application to other Member States, the Commission is not aware of the work of groups like this in other Member States.</p>
<p>In the current state of Community insurance law, there is no specific provision regarding the use of genetic data for insurance purposes. This is a question for Member States to decide whether or not they authorise their use, taking into account the ‘general good’ requirements.</p>
<p>However, Article 8 of Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data requires consent of the data subject for the processing of genetic data concerning health unless a specific exception applies.</p>
<p>The matter needs to be further examined before launching any action in this regard.</p>

<p>Concerning the 13 Iranian Jews and 8 Muslim detainees on charges of espionage, a number of demarches have been made by the Union as well as by individual Member States in the last year.

<p>The Union remains actively seized of the matter and consultations with Member States continue in order to find the best means to ensure a fair trial, with the presence of international observers at the trial.</p>

<p>The basic principle underlying the measures taken under Council Regulation (EC) No 1256/1999<a href="#defann_49_2" name="refann_49_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> referred to by the honourable Member is to ensure as far as possible that the milk quotas benefit active producers. It has frequently been established in several Member States that, over the years, a significant proportion of those quotas have come into the possession of non­producers who then lease them out every year. That results in a degree of speculation which makes it even more difficult for young farmers to gain access to milk production or jeopardises the profitability of their farms. That conclusion is supported by the corroborative findings of a large number of studies.</p>
<p>The new scheme merely constitutes a strengthening of measures previously put into effect. In particular, it enables the Member States to recover gradually and to return to the national reserve, for subsequent reallocation, quotas which their non-active holders have not assigned definitively, in accordance with the national rules currently in force and within a deadline and a percentage still to be laid down.</p>
<p>The measure corresponds not only with the objectives which the rules governing quotas have sought to attain ever since they were laid down but also with the wishes of most of the Member States. It is they who are responsible for its implementation. The scheme should be implemented, both in terms of its general principles and of the specific arrangements for it, in conformity with the general principles of Community law, balanced account being taken of the legitimate interests of producers who are still farming and those who are giving up farming.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Norwegian-Russian environmental movement, Bellona, has obtained information according to which the Russian Ministry for nuclear power (Minatom) is planning to take in nuclear fuel, primarily from the east European countries. Russia can offer lower prices for storage and recycling than Sellafield in the UK and Le Hague in France, for example. The Russians then hope to be able to attract countries such as Germany, Spain, Japan and Switzerland also.</p>
<p>According to Bellona, the plan has already been approved by six federal ministries and the government environment committee in Russia. The proposal must still be approved by the Duma since current legislation prohibits all imports of radioactive material.</p>
<p>Part of the plan is to expand the existing plants at Zelenogorsk and Mayak in Siberia, which have already been accused of discharging large quantities of liquid radioactive waste in the southern Urals. According to the plans, Russia will not require suppliers of the spent nuclear fuel to take back the treated fuel. Siberia would thus become a nuclear waste dump.</p>

<p>The Commission attaches the utmost importance to the inclusiveness of the Information Society.</p>
<p>The current legal scope of universal service includes the possibility of Internet access in terms of dial-up access over the telephone line. At the moment, this is the most common access method for individuals and households. In addition to the cost of the telephone call, this involves using an Internet Service Provider (in most Member States free Services are offered).</p>
<p>This guarantee is in all regions as universal service covers the whole of the national territory. In most Member States (all except Finland) the telephone tariffs are common within a country.</p>
<p>Prices for using the Internet are continuing to decrease, irrespective of the type of user group and geographic location, due to liberalisation of telecommunications markets. Although there may be more choice of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in urban and denser populated areas, the bigger operators and Internet Service Providers offer nationwide service. Fierce competition in urban areas puts pressure on incumbent operators and leads to lower prices nationwide.</p>
<p>In January 2000, the Commission launched a public consultation (based on <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=99&amp;nu_doc=0539">COM (99) 539</a>) on all aspects of telecommunications regulations including universal service. The consultation has revealed that there is a broad support for the Commission’s proposal not to extend for the moment the current scope of universal service to broadband Internet access. This extension would, at the present point of market development, risk constituting a cross-subsidy from ordinary telephone users to the early adopters of broadband technologies, who usually tend to be wealthier.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to monitor and review this scope of universal service so that the concept keeps pace with market and technological developments. The Commission intends to include a specific review clause in the new legal framework.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0321"></a>

<p>Senator SERRI was appointed the Union Presidency Special Representative in January 2000 to assist the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in its efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement of the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea. All parties involved have expressed their satisfaction with this appointment. In this respect it has to be mentioned that Senator SERRI has an intimate knowledge of the Horn of Africa and its problems. Senator SERRI has, since his appointment, been in close and constant contact with the Algerian Presidency of the OAU in order to contribute to the success of the mediation initiative. The OAU has expressed its strong appreciation for the Union decision to support the peace process as this will allow, amongst others, to put together information, perceptions and evaluations of the underlying reasons behind the conflict as well as developing scenarios for a peaceful solution of the conflict. In his capacity as the Union Presidency Special Representative, Senator SERRI carried out his first mission to Asmara and Addis in February 2000. He met with the President of Eritrea, Mr Isaias Afewerki, and the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister of Ethiopia, Messrs Meles Zenawi and Seyoum Mesfin. They all expressed their appreciation for the European contribution through the special representative. In the meantime, the permanent contact between Mr SERRI and the OAU Presidency has continued unabated.</p>
<p>Mr SERRI embodies not only the Union support to the peace process led by the OAU, he is also providing both the Member States and the Commission with very valuable up to date information on the peace process and its constraints. This allows the Union to better appreciate the underlying issues of the conflict as well as enabling the Union to better assist in resolving the conflict.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0331"></a>

<p>Tourism is a complex sector inter-related to many other sectorial policies, such as those on transportation, regional policy, regional planning, etc.</p>
<p>The application of the principle of integration is therefore a relatively complex matter, insofar as it affects many sectors and addresses several independent policies. In other terms, it is not simply a matter of promoting the integration of environmental considerations in one sector of activity but also of including a number of other sectors in order to ensure that their actions are consistent and well coordinated.</p>
<p>The way in which current regulations for Community policies relating to tourism (water, noise, waste, etc.) are implemented must enhance this integration.</p>
<p>The Commission’s current projects particularly target:</p>
<p>- the promotion of environmental protection and sustainable development in tourism, including the application of good practice, closer cooperation with Member States and improved consultation with experts from the tourist sector;</p>
<p>- the development of guidelines for good practice in tourism in protected natural sites, particularly NATURA 2000 sites;</p>
<p>- the extension of the Eco-label to tourist services;</p>
<p>- support for operator information and awareness campaigns in order to promote environmentally friendly tourism.</p>
<p>In the context of the follow up to the Council conclusions of 21 June 1999 ‘Tourism and Employment’, one of the working parties set up jointly by the Commission and the Member States is particularly concerned with sustainable development in tourism. The initial results of their considerations are expected in autumn 2000.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0335"></a>

<p>A debate is taking place in the USA on MTBE, a substance which is added to petrol and which has polluted groundwater, in particular in California. It is added to petrol everywhere and began to be used as an octane booster when lead-free petrol was introduced. Under Swedish rules, petrol may contain 15% MTBE, but on average it contains 2-3%. The problem with MTBE and closely related ETBE is that they take longer to break down in water than the corresponding alcohols, methanol and ethanol. MTBE and ETBE, like ethanol and methanol, have been proposed as low-level petrol additives as a first step towards introducing renewable fuels into our petrol tanks without the need to change engines.</p>

<p>The Commission is well aware of the political and public concern about the contamination of water supplies in the United States and recent statements by the US EPA and will keep abreast of developments.</p>
<p>MTBE is on the Third Priority List, published in 1997, of priority substances for assessment, as foreseen under Council Regulation 793/93 on the evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances<a href="#defann_65_1" name="refann_65_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span> (Commission Regulation (EC) 143/97)<a href="#defann_65_2" name="refann_65_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup">2</span>. Finland is the Member State ‘Rapporteur’ responsible for the assessment of the substance, but all Member States are represented in the competent Group of Experts which discusses and finalises the risk assessment report for MTBE. The Community risk assessment will address the possible environmental and human health concerns in the Community, taking into account the US findings. When the risk assessment report is finalised, it will be presented to the Scientific Committee for Toxicity, Eco-toxicity and the Environment for independent peer-review. Risk reduction measures will be recommended in those areas where concerns have been indicated and legislative measures taken, if appropriate.</p>
<p>In August 1999, the Commission asked Member States for information on whether they have encountered any problems with (water) pollution due to MTBE. Once such information is available from a number of Member States, the Commission will provide complementary information to the MEP.</p>
<p>MTBE is a blending component (oxygenate) used in petrol to varying degrees by the Member States. In this context, it should be pointed out that there is a fundamental difference between American and Community legislation. EU Directive 98/70 relating to the quality of petrol and diesel<a href="#defann_65_3" name="refann_65_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 3</span> allows a maximum oxygen content in petrol of 2.7% by volume (which equates to a maximum MTBE content of 15%), whilst not setting a minimum content. The American legislation, on the other hand, requires a minimum oxygen content of 2% - which equates to a minimum MTBE content of 11% - in certain geographic areas. This minimum oxygen content has given rise to a much higher MTBE percentage in petrol in some parts of the United States, as in California, than is generally the case in the Community.</p>
<p>MTBE is the most commonly used ether. By contrast, ETBE has found limited use.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
