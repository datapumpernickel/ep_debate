<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pack (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just had a chance to speak with some young lawyers from Serbia, who gave us an impressive account of the hopeless situation in their country. So I am glad to come back to today’s subject, the complete lack of press freedom and access to information there.<span class="bold"> </span>The population only gets information from the subjective viewpoint of Mr Milosevic and his wife Mrs Markovic. Anyone who sees the facts as they are is treated as a traitor to the Serbian people and a NATO lackey. One of the young Serbian women told me that it is extraordinarily difficult for her to explain to her grandmother why she opposes Milosevic, as her grandmother only has her own information and experiences to go by. This means that she cannot understand why this young woman is involved in the OTPOR organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">We must help the independent democratic media in Serbia so that they can provide accurate information as far as possible, and so that democracy may yet blossom in Serbia. I would also like to say, however, that we naturally expect the “opposition press”, or what remains of it, to denounce the current irregularities in political leadership in the city of Belgrade, for example, which is governed by the MRS, just as much as it justifiably criticises the Milosevic regime. As long as it does not do this and is blind to other shortcomings, it is not an independent medium. I would also like to draw honourable Members’ attention to the following point: given that we are now hearing suggestions that Mr Draskovic is once again on the way to collaborating with Mr Milosevic, we have to be very careful about who we give help to.</p>
<p class="contents">OTPOR, the real resistance group in Serbia, which grew out of the student movement, is as at present being prevented by Milosevic from registering as an organisation. Nevertheless, this will not stop it organising demonstrations and displays of good will on the streets of Belgrade and elsewhere in Serbia. Next weekend, our delegation will be travelling to Montenegro, and on Sunday will be holding talks with representatives of OTPOR and of the opposition. We will, of course, take this opportunity to sound out what scope there is for supporting them.</p>
<p class="contents">A contributory factor to the lack of freedom in that country is the Serbian University Law promulgated in October 1998, since when many professors have been removed from their posts. They are forbidden to give lectures and they have been removed from their posts because of allegedly inadequate qualifications. It is evident what is going on if I tell you that one of these allegedly unqualified professors is now a professor at the Universities of Saarbrücken and Berlin. I find it hard to imagine that these universities would employ unqualified Serbian professors. But, of course, they did not fit in with Milosevic’s doctrines.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I have to tell you – because we here do not get to know everything that you can only find out by talking with people on the spot – that the extremist nationalist politician Selesj is currently a university professor in the law faculty. You can imagine how they rate quality there!</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s debate is, of course, first and foremost concerned with conditions in Serbian prisons. There are over 2 000 Kosovo Albanians held in Serbian prisons, most of them since spring 1999, that is before the NATO offensive. The situation in these prisons is indescribable. The people have received no legal representation. If they are then sentenced, this happens with total disregard for the law. Let me remind you about Flora Brovina, the doctor who did nothing more than respect her professional ethics as a doctor, by helping people regardless of their nationality. She was sentenced to 14 years in prison in Serbia, in Niš. The prisons are certainly not in line with any convention, and contravene the Geneva Convention. There is horrifying torture and abuse, and the world is simply looking on.</p>
<p class="contents">A fortnight ago, I visited Kosovo with 12 colleagues, and that was when Kosovo Albanians gave us these 75 000 signatures. We have brought them here because we want to demonstrate the enormity and the awfulness of the situation of people who have been trying to find out for at least one and a half years where their relatives are – their fathers, their brothers or even their children. I do not think that we can simply file these 75 000 signatures away. We must attempt to at least give these people some certainty about where these missing persons are, what prisons they are in or where they met their death.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the picture in Serbia. In Kosovo, which we also visited, although the situation is different, there are similar problems. We went to Kosovo last year because we wanted to help the Kosovo Albanians who for ten years have suffered under an apartheid-like regime to obtain attention. The aim we are working towards now in Kosovo is to achieve peaceful coexistence between the majority Albanian population and minorities who are also entitled to live there, be they Serbs, Ashkali or Roma. I believe that we should focus our attention on ensuring that coexistence is possible there.</p>
<p class="contents">There were many incidents during the last few days of our visit there, and these are occurring again now. There have been murders of Serbs over the last few days. Nobody can say who committed them, but someone is responsible for the fact that a Serb – or even several Serbs – is murdered somewhere every day. We condemn these acts, indeed we condemned them on the spot, and have done so here on several occasions. We call on everyone in positions of responsibility, and now above all Kosovo Albanians, to ensure that when the occasion arises their compatriots behave in a restrained manner and prevent this sort of conduct against minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We did not come to the aid of the Kosovo Albanians so that they could make the life of minorities in Kosovo hell. It also has to be said, because we do not know who the culprits are, that it cannot, of course, be ruled out some of the people responsible for these acts are possibly being infiltrated into Kosovo from Serbia as <span class="italic">agents provocateurs</span>, because they simply do not want peace in Kosovo. </p>
<p class="contents">All of us in the European Union, and also UNMIK, must take swift action in that region now. UNMIK must ensure that there is a legal framework, so that the culprits can be caught, put behind bars and punished. But in Kosovo there is also the problem of missing Serbs, which we are all familiar with. We call on the Kosovo Albanians to speak now and to inform the Red Cross if they know anything about the whereabouts of these Serbs and people of other nationalities, so as to put an end to this uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">The few Serbs in Kosovo who want to work with the administration of course also have a problem. They are viewed as traitors by some of their own compatriots. That being the case, we must help these well intentioned Serbs to achieve some positive results, so that their cooperation is clearly of some benefit for the Serbian population. We must try to ensure greater police protection. That is why I appeal to all the Member States to send as many police officers as possible to Kosovo, in order to guarantee protection for minorities also.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schroedter (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, freedom of the media lies at the heart of democracy. If the opposition has no opportunity to express its opinion, if a public debate about society is no longer possible, then you are looking at total dictatorship. And I know just how painful that is from personal experience. I also know how hard it is to act as opposition in this situation, and not to despair or give up. The transformation of society for which we are looking to the opposition there is virtually impossible under these circumstances. That much should be clear to us. It is virtually impossible because people stand a good chance of ending up in prison if they act in the interests of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">And it will be extremely difficult to intervene from outside, because the human right of freedom of expression is simply declared illegal. Therefore – and I am addressing this comment to the Commission in particular – we need all our imagination, flexibility and creativity to development instruments which will nevertheless enable us to support the opposition in this situation. It is not impossible to transform society even in these circumstances, as we saw 11 years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what we have to concentrate on. We should not always let bureaucratic obstacles get in the way. We really must find out what can be done under European mechanisms. And the answer is that they allow more to be done than has been evident up to now. It is also important to give these signals, because otherwise the opposition feels isolated and loses all its drive. If that happened things would be much, much more difficult and would take much longer.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Pack has made it plain that the situation in the prisons is appalling and that for the inmates every day is one day too many. I therefore call on the Commission to take every opportunity, in all its talks with representatives of the Serbian Government or embassies, to present the list of prisoners and to request information on each prisoner. We are talking about human beings, and it is a humanitarian act to press for these people to be released and united with their families one day.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to call on the Commission to offer indirect financial support to those organisations which are trying to draw up lists, to organise prison visits and to care for the families. It is enormously important to provide this humanitarian support, and this will also strengthen the democratic forces in Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Kosovo, after one year that region has still not reached the position we would have liked to see. It is a great disappointment for me that there is such great hatred that it is not possible for Serbs, Roma and other minorities to live in peace in Kosovo although they are under an international protectorate. It is humiliating that we have not succeeded in promoting tolerance or at least cohabitation in this area. For the sake of the credibility of the international community it is therefore a matter of urgency for us to protect the minorities and give them genuine opportunities for living and working there. And this is also important for me because I believe that otherwise everything that happened a year ago will lose credibility. It is therefore vital for us to do more in this area and to endeavour to make it clear in the public arena that it is unacceptable for people belonging to a different race to be driven out of Kosovo. The Serbs, Roma and other minorities have a right to live there! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall not repeat them, as our president, Doris Pack, has explained them better than we could. I would just like to highlight the issue of Kosovar prisoners, as did Mrs Schroedter. This is a fundamental problem and we must persevere in our actions, even if we know that we do not have many weapons to influence the Belgrade regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, there is also all the repression in Serbia. But for the first time, I will admit that I cherish a certain optimism, given the way the Belgrade regime is developing, that it will collapse in the near future. In particular, I am thinking of the student movement, the virtually underground OTPOR movement, and on this subject, I think that the relentlessness with which it is suppressed and monitored by Milosevic’s henchmen is a good indicator of its power.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I think it is time for the European Parliament and also the Commission and the Council to engage in a debate – and I know that the president of our delegation does not entirely share this point of view – on the future status of Kosovo, the future status of Bosnia, and therefore also, directly, that of Serbia. The uncertainty surrounding the definitive status of Kosovo today is a source of instability, an incentive to extremists of all types, an obstacle to development, because this situation certainly does not encourage foreign investment.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another fact that merits our attention: the presence, in a country with less than two million inhabitants, of over fifty thousand westerners with a standard of living 10, 15, 20 times higher than that of the Kosovars, cannot but present many problems in terms of discrimination and inequality, and is not without secondary effects that are not always as secondary as all that, and are in fact very serious and often very problematic, or even truly adverse. Having said that, I am not questioning the role of the KFOR, the role of the United Nations in Kosovo, at all, but we cannot consider and plan an “occupation” of Kosovo for many years without running serious risks.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore unreservedly confront the issue of the final status of what was formerly Yugoslavia. Six years after the signature of the Dayton agreements in 1995, with a Bosnia that is still not a country where things run smoothly, with a Bosnia comprising two or even three entities, we must urgently put an end to all these problems and the Commission and the Council must urgently propose ways of overcoming these situations which were designed to be interim situations. We must propose ways out of the situation in order to create a conditions which might form a basis for imagining the integration of these countries into the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I do not think we can avoid the idea of a federation between Kosovo and Albania, nor can we avoid associations between certain parts of Bosnia and Serbia. This is the result of a policy which we, the radicals, definitely did not want, but which the international community wanted, and to which we can no longer turn a blind eye. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was successful and a victory for justice and human rights. I was there before the war began. At that time, the Serbs had already driven 200 000 to 300 000 people from their homes and had ravaged and laid waste whole areas of the country. And I was there again a couple of weeks ago and can testify to the enormous change for the better which has occurred thanks to NATO’s intervention. I can also testify to the incredibly efficient work being done by KFOR, the UN mission (UNMIK) and the UNMIK police. I can, unfortunately, also testify to what the debate here ought especially to be about, namely the fact that it is now the Serbs who are being persecuted by people who act with spite towards them, throw stones at them, burn their houses down and attempt to drive them from their homes. Now, it is the Serbs who need our attention. The police are doing everything possible, but nothing like the promised number of police has arrived. The EU countries, in particular, have gone back on their promise. Only one fifth of the police force comes from EU countries. That is partly why the former liberation organisation, the KLA is all too easily able to engage in anti-Serbian and criminal activities, which presumably also include murder, arson and attempts to drive people from their homes. So, what is now needed may be expressed as succinctly as a year ago: the objective is to get the KLA out, the police in and the Serbs home to those places in which they have always lived in Kosovo. The KLA must be disarmed and stripped of any monopoly position in the coming election campaign. They must also be divested of the special privileges they have evidently been given when it comes to recruiting for the new police force. The KLA’s criminal activity must be brought to an end. The EU countries must send more police and judges. The Serbs must be helped to return home. Attempts must also be made to help groups of Serbs in Serbia itself. In turn, it must be absolutely clear that the election planned for October in Kosovo must be held, irrespective of whether the Kosovan Serbs boycott it, for what are especially needed are Albanians, who are accountable. At the moment, all Albanians have been turned into clients and can blame everyone else for terrorism, street fights etc. What we need is to arrange for the Albanian majority to be held accountable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The daily news is witness to the oppressive actions of the Yugoslavian government. Opposition is struck down and intimidated in the ways traditionally adopted by governments who feel insecure: newspapers and radio stations are closed down, equipment confiscated, various groups and non-governmental organisations intimidated and there are random arrests and trials with unjustified sentences such as the case of Flora Brovina. Many of the men, women and students who are victims of oppression today are the same people who have courageously spoken up in these past years, calling for peace, freedom and respect for human rights, and who have, in reality, been abandoned even by Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the situation in Kosovo is equally worrying, where the oppressed have become the oppressors, and this has been said by Kofi Annan, Solana and Kouchner. In the space of a year, 240 000 Serbs, Roma,<span class="bold"> </span>Gorancs and Jews have fled from Kosovo in terror. And those who have remained are regularly attacked and, in many cases, killed. The most recent UNHCR/OSCE report states clearly that, in Kosovo, minorities have no access to education, health and public services and no freedom of movement. And it is not only the minorities who are in this situation: even the Albanian Kosovars who are openly against the vendettas or for democracy in Kosovo live under threat and in fear of their lives. </p>
<p class="contents">Leaders such as Rugova are familiar with the situation, but even more in touch are those women who, together with Serbian, Bosnian and European women – the ‘Women in Black’ against war – have in recent years managed to maintain relations and build peaceful bridges. Some of them have had to leave Kosovo and others have been forced to remain silent. In Serbia, the centre of the ‘Women in Black’<span class="bold"> </span>is currently under threat of closure. </p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, Europe, and, in particular, the 19 NATO countries, should undertake a large-scale self-appraisal operation and revise its policies. The crimes and unlawful acts committed by NATO against civilians are now universally acknowledged. In the interests of the protection of human rights, we must not violate international regulations and we must start by observing the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, let us mention fundamental freedoms: for these freedoms to be established the embargo policy must be abolished. We must not treat civilians in this way, and the democratic Serbian opposition which is still today at the mercy of Milosevic is calling for us to change our policy. It may be that we should be the ones to give them strong support in Serbia and Kosovo. We owe it to ourselves, but, most of all, we owe it to a wonderful little boy from Kosovo called Felt who said to me while we were eating an ice-cream one day: ‘This war has turned us all into nastier people’.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is with growing frustration that we have to note that the situation in Serbia is deteriorating by the day. Milosevic is creating dictatorial conditions, a country governed by security troops, State media and State terror. He shies away from a democratic confrontation with the opposition. Every day, we are confronted with examples of repression. The independent media are thwarted. A very negative trend is setting in. Politicians are under threat. There is a murderous atmosphere. The assaults are relentless. </p>
<p class="contents">The student movement, OTPOR, on which the opposition is pinning all hope, is being attacked without mercy. CCL recently branded them terrorists. Measures are also being prepared against the universities so as to force students to keep calm. All in all, a situation is being created in which democracy is becoming a farce and the regime is trying to keep a grip on the situation by means of totalitarian manipulation. </p>
<p class="contents">We are sitting on the sidelines and can do all too little to bolster the democratic powers. We have insufficient direct influence on the situation in Serbia itself. It is nonetheless important that we express our indignation once again today. We need to remain involved, and it is also useful that we, as a Parliament, are here today expressing our broad consensus on the situation and on how the situation in Serbia is to be addressed. </p>
<p class="contents">The opposition in Serbia needs us. A great deal of aid has been set aside for Serbia within the framework of the Stability Pact. The money concerned cannot be spent until Belgrade makes a U-turn, but that will only happen if the opposition can express itself. As Mrs Schroedter has already mentioned, we are asking the Commission to make a huge effort and employ a great deal of creativity in order to help the towns in Serbia which support the opposition. But in addition to this, it must also be possible to give the independent media some backing. Is the Commission prepared to cooperate in setting up radio and TV facilities which can reach the Serbian population from outside that country? In my opinion, this proposal is worth a very serious effort. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Posselt (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, we have heard here about the brutal and wide-scale repression of the freedom of the media in Serbia, and in fact Belgrade’s Radio B92 was closed down during the May part-session here in Strasbourg. Since then a whole series of repressive measures has been taken against the independent media and against the student movement OTPOR, whose leaders have been unlawfully persecuted, excluded from university and taken into custody. We are calling for their release and we are demanding freedom of the media, but we must of course do something practical. I welcome the fact that Mr Wiersma has taken on board something which I also wanted to see in this resolution, which is that we must we must support independent broadcasting stations in the territory surrounding Serbia just as much as we support the few remaining independent media still existing within Serbia itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from Munich, and Munich has for decades been the home of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, which have been a voice of freedom for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Following the fall of Communism, President Havel said that these stations, which now also broadcast from Prague, played a leading part in establishing freedom and the rule of law there. But it was up to the Americans to do that – Radio Free Europe was created at the time by the Americans. We in the European Union today have a chance to do the same for a small part of Europe as the Americans did for Central and Eastern Europe. I have in mind creating independent broadcasting stations in Hungary, Romania, Montenegro and Albania which will be an independent voice and a source of information for the Serbian people. We must make one thing crystal clear once and for all: our criticism has never been aimed at the people of Serbia, but against those in power who are abusing the name of the Serbian people for their own criminal ends. We must draw a distinction between the people and the regime, and we must support the people and we must give them information and an independent voice.</p>
<p class="contents">We have some opportunities here. We must at the same time be very much aware that the issue of protecting minorities also affects Serbia. Not only do people frequently forget about the minorities in Vojvodina, but there is already a stream of refugees and expellees flowing into Kosovo from the border region of Serbia which has an Albanian population. The Albanians driven out of core Serbia scarcely get a mention in our media, yet they are significantly aggravating the situation in this region.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, of course, also championing all the media and supporting all the minorities in Kosovo, and Mrs Pack has already pointed out that in practice there is not only tension between Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo, but there are also Serbs persecuting other Serbs because they are regarded as collaborators since they are willing to participate in the process of reconstructing Kosovo and reconciliation between the peoples of Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of those held in prison is an important one, and I would like to add to what Olivier Dupuis said on this: there are many people in Serbia who have been carried off into custody, and about whose fate we know nothing. I would like to mention Ukshin Hoti, whose release we have repeatedly called for in this House: we do not know if he is alive at all or if he is being detained somewhere. We are calling for him to be released as a matter of urgency. His family hopes that he is alive and we must continue to draw attention to the fate of this famous civil rights campaigner, who for a time was the Foreign Minister of the democratic government in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context I would like to make it very clear that it is crucial for us not just to point the finger of blame at others, but also to fulfil our own obligations. This region is, of course, marked by criminality, hatred and conflicts, but if we do not even send two-thirds of the police officers we have promised to the area, so that a whole shift is missing in this crisis region, and on top of that there is no night shift, and all this happens simply because we are not meeting our own obligations, then we can scarcely point the finger of blame at others. Instead we should now ensure that we build up this region’s police force and administration. Without an operational police force and at least the rudiments of the rule of law, there is no hope of peace in Kosovo between individuals and between ethnic groups.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the point that Olivier Dupuis made so clearly. There may be differences of opinion about ways and means, but we should be united on the essentials. We can no longer dodge the vital issue, which is the very future of Kosovo!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, no one is safe from attack, whether he belongs to the majority or the minority in Yugoslavia. That is why I think it is important to maintain constant contact with the opposition and to attempt to bring about a change in the political scene. I also believe that it is absolutely right that the Commission also wishes to make a relatively large amount of money available if these changes should come about; many people regard such a large amount as being quite appropriate in view of the requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commission and Parliament will remain resolute in facing up to the Council, which is taking a rather softer line here. I also believe that funding for increased information provision should be implemented here and now, so as to provide more objective information about the actual conditions in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Kosovo today is different. Whereas before it was the majority that was in great danger, now it is the minorities who are living in difficult circumstances. This is just as unacceptable as the previous situation was. We are unanimous in advocating the rights of all the people living both in this region and in other regions, so that they can live their lives freely and move about at will.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, I am sceptical to say the least about the elections and their results. At the very least we should see these for what they are – an election decided by the Albanians, that is by that predominant part of the population which can move freely within this region. This does not apply to Serbs living in Kosovo, nor indeed to those Serbs who have fled Kosovo and are now living in Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the really critical issue – and I urge the Commission and the Council to really knuckle down to things here – is that more police and greater rule of law are needed. We are responsible for the rule of law applying to everyone in Kosovo on a uniform basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In his annual report, the UN Secretary-General notes that, one year on from the deployment of KFOR, we face a well-developed, organised and well-orchestrated campaign against the Serbs and other ethnic groups in Kosovo, which is undermining confidence in the future and transforming Kosovo into a breeding ground for retaliation and crime. The UN High Commissioner and the OSCE have condemned the fact that, one year on from the arrival of the KFOR forces in the area, the minorities living in Kosovo, mainly Serbs and Gypsies, are still unprotected. Even Amnesty International, which throughout the whole of the criminal NATO bombings in the region, only saw Milosevic’s crimes (with or without quotation marks), has now discovered that NATO committed war crimes in Kosovo resulting in the mass murder of civilians. </p>
<p class="contents">Only the European Parliament seems incapable, including in today’s resolution, of drawing any conclusions from the tragic situation which has arisen in this area as a result of the military incursions of NATO forces into an independent Member State of the UN, in violation of the fundamental principles of international law. It seems that the witch hunt in which all the main political forces of the European Union have joined still continues to inspire the European Parliament, making it incapable of assuming its historical responsibility towards those who elect it for safeguarding peace and the rights of the people of the Balkans to live in peace and dignity and to uphold their right to be masters of their own destiny, not the geopolitical pawns of the new imperialist world order. </p>
<p class="contents">Will we, as the European Parliament, ever be able to assume our responsibilities and understand that, while we talk of rights and democracy in certain regions, while we subsidize intervention in local elections in Montenegro and while we support the embargo on Iraq, condemning hundreds of thousands of children to death, we have no credibility whatsoever? Will we ever be able to say, we are putting an end to the embargo? That is the question which at some point will need an answer.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this respect, I much prefer the joint motion for a resolution to the proposal submitted by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left. After all, the resolution speaks out unmistakably about the undemocratic nature of the Milosevic regime in Belgrade and the means it deploys in order to exercise power. The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the other hand, does not seem to see any direct link between the continuous presence of Slobodan Milosevic on the political stage of the Balkans and the continuing instability in the region, one year on from the end of NATO’s intervention against Serbia’s ethnic cleansing which affected Kosovo on a massive scale. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to illustrate this link by referring to the position of Mrs Rada Trajkovic from Grazanica. This medical doctor forms part of the political leadership of the moderate Serbs in Kosovo. Her now suspended cooperation with UNMIK led to anonymous threats by the Serbs, because the Milosevic arm stretches far for the time being. </p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the whole of the Serbian minority in Kosovo remains just as vulnerable to acts of terrorism committed by Albanian extremists. Both motions for a resolution therefore underline the international guarantees of this minority’s physical safety – and rightly so. </p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I would like to make a critical comment on Paragraph 14 of the joint motion for a resolution. This clause calls for promoting reconstruction projects with EU aid, specifically in those areas of Kosovo where human rights and the rights of minorities are being fully respected and where democratic principles are guaranteed. In my opinion, this is an impossible criterion for granting aid, given the current situation. Remember, only one act of terrorism committed by an Albanian or Serb is all it takes to cause a setback within an entire region. Or do those drafting the joint resolutions have specific arguments underlying this proposal in Paragraph 14?</p>
<p class="contents">Commendably enough, the joint resolution presses for actual international attempts at ethnic conciliation and cooperation within Kosovo. How difficult this is was once again reinforced by the boos and hisses that rained down on the so-called “Mandela of Kosovo”, Adem Demaci, at the massive memorial service to commemorate NATO’s troops entering Kosovo Polje one year ago. Demaci spoke in the Pristina stadium: "Today, I call on all of you to fight a different battle, namely the battle for peace, for the future, for co-existence. Do not forget the Serbian people who have stayed behind in Kosovo. They find themselves in a difficult situation. Even the Serbian regime would prefer it if they were not there. Help them.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to say that the political situation in the entire region we are discussing today by no means justifies complacency or even guarded optimism. Quite the opposite – a realistic assessment suggests that there are only a few faint glimmers of hope on a dark horizon.</p>
<p class="contents">We are dealing with an ever more hard-line dictatorship in Serbia. In Bosnia, the structures of civil society are still so weak that only the presence of international troops is preventing violence from breaking out. In Kosovo, violence is a daily event, and the democratic forces in Montenegro are at risk from threats from outside and from polarisation within. That is the situation we are dealing with.</p>
<p class="contents">Let there be no mistake about this: all this is due to the disastrous actions of one man, the clique surrounding him, and his regime – Milosevic. The entire instability of the region is due to him. As long as this regime continues to exist, so will the instability in this region. Therefore the foremost demand that the European Union must make, again and again, and which it must back up with all the power at its disposal, is this: Milosevic must go!</p>
<p class="contents">The media of course play an important role in this context. So it is not surprising that the Milosevic regime is now taking a harder line than before against the independent media. As I see it, this is a sign of weakness. A time when a regime has to repress any freedom of expression is a time when it feels particularly weak and under attack. This is normally a sign of the beginning of the end. But in this case, unfortunately, the end could last a very long time. That is why it is right that demands are being made here for the European Union to use its resources to bolster the independent media in Serbia. We have been doing that for years. It is not, for example, as if objective reporting is not penetrating into the region. We should not always hide our light under a bushel, and we should not always talk just about American broadcasters. I must point out that there is a whole string of outstanding and skilled stations broadcasting to foreign countries which have for many years, and to an ever greater extent, been transmitting high-quality, objective and valuable programming to these regions, and they have received European support for this. If it is possible to do yet more in this area, then the Commission is of course willing to look into this.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, of course, already reacted to media repression in many cases in the past. And in the present situation the Commission has adopted and financed a whole raft of measures which I do not wish to describe in detail now, but which always aimed to enable independent media either to continue to appear, in the case of the print media, or to broadcast, in the case of audio-visual media, or else to open up alternative channels for the media.</p>
<p class="contents">This is part of the overall project developed by the EU to positively influence events in Serbia and to demonstrate that democracy really does have advantages for the public and is good and right. Let me mention the other examples from this overall project. First, there is of course the “Energy for Democracy” programme, under which cities governed by a democratic opposition are supplied with fuel oil in the winter. Then there is the follow-up project in the area of education, entitled “Schools for a democratic Serbia”, which is currently being completed. And we are currently also discussing programmes run by the Member States themselves with organisations in Serbia and with the Member States, for example a programme entitled “Asphalt – roads to democracy”.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is very important to demonstrate that democratic developments in Serbia will be rewarded and will receive a positive response. Against this background I would like to stress that we regard it as being particularly important to strengthen and stabilise the democratic developments that have already started in Croatia, as Croatia in particular is also capable of exerting a positive influence on Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Montenegro, I must say that we certainly welcome the democratic way in which the most recent municipal elections in Podgorica and Herceg Novi have been conducted. The very fact that these elections were held in near peaceful circumstances is unusual for this region, and we have to be grateful for small mercies. Overall, the EU is supporting the democratic reform process in Montenegro in a wide-ranging and active way. Significant financial support has been granted to Montenegro, so that since 1998 over EUR 115 million has either been spent or committed.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased, in view of all the laborious history of this, that the Council has now finally agreed to grant Montenegro an emergency support budget of EUR 20 million. I am being very serious when I say that the significance of this emergency programme in terms of giving Montenegro a stable and democratic future is greater than simply the amount of money involved may suggest. I therefore hope that it will soon receive the approval of the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgets. </p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to Kosovo, where ethnically motivated violence still dominates everyday life. We must condemn ethnically motivated violence regardless of who the perpetrators and the victims are, that is regardless of who is at the receiving end of ethnic violence and who commits it. The European Union will always condemn such violence with equal force.</p>
<p class="contents">The acts of violence being perpetrated against the Serbian minority and also against the Roma minorities are unacceptable in our eyes, just as the violence committed against the Kosovars just a few months ago was unacceptable. Just as we condemn the trials against Kosovars held in custody in Serbia, we welcome the reopening of the proceedings in the case of Flora Brovina, which has previously been the subject of resolutions adopted by this House.</p>
<p class="contents">We call upon all parties in Kosovo to solve the vital issue of missing persons and prisoners as a matter of urgency. We fully support KFOR’s efforts to maintain law and order in Kosovo and to protect the public as a whole. The Commission shares Parliament’s view that sending an international police force is highly important. Not only is the credibility of the policies of the European Union and its Member States at stake, it is also imperative, if we wish to achieve our objectives in Kosovo, for us to provide the minimum level of police presence required to guarantee stability.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless an atmosphere of stability and safety can be created, which will also make it possible for Kosovar Serbs to return, then there will be no true peace in Kosovo. It is in everyone’s interest to ensure cooperation between all Kosovo’s citizens, on the basis of common institutions. It is clear to us that a continuing substantial level of EC aid will be required. This aid will be provided via the reconstruction agency and the fourth pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, the Commission welcomes the conclusions of the most recent European Parliament mission to Kosovo. The Commission also supports UNMIK’s endeavours in the area of local administration by means of twinning projects and by advertising posts in UNMIK’s civil administration and the pillars of the reconstruction programme as widely as possible in all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider it extraordinarily important that the European Parliament has today once again held an in-depth debate on the resolution before us on the situation in the Western Balkans, and that this not only expresses our concern but above all demonstrates our shared determination not to leave our work in this region only half done. We have started it and we are determined to bring it to a successful conclusion.</p>
