<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, let me engage in a bit of continent hopping. Before reporting on the third ASEM summit and evaluating its results, let me briefly say a word about the ASEM process. The first summit in 1996 was at a time of huge optimism about Asia when people were talking about the Asian economic miracle. The second summit, in 1998, came at a time of economic crisis when many people were saying that Asia had had it and all had been much exaggerated. We saw some reality at the third summit. There was not an Asian economic miracle but a great deal that is very exciting has happened in Asia and it has recovered very rapidly in most parts from the crisis of 1997/98. Where it has done so most successfully, it has managed it by combining economic and political reform. That has been the background to these summits.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenge for the third summit in Seoul was to deepen the ASEM process both for governmental participants and for the broader public. It had to demonstrate that there need not be dramatic events occurring to justify meetings of European and Asian Heads of State or Government. We outlined our goals for ASEM III in our working party, we discussed it with the European Parliament before the summit on two occasions in the ASEAN working party and in the plenary which resulted, I believe, in your resolution of 5 October, the aims of which we not only took into account, but also managed to achieve in most cases.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to adopting three important documents, the leaders of the summit actively engaged in discussion of sensitive issues like human rights, the South China Sea, East Timor and Burma. They pledged to promote and protect fundamental human rights and uphold respect for democracy, the rule of law, equality, justice and concern for the environment. It was agreed to intensify ASEM's high level political dialogue by drawing strength from the diversity of Members while not excluding any issue. Leaders agreed to an expanded and updated Asia-Europe cooperation framework 2000 which forms the work programme for the coming decade. The need for common efforts to implement the Kyoto Protocol was confirmed, a consumer-producer dialogue to stabilise world prices for oil was advocated as well as closer cooperation to develop energy saving technologies. Trans-national crime was discussed, the exploitation of migrants, people trafficking, the fight against illegal drugs, all those issues which, alas, form the darkest side of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The summit adopted the separate Seoul declaration for peace on the Korean peninsula, welcoming the inter-Korean summit in June, urging both sides to continue building on its success and underlining the importance of engaging the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in multilateral dialogue. On enlargement, the two-key approach was adopted whereby a candidate country first needs the support of its regional partners before seeking endorsement from the other region. The final decision is made by consensus, by Heads of State or Government. No specific candidates were discussed at ASEM III.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of economic and financial cooperation, leaders agreed to work together to address the challenges posed by globalisation, information technology, <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce and the digital divide by expanding research and information networks between the two regions. Leaders also confirmed the preparation of voluntary annual reports on the status of efforts to overcome barriers to trade as identified under the trade facilitation action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">There was an acceptance by all ASEM partners to work towards a new comprehensive WTO round as soon as possible, taking into account the special needs of developing countries. In the social and cultural field, leaders recognised the vital importance of better educational links with specific initiatives for promoting mutual awareness, including an enhancement of inter-university cooperation and electronic networking between schools. In the related people-to-people field, the principle of opening the ASEM process to a larger segment of civil society was maintained, although the NGO initiative to establish a social forum could not be realised because of the resistance of certain Asian partners.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure Parliament can see these results are in line with the resolution of 5 October which I mentioned earlier. Human rights and the rule of law are embedded in the process; there was a clear understanding of the need for the early start of a broad-based WTO round but I am not sure that has been entirely reflected so far at the discussions at the APEC meetings in Brunei. While the proposal to establish a social forum was not accepted, we actively engaged with civil society and the NGOs and I very much hope that this area will see further progress in the run-up to ASEM IV in Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, leaders agreed to encourage an intensification of contacts among parliamentarians as set out in the cooperation framework. Inevitably, ASEM III was dominated by the momentous developments on the Korean peninsula which have resulted in the very worthy nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize of the President of South Korea, a man whose career has been distinguished, both by his commitment to democracy and human rights and the rule of law and, most recently, to his commitment to reconciliation between the south and north of the peninsula.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that reminded us in Europe of the important role that we have in Asia, not just in economic and trade terms, though it has to be said that one of the reasons for Asia's recovery has been that we have kept our word to keep our markets open to Asian exports over the last two years. This year it seems very likely that China will have a surplus of EUR 40 billion with the European Union. We have kept our word in economic and commercial matters which, among other things, encourages Asia to take us rather more seriously. It is important to remember that we also have a political role in Asia, not just in our advocacy of democracy and good governance, but also in the contribution we can make in the Korean peninsula and elsewhere to stability and security for the future. The ASEM process is an important one. This was a very valuable meeting. The process is developing and strengthening with time and I look forward to the next ASEM meeting in Denmark in a couple of years' time when I am sure we will be able to build on the progress already achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jarzembowski (PPE-DE)</span></span>  . – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I think the House is so empty because we have proceeded apace this evening and some members who wished to speak have not yet arrived and are still dining. I would ask you, therefore, not to interpret the low turnout as an indication that the issue is not important.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, first I agree with your reading that the ASEM process is hugely important. It is of huge political and economic significance. I only wish that both this House and many of your colleagues in the Commission would see the importance of Asia's relations with Europe from the right perspective, and that includes the Union's fisheries policy – may my Spanish colleagues forgive me and with my excuses to Mr Fischler. If you take a long-term view of political and economic developments in our multi-polar world, then you will see that Asia's relations with Europe, and vice versa, are of paramount importance. In this respect we are extremely lucky that the summit in Seoul took place at all and that, with one or two exceptions, all the heads of government attended. That was highly significant.</p>
<p class="contents">You are quite right that the Asian Summit was somewhat dominated, in the positive sense, by developments in both North and South Korea, with the result that more time was spent evaluating and qualifying the <span class="italic">rapprochement </span>on the Korean peninsular than on a real in-depth discussion of the Asia process. But we should be pleased that positive developments are taking place there. Allow me, however, to comment on the poor Council representative who will have to write up his protocol at some point: obviously the situation was awkward in Seoul due to the fact that some EU Member States have stopped exchanging ambassadors with North Korea and others have not. It would have been smarter – if we are to have a common foreign and security policy – if all 15 Member States had taken a joint decision to resume relations with North Korea at the same time and on the same terms, as opposed to this display of showmanship by some Heads of State and Government.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good – I freely admit – that some agreement was reached on a framework programme for cooperation between Asia and Europe. But, Commissioner, have you in all honesty understood the substance of the framework agreement? I still have a great deal of difficulty really understanding the substance of what has been agreed for the next decade. And here I think that, what is important to Parliament – even if only a few of us are here, someone should read the protocol and we specialists will take it from there – is for it to be involved in the process of putting flesh on the bones of the framework for cooperation between Asia and Europe. I think, in any case, that Parliament conducts itself far too reactively. As we have such a good negotiating partner in you, Commissioner, we should try to agree on the content before Copenhagen and before the conferences and Parliament should start us thinking about how we can flesh out the framework which you have decided on.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that the European side took a clear stance on human rights. But we need to discuss the consequences of what that means at our leisure. I think it was an excellent political declaration but we still have a few problems here.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that it is our job here in Parliament to follow up on what the European side generously included in the conclusions, namely cooperation between the European Parliament and the parliaments of the countries in Asia, following the first ASEM conference held in Strasbourg a few years ago. It is an important task and I can only hope that Parliament will initiate the second meeting next year before Copenhagen. We should arrange to hold it in Asia, given that the last meeting was held in Strasbourg. It is when you look at cooperation between Asia and Europe from the point of view of democracy or human rights that you see how important it is for us to cooperate more closely with parliaments in the Asian countries and bring about positive developments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We were all agog. Naturally we welcome the fact that the process has been opened up to North Korea. It is just a shame that we have not seen fit to make the necessary funds available to go with it. Apart from that, we feel the outcome left a lot to be desired, and that is putting it mildly. What we dislike about ASEM II is not so much what we <span class="italic">have </span>managed to achieve, because projects to do with money-laundering, HIV and AIDS, food safety and suchlike, are of course to be welcomed. In fact two concrete proposals have been adopted, notably the round table on globalisation and the duo fellowship programme, 4300 fellowships amounting to a total cost of USD 25 million. That is not to be sniffed at of course, but there are still a few questions we would like answered. I will return to them in due course.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more important is what was <span class="italic">not </span>adopted. We could have done so much more in terms of financial stability, trade and investments, and infrastructure. An ASEM environmental centre was proposed. Now that would have been something. What concerns us is what we failed to do on the human rights front. Things were said but they have not found their way into the projects that were agreed, not even in terms of the considerable reserve, for example, although this could easily have been done. In any case, this considerable reserve also has something to do with globalisation. We agreed to concentrate on globalisation, in particular the adverse effects thereof, when in fact we believe that globalisation is a positive force. There is a down side but surely we should also consider the bonuses.</p>
<p class="contents">We find it incomprehensible that the secretariat for the fellowship programme is to be located in Seoul. ASEF is working extremely well in Singapore, so why not establish it there?</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the Commission values ASEM extremely highly and it has our wholehearted support on that score. What we want to know is whether our Ministers have given ASEM due consideration. We feel they have been sadly lacking in ambition and are therefore unworthy of praise.</p>
<p class="contents">Some headway has been made in terms of Asia-Europe parliamentary dialogue. Perhaps we parliamentarians can succeed where Ministers have failed in this respect. The European Commission deserves our support because we are convinced it is going about things the right way.
