<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karas (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 500 days from now euro banknotes and coins will come into circulation. This will be the final stage of the first currency changeover on this scale in the history of our continent. EMU citizens, every citizen of the Member States of the European Union and of the applicant countries and beyond will be indirectly or directly affected. Every single consumer, including both our own citizens and tourists visiting Europe, and the whole world economy will have to learn to recognise the new money, to become familiar with prices and values in euros and to handle the new money. Both large and small companies will have to adapt and change over their accounts and computer systems to the new currency, which will involve substantial preparatory work.</p>
<p class="contents">We have talked a lot about the advantages of the euro and of economic and monetary union. But there still remains a very great deal to be done. According to opinion polls, not enough companies or private individuals are using the euro, and awareness of it is still too low. 30% of companies do not yet see any need to make preparations well in advance and in some cases even think that they do not need to complete the changeover until 2002. Most members of the public do not have a euro account and rarely carry out financial transactions in euros.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an enormous need for information and awareness-raising measures going beyond merely technical information on the changeover. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has not simply commented on the Commission report – we welcome the priorities and measures put forward in it. We have attempted to put the report in concrete terms, to strengthen in it, and, where we thought it was necessary, to supplement it. Considering that around EUR 80 million will be spent on this information campaign in the three years 1999-2002, plus a further EUR 80 million from the ECB, it is absolutely vital for us to have the closest possible coordination between all the institutions, associations and states affected, for us to identify priorities and to encourage agreement on key messages, for us to monitor the process, and in that case I would suggest using the European Parliament and European Commission interinstitutional working group. It is also important for us to implement the political guidelines, also in the context of contracts with Member States, and for us to demonstrate a high degree of professionalism in doing all this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to use my last one and a half minutes to say something about priorities. Over half of all SMEs do not yet have an action plan for the changeover. SMEs need to tackle their technical changeover as quickly as possible, and in doing so also to give some thought to the strategic consequences of a market notable for price transparency and increased competition. So SMEs are the priority for autumn 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the public at large, which includes all the target groups and more besides. The public needs to be made to feel secure about this. In this area, public administration needs to act as a role model, just as NGOs and foundations need to be involved in the information campaign and act as intermediaries.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we have schools, schoolchildren and other young people. We have a very specific proposal, which is not only to change over all school books as soon as possible, but also to organise painting, drawing, essay-writing and public speaking competitions on the subject of ‘Changing to the euro’, which is a defining topic for Europe’s identity. The third area is this: the banks have run world savings week throughout Europe, and in this context we should also introduce ‘euro savings days’, to encourage more people to open a euro savings account before the changeover stage. We need to increase the involvement of elected representatives, by which I mean not just Members of the European Parliament, but also all representatives elected by the public from municipal level to European level.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the need to have sufficient staff in the Commission’s directorates-general to cope with the change, coordination is also a key area if we are to send a clear message to the public through a wide-ranging communications strategy with adequate financial resources and an appropriate time frame. We are therefore proposing that the campaign should be extended to 2002. In that case, the success story of the euro will not come to an end at that point, but, with the support of the public, it will go on to greater things. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are less than 75 weeks to go in fact. The Committee on Budgets, in common with all Members of this House, is very much in agreement with the objectives described in the Commission communication on the communication strategy covering the final stages of the completion of EMU. We also believe that there should be incentives and support for companies, especially SMEs, to enable them to carry out the work needed to change over to the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, enhanced preparation is just as desirable and important for all our citizens and for all consumers. We all need to change over to the euro in our daily lives. It was not of course for the Committee on Budgets to assess the content of the Commission communication in detail: we limited ourselves to budgetary aspects. We wish to point out once again that in the interinstitutional agreement it was stipulated that information policy is an autonomous action which does not require a separate legal basis. For the reason mentioned, this particularly needs to be brought to the attention of the Council again.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would particularly like to remind you that the Prince programme was initiated by Parliament through budgetary intervention in 1996 with the clear aim of financing information campaigns on priority issues for the EU. This was to take place at interinstitutional level, as at that time we were convinced, as we are now, that this would ensure that the available funding would be spent as effectively as possible. We therefore wish to stress once again that the decision on the breakdown of appropriations and the guidelines for implementation, including joint actions, is taken on the basis of the opinion given by the interinstitutional working group. This working group was specifically referred to in the budgetary remarks, and that is how it should stay – and that comment is particularly for the ears of the Commission! For that reason we wish to reinsert the relevant remark on budget headings B3-300 and B3-306, which the Commission evidently ‘forgot’ to include in its preliminary draft budget for 2001. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur and the committee responsible for including our remarks on this in the conclusions.</p>

The information must come in cooperation with the Member States, but what, in my opinion, is of most importance is that NGOs are kept fully aware of what is happening. We have to reach grassroots level as swiftly as we can, in a language that is perfectly clear. The so-called two-stage information strategy, where peer groups keep each other’s members informed, has turned out to be the best of all options, and this should be put to good use too in dealing with this information issue. I fear those information campaigns that are led by the Commission. They are often sweet as candy and very beautifully contrived. The fact that this information campaign is being made with the support of NGOs and via them will hopefully prevent a repeat of that.</p>
<p class="contents">The arrival of the euro will also entail a lot of practical questions for consumers. Above all we have to take care that prices do not trail upwards when the currencies are finally changed over. In this the consumer organisations have a very big and important job, and women’s organisations must also be taken into account, as women need information on this. It is absolutely essential that cross-border giros and payment transactions are in accordance with the principles of the Internal Market. I am glad that the President of the European Central Bank, Mr Duisenberg, also paid attention to this and promised that the ECB would produce a report on the subject. I genuinely hope that these practical matters, which are a thorny subject for consumers, are attended to before the euro comes into proper circulation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We wish to remind the House that the euro information programme is also, as defined in the budget, a joint European Commission and European Parliament programme. During the last parliamentary term there was a committee led by Mr Anastassopoulos which laid down the essential features of information policy in this area. It was very successful at that point. We also managed at that time to secure a full and key role for Members of the European Parliament in this information campaign, via the political foundations. This has not happened during this new parliamentary term. This body, which consisted of the Commissioner responsible and the relevant committee chairs, has not yet been convened. Some of the procedures dating from the last parliamentary term have still not been discharged to this day. We therefore have to ask in the clearest possible terms what should happen next. For this reason, my first request is that a meeting of this body should be called as quickly as possible. That is my first point.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point that I would briefly like to touch upon relates to an observation regarding the substance of the information campaign. If you compare prices in the Eleven, that is in Euroland, with prices in other countries which have remained outside the Eleven, including the United Kingdom but also Switzerland and Norway, where this is particularly apparent, you will see that price levels in Euroland, even in the ‘rich’ countries, are generally speaking lower than in the other countries. This means that the European single currency is already leading to greater competition in this area, and that in turn this competition is leading to the public getting goods and services on more favourable terms. A study should be carried out on this, something which is also called for in the Karas report.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is high time that we had a more efficient communications strategy and that cooperation between the Commission, the European Parliament and the Member States was improved in this new parliamentary term. The European public not only feels inadequately prepared for the euro, it also genuinely is inadequately prepared for it, both objectively and subjectively speaking. The fact is that the long transitional period has not led to more intensive and careful preparations being made for the introduction of the euro, quite the contrary – it has led to more disinformation and also to preparations being postponed, in some people’s minds even to June 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, this seems to apply not only to the public, but also to business. Although 80% of businesses say that they are preparing for the euro and its introduction, objectively speaking at most 25% are making concrete preparations. A sign of this is of course that only 1% of banknotes within the European Union have been converted to date. If we do not tackle this now, fears that we will end up with the dreaded ‘big bang’, which none of the governments wanted, will be totally justified.</p>
<p class="contents">The governments themselves really must do some advance work, however, and demonstrate greater commitment. I believe that you cannot shift all the responsibility to the European institutions. After all, it is the EU Member States that have a duty to provide political information and education according to the principle of subsidiarity. We really must call on the Member States of the European Union to invest money, time and human resources in ensuring that the euro is a success. It is a matter of regret that up to now public administrations have not led the way as they should have done.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is also important, and the rapporteur has quite rightly drawn attention to this, for schools, teachers and places of education to prepare people for the euro. The euro must become part of education across the board. It is not enough to have a few successful but extremely modest Socrates projects about the euro in Europe’s schools. No, this is really a job that needs to be successfully handled at local level. I think it would be wonderful if the schools, Europe’s young people, welcomed the euro as a tangible sign of Europe, and if everyone used their own preparations to communicate with others. This is also something that the older generation, who are generally so sceptical about the euro, could do. Why should older people in the European Union not use their experience, their knowledge and also the time that they have available in order to make the euro a success? Maybe this is an area where we could have a kind of new pact between the generations that would help the euro project to succeed. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission certainly needs to work even more closely with us and to step up the pace of its involvement. But we should not forget that the resources for the information campaign are extremely slight and have to be shared out between the Member States. No company introducing an important product would rely on such modest resources to ensure that a product was a success. A powerful argument in favour of the euro is the initial positive experience with monetary union, which has in fact provided protection against turbulent currency markets in recent times. But it is also a matter of turning information into education, because at the end of the day we need to acquire a totally new way of looking at prices, making calculations and judging values. We should not be deceived by the painless transition on 1 January 1999. Nor should we be deceived by the almost automatic transition to the new millennium. We also need to prepare for the euro psychologically. We must all do this together, at all levels of the European Union!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We believe that it is a very good report and it makes a very positive contribution to an issue of fundamental importance in the process of introducing the euro into the lives of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the euro is not purely a macroeconomic and financial issue. It is an issue which will reach every European citizen, it is a European distinguishing mark and, therefore, it is of the greatest importance in the process of European construction. To this end, it is very important that a campaign be implemented – and a very good campaign – so that in 2002 the euro may enjoy the degree of confidence and acceptance which we all want. Furthermore, as has been said, there is a great delay in terms of the number of countries and companies prepared for its use and in terms of our citizens’ level of knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect I would like very briefly to highlight three dimensions. The first is decentralisation. The participation of regional and local authorities is very important. Many of them have very significant responsibilities and are better prepared than the Member States themselves to reach the citizen. This is an aspect that the European Central Bank and the Commission should bear in mind. I would like to know Commissioner Solbes’ opinion with regard to participation at this level, which Mr von Wogau has also requested. We must ensure that these administrations play a significant role. It falls to them to do so, since they are best prepared to reach the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this decentralisation must also take place at company and industry level and not be limited to the headquarters of managerial or union organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I recommend that you read the conclusions of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which introduce a cultural dimension, which is very important to the success of this information campaign. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In contrast my party – the Scottish National Party – recently reaffirmed our position of support in principle for entry to the euro currency and we are not afraid to promote that view.

<p class="contents">Mr Karas acknowledges a high level of support for the euro but also some shortcomings in the provision of information within the euro zone and I support his ideas for addressing that problem. But in particular I welcome the fact that this strategy also addresses those Member States not yet taking part in monetary union, since of course we will be affected whether we join in or remain out.

In these countries, referenda will be held before the governments concerned make the decision concerning the introduction of the euro. Two of these countries, England and Denmark, have had the good sense not to take part in the euro information campaign. They have said no in view of the fact that the discussion is not yet concluded and with the forthcoming referenda in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">The third country that remains outside EMU, Sweden, has, however, decided to take part in the campaign, despite the fact that it will take place before the referendum and before it is decided whether Sweden will introduce the euro. This means that the euro information campaign will not be a normal information campaign as it is in other countries, but a sort of persuasion campaign and the beginning of the fight between those that are for and those that are against in the referendum. It is, of course, difficult to imagine that the euro information campaign would produce any particularly critical information on the euro, as the object of the campaign is to increase confidence in the euro and the euro reform. This means, in actual fact, that the euro information campaign will serve the political purpose of the Swedish government, which is, of course, to persuade the Swedish people to vote in favour of the euro in the referendum.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifty percent of the euro information campaign is financed from EU funds and is to be conducted throughout society, even in schools where it is not usual to carry on one-sided political campaigns, which is what this is. I think that it would be disgraceful if the Swedish government were allowed to exploit the euro information campaign in this way. It would be both compromising and embarrassing for the EU if the campaign were allowed to be carried out as planned. Therefore, I want to appeal to the Commission to take steps to ensure that the agreement concerning the Swedish euro information campaign is torn up or amended in such a way that it may only be implemented once the Swedish people have expressed their opinion in a referendum.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to appeal to my fellow MEPs here in the House to support Amendments 7 and 12 in the vote tomorrow, as the text of these amendments recommends that the campaign not be conducted in countries that have not decided if they are to be a part of EMU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am glad that no money from the campaign is formally being used for propaganda in the Danish debate. This report is one of the most interesting documents I have read for a long time. It could form part of a handbook for democrats or perhaps, rather, be used as an object lesson in anti-democratic manipulation. I read here that the euro is an ‘essential, identity-building factor in the process of European integration’. It is also noted that there is no overwhelming support for the euro in the euro area and certainly not in the countries surrounding this area. As the opinion of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport very clearly puts it, the Commission is therefore urged, “when carrying out the advertising and information campaign, to take account of the fact that large parts of the population continue to be sceptical about the common currency”. Or, to put it another way: the objective, as stated in the report itself, is that “the right means of communication can be used to respond to the European public’s national and cultural features”. Or, in a nutshell, manipulation. The situation is that, in this programme, more than EUR 100 million has been used to influence the people of Europe. That is to say, the Commission is using Europeans’ money to manipulate Europeans. As I see it, that is the very opposite of how we really visualise this project. Democracy depends upon decision-making by the people, not upon manipulation by the institutional machine. If I say this, it is because, as is well known, we are holding a referendum in Denmark on 28 September on joining the euro, and it goes without saying that it is the public debate which forms the basis for this. We will not be manipulated. Such tellingly described manipulation has not been seen since the totalitarian regimes collapsed years ago. This is a most deplorable report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Out of respect for all our European citizens, it is important not to underestimate the political significance of the changeover, and for this changeover to occur without any hitches. With this in mind, it is necessary to organise the practical dimension of the changeover well as a matter of priority. It is, in this context, extremely useful that, after extended pleas, also on the part of this House, frontloading has become possible. In addition, people need to have faith in the process as a whole. In order to instil this feeling, we must provide them with information as a matter of priority. We endorse the plans of the Commission, which set out to achieve this for each target group and by mobilising the organised midfield. After all, the hallmark of sound information is that it is tailored to the specific circumstances of those involved, and people and companies have a great deal more faith in their own associations and organisations than they do in public institutions. But not until we manage to reduce the costs of cross-border payments and exchange rates within the euro-zone will people and companies have a sufficient level of confidence, and this confidence is crucial. It is a prerequisite for motivating people to make the necessary efforts, efforts which are needed to adapt to the new situation. Let us not delude people into thinking they will not need to make any sacrifices. The changeover will require an effort. Everyone will need to adjust, everyone will need to make an effort. If we can help them in this and guide them in the right direction from the outset, we will have succeeded in our task of providing information. </p>

<p class="contents">Although we have repeatedly stated that the euro has, since January 1999, been the official currency of 11 EU Member States, which Greece and possibly Denmark will join at the start of next year, and that the national currencies are just multiples and fractions of the euro, the fact of the matter is that the majority of Europeans do not believe that escudos, pesetas, francs and marks are not still their official currency, because that is what they have in their pockets.</p>
<p class="contents">While water, electricity, telephone and supermarket bills are also shown in euros, I regard that as a mathematical exercise of limited usefulness. Yet in 18 months’ time our national notes and coins will disappear and it is high time that we were totally familiar with the new money, developed a sense of its value and recognised its implications for our lives and for the development of our economies and societies.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, information campaigns on the euro need to focus on precisely these two aspects: first, the value of the euro, its appearance and the way we use it as a currency, and, second, its potential and effectiveness in terms of monetary stability in the European Union, the level of growth achieved – the highest in recent decades – and in terms of controlling inflation and creating employment.</p>
<p class="contents">If these campaigns are to deliver the desired results, however, it is vital for the various actions to be coordinated. It is no good having one campaign by the European Central Bank and another one by the Commission or by Parliament, not to mention all the other campaigns organised by the Members States involved. It is essential to effectively coordinate the resources available so as to reach the target groups, and for us to be certain that there are no errors of the kind already identified in documents which the Commission has widely distributed in Portuguese schools.</p>
<p class="contents">Schools are nerve centres for information and have a multiplier effect, so they must be used in the most appropriate, simple and effective way possible. This means that the key words in these campaigns have to be coordination of effort, involvement, and human, technical and financial resources. Whereas it seems that up to now the right hand has not known what the left is doing, and vice versa, and it is important to get past this stage as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">2001 should be the year in which the euro takes over the key role of national currencies in setting prices, in company accounting and in cross-border transactions. We need to call a halt to the scandalous cross-border costs within the euro area, which do not involve any risk for the banks. The practice of charging a percentage on credit card transactions and on bank debits and transfers is one of the causes of the poor light in which the European public views the euro, and only action by the Commission to outlaw the real cartels that have been created can put an end to this and help to restore confidence. And this is what the citizens of Europe are waiting for.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, I cannot escape this here, either. Anyone who uses the euro as a vehicle to sell the so-called European idea is committing a very grave logical error.

Surely no-one could challenge the need for information. True, some British newspapers declare that we already know all the facts, but the recent announcement of the merger between the Frankfurt and London stock exchanges left many British newspaper editors spectacularly exposed on the simple issue of which currency would be used for the exchange denomination.</p>
<p class="contents">More than two-thirds of UK businesses are unaware of the practical implications of the introduction of the euro, even for those countries outside the euro zone. If there is funding available for the many seminars and conferences which UK trade associations, lawyers and accountants are holding, then as a UK lawyer let me declare my interest in ensuring that we get our share of it.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is reason to believe that this campaign goes well beyond the provision of practical information. After all, the European Central Bank is holding its own information campaign, so why should we be duplicating the effort? Perhaps we see the answer in the evangelical tone of Mr Karas' report and his remarkable declaration that the euro information campaign must help to perpetuate the successful history of the euro. I certainly wish the euro well. Currency instability is bad for all of us, whether we are in or out of the euro zone. But I personally fail to recognise this historic success over the last six months, and the astonishing suggestion that the euro has proved a stabilising factor in the face of international monetary crises.</p>
