<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ewa Klamt (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, although I have the floor, what we are really talking about here is the Green Paper on economic migration. Today’s plenary debate and tomorrow’s vote signify the beginning of a new chapter. We are creating the framework conditions for economic migration in Europe. The EU is one of the safest, economically strongest regions in the world. For this reason, we are subject to considerable pressure from migration flows; as, indeed, we shall continue to be in future. Managing these inflows is one of Europe’s challenges for the future, and to meet it we should not just react to reality, but act to shape the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In a European Union with largely open internal borders, immigration can and should only be regulated in a way that makes allowances for and shows a sense of responsibility towards other Member States. That means that, within the EU, we need harmonised European regulations on migration. It should also be made clear, however, that ultimate responsibility for access to the labour market lies with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has compiled fundamental questions on the regulation of economic migration in a Green Paper in order to obtain an overview of opinion that is as comprehensive and reliable as possible as a basis for drafting subsequent proposals for regulations. Parliament gave advice on this questionnaire in the form of a resolution as an own-initiative report.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to do justice to the state of affairs now, in the early stages of the regulatory framework, my report summarises fundamental guidelines on economic migration. Parliament has the task of working out the framework for our action in the coming years. Detailed issues are to be resolved at a later date, at the advisory stage for particular Commission drafts.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of a European immigration policy must be to manage legal, that is to say desirable, migration whilst preventing illegal, unwanted migration. Only by stemming the abuse of existing regulations can we create scope for legal, managed migration. We need a European migration policy in the form of a comprehensive, coordinated framework, within which migration regulations are to be drawn up according to reasons for moving.</p>
<p class="contents">There must of course be continuing respect for human rights and human dignity. Economic migration differs from the granting of asylum, however, in that the main emphasis is on the economic needs of the receiving countries. This explains why mass legalisation is not a viable immigration-policy measure, because there can neither be selection of migrants nor analysis of the labour market to determine actual labour requirements. Mass legalisation is an attempt to somehow give an untenable situation a better administrative form. In a way, it means politicians capitulating to reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Even the idea of attempting to solve Europe’s demographic problem by means of migration is inadequate. Studies have shown that the birth rate in integrated immigrants falls to EU levels as early as the second generation. In addition, we would need so many immigrants in the near future that their integration would be impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we should also reject the calls to follow the example of the United States and introduce a green card system. Apart from the fact that there are far better ways of regulating immigration, this would mean considerable intrusion on the competences of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to the calls for Europe-wide regulation of the right to vote for third-country nationals. This is one of the original prerogatives of the Member States, and does not belong within the competence of the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent weeks, the issue of immigration has once more become the focus of public attention. The images and reports from Lampedusa, Ceuta and Melilla, Malta and Cyprus have shaken many people. Behind these images lie individual destinies by which we are touched. Firstly we are shocked at what is happening on the southern borders of Europe, and secondly we ask ourselves how we can change the present situations and prevent such things happening in future. Let us not fool ourselves, though. We are here to speak about all the external borders of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The only reason that the problems of securing the other external borders of the EU are not the focus of public attention is that the images are not so concentrated in the media and thus do not make such a powerful impression. Politicians are called upon to rectify the situation as quickly as possible or, even better, to prevent a certain state of affairs from arising in the first place. Tackling only the symptoms cannot be the solution; we must also confront the causes.</p>
<p class="contents">To put it in plain language, letting the people currently waiting on the Moroccan side of the fence travel into the EU would seem to be a humane act. In reality, however, to do so would be excessively simplistic and ultimately inhumane. It is not sufficient to let people into the EU, because what is to happen then? Where and how are these people supposed to live and work? What prospects do we have to offer them? Much worse, this act would have a pull effect. Unfortunately, Ceuta and Melilla are living proof that mass legalisation has an immense pull effect. What was originally meant to be a measure to end illegal residence and undeclared work has become an incentive for illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, it should be emphasised that we need clear regulations for all fields of immigration: flight, asylum and economic migration. The people we receive must be offered quality of life. That is one aspect. In this context, we need cooperation and support concepts with regard to countries of origin and transit. That is a further aspect. We need a third aspect too, however: a consistent, rigorous fight against illegal immigration. Readmission agreements, border management, return of illegal immigrants, and tackling the trafficking and smuggling of human beings all form part of this. Approaching and solving this as an overall task is the key to successfully mastering this new chapter in European history.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Franco Frattini, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. – (IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mrs Klamt in particular for the work produced, for the commitment shown by the whole Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and for the contribution it has made to the work of the Commission. In January this year the Commission issued a Green Paper aimed at stimulating a transparent public debate throughout Europe, which has involved all the public and private players.</p>
<p class="contents">So far we have received 140 different contributions from trade unions, non-governmental organisations, Member States and employers’ organisations, as well as the contribution from the European Parliament itself, which will certainly be one of the key elements in drawing up an action plan. I confirm that I intend to submit the action plan to the Commission by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The guidelines for European action consist primarily of the need for a political strategy. We cannot even think of tackling an issue like immigration, whether legal or illegal, with emergency measures or police actions, either slamming the doors shut as if Europe were a fortress or, conversely, opening them indiscriminately, without thinking about the consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need political strategies and a joint effort by the 25 European Union Member States. I often hear of small groups of countries that want to act independently or other groups that think they have the solution all sewn up. Quite frankly, I think the only solution can be cohesive action by the whole European Union. In this connection I shall say it again: Parliament, the Council and the Commission must cooperate with each other.</p>
<p class="contents">Emergency strategies are needed, certainly, because people are tragically dying in the Mediterranean Sea, and for other reasons. However, we also need medium-term strategies with a broader scope, because immigration must not be just passively tolerated, but wanted and managed according to a European Union political procedure. The results of the Green Paper will be converted into an action plan, from which some guidelines for the European Union will emerge.</p>
<p class="contents">We see legal immigration – that is, immigration that conforms to the rules of the Member States and of the European Union – as a resource and not as a threat, and that is how we want to see it. We are aware of the demographic trends that mean that labour is needed from outside the EU, but of course we also know that the Union of 25 must not forget that there are human resources – workers – available in the new Member States of the Union, who are European citizens like us. Therefore, when rules concerning that category of workers are discussed in May 2006, I shall be one of those encouraging the old Member States, the 15, to get rid of the barriers that still stand in the way of workers from the countries that acceded to the European Union in 2004. That is a further aspect to be considered within a broader strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">National competences, of course, remain unaffected. Even in the Constitutional Treaty – as you will remember – we decided that the question of determining quotas would be dealt with at a national level. Note that there is not yet any willingness in the Council to decide on entry quotas at a Community level, whereas there is great willingness to formulate common strategies, particularly on managing legal economic immigration and fighting the black economy. Underground workers in the black economy are exploited twice over: on the one hand they are paid less, and on the other they do not benefit from worker’s rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We are faced with a commitment that should be considered very carefully by those who are only concerned about letting workers in, showing them solidarity and welcoming them. We should be concerned, rather, that those whom we let into our countries enjoy their full rights as workers and are not forced to work in the black economy without health care or social services, because that is not a decent service for us to offer to friends who enter the European Union legally.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore adopt a balanced approach: solidarity and integration for those who come here lawfully; a credible policy against traffickers in human beings and those who facilitate illegal immigration; and a credible, common policy to expel those who do not obey our laws. We have to demand that the laws of our lands be obeyed, but in so doing we must also respect the dignity of every human being: an expulsion procedure must never infringe people’s dignity, even if they have come here illegally.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the European Commission’s major lines of action. Of course, on this more than on any other subject, Parliament’s voice will be a voice of democracy and a crucial factor in enabling us to reach decisions on which we all agree.</p>

I believe that the report, on which we shall also be voting tomorrow, really offers an excellent basis for joint regulation of economic migration by the EU and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I note that the present report largely reflects the positions of the Committee on Development that we had summarised in an opinion. My colleagues should also be particularly pleased that paragraph 8 of the report calls on the EU Member States to ratify the UN International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families at long last.</p>
<p class="contents">We think it particularly important that migrants be treated with dignity, and according to the work they do, throughout the duration of their stay in the European Union. This concerns a number of points that we have also raised directly. One example is the necessity of economic migrants having access, following their departure, to the money paid by them into European social security schemes. A further example is making it easier for migrants who have returned to developing countries to immigrate again to the EU, partly in recognition of the experience of integrating they have gained.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise clearly that it is important to us that victims of trafficking in human beings from developing countries not be criminalised, but receive all conceivable help and support.

Thus there can be no doubt as to the significance of the Green Paper ‘On an EU approach to managing economic migration’. However, the document is contradictory. It indicates that it is devoted to admission procedures for migrants from third countries, and not the movement of persons within the EU's internal market. However, it is predicted that discussions on the results of the Green Paper will form the basis of a plan on how to react to the needs of the labour market. Migrants will be admitted to the EU labour market; it is proposed that EU labour market services like the European Public Employment Services and the EURES job mobility portal will be used to facilitate their employment. The Council Directive on the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents, which enters into force in 2006, provides that long-term migrants will be able to move to another Member State or settle in it for the purposes of studying, hired employment or self-employment or may even settle without engaging in any economic activity. This means that long-term economic migrants will be able to work and offer services across practically the entire EU internal market. At the same time, for the new EU Member States a transition period of seven years applies to the free movement of workers. Parliament has been discussing the Services Directive for two years. Yet neither free movement of persons, nor free movement of services has truly been realised in the EU itself. Bearing in mind that the determination of the flow of economic migration is a matter for Member States, I propose that when they are devised, EU regulations on the admission of economic migrants should be confined to the minimum criteria for migrant admission, and should leave the Member State the right to make a final decision, all the more so because the EU does not have a common industrial policy.

<p class="contents">The phenomenon of migration has more bearing than ever on the international community and each Member State. The report by Mrs Klamt makes an important contribution to this pressing debate.</p>
<p class="contents">We still do not talk a lot about the situation of immigrants in their country of origin, but we talk more and more about immigrants in order to highlight the problems they create in the countries in which they settle.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who ought to concern us, as political representatives, are the men and women who suffer as a result of immigration. I am referring, in particular, to the poorest people and families. For them, immigration is sometimes seen as a last resort to escape poor living conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of an immigration policy in Europe that fully respects the European Convention on Human Rights and of its being enforced in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity. I am in favour of having the courage to distinguish between economic migration and asylum granted on humanitarian grounds, which respects the dignity of unknown persons. I am in favour of having the political and civic courage to select economic migrants in accordance with the actual requirements of the labour market in the Member States acting as host countries. I am in favour of governments having the courage to give jobs first and foremost to all those women who want one, in order to bring them out of long term unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">The opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality also emphasises the need to acknowledge the importance of undeclared jobs. Doing so is an essential factor in the fight against illegal economic migration, of which women are frequently the victims.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to make one further point regarding women. We want cultural diversity. We are all in favour of improving women’s health. That is why we are in favour of gynaecological and obstetrical health care services and of protecting mothers and their children in order to enable all female migrants to receive the highest possible level of health care. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Debate has until now been marked by a demagogical tone, both from those who say that we should irresponsibly open up our borders without restriction, and from those who feel that we should give out all of the rights, including political rights, that we confer on our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear. We must not confuse the granting of basic rights to migrants with the citizenship rights that we confer on those to whom we grant nationality. Establishing confusion of this nature could lead to more alienation and to unwanted xenophobia.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Klamt notes, in the last 25 years the number of migrants in the world has more than doubled; there are more than 200 million of them today and they are moving in increasing numbers to the EU, rather than the previous typical emigration destinations such as the United States and Canada.</p>
<p class="contents">The right of men and women to seek a better life in a country other than their own is not open to question. Their expectations of entering a new country safely, legally and with their fundamental rights completely respected are also legitimate. For this to happen, Europe must have the capacity to receive, host, employ and integrate these people. It must also be able to pursue a policy of development cooperation that reduces wealth imbalances between countries of origin and host countries.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed is clear and coherent common European immigration policy, and effective management of migratory flows. To this end, we must, firstly, open up new legal ways of entering the EU, whilst taking into account each Member State’s actual capacity and without losing sight of the Lisbon agenda and the European employment strategy; secondly, step up the fight against illegal entry and trafficking of human beings; thirdly, promote the effective integration of immigrants, because successful immigration is commensurate with the effectiveness of integration, as Mr Frattini noted; and fourthly, set out a policy of safe, dignified and humane return to the country of origin in full respect of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is, in actual fact, an issue on which we need to have a common approach. It is no longer possible to continue carrying out isolated policies on these matters. We believe that an economic migration policy goes hand in hand with an integration policy. We are also keen to point out that immigration can be a positive factor for the European Union. Other ideas of which we are in favour are introducing a European green card, which would make it easier for immigrants to find jobs, and granting immigrants who have lived on EU territory for at least five years the right to vote in local and European elections but not, by any means, in national elections, contrary to what Mrs Klamt said a few weeks ago. We would point out that regularisations have enabled men and women who were exploited by unscrupulous employers while working illegally to emerge from the shadows. Finally, we would point out the need to develop genuine integration policies. In short, it is a question of finding a means to deal with an indisputable fact: Europe’s population is ageing and, consequently, a new workforce is required.</p>
<p class="contents">Admittedly, we are only talking here about an own-initiative report following on from a Green Paper, but these are – and I emphasise this fact – so many altogether crucial factors which really are supported by the majority of this House and which therefore ought to be looked at more closely by the Commission, when it drafts its proposal on this matter. Only a few moments ago, Mr Frattini informed us of a draft action plan. I hope that he will take account of these altogether crucial factors. Legislation drafted on such an important subject would be worthy of the European Parliament’s full involvement, for today it is our responsibility – I would even say our duty – finally to give our opinion in favour of a common policy on legal migration.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that, by completely putting a stop to legal channels of immigration, we are only contributing to the rise in illegal immigration. Let us be totally honest and acknowledge that, until now, all of the policies solely and exclusively founded on repression have failed and that we might have to accept the need to do things differently and, in particular, increase development in immigrants’ countries of origin. It is by doing this, above all, that we will succeed in reducing the migratory pressure of which these countries are the source. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is evident to me from what I hear said in this Chamber today, and from what the Council and the Member States, among others, have been saying for years, that we all agree that Europe has become an immigration country. We need immigrants for our economy and people are keen to move to Europe to work.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore actually staggering that we do not seem to manage to agree on an actual common European immigration policy, and I hope that the report, which I hope we will adopt tomorrow, will be a first step in that direction. On the one hand, it should be possible for asylum seekers, refugees, as well as people who are persecuted, to find shelter here, but on the other hand, we must have legal instruments in place for labour immigrants, in which the requirements of the labour market play a major role. We can regard this as a win-win situation, since we, as well as the immigrants, stand to benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">As for mass regularisation, that is, of course, a dreadful dilemma. We recognise on the one hand the risk of attracting more illegal immigrants, but on the other hand, we cannot turn our backs on the dismal situation of illegal workers. I would therefore urge both large groups in this House to endorse paragraph 15, because it actually covers both aspects very well.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Green Card proposal, I would like to say to Mrs Klamt that the amendment tabled by us clearly refers to a European Green Card model, which need not bear a resemblance to the US model at all. There is also the Canadian model, for example, to draw on, so we can develop our own.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the right to vote, I know that it is a sensitive issue, but it forms an essential part of actual immigration. Surely it is indispensable to any serious discussion about full participation in social, economic and political life.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, all European citizens should of course get freedom of movement right now, and, while I am on that subject, I should like to congratulate Commissioner Frattini, who I clearly heard indicate his intention of supporting this initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We forget that in this debate. It is true that the economic situation in some countries of origin may well push people to move, which raises questions about our external policies, our trade policies. After all, the GATT agreements give service providers the right to move. But people also come here for the benefit of their CVs, because they can earn good money and because we want skilled workers.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to non-documented migrants, we have been told that they come because of the draw of illegal work. In that case, many of our Member States are absolutely complicit in that. We know of major construction projects that have been built with the assistance of undocumented migrant labour, for example, and the Commissioner is absolutely right, these people are attractive because they are cheap and they have no rights. To establish legal, simple, flexible channels for migrant labour and employers is extremely important. The green card and the job seeker’s visa, which we talked about last time we discussed this, are very good ways forward, as would be assistance for the implementation of existing labour standards by our governments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should, however, like to emphasise one point. The Green Paper states that between now and 2030 Europe will need a further 20 million immigrant workers in order to maintain our current economic standards and to make up for the population decline. The nub of the question is this: will these 20 million immigrants be regular workers or not? Do we want them to remain illegal or do we want to regularise their situations and incorporate them into a healthy labour market? That is the problem we have to face.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, since the measures used so far to curb illegal immigration over the years have driven it underground, a residence permit for jobseekers and the right to vote are the best way to ensure that these 20 million workers will work in Europe legally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One can only hope that this right will be respected in the future. I look forward to the day when we will have a common immigration policy, but is the European Union currently ready to accept immigrants from all over the world? Europe’s labour market is still not open to its new citizens, and the new Member States that will join the EU in the near future have high levels of unemployment. Experience has taught us that immigrants from non-Christian countries integrate poorly into Europe, despite the best efforts of the countries receiving them. This begs the question of whether it would not be preferable to hire workers from Eastern Europe to fill any vacancies, and to provide needy countries in the south with aid that is both effective and much more generous than to date.

<p class="contents">The best way of implementing a genuinely effective immigration policy that is actually accepted by the citizens is by means of a balanced approach, and that is precisely what Mrs Klamt has proposed. The notions of, on the one hand, accepting everybody and, on the other, building up the myth of zero immigration, are neither realistic nor particularly responsible. It is high time that Europe addressed immigration calmly, frankly and humanely. Let us not wait for further tragedies before addressing the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no longer conceivable for each Member State to implement its own immigration policy in its own backyard. No State can take such decisions alone. What Europe needs is a truly global, common and coherent approach. Working together, we must try to establish partnerships with countries of origin and transit in order to manage migratory flows and the acceptance of migrants. We must be realistic. We will not solve the problem by building walls and barbed wire – reminding us of previous eras – by strengthening border policies or by building reception and detention centres. These men and women come to Europe not to have fun, but to survive and to feed their families.</p>
<p class="contents">The real problem is the difference between our continent and the countries of origin in terms of development and living standards. The EU must take action to bridge this gap by means of a genuine co-development policy, which entails financing projects to encourage migrants to stay in their countries in decent living conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The second crucial point is that common measures must be put in place regarding legal immigration. Short-term, piecemeal responses, such as mass regularisation, are not the answer. Take Spain, for example, which recently regularised 700 000 people, and which is now experiencing the biggest bombardment of immigrants in its history. That is not the answer. It is one possible answer, but only if backed up by a genuine common policy, based on both justice and security, enabling the harmonious regulation of migratory flows.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Europe is equipped with specialised structures and financial means. The time has come to end the interminable rhetoric and to take action. We can no longer stand by as human beings die simply because they wanted to come to our countries for a better life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A series of regularisations has helped to put an end to illegal work, a phenomenon that stops all workers from enjoying the benefits of the law. The practice of keeping in the country people who have no rights, whose situation is extremely precarious, who are reduced to feeding the profitable illegal work market or who succumb to crime inevitably poses social, moral and legal questions.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a whole raft of reasons why migrants resort to leaving their country of origin, but they do so mainly for economic and social reasons. I feel it is worthwhile at this point to mention the four principles drawn up at Tampere, which should be the best way of controlling migratory flows and of addressing the current economic and demographic challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">The first principle is a comprehensive approach to the management of migratory flows, so as to find a balance between humanitarian and economic admission and the fight against illegal immigration. The second is fair treatment for third country nationals, ensuring, as far as possible, comparable rights and obligations to those of nationals of the Member State concerned. The third principle is developing partnerships with countries of origin in the management of flows, including policies of co-development. The fourth is a common asylum policy across all EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with a rise in populist fears of foreigners, many people are concerned that the common approach to immigration may take on a dangerously repressive hue. We know all too well that policy of this nature is not the way to tackle these problems. If anything, it has the potential to exacerbate them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
