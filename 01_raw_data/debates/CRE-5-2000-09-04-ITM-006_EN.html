<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Valdivielso de Cué (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, certain circumstances could have justified postponing this report to a time when everything was available, including the amendments. However, in any event, I believe that we, as MEPs, must take the work forward so that the MEDA report is not delayed at any time, with the resulting harm that that could mean for the countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Having expressed these reservations, I shall summarise the MEDA programme. I shall then give my opinion of the proposed regulation, as well as the report as a whole. As is well known, the MEDA programme comes within the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, which was created after the Barcelona declaration of November 1995. The Foreign Affairs Ministers of the European Union participated in that meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an initiative which encompasses 27 countries from both sides of the Mediterranean. On the one side, there are the 15 states of the Union and, on the other, Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey and the Palestinian territories. As for Libya, for obvious reasons, it only has observer status.</p>
<p class="contents">Our main objective, through this cooperation, is to forge links, especially in the numerous areas of common interest which we share with our Mediterranean neighbours. To this end, around EUR 3 500 million have been invested over the last five years, shared between two broad cooperation formulae: bilateral and regional. Specifically, this economic and financial aid must facilitate the completion of a free trade area by 2010, to which end aid programmes have been implemented, both for macroeconomic reforms and for sectoral reforms and structural adjustments.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remember that the ratio between the per capita income of the European Union and the MEDA countries is 1 to 10, that is to say a very considerable gap. Therefore, in my judgement, it is logical that the sustainable economic development of the area should be our main goal. In this regard, I must add that the commercial balance between these two blocks favours the European Union to the tune of EUR 21 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, measures are also being considered to facilitate private investment in these 12 countries, which in 1994 amounted to EUR 3 500 million, particularly by means of updating legislation and administration, as well as by means of meetings between companies belonging to the MEDA countries and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also remember that we are discussing an area of the world which is particularly affected by military conflict. There is no point in listing the different wars being waged by many of the countries which are members of this partnership. The MEDA programme seeks to clear the way towards a definitive and lasting peace in that part of the world by means, amongst other things, of economic stability. We are talking about a population of around 230 million people which, given the current rate of growth, will reach 300 million in 10 or 12 years time. There is a significant diversity of religions and traditions in all of those countries and this is one of the pillars on which the European Union’s work is based.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, MEDA also includes a short- and medium-term action programme for the environment, which aims to reverse the current environmental deterioration in the area.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to an analysis of the Commission’s proposal, I think the proposal as a whole is insufficient, partly because of the criticisms made about the implementation of this programme. The Commission principally defines three initiatives for achieving greater efficiency: on the one hand, making the decision-making process more dynamic, focussing the activity of the “MED Committee” on strategic planning and programming. The national and regional funding plans will be adopted annually on the basis of indicative programmes. It also proposes an increase in programming and implementation abilities, for which greater human resources must be provided. Lastly, the Commission intends to scale down procedures in order to achieve more effective implementation and increase the percentage of programmes that are implemented. Specifically, the intention is to develop common harmonised procedures for all aid programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to say that I believe this report is important because anything that helps the countries to the south of us, in turn, helps us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are now presenting the first progress report, or annual report for 1998, but which, in fact, summarises the initial implementation period, 1996-1999, and prepares the way for the implementation of the actions for the second period, 2000-2006, in the form of the regulation proposed by our fellow Member, Mr Valdivielso de Cué. Given that this report is subject to the Hughes Procedure, we have included all the proposals adopted unanimously not only by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which was chiefly responsible, but also those of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">The context is this: approximately EUR 4 billion over the last four years, plus the considerable appropriations contributed by the EIB, have been allocated. The Barcelona Agreement signed by 27 countries, those of the European Union plus the 12 countries of the southern Mediterranean: Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey. The three main objectives involve the political and security dimension, the economic and financial dimension and the social, cultural and human dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">The following observations have been made: this is a programme still in its infancy which has experienced implementation problems and has suffered from various administrative problems, as highlighted by the European Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control. There has been particular criticism of sub-contracting associations such as RTM. In the final analysis, implementation has been virtually paralysed and, despite the almost 100% commitment of appropriations, only 26 % have been paid to date, and that only with difficulty, with payment taking, on average, four years.</p>
<p class="contents">We presented the ins and outs of the matter in sufficient detail in our report, so I am now able simply to summarise our conclusions, which are as follows: firstly, there is a need to simplify the regulation in order to enable the process to be speeded up, while ensuring greater transparency by providing the resources necessary for the Commission to plan the programme and for the Council to monitor it. Above all, the European Parliament must take part in the process and must be kept informed more regularly, particularly through the Euro-Mediterranean forum.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be appropriate to speed up the signing of the association agreements, which to date have been signed only with 7 countries. This particularly concerns Lebanon, Algeria, Syria, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, project selection must be more democratic and must, to a greater extent, involve greater participation by civil society and NGOs, who continually expressed this desire, especially at the European Parliament round table held in Brussels on 29 June this year, entitled ‘Towards a sustainable MEDA’.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, respect for human rights must be monitored more carefully, for cooperation is not only targeted at economic progress, but is fundamentally related to democracy, freedom, peace, the eradication of inequality, and sustainable development. We would therefore ask that a report on the human rights record of each of the signatory or candidate countries be presented to Parliament annually to be taken into consideration in the selection of projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we consider that the 10% of appropriations allotted to regional cooperation are inadequate as compared with the 90% allocated to bilateral cooperation. We must therefore comment on the volume of appropriations dedicated to regional schemes which, we acknowledge, are harder to negotiate and implement but which correspond to the objective of efficiency, particularly in improving South-South relations and, above all, in safeguarding more extensive action for decentralised cooperation, which we all consider to be an important goal.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, on the subject of the six priority areas of partnership, the environment, water policy, industry, energy, transport and the information society, we think it essential to reactivate programmes disregarded until now, the SMAP adopted in Helsinki in 1997 on the environment. At least EUR 10 million must be allocated annually for water. Action must be undertaken to promote renewable energies and to provide support for SMEs and for transport. We should support each country’s sustainable development plans.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore consider it absolutely essential to implement the proposals for regulations suggested by Mr Valdivielso de Cué, particularly those on simplifying procedures in order to increase the transparency, efficiency and speed of payments and on deploying more Commission staff in order to ensure better administration of the programme, which must cease to be a poor relation in comparison with the cooperation programmes for Asian or ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point I should like to thank not only the many participants, particularly the countries concerned and the NGOs that helped me to finalise this report, but also our European Commissioner, Mr Patten, who has a clear overview of the situation and whose external relations departments should contribute towards improving Mediterranean projects from now on.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks, too, to Mr Patten’s colleagues, especially Mr Patrick Laurent. I should also like to stress the interest which Commissioner Busquin has taken in our work, reactivating Mediterranean cooperation in the field of research, particularly at the forthcoming informal summit on Capri, on 29 September. Thanks are also due to all our fellow Members of Parliament, particularly Mrs Terrón, Mrs McNally and Mr Sami Naïr who are working on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial to implement our proposals in order to achieve the necessary revitalisation of the Euro-Mediterranean process. Above all, the appropriations for 2000-2006 should not be penalised because of the programme’s earlier problems. Instead the programme must be the spearhead of our policy, which we shall be discussing again at the Marseilles Conference in November.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish the French Presidency every success. I know that they are extremely concerned to resolve all difficulties and determined to achieve their objectives.</p>

The points which were missing from the Commission proposal and which were added by Mr Valdivielso de Cué are important ones.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Mr Valdivielso de Cué added, and I congratulate him on this, a fundamental idea, namely the need to make a real commitment to the Mediterranean by granting this region aid comparable with that granted to the countries of Eastern Europe. The countries of the South, rightly or wrongly, have the impression that they have been rather overlooked, even though everyone knows that the Mediterranean is one of the most sizeable divided regions existing in the world today.</p>
<p class="contents">The second idea which was restored was the harnessing of financial resources that were adequate to the challenges. Reference was also made to the overall approach defined in Barcelona (and not just, as the Commission thinks, the structural adjustment dimension), the intensification of regional cooperation, particularly South-South relations, the importance of decentralised cooperation (contrary to the wishes of the Commission which would apparently like to do away with it), the maintenance of support for micro-projects, i.e. for NGOs and civil associations and the need to finance initiatives for industrial cooperation, particular for SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Valdivielso de Cué has done excellent work on all these points. I do, however, feel that one fundamental matter, immigration, has not been sufficiently taken into account by this proposal for a regulation. The Commission’s proposal looks at the question of migration from a strictly negative point of view. They make a very serious connection, and I say this weighing my words carefully, drawing a parallel in the very same indent between, on the one hand, the campaign (which I consider to be legitimate and necessary) against illegal immigration and in favour of repatriation and, on the other hand, the fight against drug-trafficking and international crime. This intolerable attitude is an insult to the millions of immigrant workers who contribute to the wealth of Europe. A distinction has been made, as I requested, but it is still insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the time has come to consider a genuine policy of movement between the two sides of the Mediterranean, north and south. Europe must, I feel, today establish a genuine co-development policy related to migratory flows, which should, Mr President, centre on a few simple proposals, such as the framing of aid policies for projects by migrants, devising instruments for channelling the savings of immigrants, the placement of students in training and the placement of young trainees. Voting in favour of the amendment I have tabled would therefore, I feel, be a contribution towards giving immigrants legally resident in Europe the opportunity to be acknowledged as vectors of co-development for their country of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me, in conclusion, quote Mr Prodi who said that immigration must become a factor in development. Mr Valdivielso’s work has gone some way to achieving this, and I would like to see us go further still. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this respect it is critically important that the funding should be properly applied.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge the House to support the two amendments tabled to the Piétrasanta report in the name of this group. As a member of Parliament's delegation to the Mashreq countries and Gulf States, I am concerned that the association agreements with these countries should be ratified as expeditiously as possible; the Jordanian agreement in particular is only slowly proceeding through the ratification process. Our amendment urges the Member State parliaments which have not yet ratified the agreement to hasten this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Our other amendment refers to a degree of hypocrisy in our approach to developing a fully free-trade zone in the Mediterranean area. As Mr Valdivielso pointed out in his speech, the EU has a large trade surplus with this area. Yes, we call for a free-trade zone but when it comes to those products which these countries could most readily export into Europe – i.e. agricultural and food products – we maintain trade restrictions. Our friends in these countries understandably question our sincerity. I accept that free access to Europe for Mediterranean products poses problems for producers in our southern Member States, but surely this problem could be compensated at least to some extent in the CAP. So our second amendment calls for the acceleration of progress to free trade for all products including food and agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">I would appreciate the Commission's estimate as to the likely timing for achieving a full free-trade zone in the Mediterranean and how it intends to implement this. I would urge my colleagues to support these amendments along with the two excellent reports under consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The deep schism that divides the Mediterranean world is obvious. The Conference of Barcelona was the European Union’s reaction to it. We should now be working at a steady speed to achieve the aims established there, but that is not the case. Many reasons have been given for this. The MEDA programmes have always been surrounded by too much fuss, and they still are. It is totally pointless to return dwell on this fuss. I prefer to look forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has proposed a new MEDA regulation and in it asks us for speedier decision-making procedures. We agree absolutely with this. My group and Parliament – if we reflect the vote of the relevant committee – proposes to place more trust in the Commission so that it may decide on projects of less than EUR 5 million and we also ask that the Commission be accompanied by a Council advisory committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the Council and Parliament cannot expect the Commission to do things which they do not give it the power to do. In this regard you have our support, Commissioner. You also have our support – and this is expressed in the amendments we are tabling – in order to solve any problems relating to staffing and to management ability that you may have. I would like to remind you, Commissioner, that the Barcelona agreements talk about an area of free trade and economic cooperation and of security and they also talk a great deal about the cultural and human dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I believe that in order to develop these three pillars on an equal footing with one another, we must continue to show our confidence in Mediterranean society and, far from ending decentralised cooperation and small projects, we should implement these effectively and by incorporating all the players: entrepreneurs, unions, cities, NGOs, immigrants – as Mr Naïr pointed out – professionals etc.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to believe that we share the aim of reducing the gulf between the, at least two, Mediterranean worlds. To this end, Commissioner, we ask, and my group will act in accordance with this request in the budgetary debate, for the restoration in the regulation of the amounts allocated to MEDA, so that these will remain at least equal in real terms to those allocated during the previous period. While the problems in the Mediterranean remain serious, and there has been considerable delay in implementing the Barcelona decisions that were designed to tackle them, we cannot accept a reduction in investment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I must admit that there are certain reservations in our group with regard to future budgetary proposals as a result of the difficulties which have arisen up until now in the employment of funds intended for the MEDA programme.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this issue would lead us into a discussion of the budget, which is not the main subject of this debate. The main subject of this debate is political and the issue is the fact the Mediterranean is one of the essential elements in ensuring the peace, stability and progress of the European Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Eliminating tension and promoting balanced development in the Mediterranean third countries leads to greater security, prosperity and prospects for the European Union. Therefore, Mediterranean policy must be a fundamental pillar of the Union’s external action, which will benefit the European Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I believe that we must consider that officially, there are at least three Mediterranean candidate countries, and that, with regard to the conflicts which Mr Valdivielso has mentioned, the European Union has made a very significant contribution in recent years to solving them. We are very close to reaching peace agreements to solve them definitively and this obviously requires a significant economic contribution for which MEDA is the main financial instrument. The different aspects mentioned in each report must be taken into account because they make a wonderful contribution to achieving this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report also condemns the fundamental political imbalance between structural adjustment measures and free-trade measures and the other dimensions of the partnership (social, cultural and democratic).</p>
<p class="contents">Such obvious imbalances stack up, distancing us from the objectives of peace, democracy and sustainable development contained in the Barcelona Declaration. The case of Tunisia, signatory to the first association agreement and the first recipient of appropriations, is an edifying one. In an increasingly overt way, the international partners delight in describing countries involved in harsh repression and widespread corruption, where increasing social instability prevails, as stable and successful.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be wondering whether accelerated economic liberalisation, in the guise of free trade, is not an aggravating factor in this deterioration. Democracy and respect for human rights must not continue to be officially declared theoretical principles which are ignored in practice. Is respect for these principles compatible with the repatriation of illegal residents even though this represents the very success ...</p>

The difficulties in setting it up, the impatience and even the disappointments it has caused our southern partners should nevertheless encourage us to look more deeply into the state of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The southern Mediterranean countries need European aid, aid that demonstrates solidarity and which contributes to the development of their society. This aid must also reduce the disparities between the two sides of the Mediterranean, by putting an end to the existing relationship of economic domination, the most obvious and most unfair example of which is perhaps the system maintaining national debt. What role does MEDA have to play in this? With more than EUR 3 billion in commitment appropriations for 1995-1999, MEDA I actually committed just over EUR 2 billion in its first four years and actually paid out EUR 553 million, or scarcely a quarter of the credits committed. What a discrepancy between the aid promised and the aid actually provided! This discrepancy is largely due to the fact that, as Mr Patten has often told us, the Commission lacks the human resources to deal with all the tasks that are assigned to it.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that I will not be the last person to call for further human resources if that will enable the European Union to shoulder its responsibilities. The Commission proposals, moreover, are aimed at simplifying and speeding up procedures under the new regulation, even though removing from the outset individual States’ ability to supervise projects would not necessarily be the best solution to achieve greater transparency. More credit should be provided for smaller-scale projects. Too frequently I meet people who have extensive experience of the local association movement, who feel let down by the procedures they have to follow in order to receive subsidies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Euro-Mediterranean partnership can only really be built by and for the general public, who themselves wish to achieve a partnership that is of real benefit to all citizens. The MEDA programme also raises fundamental questions about our Euro-Mediterranean policy in general. First and foremost, cooperation is concentrated essentially in the economic and financial dimensions and marginalises the social and cultural dimensions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also time that we took greater account of the growing dissatisfaction with the practices of out-and-out free trade. The social consequences we are seeing in the free trade area are cause for deep concerns, which cannot be ignored. The social budgets of southern countries risk seeing the budgetary resources raised from customs duties cut to a dangerous level. The growth in competition could eat away at the industrial fabric of these countries, which in some cases consists of vulnerable small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than so-called ‘accompanying’ measures, the economic systems in the South need real technological support. The purpose of aid, furthermore, should be not only to convert businesses to comply with the criteria of profitability, but also to respond to the employment needs of the population. While private sector development is heavily supported by MEDA, the public sector is largely forgotten, even though it responds to genuine needs.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to concentrate on two aspects of the reports which I support: really encouraging the participation…</p>

In concrete terms: the laborious and monumental undertaking of EU enlargement simply does not allow for a similar tour de force within the European-Mediterranean partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">That is certainly not to say that there is no room for improvement in the Union’s Mediterranean policy as matters stand. An evaluation of MEDA I and the wording of MEDA II clearly demonstrate the need for this. In particular, this programme lacks cohesion and has been insufficiently implemented. For example, to date, only a quarter of the commitment appropriations has been paid out.</p>
<p class="contents">It is right that a streamlining of the programmes and implementation should be proposed with a view to resolving the aforementioned shortcomings. The sluggish pace of implementation is not the fault of the committees, in any case. They are responsible for a delay of five months at most. No, it is the procedures within the Commission that are largely to blame for the delay. Giving the Commission more financial latitude is not, therefore, the most obvious solution worthy of recommendation. Transparency and control are important aspects that will enhance the quality of MEDA projects. And the standard of quality required varies from project to project to this day.</p>
<p class="contents">It would appear from the conclusions of the European Council of Feira (19 and 20 June 2000) that the EU’s Mediterranean policy is founded on ‘the partnership’. I will quote in full from this document: “this partnership should be actively supported by both sides”. Cooperation with a view to becoming good neighbours, increasing prosperity and eliminating poverty, and, not least, promoting good government and the constitutional state. May these reports and this debate help to realise these lofty ambitions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I share the view that enlargement of the Union to the East is causing us to underestimate the South and the crucial nature – crucial for our future, that is – of our relations with these countries. We have been working in this area for almost ten years and for the last five, the significant MEDA programme has been available to us.</p>
<p class="contents">The way this programme has been implemented is far from ideal – to say the least – and that is why I share and approve of the objectives of the Commission reform. That is also why I support the calls made by Mr Valdivielso and Mr Piétrasanta to redress the balance, for regional cooperation, for support for ‘micro-projects’ and for projects involving civil society. It must, however, be clearly stated – and also made clear to the general public – that the financial objectives must match up to our speeches and there should be no question of accepting a reduction in credits relative to the previous period. This holds true whatever arguments and quibbles are put forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, looking beyond MEDA, we must not lose sight of the urgency of the problem of cancelling the debts of poor countries, the need to speed up the implementation of bilateral agreements and the need to promote new multilateral agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, we must therefore improve the systems that are already in place. Above all, however, we must ensure that the proposals that have already been made, the positions that are adopted in our debates and the way we vote tomorrow are not seen and perceived by our Mediterranean partners as just so many negative messages. There is a serious risk of this, and, if we wish to maintain a political presence, in the region, in conflict management and risk prevention, we must do more and better in the future than we have done in the recent past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The economic boom in Far East Asia has changed all the parameters, and the Mediterranean Sea has become an important element in international trade, assuming major importance. Trade and cultural relations have to be given priority for economic reasons; a cooperation process needs to be set in motion, but the development of countries which are developing at a slower rate than Western countries also needs to be promoted. There must be political and commercial dialogue and cultural and financial cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what is important for the development of relations between the European Parliament and the countries of this area of the world. The Mediterranean Sea is the testing ground for the European Parliament’s capacities to act outside the borders of the Union.

These regions must be able to prosper on the basis of their own potential. That is why it is so important to have local sub-offices that can pursue this dialogue with universities, NGOs and local authorities. That is preferable to having expensive technical assistance offices, and is also preferable to the divide and rule policy of the governments, who often put their own interests first, whereas we regard MEDA as an instrument for peace and democratisation and not just for economic well-being. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is obvious that the main instrument of the MEDA-Euro Mediterranean programme is a programme of tremendous benefit to the whole of the EU. In the same way, we should recognise that cohesion between the Union’s central and northern regions and the neighbouring regions should be strengthened by means of a comprehensive solution similar to the MEDA Programme. New initiatives to support cohesion policy, such as the Union’s northern dimension that stepped into the limelight during the Finnish presidential term, must also be seen as important projects for the Union as a whole, especially with regard to the challenges of eastward enlargement. It is encouraging to see that, after a long period of twisting and turning, appropriations have been set aside in next year’s budget for the northern dimension. It would be good to move on from here. We need an enormous amount of additional financing, however, to be able to guarantee, in particular, the future of the small-scale programmes to strengthen cooperation with neighbouring regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The objectives of the MEDA programme were unfortunately not realised in the financial period that has just ended. For various reasons, there have been problems with the implementation of appropriations, and the monitoring arrangements to prevent misappropriation have proven inadequate. The European Parliament should concentrate on ensuring that the under-use of resources that has gone on for years should come to a stop and the internal monitoring of programmes made more effective. This cannot be guaranteed merely by swelling administration. Cooperation between the Commission and the agencies that implement programmes in the Member States must also be able to be made more effective through other means, for example, through water-tight cooperation between the European Investment Bank and the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is that I should like to thank both rapporteurs for their reports, which were well worth reading. Secondly, I should like to say directly to the Commission: stick to your guns, stick to your guns with the Council! Because the real problem is that the Council, that the Member States, are forever wanting to have their say on a matter which the Treaty says is your responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Just imagine that the Americans had implemented their aid under the Marshall Plan after the war in such a way that for each sub-programme they had asked the Member States of the USA whether they, for example, ought to fund a reforestation project in the south-western part of Bavaria or not! It would probably have taken until the end of the last century to disburse the Marshall Plan aid. This is not what I want to happen to you. Mr Patten, stick to your guns! Parliament ought to support you on this. The Council or the Member States have a right to be consulted, but they do not have a right to co-decision. I suspect that this will also be the decisive issue for the Commission when history judges it one day. You will be judged on enlargement towards the east, but also on whether you create your own room for manoeuvre in external policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we are not demanding a voice for the Commission alongside the United Kingdom or France on nuclear capabilities for example. But where the budget is concerned, the European Union's own budget, you are the executive. We should secure this position and defend it! In Parliament you should have an ally here! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The MEDA programme, which largely failed in the first stage, perhaps did not appreciate that the situation of the Mediterranean countries, given the direction that European politics are taking, is extremely difficult. Many Mediterranean countries are less highly developed than other countries, and they face the threat of a single agricultural market, which they will not be able to cope with. In this respect, I would like to refer to the wonderful article by Mr Riccardi of two or three months ago, in which he spoke specifically of the fact that, for reasons of scale, the Mediterranean countries do not attract investment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is extremely difficult in those countries to change the agricultural system and, nevertheless, they have to share their products with other countries of North Africa, of the <span class="italic">mare nostrum</span>, which belongs to everyone at the same time. Meanwhile the greatest migratory impact originates from these countries. Therefore, we must have a fair policy, and to this end the MEDA programme may be a start, although I believe that, in many cases, it is based on criteria that are important to the northern countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it is not possible to set up a project without highlighting the great weaknesses of those countries such as, for example, water and desertification. What European policies do we have to combat desertification? We have no clear policy on this issue. Secondly, as far as culture is concerned, more importance is being attached to intermediaries than to the actual beneficiaries and producers of culture. The same thing is happening with many other industrial projects. Numerous NGOs have been created, forming networks with no obvious beneficiaries, when what southern Europe really has to do is wake up.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore support a process of industrialisation based on innovation – we must not turn to the old industries but to innovation – and of supporting projects relating to technological innovation and training. In this respect, I believe it is a mistake to turn to large projects. They would simply make a few people richer. What Mediterranean Europe needs is to wake up, to leave behind its self-absorption and to exploit its own human resources. This will only happen if we support multiple initiatives which together create awareness, a critical mass and a basic system so that, on that basis, many other small initiatives and businesses of all types may be created. Some will be successful and some will fall by the wayside, but if we do not create a policy of multiple initiatives of many types, allowing society to express itself and take advantage of its resources, we will not achieve anything. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Mediterranean’s location as a major geographical point in terms of the stability and security of our continent has already been mentioned. This is all very well, but there is another issue underlying many of the points made in Mr Valdivielso’s report: a gap is forming between the absolute priority status of enlargement and the development of relations with the Mediterranean countries, which gives cause for concern. The Mediterranean is, in actual fact, an area which is still marked by zones of real poverty, and it is an area where the standard of living and quality of life are such as to require a major European presence.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever we are able to do to boost development of the private sector, to improve the conditions under which small and medium-sized enterprises operate, to modernise infrastructures and encourage the promotion of investments, industrial cooperation and trade, will be gratefully received, for hitherto there has been no support for the economic and production networks of the partner countries and industrial cooperation has played an extremely minor role due to the lack of direct support programmes and joint initiatives between European companies and partner countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we need simpler administration, a more strategic approach and rapid execution of programmes, for this might actually benefit the small and medium-sized enterprises rather than consultancy firms or financial brokers.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end with a reference to the agricultural sector. The establishment of a free-trade area in the Mediterranean is, of course, a goal to strive towards, but first we must analyse carefully the plight of Mediterranean agriculture and Mediterranean farmers, and, before we do anything else, we must use the common agricultural policy to rectify an extremely dangerous drop in the income levels of our farmers in precisely the poorest area of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span><span class="bold">.</span> – I am extremely pleased to be able to comment on these two important reports on one of the most significant programmes for which we are responsible. It is clearly going to be a considerable political test for the Commission and for our whole partnership to try to ensure that we deliver more successfully on these programmes in the future than we have managed to do so far.</p>
<p class="contents">I thought that Mr Linkohr made some extremely pertinent and challenging points. We will be coming back to that, not least when we have the opportunity of discussing the letter which the Commission will be addressing to the budgetary authority as a letter of rectification to the 2001 Budget, which will go right to the heart of the real resource problem we face, which creates so many political difficulties for us.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me comment first on Mr Valdivielso's report before dealing with Mr Piétrasanta's report. Naturally, I welcome the fact – though I do not think his speech was quite so enthusiastic – that Mr Valdivielso's report is generally supportive of the Commission's efforts to reform the MEDA Regulation, though there are some criticisms. Mr Piétrasanta's report is also favourable towards the 1998 MEDA Programme report. I want to stress that the revision of the MEDA Regulation is a key element in the broader efforts we are making to enable us to deliver aid more effectively and to streamline our often excessively onerous procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's objective in revising the MEDA Regulation is to streamline the decision-making process so that we can deliver assistance promptly, in line with the political priorities of the European Union in the Mediterranean. The Commission proposes to reduce excessive scrutiny arrangements for individual projects in the Management Committee by introducing strategic programmes through the yearly adoption of national financing plans and a regional financing plan and simplifying decision making.</p>
<p class="contents">The simplifications that we have requested would bring MEDA programming procedures in line with those of other financial instruments of EU external relations programmes. It makes no sense to treat MEDA differently.</p>
<p class="contents">I must underline that the Commission cannot hope to improve the implementation of the programme if it remains paralysed by cumbersome procedures. The approval of the new regulation will allow the Union to lend real support to the Mediterranean countries in their structural reform process. The economic growth of these countries is of key importance to their political and social stabilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also note that the firm commitment of the Mediterranean partners themselves to economic reform would greatly facilitate the implementation of the programme and would trigger a significant rise in its disbursement rate.</p>
<p class="contents">We have an absorption problem with some of our partners. It is difficult to spend the money as fast and as sensibly as we would like if we have not even agreed the Association Agreements, or to justify a situation in which we successfully negotiate an Association Agreement and then cannot get our partner to initial it. We all have to move faster if we are to make a greater success of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with the bulk of Parliament's amendments, particularly those which strengthen MEDA's strategic character. In that spirit, we can fully endorse Amendments Nos 2, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 17, 19, 20, 30, 33, 37 and 41 and we can partially accept Amendment Nos 4, 5, 6, 10, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 31, 35, 38 and 40 providing some slight verbal modifications. That may save me a bit of work if I am doing the votes later in the week.</p>
<p class="contents">However we cannot support Amendment No 25, which proposes an individual examination of financing proposals by the MED Committee. We think this is contrary to the spirit of our overall proposal on the revision of the MEDA Regulation, because we want to streamline and simplify procedures. We cannot accept Amendment No 13, which would seek to include a financial reference amount for the period 2000 to 2006 in the regulation since this would clearly prejudge the results of the budgetary procedure as has been agreed in the context of the Interinstitutional Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept Amendment No 21 which seeks the removal of direct budgetary support, nor Amendment No 27 on direct industrial cooperation and I should point out that the new enterprise policy of the Commission focuses on the improvement of the business climate rather than on direct tools of cooperation. In addition, the Commission at this stage lacks the necessary resources for proper industrial cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can we accept Amendment No 35 or part of Amendment No 40 on the expansion of decentralised cooperation so long as we do not have the necessary human resources to do the job in a responsible and effective way, but forms of decentralised cooperation will be pursued where possible within existing regional cooperation programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Now let me comment briefly on Mr Piétrasanta's report. I congratulate him and the other rapporteur, Mr Vandevielso, for the commitment and dedication which they have shown. Most of the views expressed in Mr Piétrasanta's report and in the amendments are wholly in line with the Commission's efforts to reform the MEDA programme and our overall objective of streamlining procedures and accelerating delivery of aid.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the plea regarding the simplification of MEDA's management procedures and the strengthening of its strategic and integrated approach. The report's appeal for an increase in Commission staff assigned to management of the MEDA programme is one we wholly support. Enough staff to do the job is one of the key principles underlying the Commission's efforts to reform its external assistance services. The increase will be, of course, pursued within the overall staff priorities of the Commission, and I note as well the report's request for the preparation of an annual report on human rights in the Mediterranean. We believe this is something for the Council and the Commission to consider together.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the proposals for reinforced South-South cooperation and for more programmes backing small and medium-sized enterprises. We are taking action on water management but we are not, I regret to say, in a position to support the micro-project proposals because again we lack the staff to manage them properly. They are extremely resource-intensive in terms of management.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be apparent from what I have said that we are thinking very much along the same lines. Our programmes in the Mediterranean are at the core of my agenda, along with the reinvigoration of the Barcelona process.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make two final points. First of all, I hope, the Commission will this week be agreeing a Commission communication on the revitalisation of the Barcelona process, which we will then, of course, wish to discuss with this Parliament. Our funding of programmes in the Mediterranean between now and 2006 is probably the largest of all our programmes representing over 20% of our efforts externally. My concern is that we should deliver that assistance more effectively and more rapidly.</p>
<p class="contents">I have told Parliament before of my surprise at the discovery that if we were to continue at the present rate of disbursement it would take us almost nine years to get through the backlog of our existing obligations in the Mediterranean. That is simply not tolerable. You cannot explain that to the people you are trying to help and it is very difficult to justify it to Europe's taxpayers. Instead of our programmes enhancing the reputation of the European Union in the Mediterranean countries and around the world, it damages our reputation even though we are using taxpayers' money to do good. So, the reform of programmes like MEDA goes right to the heart of what we are trying to do in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The other point I wanted to make is this: at the informal meeting we had in Evian at the weekend we spent over three hours talking about external assistance and how effectively we do things as a Union. I pay great tribute to the French Presidency for giving this issue the priority it has. The Commission raised the issue in May when I set out our external budget for the General Affairs Council, the first time the General Affairs Council had ever discussed the budget for external relations, and when we put forward our proposals for reforms, so I think the issue now has the political priority it deserves.</p>
<p class="contents">But we will be tested by what we do with MEDA and what we do in the Balkans and by how these programmes actually work on the ground. I cannot keep on coming back to this Parliament and saying we have terrible problems. Parliament, the Commission and the Council have to be able to show that we are making a difference. I hope that with the Parliament's understanding we will be able to ensure over the years ahead that our external programmes are as effective and rapid as we all want them to be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
