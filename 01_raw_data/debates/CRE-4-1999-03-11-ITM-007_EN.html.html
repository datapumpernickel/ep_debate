<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Paasilinna </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FI) </span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are here to discuss a Commission proposal to change the basic regulation governing the Community Customs Code. The Commission"s aim has been to simplify and rationalise the customs regulation, which is certainly justified, as it contains a total of 253 articles and innumerable subparagraphs and repeals at least 28 legal instruments in use before the regulation came into force. This jungle of legislation has sprouted such an impenetrable thicket of clauses and paragraphs that presumably only a few people in the Union have a complete command of its content. However the proposal still does not manage to any significant extent to fulfill the Commission"s objectives to clarify the rules, which is unfortunate. To keep legislation complicated and abstruse is to wield power: when people are unable to understand laws they must obey, power falls into the hands of those professionally equipped to interpret the law. As Parliament will not now approve all the proposals, the matter will obviously be dealt with later by the Conciliation Committee, possibly while Finland holds the presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The Customs Code has a significant impact on Community trade policy, especially agricultural policy, where traditional agricultural taxation has in fact become customs duty. The Code likewise affects indirect taxation, because it is still used to apply VAT to products imported from third countries. Furthermore, the rules affect Community anti‐fraud policy in the context of the transit system, as security factors have now been included in the rules to be applied. The Code is also a tool for compiling trade statistics, and it therefore affects statistics on foreign trade.</p>
<p class="contents">I have amended the Commission"s proposal concerning the use of data‐processing techniques for making customs declarations. My amendment has been approved by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, and I hope that it will also be approved here in the House. In my own country, as in many other Member States, it is important that the use of electronic customs declarations should be established once and for all, and accompanying documents should also not be submitted in paper form. Using electronic media will speed up the work of the customs authorities and make it more effective. One very serious problem in the European Union is that the customs authorities in the different Member States are still not in full, real‐time contact with one another. On the other hand, it would appear that our adversaries, that is to say the criminals, are quite capable of keeping in contact. I would therefore ask the Commission what stage the computerisation of the customs declaration system has reached, to make it less likely to be breached than is the case today. With customs clearance, as with electronic commerce, for example, the parallel churning out of hard‐copy documentation is harming the electronic system and preventing its development as part of the move towards rationalisation, efficiency and sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">I also did not agree with the Commission"s proposal in relation to Article 5 on direct and indirect representation to customs agents. According to estimates, this would mean that some twenty thousand customs agents would lose their jobs, and, furthermore, there would be less reliability and more fraud, especially in southern Member States. The committee agreed with me on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask you to look especially closely at Amendment No 13. I still propose the addition of a new Article 1(21a), as supported by my group in my original proposal. It relates to the ultimate origin of goods in relation to preferential status, and the question of <span class="italic">bona fide </span> operations. In it I propose that if a certificate issued by the authorities of a non‐member country proves to be incorrect, no tax penalty should be imposed solely on the importer acting in good faith. My proposed amendment will make the situation easier for labour‐intensive SMEs, especially, and will allow the risk to be distributed. It was a close result, but the committee voted to grant extremely broad protection to the importer, with the consequence that the Community, to which revenue is due, would have to bear the whole risk rather than it being fairly distributed. Now I have discovered that Mrs Peijs, who tabled Amendment No 9 which was approved by the committee, is withdrawing it, so we can now support this new article which I have just described and which is, I believe, a sufficiently good compromise between the Commission"s proposal and Mrs Peijs"s amendment. If the Community loses resources as a result of criminal activity, it is obviously always the taxpayers in the Member States who will have to make good the shortfall in the end. For this reason the Community must have the means to intervene in criminal operations or abuse on the part of exporters and the authorities in exporting countries.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ferrer </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on External Economic Relations. – (ES)</span> Mr President, the Community Customs Code is instrumental in the Union"s commercial policy and is an essential tool in completing the internal market and in protecting the EU"s financial interests. There is no doubt that we must continue to revise customs regulations and procedures and to adapt them to the new situations that arise. In this way, we will eliminate possible judicial or procedural gaps.</p>
<p class="contents">If there is a new situation that emphasises the need to amend the present Code, then it is without doubt the gradual growth of the Community"s trade. This growth is due to the progressive opening up of the markets and developments in the information society. These are changes that require the Code to be updated with a view to simplifying and streamlining it so that it is more in step with the new realities. Therefore, the Committee on External Economic Relations welcomes the Commission"s proposal for amendment as it agrees with its philosophy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, its specific content is far removed from the measures proposed. The Commission realises that wanting to improve efficiency is not enough and that a better balance must also be guaranteed between the much‐needed simplification and modernisation of procedures it proposes and the fight against fraud. In fact, in the context of the gradual liberalisation of the markets and taking into account the system of preferences the Union has established with many third countries, and with the ACP countries in particular, it is all the more vital to have legal instruments available to help combat forgery and fraud. And we must also ensure that the rules of origin are applied, particularly where preferential and non‐preferential rules are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, and in view of the abolition of customs barriers between Member States due to the completion of the internal market, it is all the more essential to establish effective control measures that guarantee the uniform application of customs procedures throughout the Community. In this way, we will avoid any gaps that might encourage fraud and crime.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission"s text does not contain any proposals that take these aspects into consideration, aspects that could be of the utmost importance. To fill in the gaps, I have tabled two amendments, Amendment Nos 14 and 15, that include the conclusions of the opinion that the Committee on External Economic Relations approved unanimously. And I should like to bring these amendments to the attention of the House and the Commission and ask you to vote in favour of them.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, what we are discussing here is allowing goods declarations to be submitted in electronic form. Nonetheless, we are still maintaining the obligation – and I do mean the obligation – for all goods declarations that are submitted electronically to be accompanied by the relevant supporting documents, which may also be submitted in electronic form. In addition, we are discussing the idea that customs authorities must adopt control measures to guarantee the correct and uniform application of Community rules throughout the Union. It is only in doing this that we will be able to implement genuinely effective control measures to combat all fraud and forgery.</p>
<p class="contents">In accepting these amendments, we will not only send out an unmistakeable signal from the Union on the fight against fraud; we will also help improve the competitiveness of businesses and, as a result, promote economic growth and job creation within the Community.</p>

In our opinion, the Commission is seeking to transfer too many legislative powers to the committee. It is gratifying that both of our committees want to change that. Having said that, I should like to focus the remainder of my remarks on one point, a point which, in my view and in the view of the Committee on Budgetary Control, relates to an extremely serious problem. More than 50 % of all goods imported into the European Union are subject to what are known as preferential tariff arrangements. Certificates of origin must be presented for all these goods. There is undoubtedly a temptation to present false certificates with a view to paying as little customs duty as possible. These manipulations do not only defraud the Union of budgetary resources; they are naturally perpetrated at the expense of honest producers and importers too. When such manipulations occur, the Community Customs Code provides for the possibility of waiving the liability to customs duty if the exporter has been dealt with in good faith.</p>
<p class="contents">Two of the rapporteur's amendments – No 9 and No 13 – relate to this point. The Committee on Budgetary Control, though grateful for the adoption of several of its own amendments, feels that these two amendments run directly counter to its interests. They are formulated in excessively lax or generalised terms. If they were adopted with this wording, all importers or exporters – whether Amendment No 9 only refers to exporters and Amendment No 13 only to importers – would be able to assert that they had acted in good faith. That is too lax, it is too dangerous, especially since our fraud prevention unit UCLAF has to cover the entire European Union with only a small number of officials to investigate suspicious cases. The risk of being convicted for a false declaration is too slight.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore ask the rapporteur to reconsider his Amendments Nos 9 and 13 and to withdraw them if possible, otherwise he will be opening the doors to fraud on an even grander scale.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides, we have information that the Council and the Commission are working on a more precise form of wording to define what good faith is and what may not be regarded as good faith. The future blacklists may also be seen in connection with the certificates of origin. I therefore strongly recommend that Amendments Nos 9 and 13 should be reconsidered and, if possible, withdrawn. We cannot subscribe to them.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Rübig </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1997 alone, a total of ECU 13.6 million was collected in customs duties. That corresponds to 86.4 % of the Union's traditional own resources. It is a well‐known fact that customs duties constitute the only real tax revenue in the EU budget. The current debate on net contributors and recipients underlines the importance of applying the Community customs system effectively and efficiently. For that reason, we are very favourably disposed to the report before us. It must also be said, however, that legal stipulations naturally have to apply in equal measure to import checks and export checks. It is surely illogical to make a distinction.</p>
<p class="contents">The crux of the matter, however, concerns the liability for erroneous certification of the origin of a product. The question is whether the European importer or the exporter from outside the EU is liable for the appearance on a certificate of origin of false information resulting from an error by the overseas authorities. We believe that efforts should be made to introduce the proposed electronic procedures at an early date and to ensure that they are efficient and, above all, easy to set up, because to my mind the current proposal is too complicated. A distinction should also be made between sensitive goods and normal or mixed cargoes, because detailed checks are most probably impracticable in such cases.</p>
<p class="contents">It is conceivable that these mistakes could be caused by errors made by the exporting companies or by the authorities of non‐EU states, but they could also be the result of fraudulent transactions. That is why care should be taken to design forgery‐proof documents, to use rubber stamps with various unknown colours of ink, to introduce digital signatures and in particular to ensure that a note is made of the departure time of consignments and their destination, so that customs checks can reveal precisely when the goods left and where they were delivered and so that any discrepancies in the timings can be very efficiently investigated.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, for its part, is proposing that importers should only be held liable if they are found to be personally responsible in whole or in part for the production of false certificates of origin. If, however, the certificates of origin are falsified as a result of malpractice on the part of the exporter or the foreign authorities, any importer who has observed the rules must be excluded from liability. If we had a sensible set of rules, we could rid the trading system of an enormous additional burden. The importer must be able to rely on the authenticity of a certificate. It is up to the politicians to organise the system accordingly. It would be unreasonable to require importers to conduct their own investigations, particularly in cases where there is no reason to doubt the authenticity of the certificate.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Theonas </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, with a proposal that is incomprehensible and totally without foundation, the Commission is seeking to amend Article 5 of the Community Customs Code in a way that we believe will be the death knell for a sector which is already suffering unemployment and underemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted that in 1993, with the abolition of internal borders, this particular sector suffered job losses in excess of 80 or 85 %. The Commission is now proposing to abolish the alternative possibility available to each Member State to make its own choice between direct or indirect customs representation, according to its financial needs. This possibility was established several decades ago, it has stood the test of time, and it has been shown to function smoothly, since it gives each Member State the opportunity to take into account the particular aspects of its own customs area and to promote the proper, responsible, speedy and cost‐effective handling of customs operations.</p>
<p class="contents">The duties of customs agents demand technical expertise and require an in‐depth knowledge of customs legislation to enable customs agents to categorise goods according to their customs classification and to determine the level of duties and taxes. Because of the criteria for entry into the profession and the personal qualities required – professional ability, reliability and presence of mind – customs agents are now on a par with those who work in the customs authority. They contribute to combating fraud and help to ensure a swift flow of traffic through the timely release of goods. They also reduce the cost of storage and distribution of goods, to the benefit both of competitiveness and the smooth flow of external trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is invoking the argument of reduced competition and the infringement of the principle of freedom to provide services. However, this is an unfounded argument, because on the one hand, customs agents are self‐employed, they do not have a collective tariff, and they are in competition with each other. On the other hand, the users of customs services can either carry out the necessary formalities with the customs authorities themselves, or they can be represented by a method which, in accordance with national legislation, is not the sole prerogative of customs agents. The arguments deployed by the Commission are fanciful, untenable and arbitrary. There is not a single quantitative study to support its curious claims. The report by Mr Paasilinna, whom I congratulate on his work, convincingly refutes the claims of the Commission. We shall vote in favour of it.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Monti, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (IT)</span> Mr President, I should like to congratulate the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Paasilinna. The report shows that the customs union remains at the centre of the political debate: that should come as no surprise, because objectives such as the simplification of formalities, legal certainty for operators and safeguarding the Community's financial interests, on which everyone is agreed in theory, can still be viewed differently when it actually comes to applying them. I must also say that the debate has in addition been fuelled by a major problem of an institutional nature, one that threatens to deprive the Community, in the immediate future at least, of the drive for reform which is needed in relation to specific policies and, more particularly, the customs union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community Customs Code is one of the pillars – the most important of all – that will help secure uniform administrative action within the limits dictated by the principle of subsidiarity. Views can differ on this. As far as the Commission is concerned, achieving uniform administrative measures in relation to customs, to guarantee effectiveness and efficiency, frequently proves difficult, not only because of the limited resources available to the Commission but also, and above all, because the Member States remain sovereign with regard to the application of the Community rules. That is the result of an excessively rigid and formalistic interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity, as Parliament was able to see for itself in the debates on the Customs 2000 programme. I must add that, as a result of this situation, the Commission is frequently the butt of criticism, which is understandable but sometimes rather unfair, because it is alleged to be incapable of securing adequate customs controls. While it is true that expectations often exceed the possibilities open to the Commission, it should also at least be recognised that the Commission itself has to be given the instruments it needs to make the Customs Code into an effective framework, in particular by adopting implementing rules that are clear and effective, albeit in a very limited context. Only in the light of that framework, Mr President, is it possible to understand some of the differences in opinion that are emerging as we assess what the outcome of the process of amending the Customs Code should be.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to our position on the amendments, on Amendment No 1, the Commission is able to accept only that the limits set in some Member States for direct representation to be used to meet customs formalities should be compatible with the objectives of a single market. The Commission does, however, recognise that a period of transition may be needed; however, what I said a few moments ago means that we are unable to take on board Amendment No 11.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 2 does not pose any problem, and nor does the first part of Amendment No 3. However, there is one thing worrying the Commission: if it is left to the discretion of the Member States to decide whether the documents accompanying the customs declaration should be submitted to or merely kept at the disposal of the customs authorities, we may find administrative practice varying from one state to another. That part of Amendment No 3 is therefore not acceptable; on the other hand, Amendment No 14, which shares the same objective, cannot be accepted because it is irrelevant. In practice, the first part of that amendment reiterates what is contained in the current text of the code, and the second part is identical to the amendment put forward by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to Amendments Nos 4 to 8 and 12, which are linked to the reform of the economic conditions under the customs regimes, the Commission is able to accept Amendments Nos 6 and 12, but cannot set aside its proposal, as required under Amendment No 4. The Commission can, however, clarify the wording of its initial proposal. Amendments Nos 5 and 7 are unacceptable because they would prevent the Commission from getting rid of a bureaucratic obstacle when examining the economic conditions. Amendment No 8 fails to take account of the fact that the Commission has itself proposed deleting another provision: if both were deleted, we would be left with a clear legal vacuum; that amendment is therefore not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 9 and 13 concern the issue of the good faith of the economic operators. The Commission has followed closely the work of the House in this area and generally agrees with its objective, that is to say to find a solution which helps the importer by apportioning more equitably the risk that a certificate may not be valid. Amendment No 9 has been withdrawn, and the Commission would not, in any event, have been able to accept it. However, Amendment No 13 seems to us a better indicator of how to find a more appropriate and balanced solution to the problem of the responsibility of economic operators. In that sense, Amendment No 13 may be considered a positive contribution and, therefore, the Commission could accept it as the basis for a more extensive revision of Article 220. We therefore intend presenting, in the revised proposal following the vote in the House, a new version of Article 220 to provide a better balance between the responsibilities of importers, exporters, third country authorities and the Community customs authorities responsible for assessing whether the parties have acted in good faith.</p>
<p class="contents">Again in relation to the responsibilities of economic operators, the Commission believes that reducing the period of limitation from three to two years would mark significant progress in enhancing legal certainty for honest operators. Unfortunately, Amendment No 10 stands in the way of that. Removal of that section of the Commission proposal is also likely to deprive us of the possibility of taking interim measures. The Commission therefore feels unable to accept the amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning, finally, to Amendment No 15, the Commission considers that the aim of that amendment, that is to say adequate controls, cannot be defined in theoretical terms in the Customs Code, but must be related to specific aspects, good faith for instance, or the risk element. For that reason, the Commission does not consider the amendment acceptable and believes that it would be more relevant in relation to anti‐fraud legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In once again extending my thanks to Mr Paasilinna, I wish to take just a moment to respond to his question concerning the national information systems. As you will be aware, the Commission has set up the Common Communication Network – Common Systems Interface, known as CCN‐CSI, to enable the national systems to communicate with each other and with the systems set up by the Commission itself. That platform will also be used in the context of the new information transit system which will come into operation at the end of this year between the five partners taking part in it, that is to say Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Switzerland.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me end by inviting those honourable Members who are interested to take part in a demonstration of the system on 31 March.</p>
