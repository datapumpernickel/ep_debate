I wish you all every success in the discharge of your demanding duties. As a representative of the country that now holds the Presidency, I shall be personally present at the part-session in September. I really appreciate having the opportunity to work together with you all.</p>
<p class="contents">In a letter from him dated 9 June, Mr Bangemann, then Member of the Commission, informed the then President of the Commission, Gerhard Schröder, of his intention to enter the service of a private telecommunications company, the Spanish firm <span class="italic">Telefónica</span> . The Council immediately looked into the matter, deciding on 9 July to take the case to the European Court of Justice, on the basis of Article 213 (2(3)) of the EC Treaty and the regulations contained in the ECSC Treaty and the Euratom Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the EC Treaty, Members of the Commission must make a solemn declaration, when commencing their duties, that they will honour their obligations of membership, during their term of office and after it has ended, and behave with integrity and discretion, in the acceptance, after their term of office has ended, of certain appointments or benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">In the view of the Council, Mr Bangemann, who has, since 1992, been the Commission Member expressly responsible for telecommunications, was in breach of the regulations. The Council believes he was under an obligation to decline <span class="italic">Telefónica"s</span> offer. The Court will decide whether the Member of the Commission was in breach of the EC Treaty or not. While handling the Bangemann case, the Council noticed with satisfaction how swiftly the future President of the Commission was to act after the case was brought. It is the common objective of the Council, the future President of the Commission, Romano Prodi, and all the candidates for membership of the Commission to prevent the repetition in future of similar conflicts of interest, such as that which occurred in the Bangemann case. Professor Prodi, in his own programme of reforms for the Commission, has stressed the need for transparency, efficiency and accountability. When he spoke earlier today here in the European Parliament, he told us what demands he would be making in practice on the Members of the new Commission. For example, there will be clear rules for new Members regarding what sort of posts would be appropriate for them to take up on departure from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of the Commission must also, if requested, allow an independent ethics committee to investigate any future post up to a year after they have ceased to hold office, to ensure the new job is compatible in its nature with the work of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council and its President warmly support the rules on behaviour that Romano Prodi has given notice of, and they are a good start on the road to comprehensive reforms. Besides the Members of the Commission, all others in the service of the institutions of the Union must be able to demonstrate that they are adhering to the principle of transparency and complying with commonly accepted rules of behaviour. I am happy to note that the Commission has acted in accordance with the wishes of both the Council and Parliament and begun preparations to alter rules relating to personnel policy. We need precise rules. Only credible reforms will bring the Commission and the Union as a whole closer to the public and increase the confidence of our citizens in the Union and its institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">(SV) Mr President, as Finland is bilingual, I will conclude my contribution in Swedish.</p>
<p class="contents">As President of the European Union, Finland will place great emphasis on openness, efficiency and accountability. The reform process has been initiated in all institutions, which is due, amongst others, to the European Parliament, which on various occasions has drawn attention to these problems. On the other hand, there is still a lot to be done. I hope that all EU institutions take responsibility by showing the necessary readiness to undergo reform in this work.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that they will find their tasks and their career here are both fascinating and fulfilling in the service of the people who have elected them.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution for debate relates to specific events and to principles concerning the conduct of Commissioners. I will therefore respond on behalf of the Commission by reporting briefly on those events and on the Commission's reaction to them.</p>
<p class="contents">On 29 June 1999, the President of the Commission, Mr Santer was made aware of the decision of Mr Bangemann to depart from the Commission in order to take up a private sector appointment two days later on 1 July 1999. Mr Santer wrote to Mr Bangemann on 30 June 1999 informing him that he would be put on functional leave and that his responsibilities would be transferred to a colleague in the Commission. In that letter, Mr Santer stipulated that Mr Bangemann could not commence his new duties and his new activities until the procedure set out in Article 215 of the Treaty had been completed and he also said that he would submit to the College the question of the compatibility of that planned appointment with Article 213 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">On 1 July 1999, the Commission discussed the matter before beginning its formal scheduled meeting. Mr Bangemann attended those proceedings and stated that he had not acted and would not act in ways that breached Article 213. The Commission formally took note of those statements from Mr Bangemann.</p>
<p class="contents">The House will be familiar with Article 213 which, amongst other things, requires Members of the Commission in particular ‘to behave with integrity and discretion as regards the acceptance, after they have ceased to hold office, of certain appointments'. All Commissioners, Mr President, appear before the Court of Justice to swear an oath to that effect on taking up office.</p>
<p class="contents">At the meeting held on 1 July 1999, Commissioners expressed their views to Mr Bangemann and he then withdrew from the room. Commissioners subsequently considered the issues raised by these events and their conclusions are set out in a statement which was published on 1 July 1999 and extensively reported.</p>
<p class="contents">On 9 July 1999, as the House will have heard from Mr Sasi, the Council decided to refer this case to the Court of Justice under Article 213 of the Treaty and, following that decision, it is now for the Court to pronounce on the matters. Honourable Members will understand that the case is therefore now <span class="italic">sub judice</span> and the Commission consequently has to abstain from public comment on it.</p>
<p class="contents">As a general indication of the view of the Commission on the issues posed by the motion before the House, I refer Honourable Members to the concluding paragraph of the Commission's statement of 1 July 1999 which expressed the view ‘that it would be advisable for the future to clarify the implementation of Article 213 regarding Commission members' activities after they have ceased to hold office'.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission consequently notes that on 17 July 1999 the President and Commission-designate agreed upon and published a draft Code of Conduct for Commissioners. As the House will have seen from press reports, that document specifies clear compulsory requirements for future Commissioners who intend to engage in any occupation during the year after they leave office to inform the Commission of their intentions in good time. It further provides for a procedure of examination and decision-making that includes the specific power of the Commission to refer the matter to an ethics committee when a Commissioner's planned occupation is related to his or her portfolio.</p>
<p class="contents">The House may also wish to know that, in the course of discussions this month, Members of the existing Commission who have always fully respected their solemn undertaking to meet the obligations of integrity and discretion have readily and voluntarily reaffirmed that commitment. To them, as to me of course, it is axiomatic.</p>
<p class="contents">The House will be aware that the composite version of the resolution for debate before this Parliament today was produced this morning in keeping with usual practice. The Commission has therefore had no opportunity to discuss the specific call in the motion for resolution for current Commissioners to respect voluntarily the new Code of Conduct. I have, however, consulted the acting President, Mr Marín, and can inform the House that this issue will receive the attention of the Commission at its meeting next week.</p>
<p class="contents">I have sought to respond to the motion for debate as fully as possible whilst respecting the fact that the case which prompted the question is now <span class="italic">sub judice</span> .</p>
<p class="contents">I know that the House will share my awareness of the fact that this debate and my later response to it will need to take account of that obvious legal consideration.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Elles (PPE)</span></span>  <span class="bold">.</span> – Mr President, it is clear that in our European Union today changes are underway, particularly in the Commission, as a result of the refusal to give discharge for the 1996 budget and then the consequent and ultimate mass resignation of the Commission. Everything in that particular story showed where codes of conduct had begun to be discussed and debated. Indeed the acting President, Mr Santer, had put out a Code of Conduct for Commissioners and officials but it seemed it did not go far enough. Everything in the story was too little, too late. From the comments of Commissioner Kinnock, the Commission might examine this tomorrow or next week. It is always in the same kind of vein.</p>
<p class="contents">This applies also to the question of a Code of Conduct for high level officials because in the Commission over the last few years there has indeed been lax management in internal organisation as was underlined by the Wise Men's report. This is why we were calling earlier today for the second part of that report to be available to us so we have as much information available to us when we come to the hearings in early September for the incoming Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">One simple example which I can give the House of the internal games which were played by the heads of cabinets – not the Commissioners – on one particular staffing matter goes to show how these things were handled. ESPRIT, an important information technology programme designated under Mr Bangemann at the beginning of the Commission as it was in early 1995, was transferred from originally DG XIII which was under Mrs Cresson to Mr Bangemann. Lo and behold, in 1998, this was then shifted back to Mrs Cresson without any formal Commission decision – it was just decided as a game between the cabinets. How much time, energy and problems were caused for staff in the running of a programme simply because the Commissioners did a deal between themselves which was not transparent, not effective and certainly unaccountable to us here in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I come to this particular case of Mr Bangemann. It is to us extraordinary insensitivity at this particular time, in this current climate, when you have an acting Commission, that someone can, in that particular state of office simply say two days later he wants to go and work for a private company which is one of the major operators in the field for which he is responsible in telecommunications. It could be argued that Mr Bangemann is not doing anything strictly wrong because there was not an enforceable Code of Conduct. But the Statute is very generous to Commissioners. Is not 80 % of salary for five years enough to satisfy someone's need for financial back-up and to make sure that they do not need the extra finance which a company like <span class="italic">Telefónica </span> is giving?</p>
<p class="contents">We unanimously support in our group the Council's decision for this case to go to the Court of Justice. We are particularly hopeful that they will look at the suspension of pension rights for the Commissioner in this instance, particularly while he is engaged in a private company. What it leaves for us is a reflection of the disregard of certain members of the outgoing Commission for the need to have a rigorous approach to high standards in public life.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore welcome the statement by the incoming President, Mr Prodi, that there will now be codes of conduct applied rigorously, but we have heard this before. This is what worries us. We want to be able to see these codes of conduct effectively applied so as to make sure not only that the people at the top accept political responsibility, but also that we have high quality management right the way down so that people can be appointed for what they know rather than who they know.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are not only judging a Commissioner whose behaviour has been unacceptable. We are talking about a former Member of this Parliament, a distinguished parliamentarian who was even a leader of the Liberal Group in the European Parliament, a former German Minister for the Economy and a Commissioner with a long record of service. We must start with the freedom of people and the fact that we are all in public service voluntarily, and the ex-Commissioner cannot claim ignorance of this.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the Council"s decision on this case – and I believe it has been a quick one – as well as the Commission"s explanations with regard to its actions in this case, which have been enormously speedy. It is clear – while I respect the fact that it is still <span class="italic">sub judice </span> - that the acceptance of the post offered to him by <span class="italic">Telefónica</span> represents an obvious conflict of interests. We simply have to remember the role played by Mr Bangemann in the Commission"s revised proposal on royalties and the information society, the pressure applied by <span class="italic">Telefónica</span> to introduce changes to the proposed Directive previously rejected by Parliament, <span class="italic">Telefónica</span> "s active policy with regard to penetrating the media, and also in relation to charges. And I could mention other cases, such as the case of the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I know from my own experience what the <span class="italic">Telefónica</span> company represents in Spain. I was Minister in this area during the 80s and I can tell you that in Spain it is more significant than the Society of Jesus<span class="italic">. Telefónica </span> has been a monopoly from the beginning and has been privatised incredibly quickly, it has been put into the hands of an ex-college associate of the present Spanish Prime Minister, the whole privatisation having been highly questionable. But it still holds a dominant position in the Spanish market-place and an international profile, which means that this is not a purely Spanish matter.</p>
<p class="contents">What is there at the moment to prevent Mr Bangemann from using any confidential or strategically sensitive information about <span class="italic">Telefónica</span> "s competitors that he has obtained through his status as Commissioner? There is no answer to this question and it is truly serious. I therefore believe that we should draw up codes of conduct which include standards of political decency applicable in all of our countries. At the moment, as we have been reminded, the Commissioners now have a suspension of three years to rebuild their professional life without having to sell themselves to the highest bidder.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, Mr President, to conclude with something which relates to the end of the last legislature and the beginning of this one. In the Committee on Budgetary Control, certain examples of the behaviour of the ex-Commissioner were presented. However, these were not used, even in the light of the report of the Committee of Experts, an inquisitorial campaign against certain Commissioners was preferred – and in one case I would say there was sexual discrimination because the Commissioner was a woman. Since highly critical things have been said here in this Chamber, who is going to restore the honour of those Commissioners?</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I believe that, in view of the locations we have for this Parliament and in the Union, this is an experience which must not be repeated because, in the end, black sheep are found in unexpected places.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">(NL) Mr President, on 10 June, all Europeans suffered an electoral defeat. By not voting, many people made it clear that they no longer have any faith in Europe as it now is. That is why it is an absolute priority for our group to restore our citizens" faith in Europe so that we are able to meet the challenges of the coming five years with credibility. For the same reason, my group finds it incomprehensible that Commissioner Bangemann should choose precisely this moment to take an extremely dubious step in his career. Unfortunately, this affair confirms the view that nothing will ever change in Europe. Whereas the whistleblowing official Paul van Buitenen is still waiting for his reputation to be rehabilitated, those at the top, such as Mr Bangemann, are evidently able to go about their affairs in the usual way.</p>
<p class="contents">We democrats seek to restore the people"s faith in Europe, which is no small challenge. That is why every European slip-up must be tackled, irrespective of who is responsible for it. Consequently, my group heartily endorses the fact that the Council intends to present this case to the Court of Justice. However, it would have been more fitting if the President of the European Commission had taken this step himself. This would have signalled an ability to put its own house in order, which would have been most welcome in view of recent events.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are certainly right when they say that Mr Martin Bangemann, in his own inimitable manner, has succeeded in permanently damaging not only the reputation of the Commission and the Parliament but also the European ideal itself. The electorate, the citizens out there in our countries, cannot always clearly distinguish between the Commission, the Parliament and the Council. They frequently get the institutions mixed up and we now have a situation where people at home refer to us as ‘you over there, you in Brussels who are always corrupt, lining your own pockets and so on’.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have to painstakingly rebuild, together with the new Commission, that which Mr Bangemann destroyed. What does this tell us about Mr Bangemann when he acts in such a manner? It is imperative that the courts deal with this matter since, casting our minds back to the case of Ignacio Lopez at Volkswagen, this sort of insider knowledge is actually tantamount to a criminal act when an individual gains employment in another area so soon afterwards. This should also be borne in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">This Mr Bangemann, however, was also sent here on two occasions by Kohl"s government. In this regard, I would like to clear up the myth once and for all that the opposition in Germany also always provides a Commissioner. That was the case the first time with Mrs Wulf-Mathies, and only then. I would like to ask Mr Poettering, who of course is no longer here: Where was his Party when it came to controlling their own Commissioner? He was hardly acceptable as Minister for Industry and Commerce. He has again been kicked out by the Liberal faction in the European Parliament. As Commissioner, he was very often controversial. Remember the business with the yacht. This is also relevant here. I welcome enormously the fact that the new President of the Commission, together with his new Commission, which we still have to approve, wishes to introduce different rules to the game. Of course, simply signing a Code of Conduct won"t make any difference. We also have to lay down legally binding and documented sanctions in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">We can not accept it when someone says: ‘Well, my reputation may have been called into question but, in any case, I am free to do what I like once my time in office is up’. In this regard, it is down to us, among others, in our positions as Members of Parliament, to fight for clear statutes and rules of the game, and to elaborate on these, since no one benefits from simply throwing stones at others whilst overlooking the fact that we ourselves sometimes sit in glass houses.</p>

Such behaviour endangers the reputation of European institutions and engenders reservations on the part of citizens towards the European Union. This makes it all the more pressing to take effective measures in the fight against corruption and to introduce clear and open regulations for the proper application of Article 213 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Legally binding regulations must be created, similar to those in private industry, which contain a competition clause or a competition restraint clause in employment contracts. Naturally, Mr Bangemann has to take personal responsibility for his actions, but a policy geared towards economic interests as a matter of priority and, unfortunately, towards the business management interests of large concerns, also as a matter of priority, poses the inevitable risk that their leading representatives, as those putting this policy into practise, adopt the same attitude, thereby devoting themselves to maximising their personal profit, in violation of every moral code.</p>

This same Commissioner Bangemann has just accepted an extremely well-paid job on the board of a company involved in his area of responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that the Council of Ministers was right to inform the Courts of Justice, in accordance with article 213 of the Treaty, which prohibits Commissioners from accepting, even after leaving their posts, jobs which would place them in an awkward position, given their obligations to be honest and sensitive in these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">One of these obligations which I feel should be mentioned in particular, as it is not mentioned often enough, is that of professional secrecy, which, in accordance with Article 287 of the Treaty, applies to Commissioners indefinitely after leaving office. Indeed, I do not see how Mr Bangemann could act as a director of <span class="italic">Telefónica</span> without using, directly or indirectly, confidential information which he has acquired over the last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union for a Europe of Nations Group finds that the new Code of Conduct, touched on by Mr Prodi, is not up to the job. The one year minimum period which would relieve the Commissioners of their obligations after leaving office, seems far too short. In addition to this, potential penalties should be made much more severe, and could even include the returning of salaries paid to them during their time in office at the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The stakes are high, dear colleagues. We must know whether or not we can take decisions at a European level which reflect the opinions of the citizens of Europe and not those of economic or financial lobby-groups.</p>
<p class="contents">There is more. The indifference of Commissioner Bangemann, who has not even had the decency to wait just a few months until the Commission"s agony is over, shows the extent to which there is a feeling within this institution, of being above the law and above public opinion. This type of behaviour casts serious doubts, in retrospect, on many past decisions. This must be put right as a matter of urgency, particularly before the forthcoming international negotiations at the Millennium round which will be fundamental to Europe"s interests. In order to put things right though, Mr President, we will need more than a new Code of Conduct. The control of whole European institutions will have to be given back to the people, and the first step in this direction is to give this control back to their national parliaments.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It reveals totally rotten law and no less rotten policy. I consider that these persistent colleagues, who are keen to give their own ruling in the case brought before the Court, thus pre-empting the course of events by pronouncing a judgment without court proceedings, in obvious violation of Article 213, and depriving the man of his pension rights, are usurping a function which is rightly a matter for the courts. It is rotten law and it is rotten policy. However, I will take another starting point and say that I, representing the Danish opponents of the Union, the People"s Movement against the EU, owe Mr Bangemann a debt of gratitude. It was Mr Bangemann who, as a Commissioner in 1992, spoke the truth concerning the Maastricht project. The truth which is evident today, namely that the large States have unlimited power and outrageous dominance over small, less fortunate States such as the State which I represent, Denmark. It was Mr Bangemann who, in this way, secured the Danish ‘no’ to the Maastricht Treaty on 2 June 1992, which put the skids under the process which we call the democratisation process. We now owe Herr Bangemann a debt of gratitude for yet another eye-opener. Mr Bangemann has breached a few regulations, but we are not here to defend <span class="italic">Telefónica"</span> s competitors. We are not here to reproach Mr Bangemann for damaging trust in this project. Mr Bangemann simply transgressed the very, very broad and flexible boundaries of greed and the merging of private and public, which is a vital part of the European Union. Mr Bangemann"s offence is that he has made this fundamentally corrupt system visible, so that any European voter could see it and therefore choose to stay at home on voting day, as most people did between 10 and 13 June, thus depriving this assembly of any form of democratic legitimacy. That was all I wanted to say.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It really is most reprehensible that there has been not only an apparent flouting of the formal rules for Commissioners, but also a contravention of the spirit of transparency and trust that should be the basis of the work between this Parliament and Commissioners.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been the rapporteur on a substantial number of Directives concerning the liberalisation of the telecommunications industry and I, and my colleagues, have acted in good faith in this work and had assumed that the former Commissioner Bangemann had done the same. One can only speculate at just how much of a commitment Mr Bangemann had to the level playing field in this aspect of the internal market when he is willing to sell his knowledge to <span class="italic">Telefónica</span> , a major player in the European Union and further afield.</p>
<p class="contents">It is particularly difficult, Colleagues, when Mr Bangemann was a former Member of this Parliament and indeed, a leader of the Liberal Group.</p>
<p class="contents">One matter which has not been mentioned in the debate is that there is to be a major review of all of the telecommunications legislation later this year and part of this work has already been started by the Commission under Mr Bangemann's commissionership.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have previously stated, I have been the rapporteur on a number of matters, but if I can just give you a thumbnail sketch of just how extensive this review will be and what it will cover – universal service, frequencies, satellite, regulation, licences, interconnections, numbering, mobile telephones, convergence of broadcasting, data transmission and telecommunications – an explosion of legislation and an enormous segment of the European Union's manufacturing, industrial and commercial base in its own right, but also as an adjunct to so many other industries. On all of this, Mr Bangemann takes with him his knowledge and his contacts to <span class="italic">Telefónica</span> .</p>
<p class="contents">There are also a worryingly substantial number of cases before the European Court of Justice on breaches of legislation, particularly in the field of interconnections – again, matters on which the former Commissioner has intimate knowledge. The Commissioner, when he was here in this Chamber, and I have had many debates with him, was fond of quoting from Shakespeare and other English poets. I shall quote one in his absence on his behalf – 'Just for a handful of silver he left us, just for a ribbon to stick on his coat'. I know that the money he has been offered by <span class="italic">Telefónica</span> hardly can be justified by the description of a handful of silver and indeed it begs the question of just how seriously Members of this House will treat a company like <span class="italic">Telefónica </span> when it comes to lobby us as they surely will on the matter of the review and future legislation in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">If I can be slightly mischievous, one wonders just how much value for money <span class="italic">Telefónica</span> will get out of Martin Bangemann. I wish he were on a performance-related pay and he might find that the fat cheque might not look nearly so attractive.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand Commissioner Kinnock's hesitation and his hesitations because this matter is <span class="italic">sub judice</span> . Fortunately, Members of this Parliament are protected by parliamentary privilege, but even then, Commissioner Kinnock, I would ask you to note the reasonably restrained language that there is in our resolution and if I may just quote to you briefly on what the resolution says – “it deems his conduct to be particularly open to criticism’. We did choose the language very carefully and many might say that ‘open to criticism’ might be a serious understatement.</p>
<p class="contents">I finish, where I started, by saying that we are right to treat this with the utmost seriousness. I support absolutely the Council's decision to refer this matter to the Court and to use all the powers that there are under the agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">However, one matter still is outstanding. There seems to be no mechanism within the existing rules and obligations where a company like <span class="italic">Telefónica</span> itself can be subject to some sort of punitive measures. If we could find some way not only of having a measure to take against former Commissioners who act in this way, but also against the companies who benefit from their knowledge, then I think that we might have two very powerful levers to use in future transgressions.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope, of course, that these will not occur. We wish the new Commission every success and hope that the high standards they espouse will be put into practice.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Yes, it is shocking that a European Commissioner should be able to profit unduly from his position for his own benefit, but it is even more shocking that incredibly rich companies should be able to profit, quite legally, from subsidies from European institutions whilst to my knowledge, these same institutions are giving no help at all to the eighteen million unemployed workers throughout the Union, nor to the several million other people who are forced to live on salaries which barely keep them alive.</p>

What is most important is that this sort of thing does not spread to the civil service or gain popularity there. The impartial nature of our administration is the most important issue for all of us here and in the Commission. There is a real need to reform the bureaucratic machinery of the European institutions, and an end must be made to these sorts of cliques. This is what the public hates most about the European Union. That was seen in the elections and in the campaigning. Our citizens do not understand an administration that works along such lines, and we should not wonder. Mr Prodi"s Commission is off to a good start, and I congratulate him on that, but it must continue as it has begun. I thank the Council for taking a swift decision to bring this case to the European Court of Justice, but as we have to be the pioneers in an administration which is open and efficient, so Mr Prodi"s Commission should get ready for the test in September. I believe that by the start of next year, we will see, on the basis of the study by the five experts, what the Commission has achieved with regard to its own administrative reforms and those of its body of civil servants. Therefore, we shall meet up here once more at the end of the year.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The actions of Mr Bangemann, a Member of the Commission, in this affair can in no way be approved. I would like to thank those who have spoken for having given their approval of the Council"s decision to take swift action in this affair, and for their support in bringing the case to court. I would like to underline the importance of Mr Prodi"s code of practice in this connection, and I wish to refer to Mr Elles" speech in which he said that hopefully we will not be saying ‘too little, too late’ next time. We must take care this time, then, that codes of conduct are absolutely clear and legally binding on all parties. In my view, it is an issue that concerns us all as it is sometimes hard for the public, as was mentioned here, to distinguish between the institutions of the Union, which means that events such as this should not be allowed to occur in any of the institutions. Thank you.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would have been easy for people to try to make a populist appeal. That was almost entirely avoided. That simply added to the weight of the opinion of this House and therefore to the reaction which everyone has just heard from Mrs Sasi, President-in-Office of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Elles was quite right to emphasise that it is absolutely essential to see responsibility exercised to the highest standard. I hope – to take Mr Barón Crespo's point – that this experience is not repeated, that we can ensure that specific and very clear provision is made so that there cannot be any repetition of the experience of recent weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">There are those who would say, and they have, I believe, rationality on their side, that the provisions of Article 213 of the Treaty and its references to integrity and discretion mean that for anyone who has an understanding of required standards in public life, little more should need to be said, if anything.</p>
<p class="contents">But if it is necessary – and I am conscious of being subject to the fact this issue is now before the court – even then to be more specific about what the implications of integrity and discretion are, then I am glad the House welcomes the developments that will take place as a consequence of the initiative taken by the President designate. I look forward to ensuring that there is a full response to both the appeal of Mr Barón Crespo and that of Mr Elles to the demonstration of the highest standards of public integrity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also say that Mr Kreissl-Dörfler was right to emphasise, together with Mr Duff – in a very interesting maiden speech – that if all institutions do not demonstrate the highest standards of rectitude for themselves, by themselves, then those standards will be imposed externally, either in the form of punishment by the general public, initially through its apathy and detachment but maybe in other ways more directly, politically too, or by the Council taking a responsibility which others appear to be unwilling to demonstrate.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe the European Union, its institutions or its people would be enriched by that experience. It is a fair warning to all of us who serve the institutions and the European people that we are responsible for our own destiny and our own standards and we must therefore proceed without any form of delay to ensuring that those standards are as stringent as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I was interested in the point made in another fine maiden speech by Miss van der Laan which calls for a response. I am happy to report to the House that she is a friend of some years and therefore my joy in witnessing her maiden speech was very particular. I see it was shared in other parts of the House. She said that it would be ‘better if the Commission had taken the step of reference to the Court of Justice’. I should like to say to her, therefore, that the Commission, as I reported earlier, discussed the matter in its meeting of 1 July. In that meeting the feeling was expressed that the issues relating to Mr Bangemann and to Article 213 had legal complexities that could not be speedily resolved. For that reason the Commission made plain its view in its statement of 1 July that there needed to be clarification of implementation of Article 213. There was no consensus at that meeting which supported reference to the Court of Justice at that stage. I say that to ensure that Members of this House understand that the issue is live, it has been a matter of discussion, the action has now been taken by the Council and that determines the path for the future. But there is no lack of concern or consideration in the current Commission, despite the fact that it is coming to the end of its life, in these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude by saying that Mrs Laguiller made an extremely valuable contribution to this debate because, like others, she dramatised the issue quite properly by drawing attention to the economic gaps in society and the way in which those divisions actually serve to emphasise the fact that it is absolutely essential for those of us who have the good fortune to hold representative and appointed positions in the public service to act with complete integrity and discretion. We enjoy a very considerable privilege. We must, therefore, show complete probity. This debate has served to underlined that. If anybody ever needed the lesson, this has added to it. I hope we can look forward to a future where no instruction will be necessary.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
