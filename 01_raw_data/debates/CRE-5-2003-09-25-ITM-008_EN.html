<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Von Wogau (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, first of all we should ask ourselves why we are debating issues to do with European defence in this Chamber, which is not particularly full, in the European Parliament. I am particularly pleased that Commissioner Barnier is here, because he was the one who brought the issue of European defence to the fore in the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Right at the outset, I should like to explain briefly why we are addressing defence issues here in this Parliament. In 1999, the Heads of State and Government decided to establish a European crisis intervention force of between 50 000 and 60 000 troops. Since then, this crisis intervention force, which was actually a virtual force and not a regular European Union army, has however been deployed in two cases, first in a small operation in Macedonia, and then also in Bunia in the Congo under mainly French leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">I come now to the European Parliament: on 10 April of this year, on the basis of the Morillon report, the European Parliament set out its views on defence policy, and in particular proposed a two-stage plan. At the time we had asked ourselves what we could learn from Maastricht. We learnt from Maastricht that first and foremost you only make progress in Europe if you set clear goals and deadlines for achieving them. We said that by the year 2009 we wanted to have made sufficient progress to be capable of carrying out an operation of the intensity and difficulty of the Kosovo conflict on our own, independently, or together with our allies.</p>
<p class="contents">As a first step, the call was made in the Morillon report, and subsequently endorsed by a substantial majority in the European Parliament, for us to have a 50 000-strong crisis intervention force by 2004, a permanent crisis intervention force to be available around the clock for rescue operations and humanitarian duties. That then is what the European Parliament is calling for.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn, however, to arms policy: after the operations in the Balkans, we were told repeatedly by the American side that Europe only spent 50% of what the Americans spend on defence, but that measured in terms of efficiency it was only 10%. Why is that the case? In the United States there is only one buyer of arms and that is the Pentagon. In the European Union, there are not one but 15 buyers, which procure more or less the same things, but according to different criteria and using different methods, and cooperation in this sector leaves a great deal to be desired.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not therefore have a common armaments market here, but continue to have 15 sub-markets. Our goal now must be – if we wish to move forward and spend European taxpayers' money more efficiently in this sector – actually to form a common market, which means dismantling barriers to trade between the Member States in this sector too. However, if we wish to dismantle these barriers to trade, we first need to ensure not only that there are common rules for the export of armaments, but also that these common rules are applied in the same way by the 15 Member States. Anything else would mean that the exports would first be transferred within the European Union to those countries with the laxest provisions, and that must not be allowed to happen. The European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports is undoubtedly our most developed body of legislation. But firstly it is only a code and it has only been transposed into law in some countries. The first demand that is made in my report is for this code to be made legally binding. That is the first issue. Member States may also declare unilaterally that the provisions are legally binding. In addition, we have to ensure, as soon as they are legally binding, that the authorities in the 15 Member States apply these provisions in exactly the same way, because that is the first and most important precondition for success.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the report calls for arms brokering to be better regulated. There is a certain element here of deals taking place in a grey area, brokered by people who should surely not be involved in this activity. That is why we are calling for all of those engaged in brokering activities to be registered, and think that a Europe-wide system of authorisation should be introduced for this activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we note that it is relatively straightforward to ascertain who has manufactured the arms, and often this also tells you who owns them. It is unclear, however, how they are passed from one to the other. That is why we are calling for an international system to be set up that will make it possible to ascertain who has passed the arms to the end-users. There is a French proposal on this subject and we are calling for this to be used as a basis for ensuring that we obtain a full account of how the arms reach end-users, which is of decisive importance for security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barnier,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr von Wogau, I too am glad to be with you again today. I have not forgotten the excellent dialogue we engaged in at meetings of the various parliamentary and non-parliamentary groups when you tackled issues relating to European defence. In particular, I remember the time when I was leading the group on European defence policy within the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr von Wogau, I would like to thank you for drafting the splendid report you have just presented to us, namely the Fourth annual report on the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the merits of this report is that it puts the problem of arms exports back in a wider context. In other words, it puts it in the context of the policies of the European Union. Some of the most notable of these are the challenge of the forthcoming enlargement, the common foreign and security policy, and of course, defence policy. Another is the need to develop a European procurement and defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports adopted in 1998 is politically binding on Member States. The ultimate responsibility for arms exports rests with national governments. Nonetheless, certain aspects of the arms trade do come within the remit of the CFSP. The Commission fully endorses the CFSP, and endeavours to implement everything that falls within the competence of the Community. The Commission is prepared to collaborate with Member States in areas where responsibility is shared. Compliance with the regulation on products with a dual use is one such area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the progress on implementation of the code and better transparency made last year by the Council under the Danish and Greek Presidencies. In particular, I would like to highlight the improvements concerning the data contained in the annual report and in the introduction of a record of the procedures agreed by the Member States within the framework of the code of conduct. I should also like to mention the adoption in June last year of the common position on the control of arms brokerage activities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of Parliament’s strong interest in this subject. We have taken special note of the constructive and ambitious position adopted in the House as reflected in your report, Mr von Wogau. Your report encourages the Council to pursue its work in this field and strive to improve it. We agree with almost all of your assessment of the fourth year of the implementation of this code, Mr von Wogau. We appreciate many of the suggestions put forward in your report. I refer both to those aimed at greater transparency and more rigorous control and to those seeking greater harmonisation and legally binding provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with your proposal to make more frequent use of the expertise of the group on conventional arms exports and the Council’s geographical working groups in order to draft common assessments and ensure a more multilateral approach. This could prove an important step towards harmonising the arms exports policies of all the Member States. More attention must be paid to the attempts to establish a common definition of the eighth criterion of the code regarding compatibility between arms exports and the technical and economic capacity of the country of destination.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is also very important for the European Union that the acceding countries should be fully engaged in procedures linked to the code of conduct, especially as regards the exchange of information and notification of licences refused. In addition, the European Union should continue to encourage third countries to adhere to the principles of the code. It should also continue to support efforts to create an international instrument for this field, especially the work within the framework of the G8.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has presented a draft Community Council regulation on the trade in certain goods and equipment that could be used to inflict torture, capital punishment or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. I believe it is essential to ensure respect for the European policy banning the death penalty and torture. No exceptions can be allowed. At the same time, the WTO provisions must be respected. Hence the relative complexity of the measure.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also the reason for the delay in drafting our proposal. The latter is now being considered by competent bodies within the Council. We still hope, however, that it will be possible to adopt it in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">The Parliament report and the very important proposals by General Morillon you mentioned a moment ago, Mr von Wogau, both rightly highlight the link between export control measures and the development of a European Union defence procurement policy. Such a policy was proposed in the Commission communication of March 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, there is a connection between relaxing controls on the movement of arms within the European Union on the one hand and strengthening and harmonising practices on the control of exports to third countries on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, it is essential to consider carefully the proposals on a common monitoring system within the European Union. You and I both worked on this idea in the framework of the Convention. In light of this, it is now appropriate for us to explore the possibility of creating a European arms export control agency. We should also consider a European agency on armaments, procurement and research. Such an agency could be one of the instruments of a single European arms market. The latter is sorely needed, as you pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">That concludes my response to the contribution by Mr von Wogau. Thank you for your attention, ladies and gentlemen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report analyses the situation at present and proposes consistent action for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to take account of the enlargement of the Union in this connection too, as the considerable market in conventional weapons still focuses on the countries included in the accession now and those countries bordering on them. A review and standardisation of EU practices must be undertaken without delay, and we must ensure there is compliance with the EU Code of Conduct in the countries that are to be the EU’s new neighbours and in countries with which the EU has concluded a stabilisation and association agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur rightly states it is a fault of the current Member States that data on exports to stable countries – to other EU countries and the United States of America – is given in minute detail but there is a lack of such data on exports to less stable countries. The remedy proposed in the report, greater transparency and a more multilateral approach, is the only way to correct these defects and prevent transfers of arms that pose a threat to human rights, regional stability or sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">The development and harmonisation of legislation as well as a register of transactions and an authorisation system regarding the export of arms are both essential, and the idea also presented in the report with regard to establishing a European arms export control agency should be seriously considered as a logical next step towards a joint European armaments and procurement policy and the establishment of a common market in armaments.</p>
<p class="contents">One piece of information in the explanatory statement in Mr von Wogau’s report needs to be corrected, however. The legislation in force in Finland on the export of armaments is in accordance with the recommendations laid down in the UN Firearms Protocol and in the OSCE Document on Small Arms and Light Weapons. The control of armaments brokering in Finland aims to thwart the circumvention of bans on arms exports imposed by the European Union, the UN Security Council and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports and other international agreements and undertakings concerning the control of exports. The aim too is to prevent the illegal manufacture of, and trade in, arms. We can therefore anticipate that my country will support the policy being proposed by my colleague, Karl von Wogau. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Leinen (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, the Group of the Party of European Socialists supports Mr von Wogau's report, and I should particularly like to thank the rapporteur for his very good analysis of the successes and deficiencies in the control of arms exports in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Convention and the draft constitution we have said that Europe needs to shoulder more responsibility in the world. Our clear intention is to not only be a large market but also a political unit, which takes on responsibilities beyond the borders of the European Union, and the issue of arms exports has a central role to play here. We hear of some cases of completely irresponsible behaviour: of arms being exported to crisis regions causing conflicts to escalate, instead of arms exports being reduced or stopped, which would help to take the heat out of these conflicts. The arms trade is one of the reasons why it is often in the poorest regions of the world that there is armed conflict and, as we see, it is very often child soldiers who are deployed there.</p>
<p class="contents">The arms trade, as we all know, is, like the drugs trade and trafficking in human beings, a multi-billion-pound business. The profits are huge, and that is why this shady market is so attractive to operators. The Code of Conduct has proved its worth – there has been some improvement – but the report also notes that exports are still being sent to crisis regions in contravention of the Code. We have not yet achieved our aim; we do not yet have this issue fully under control.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with the rapporteur that if we want a common arms policy – meaning that individual countries do not do their own research or manufacture their own arms but that we do this together at European level – we not only need a common armaments market internally, but also a common arms export policy. Just as we have a common trade policy for normal goods, so we also need a common policy for arms exports, and I agree with what we say in paragraph 3: the data available is insufficient. The type of arms that are supplied, the total value of exports, the number of licences refused, more precise information on the country of destination and the end-user – we need all of these data, otherwise we cannot exercise control of the market and spot when something is wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">Brokers in the arms trade are quite unique agents. We are familiar with the various scandals. As I have already said, there is a lot of money to be made. That is why I very much welcome our call for a register of arms brokers and also for an authorisation system of some kind. We urgently need a common position here, and this Parliament calls on the Council to bring about an agreement amongst the Member States. I also wish to mention that the EU cannot shoulder this burden alone. We need our neighbours, but we also need Russia and the United States of America. We would be pleased if the French initiative were successful. It is in the interests of the credibility of the EU's external policy for us to stick to our principles in this sector too, and I very much welcome Mr von Wogau's report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, the production of and trade in arms secures huge excess profits for multinational big business which, with privatisation, now controls these sectors. However, quite apart from the profits, by supplying arms, producer countries also safeguard political control of purchasing countries, both through the rake-off paid by the arms industries to the governments of these countries and through control of their equipment. Thus, all means are being used to promote the creation of conditions of demand and consumption of arms, by fomenting tension, armed clashes and massacres of or infighting among peoples. The demand and consumption of these products also concerns the producer countries. In fact, as we know, our governments are constantly strengthening both the repressive mechanisms used against the burgeoning demonstrations by our peoples against the anti-grass roots policy and conflict prevention, crisis management and the fight against terrorism, in other words military intervention the world over.</p>
<p class="contents">All this, which is expressed through the constant militarisation of the European Union, in ever closer cooperation with ΝΑΤΟ, calls for huge quantities of arms. That is why Mr Solana proposes increasing the military forces. These developments, of course, are fraught with huge dangers for the peoples of the European Union and for mankind as a whole within the framework of intra-imperialist rivalry. However, they satisfy the speculative appetites of the political-military-industrial network which, especially after September 11, now has absolute control over US policy and is also strengthening its influence in the countries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The report being debated, however good the rapporteur's intentions may be, does not refer to these questions, or rather it conceals them. Like all the previous reports, it formulates wishes and proposals which will never be applied. That is why what is needed is not codes of conduct, compliance with which depends on the good will of the Member States, but the introduction of mandatory rules and controls and the gradual reduction in the production, movement and use of arms, pending their definitive prohibition. We need to convert war industries into peace industries. These are the demands of the movement for peace. We support them, which is why we shall not vote for the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, I have to say – and I would ask the President to send a note to this effect to the Council – that a discussion is being held here between the European Parliament and the Council, which means that the Council Presidency is actually who we should be talking to because it has 100% responsibility for implementing the Code, and I am disappointed that it is not represented here at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, given that the Council Presidency is not taking its responsibilities seriously, I actually think that it would be sensible for the Commission to share that responsibility, namely where integrated instruments apply, which would also give the European Parliament a better opportunity of contributing to improving the Code of Conduct. One of the key issues that we need to address is the Europe-wide registration of arms with the involvement of all Member States, and I think that entrusting the Commission with these tasks would be an important institutional step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The main problem – and this has already been mentioned – is that the Code is not binding and cannot therefore be applied effectively. This is therefore another central issue that urgently needs to be resolved. Nevertheless, we also still have the problem – and this too has already been mentioned – that this Code is insufficient to ensure proper surveillance of arms movements. That is why we urgently need registration, firstly of the product, secondly of its movements and thirdly of the end-user.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also necessary to have a register of how the arms are intended to be used when they reach the end-user, and for this purpose we need a joint surveillance office in the European Union. Even better would be an arbitration service, an ombudsman, to deal with questions and criticism from the public, because arms can still end up in the wrong place and because arms from the European Union still lead to conflicts today. I think that it has become clear that the main problem with the Arms Code is implementation. In terms of implementation, we still fall far short of meeting our actual standards, and we also know that arms exports still lead to fresh violence in latent conflicts, to the violation of human rights and to situations of war, where we then have to invest more money and personnel to restore peace to the region. That is why one of the key tasks of a common foreign and security policy is to ensure that arms exports are tracked and restricted and that those who violate the Code are punished accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One might as well try to make murder, plunder or abduction more ethical. The simple fact that the great powers are wasting enormous sums of money on weapons of mass destruction shows that the present organisation of society is barbaric. The governments of the great nations, who are responsible for criminal wars from Iraq to Afghanistan and accomplices of state terrorism in Palestine, would like to deny a number of smaller countries, whose regimes they do not like, access to weapons. They would like to do the same to certain organisations described by them as terrorist, and to the world of organised crime. Even that, however, is proving impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">In an economy where arms dealers are willing to sell the rope to hang themselves if it makes them a profit, how can they be prevented from bypassing government controls? When the report welcomes the French initiative concerning the submission of a proposal for an International Code on Transparency, moreover, or refers to the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, that is both odious and ludicrous, since those countries are among the world’s leading arms exporters and are periodically shaken by politico-financial scandals involving highly placed politicians and arms dealers.</p>
<p class="contents">A major arms dealer has recently been appointed to a ministerial post, representing a developing country at UNESCO. This is ample proof of how useless and ridiculous it is to attempt to bring morality into the arms trade. Legal proceedings have been opened against this individual, but he will now enjoy diplomatic immunity. Naturally, we are opposed to this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You spoke about a politically binding code, but this is not enforceable. We cannot jolt our governments’ consciences. That is a sad thing in connection with arms, because these are not everyday goods. Nevertheless, they are all too easily used in this way. As regards the report by Mr von Wogau, I think that he is right in noting, on the fourth opportunity we have had to give our reaction to the Council’s annual report, that progress can be noted once more, on paper, in reporting and transparency. As regards the effectiveness of the agreements, I have the impression that these are chiefly concerned with preventing unfair competition and with not tormenting each other. Brokering, too, is to be taken rather more seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that I am not so optimistic in practice. European arms exports are clearly rising instead of falling. Many believe that military expenditure should be increased; while we, on the contrary, are inclined to think that it should be reduced. The military-industrial complex is organising in order to lobby Brussels intensively. Large parts of the world continue to be inundated with arms that are used not only against the people living there, but also against our own peacekeeping forces. I saw a BBC report in which French peacekeeping forces in Eastern Congo were fired at with arms supplied with the express complicity of Rwanda or Uganda. When I look at the list of suppliers, I see that there are still European countries that either directly supply arms or let arms be purchased using budgetary support, which amounts to the same thing.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out that, in recent weeks, refugees from Uganda have been arriving in Chad. NGOs on site have reported to us that the proliferation of small arms in that area was the direct cause of the outbreak of armed conflict. I read here that inquiries have been made into how arms can be supplied for humanitarian purposes. I think that it is a bit much to state that this could be possible. I do not acknowledge that possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">In my country, the Arms Act was very strict, and, back then, it was said that no arms were to be supplied to regions of conflict. Nevertheless, people found an opportunity to export them to Nepal, and now we even have regionalisation of the arms trade. At European level, the Code of Conduct may have been adopted, but there is a problem of interpretation, and, as our fellow Members have already said, the grey area is extensive. Exporting arms to regions that are somewhat unstable of course means exporting to the best customers, because willing buyers do not discriminate. Irrespective of whether the country is rich or poor, arms are being bought and apparently paid for, if necessary with raw materials stolen from the country itself, as is the case in Eastern Congo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to respond first to a point raised by Mrs Maes. A common Council action aimed at restricting the proliferation of small arms has been in place now for a number of years. Admittedly, its effects have been somewhat uneven. In addition, I understand the European Union supports several other specific actions concerning the destruction of stocks of such low calibre weapons or small arms in particular countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now turn to comments made by several other speakers and in particular by Mrs Korhola. I would like to recall that the acceding countries already subscribe to the code of good conduct Mr von Wogau and I referred to earlier.
