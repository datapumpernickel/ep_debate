<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schnellhardt </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have a report before us which has been occupying the European Parliament for a long time. Even during the preparation of the labelling directive, the question of listing the ingredients of alcoholic beverages was being discussed, but the move was blocked time and again by the Council. Commissioner Bangemann, so that we have no misunderstandings such as those which occurred at our last meeting at the same place and time, I should like to say from the outset that I am grateful for the timely presentation of this report. That is exactly what was agreed on during the conciliation procedure. I find that very professional.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposal seeks to close a loophole, and that is to be welcomed. Unlike other foodstuffs and beverages, alcoholic beverages have hitherto been exempt from compulsory labelling of ingredients. For all the points under discussion, there is surely one thing on which the House is in agreement, namely that the labelling of ingredients has to be introduced in the interests of the single market and in the interests of proper consumer information. I should like to stress that we are all united on that point. Not only in the committee responsible for the report, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, but also in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, these Commission proposals have been supported and enhanced.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal does not deal with the substantive aspects of ingredient labelling. Let me make that quite clear. It deals first and foremost with the question of the legislative procedures to be applied when the labelling provisions are laid down. Some widely differing ideas are surfacing here, and I must say that the situation starts to look precarious when the rapporteur and Members of the House attack each other, as for example in a press statement in which my honourable colleague Mrs Lulling implied that I had been guilty of obsessive behaviour and procrastination in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. I should be grateful, Commissioner, if you would confirm afterwards that I came to see you a year ago and that we tried to urge the legal services of the Commission and Parliament to deliver a joint opinion. We do not seem to have succeeded in this, for I have not received any word as yet.</p>
<p class="contents">That was also a reason why I hung fire, because I should have liked to know what was right. There are two divergent opinions on this matter. The proposal, in my view, is most probably designed to attract the support of the Council, but I do not think it is in any way logical. Three different legislative procedures for the same legislative measure, a measure of consumer protection, will elicit a protest from any Member of Parliament, especially if the codecision procedure is to apply only to spirits and aromatised wines. The Maastricht Treaty granted us the right of codecision in the domain of labelling, and I must insist on that right, not only in respect of spirits and aromatic wines, but also for beers and all other alcoholic beverages.</p>
<p class="contents">It is surely high time we rid ourselves of this very frequent fault of ignoring expert opinion when we discuss wine and beer in the European Parliament. That is why I based my work on this report on the following principles: firstly, the provision of consumer information on foodstuff and beverage labels, including the labelling of alcoholic beverages, is essentially a measure relating to the single market, a measure of consumer protection. The relevant legislation is the foodstuff labelling directive. The listing of ingredients on labels must therefore comply with that directive. It is simply not true that, as someone is bound to assert in the course of this debate and as others have asserted before, the labelling of wine can only be dealt with in a set of special provisions because it constitutes agricultural produce. The agricultural aspect is irrelevant here; the issue is the labelling of products and the provision of consumer information.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, when it comes to labelling the ingredients of alcoholic beverages, all such beverages must be treated equally. This applies both to the timescale, especially the simultaneous entry into force of the provisions, and to the procedures to be applied. There are no differences of opinion in Parliament on that principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the equal treatment of all beverages does not exclude the possibility of specific labelling directives for each category of beverages to take account of the special features of the individual beverage types. The proposal made by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection allows for that option. The response of the industries concerned has shown me that equal treatment of all beverage categories is no mere pipe dream. It is not my job as a rapporteur, nor is it the task of Parliament as the legislative authority, to champion the cause of any particular industry. Our task is to provide a level playing field and to avoid discriminatory measures. That is why we insist that a uniform procedure must be applied and that the same timescale must apply to all categories of alcoholic beverage. This principle is enshrined in our committee's proposal. We shall have to decide tomorrow whether we want comprehensive parliamentary involvement or whether we wish to leave some labelling to the Council. I have to say, Mrs Lulling, that this is not obsessive; indeed, your press statement testifies to a lack of knowledge of this matter when it asserts that, under the Treaty, wine and spirits have to be labelled in accordance with the common organisation of the market in wine. Now that really is the most novel idea I have come across!</p>

I believe the consumer should be informed, indeed the consumer must be informed. That is the principle, and we all agree with it. The difficulty comes when we have to decide in detail on the form that such information should take. We are talking today about the labelling of beverages with an alcoholic content in excess of 1.2 % by volume – an extremely wide variety of beverages, ranging from wine to fortified beverages and even to the so‐called alcopops. Each beverage has its own special characteristics that distinguish it fundamentally from the others. Wine is a natural beverage made from grapes, and I believe the consumer is well informed about it. Above all, there are specific regulations which clearly define the ingredients that wine may and may not contain.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a different story with the so‐called designer drinks, the alcopops. A set of rules is urgently required here, first and foremost to establish that these are quite clearly alcoholic beverages, that they must be categorised as such when offered for sale and must not be placed on the same shelf as soft drinks. The Schnellhardt report does not deal with the details of labelling; our task today is merely to establish who should decide on these details at a future date. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development supports the Commission's proposal that labelling, wherever it may be required, should be prescribed in the specific Community provisions that already exist. We do feel, however, that the three‐year period for implementation proposed by the Commission is too short, given the need to produce a sophisticated classification system, and we are therefore requesting an extension of that period.</p>
<p class="contents">The labelling provisions for all other products should be laid down in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 189b of the Treaty. Criteria based on practical expertise must be paramount in the realm of labelling. Try telling wine growers and farmers that we need more directives! For that reason we consider the Commission proposal to be acceptable, since we have specific Community rules in this area, and we can adapt them to cover labelling.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lulling </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy. – (DE) </span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with the best will in the world, it cannot be said of this report on the draft directive relating to the provisions on the labelling of alcoholic beverages that good things come to those who wait. For roughly two years the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has been tinkering with its report, despite the fact that the Committee on Agricultural and Rural Development and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy delivered their opinions back in November and December 1997 respectively. Both committees adopted their opinions unanimously apart from two abstentions. In both committees, 74 Members took part in the votes on the opinions, which largely endorse the Commission proposal. The proposal only governs the procedure for labelling the ingredients of alcoholic beverages, but not the technical details of the information that should be displayed on labels.</p>
<p class="contents">We have known since 1979 that the Commission, the Council of Ministers and Parliament too are struggling to come up with a set of rules on the labelling of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, it is irresponsible of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection to fritter away a whole year after the submission of opinions by the committees consulted, only to present us with a hotly disputed report which was adopted in the first holiday week of January and for which only 24 Members voted, while 15 voted against it and one abstained. Why were such tactics adopted? Because the rapporteur and the members of the Environment Committee who supported him simply refused to recognise that, under the Treaty, wine and spirits in their various forms are agricultural products, the production and marketing of which are subject to the common organisation of the market in wine. A different legal basis applies to all other alcoholic beverages, including beer.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has presented a logical proposal on where the rules relating to the ingredients in these two groups of alcoholic beverages will be determined – not how they will be determined, that will come later. The plain fact is that agricultural policy, whether it suits us or not, rests on the legal basis of Article 43, which only provides for Parliament to be consulted. As for the legal provisions on the labelling of other alcoholic beverages, which are industrial products, we now have the right of codecision. The fact that many people in this House plead the case for codecision and are trying – <span class="italic">tous azimuts</span> , on all fronts, as De Gaulle would have said – to achieve codecision where the Treaty does not provide for it may be understandable, although I personally have no time for such pettifoggers.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur's veritable obsession with securing a right of codecision on the labelling of agricultural products too – he was always speaking about it – is now reaching grotesque proportions, and as you are aware, Mr President, we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy have reintroduced some reasonable amendments. We agree that the provisions on the labelling of ingredients for both beverage categories can enter into force simultaneously. We can also live with a three‐year time limit for all of this, but anything else would be in contravention of the Treaty, which is why I hope that the House will agree with us.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Whitehead </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I want to support the rapporteur against that attack from his own side. It is not the fault of Mr Schnellhardt that this remained locked in committee for some time. It is not the fault of Mr Schnellhardt that there has been a woeful refusal to see that common policies on labelling require common procedures. It is not the fault of Mr Schnellhardt that there have – to put it mildly – been a number of obstructions.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the people in the committee believe that it is imperative and legitimate that Community provisions having the same objective should be subject to the same legislative procedure, namely that which is laid down in Article 189 of the EC Treaty. We want that to apply both to the specific Community provisions referred to here and to all other alcoholic beverages. We are not involved, and we do not want to be involved, in an argument about what should be on the label. That, for the moment, is the concern of another department.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want to be involved in a North‐versus‐South debate or one between those who have a particular sector of the agricultural market in their care against those who have other such sectors. We do not want to be involved in the stigmatising of alcoholic drinks with the sole exception of areas where new products may present a health hazard for the unwary. We want a uniform opinion. We want all recognised legitimate and traditional alcoholic products incorporated within it. That is why a series of amendments, most notably Nos 9 and 15, seek to include cider and perry on the standard list with wines, spirits and beers.</p>
<p class="contents">I would appeal to the wine enthusiasts here to contribute to the spirit of compromise in bringing about a common procedure. We all have to do that. I have done it myself. I am prepared to accept Mr Bébéar's amendment, supported by the last speaker but one, with regard to the possible dangers of the new alcoholic beverages, the so‐called alcopops. I do that in the full knowledge that these are made in my own constituency. The people who vote for me make these products. I am prepared to say on the record here and now that they can present health hazards and they need to be treated in a special way.</p>
<p class="contents">I never hear any of that spirit of compromise from those who come here and tell us that the drinking of wine is a cultural experience, that somehow it should be left outside all the arrangements and scrutiny of this Parliament. Those who say that and make these rather dreary claims are not just insulting the intelligence of Europe's consumers – most of whom would strongly agree with Mr Schnellhardt and his long labours on this issue. Worse than that, they are insulting this Parliament itself. They are deliberately saying that there is an area of scrutiny and oversight in which this Parliament, in the matter of labelling, should play no part. I cannot accept that and I hope Parliament will not either.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schleicher </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, beverages provide us with some of our nutrition. In my home state of Bavaria, we came to the conclusion back in the 15th century that the consumer also needed to know that his beer was brewed in accordance with precise rules, since beer, after all, is a significant part of the Bavarian diet. There are naturally other drinks as well. Doctors are now recommending that we consume at least three litres of liquid every day, and consumers have a wide range to choose from. However, it is important for them to know the quality that is available on the shelves. I do not believe that consumers would ever enquire whether a beverage comes under the common organisation of agricultural markets or under other areas of the single market. What they need is information that will help them to choose the right product.</p>
<p class="contents">I am thinking of people who have perhaps already consumed too much alcohol and should not therefore drink any more, but this is also about people with diabetes, for example, who need to know how much residual sugar a beverage contains. These are all very important things nowadays, and I believe we need legislation that takes account of today's world and not only prescribes that beer and cider should be displayed in the opposite corner of the shop from wine, but actually provides us with a realistic legal basis. I only wish to appeal to reason. I believe that Mr Schnellhardt's report provides a rational basis, and I should be pleased if Parliament endorsed the material that Mr Schnellhardt has prepared.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Riis‐Jørgensen </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Schnellhardt very much for an excellent report. I think it is important, as many of my colleagues have pointed out this evening, that we do not divide up the alcohol market in such a way that we have one thing in one corner and another somewhere else. It must be a precondition that uniform requirements for the labelling of ingredients apply equally to beer, wines and spirits. That is the first point. The second point is that the rules should come into force simultaneously, in order to avoid a situation in which different rules apply depending on whether one drinks beer, wine or spirits. And the third point is that, in order to ensure uniform rules, it is necessary that the same decision‐making procedure should be used, that the same rules should be applied, with the full involvement of the European Parliament. On behalf of the Liberal Group, therefore, I support Amendment No 1 calling for the addition of Article 129a as the legislative procedure. I also support Amendment No 23, which requires it to be indicated on the bottle how much alcohol or how many ingredients it contains, so that we car‐drivers and others know how much we can drink from a health point of view. I also support Amendment No 12, which prefers the word ‘ingredients' to the phrase ‘prepared with', and finally – as I said before – it is very important that we treat alcoholic beverages uniformly, so I support Amendments Nos 15 and 9.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much hope that we can adopt this report tomorrow. I am well aware that there are major differences between North and South, but I think it incredible – and I agree entirely with Mr Whitehead – that we should talk about culture in connection with wine drinking, whereas beer drinking is regarded as an expression of something completely different. In both cases, we are talking about liquids which are consumed at social gatherings or with a meal. So I very much hope that we can arrive at a situation in which all these things are dealt with uniformly and with the full involvement of Parliament.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cabrol </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span><span class="italic"> – (FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal for a directive amending Directive 79/112/EEC concerns the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs, in the alcoholic beverages sector. This proposal, which does not include rules on the listing of ingredients, nevertheless allows for the indication of these ingredients in the five Community regulations which already exist. The European Commission proposes that this information should enter into force within a period of three years from 1 July 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to make the following comments. First of all we must congratulate the European Commission on taking account of the need for consumer information on the ingredients of alcoholic beverages. However, we must add to this the concerns that may arise regarding the new alcoholic beverages aimed at young people, known as premixes or alcopops, which are not mentioned in this proposal. The presentation and advertising of these drinks attract young people and could result in real damage to public health. It is therefore important that these drinks should be labelled with their ingredients and the percentage of alcohol. The European Commission urgently needs to present a text on these drinks, which are referred to as soft drinks but contain alcohol, and which must be displayed on the wines and spirits shelves in shops.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of these drinks contain more than 3 to 4 % of alcohol by volume; the alcohol is of non‐specific origin and the taste is covered up by sugar. With regard to the drinks that are affected by these labelling measures, and which are mentioned in Article 6(3), we should add to these aromatised wine‐based beverages and aromatised wine‐product cocktails, which are governed by Regulation 1601/91/EEC.</p>
<p class="contents">Beer, meanwhile, is not subject to any specific Community regulation. It would normally be excluded from this article, which is why I would like to ask you to support Amendment No 14 and to reject Amendment No 9 by the rapporteur. This Article 6(3) fixes a period of three years from 1 July 1998 for the application of the labelling rules. This short period already seems to be impossible to apply, because it comes too soon after the adoption of the directive. The period proposed by Amendment No 14 is therefore much more realistic.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as was pointed out by the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the phrase <span class="italic">’élaborée à l"aide de" </span> used in the French version seems less appropriate than the phrase <span class="italic">’préparée à l"aide de"</span> . We therefore prefer the latter form, which is also well known by consumers in the food sector.</p>

I do not know whether this applies to Mr Schnellhardt, and I hope that his report, duly amended, will at last be adopted by this House. There is no doubt, however, that Mr Schnellhardt's desire to include wine among the beverages to be labelled in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 189b of the Treaty has caused a serious and inexcusable delay. Indeed, the Commission referred this proposal to Parliament on 10 February 1997. The committee responsible, the Environment Committee, appointed Mr Schnellhardt rapporteur on 16 April 1997, almost two years ago. And the proposal was an urgent one, all the more so because the Commission itself was behind the schedule laid down in Article 6 of Directive 79/112. Nevertheless, the Environment Committee – which normally examines and approves reports very rapidly, thanks to the efficiency of its chairman – had to discuss this matter no fewer than three times over the two years; this was compounded by an unspecified number of strategic postponements, sometimes due to elections. Why? Because, believing that Parliament's decision should be as broad‐based as possible – a view shared by us all – Mr Schnellhardt sought to remove wine from the scope of the specific measures relating to it, overlooking the fact that, in the case of wine, labelling forms an integral part of its definition: table wine, quality wine and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Those of us who represent regions which are proud to be major producers of wine cannot agree, and I am grateful to the group to which I have the honour of belonging for allowing me to say so in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">No, we cannot agree. It is not – or not merely – so as to protect producers, even though that profession certainly does deserve our consideration, given the esteem in which it is held throughout the world; it is not – or not merely – so as to protect production in our regions; it is also, and I would say above all, so as to protect consumers in Europe and elsewhere. Among these, ladies and gentlemen, I would include keen beer‐drinkers, just in case they should decide – and I hope so for their sakes – to drink a good glass of wine once in a while.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hyland </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Mr President, from a public health perspective it would be difficult to envisage a more important area of administration than the regulations governing food quality. From an agricultural perspective, it is to the credit of our farmers and the food processing industry that they are to the forefront in providing quality food products in a manner compatible with consumer requirements. From the point of view of agricultural reform, it goes without saying that the process of extensification is a credible production base for quality raw material for the food sector. While it has a cost factor for producers, it has not, unfortunately, resulted in a better financial response in the market place.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the agricultural economies of European Union and third countries are moving steadily towards globalisation, it is crucial in the context of the next World Trade talks that those countries committed to food quality and consumer requirements are not put at a disadvantage by countries such as the United States, as is happening at the present time. I fully support the concept of clear, non‐technical and standardised labelling of food products. However, we need to be careful, in our desire for traceability and transparency, to avoid over‐regulation which could lead to lack of innovation and research into new products.</p>
<p class="contents">On genetically modified organisms I would repeat my earlier statements. No food product which is genetically modified or contains ingredients which have been genetically modified should be released into the food chain until it has been fully tested, and only then with clear labelling. To allay consumer concern in this regard, I suggest the colour coding of all labels containing genetically modified ingredients. I also call for an educational programme on the process of genetic engineering as applied to agriculture. Concerns in this regard should be based on fact and not as a response to campaigns designed to play on the fears of consumers. From this point of view we must have an effective educational programme for consumers.</p>

I do not think that you have understood our approach. I really think that you are mistaken. Mr Whitehead, I am a doctor. I do not accept that you could suppose for one moment that I support alcoholism. Every day I fight the battle against this scourge. I cannot accept you talking to us about alcopops. These are evil, deadly drinks which we should remove from consumption and which are dangerous to young people. Mr Whitehead and Mr Schnellhardt, I would like you to think a little about our European culture, which, Mr Whitehead, is represented by savouring a quality wine or whisky in moderation, as part of festivities.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think, my friends, that you realize that not long ago, less than a fortnight ago, we passed an essential reform, the reform of the common organisation of the market in wine. On that occasion we tried to defend the principles of quality and of regionalisation, and the principles of respect for our traditions involving wine and alcoholic beverages, in the interests of the consumer and the diversity that we have across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Labelling, Mr Schnellhardt, is an integral part of what we adopted, providing rules for the presentation of wine and telling people what may be represented by descriptions and designations of origin, such as the châteaux, the Rivesaltes, <span class="italic">Prädikat </span> wines, as you say in German, Mr Schnellhardt, Q&amp;A, and so on. In short, we are here to defend a particular culture. We are following our approach towards the recent common organisation of the market in wine. We want to respect consumers, we want to protect wine, and we will therefore vote against you, Mr Schnellhardt, tomorrow morning.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gillis </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Schnellhardt for his clear and concise introduction to what is a complex, emotive and difficult piece of legislation. As regards the labelling of alcoholic beverages, my position is that consumers have a right to transparency and complete openness. Labelling of all consumer products and in particular all food items, including soft and alcoholic drinks, is essential to give the consumer a clear description of the items concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I realise that traditional products have not normally carried labels as to their content. Also, labelling cannot solve all problems. Labelling must be accurate and checked to ensure consumer confidence. Inaccurate and uncontrolled declarations are useless and bring the whole system into disrepute.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite all these problems, labelling has an important role and should apply to all food products including alcoholic beverages. In the vote I would like to see the proposal to include beer extended to include cider also. Therefore I will be supporting Amendment No 15 as well as Amendment No 9.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, consumer information must be complete and accurate. I therefore support the declaration of ingredients on all food items.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bangemann, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, I have been involved in these debates for eleven years now, and I have experienced all the various efforts to rationalise the area we are discussing again this evening. The Commission has now made another attempt, which actually focuses more on procedural and less on substantive issues, because if we begin with the substance, this proposal will suffer the same fate as the first two proposals. We shall not make any progress. For that reason the approach adopted by the rapporteur, which is the same approach we suggested in our proposal, is undoubtedly the right basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot interfere in internal disputes. It is true that I spoke to the rapporteur, but I do not know whether he delayed the proposal, Mrs Lulling. On the other hand, I have a natural inclination to believe everything you say. However, I have no wish to interfere in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">What did we propose, and what is this argument actually about? I do not intend to involve myself in the question of whether one product is culturally superior, although a great deal could be said about that. After all, wine is mentioned in the Bible, and that is certainly something! As far as these things are concerned, we should not be engaging now in any sort of <span class="italic">Kulturkampf</span> between wine and beer or between wine‐growing areas and beer‐brewing areas. We should be considering how we can ensure that the information which is important to the consumer is actually on the label. That, in short, is what we all want to achieve. That is certainly an aim on which there are no differences.</p>
<p class="contents">If that is our common aim, we cannot ignore the fact that there are already very detailed specific rules for certain alcoholic beverages, as well as very experienced institutions which exercise responsibility for ensuring compliance with these rules. That is really no more than what we are proposing. We are not trying to say that there is a difference in quality between wine and beer, or between beer and grappa or whatever; the real question is whether we make use of what we already have and thereby avoid any duplication of effort. The wine market and the rules governing the sale of wine are already highly sophisticated, and if we were now to overlay the whole structure, as it were, with a set of general provisions, Mr Schnellhardt, the result would surely be a situation in which consumers would tend to lose their bearings and in which producers could face the biggest problems. That is really the only crucial difference.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I could not fail to notice during the discussion that there are very widely differing positions on this issue in Parliament. That always suits us, because we can then wait and see which position prevails. That is precisely what I would suggest we do in this case. However, I can imagine that the Council will be more inclined to subscribe to our proposal. But there too, of course, we can wait and see.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to move on now to say a few words on the various amendments, so that you can consider our positions on these when deciding how to vote. We can accept Amendment No 3, which proposes an additional recital enunciating the two aims of the proposal, namely consumer protection and consolidation of the single market. We certainly have no problem with that. The same applies to Amendment No 17.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 1 is unnecessary in our opinion, as there is no need to supplement the legal basis by adding a reference to Article 129a of the Treaty, because Article 100a also covers consumer protection. In any event, I have no intention of interfering in the dispute between the legal services. We made this proposal in the way we always make proposals. We chose what seemed to us to be the most logical legal basis. If there is a feeling that Article 43 should also be included because we are dealing with disparate products, that can naturally be done too.</p>
<p class="contents">I have said that we make a distinction between wine, aromatised wines and spirits because we already have comprehensive Community rules for these, including provisions on labelling. It seems logical to us that the rules on the listing of ingredients on the labels of these beverages – we shall still have to reach agreement on the substance of those rules, of course – ought to be adapted in the framework of the new provisions. We shall certainly have new provisions, but they must serve as the basis for the adaptation of these specified rules, and not vice versa.</p>
<p class="contents">For beverages that are not covered by Community regulations, such as beer and cider, the labelling provisions must be laid down in Commission directives. The question will then arise, Mr Schnellhardt, as to the legal basis we have to adopt and the form of parliamentary involvement. I appreciate that Parliament naturally prefers to work with a procedure that requires, or virtually requires, its consent and thereby strengthens the position of Parliament. But this cannot be taken so far that the principle is even applied in cases where it offers no practical benefit. There is no point in waging a conflict of competence at someone else's expense. I consider that very unwise.</p>
<p class="contents">We can accept the improvements of wording in Amendment No 14, and we can also accept the extension to five years of the time‐limit for the adoption of procedures. But that should then apply to all products. Amendment No 19 proposes that it should only apply to wine and spirits. We believe that this amounts to unfair treatment, which we cannot accept. For the same reason, we cannot accept Amendments Nos 5, 6, 7, 11, 16 and 20 or the second part of Amendments Nos 9 and 15. The first part of Amendments Nos 9 and 15 is acceptable to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 2, 10 and 18, which are evidently designed to make Article 6 of Directive 79/112 directly applicable to other beverages such as cider or new industrial products, are unacceptable to us, because we should have to insist on the listing of ingredients on the labels of these beverages as soon as the amending directive was adopted, whereas the same requirement would not yet apply to wine, beer and spirits. This means that we should then have another case of unfair treatment, although this time the boot would be on the other foot.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as these beverages are concerned, by the way, the real problem has more to do with consumers being misled, which is due in many cases to strict application of Article 2 of Directive 79/112. This could very easily be resolved through the watchdog bodies in the Member States. It is not so much a matter of new rules.</p>
<p class="contents">We suggested in our proposal that the list of ingredients should be preceded by the words ‘produced from' in cases where it is impossible to include every ingredient in the list. It could be decided, for example, not to include water among the contents of many of these beverages, such as whisky, because it is not one of the active ingredients. Mrs Schleicher put forward an argument that might be difficult to sustain. She said that when consumers are already under the influence of alcohol to a certain extent, they can consult the label on the beverage to see whether they can drink another glass of it, but I submit that by the time they reach that state, they will no longer be able to read the label anyway!</p>
<p class="contents">We are not happy with the wording of Amendments Nos 12 and 22, which implies in some languages that wine is the product of a manufacturing process, and so we do not wish to accept those amendments. We cannot accept Amendments Nos 4 and 13 either, but we shall incorporate the standard article on consulting the Scientific Committee; in other words, we accept the role of the Scientific Committee in principle. Amendments Nos 23 and 24 relate to the problem of alcoholism. That is no more a subject for this debate than the GMO problem – the honourable Member who raised the question of genetically modified organisms has left already. The problem, of course, has already been the subject of an expert opinion from the medical side. Mr Schnellhardt, by the way, is a medic too. You specialists can discuss this later among yourselves.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Vets are also medics, and animals are sometimes harder to treat than humans. On the other hand, I have to admit that alcoholism is not a great problem among animals!</p>
<p class="contents">Let me ask in conclusion that we establish our agreement on one point, namely that these are truly products with a long tradition. We need not pit one tradition against the other in a <span class="italic">Kulturkampf</span> , but it is clear that these traditions are worth preserving. The problem of alcoholism does not arise in connection with beverages that a consumer buys and drinks because he or she values its taste and quality. No consumer will buy a bottle of Pétrus or Amarone in order to get drunk. There are certainly cheaper ways to do that, and this is something we all have to appreciate. We cannot be indiscriminate and lump everyone together. That would be unfair to many people – including, incidentally, the average consumer of alcoholic beverages. Consumers are not so stupid that they cannot obtain information unless we prescribe labels for them to read. We should not think of consumers as beings that we alone can release from ignorance.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not object to having a little more information on a label, but I know exactly which alcoholic beverages I drink and which ones I do not. Within the various categories too, I choose very carefully, even if there is no information at all on the label.</p>
