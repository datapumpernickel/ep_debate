<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Medina Ortega (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, the Commission has presented a proposed regulation intended to amend another Community regulation, Regulation (EEC) 1911/91, which established a special legal status for the Canary Islands.</p>
<p class="contents">Regulation (EEC) 1911/91 is in turn a regulation which amends the statute established for these islands by the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Community in 1985. The Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Community – in article 25 and in Protocol 2 annexed to that Act – provided the Canary Islands with a special status which was designed to reflect the fact that those islands were not integrated into the Common agricultural policy and, furthermore, because it was not subject to the Community Customs Union, the Community customs rules, nor Value Added Tax. In this way, the Act of Accession intended to maintain as far as possible the special status which the Canary Islands had had within the Spanish State since their incorporation into the Kingdom of Castile in the 15th Century. It was a region which was not subject to the ordinary tax regime nor, therefore, the customs rules, owing to its great distance from Peninsular Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">The Act of Accession of 1985 contained a future development clause – section 4 of article 25 – which was aimed at preventing the Canary Islands, as a result of European Union development, from being excluded from European construction. I would say that public opinion in the Canary Islands was, on the one hand, in favour of maintaining this special status but, on the other hand, had no desire whatsoever to remain outside the sphere of European construction.</p>
<p class="contents">When the Single Act was adopted in 1986, it became necessary to amend that special status and this was done by means of Regulation (EEC) 1911/91. That amendment establishes three or four very important changes: firstly, the Canary Islands were incorporated into the Common agricultural policy and the Common fisheries policy; secondly, they were incorporated into the Community Customs Union, and are therefore subject to ordinary customs duties; and thirdly, it removed the special tax rules which they had, specifically the island taxes – the so-called special licence tax arrangements – which were designed to protect local industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Regulation (EEC) 1911/91 has led to the progressive dismantling of the Canary Islands’ special tax rules and their incorporation into the Community’s common rules. But this has caused difficulties, because the problem with the Canary Islands, as with the other outermost regions – the Azores, Madeira and the French overseas departments – is that they are a long way from European territory, divided into small island areas, with very small markets, with enormous transport problems and, furthermore, with problems due, for example, to over-population, very irregular rain patterns and poor soil, which hinder the development of normal activities. This explains why, in the past, the Canary Islands always enjoyed a special status within Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">The dismantling of the Canary Islands’ special tax status, in terms of customs duties, would threaten to dismantle a series of small local industries – food, tobacco and small commercial industries – which would disappear if we were to remove that small degree of protection provided by their special taxes, specifically the tax on production and imports.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been thorough and has taken account of this, and has therefore begun a negotiation of an adaptation of the tax on production and imports, in order that that tax may not disappear. There has also been another issue: the Treaty of Maastricht of 1992 included a declaration recognising the special status of the outermost regions – the Canary Islands, the Azores, Madeira and the French overseas departments – and section 2 of article 299 of the EC Treaty, after its amendment by means of the Treaty of Amsterdam of 1997, provides for special status for the outermost regions. The Treaty of Amsterdam is now in force.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the thinking behind the new status for the outermost regions – which was also confirmed by the Cologne European Council which asked the Commission to present measures for the outermost regions before 31 December – at the moment the incorporation of these regions into the European Union does not necessarily require tax and customs harmonisation, but rather allows differentiated treatment, for example the maintenance of the port charges in the French overseas departments and the special rules for the Azores and Madeira.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Commission’s proposed regulation began to be negotiated before the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, in the Committee on Legal Affairs – which in general approves the proposed regulation, since it is aimed at delaying the removal of the Canary Islands’ taxes and therefore plays a protective role – we believe that, after the entry into force of article 299.2, rather than a simple easing of the limits of the special treatment, we need to paralyse the removal of this special treatment because it is possible that, in the measures which the Commission must propose for the outermost regions in accordance with the said article 299.9, which provides for special measures in the field of fiscal policy, the Commission may allow a limited reinstatement so that the relevant small local industries do not suffer.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said before, Mr President, the Committee on Legal Affairs unanimously approved the regulations, but proposes a series of amendments intended to indicate that article 299.2, which is already in force, establishes an additional basis for the Commission’s proposed regulation. We are not trying to oppose the Commission’s regulation, which establishes an additional basis. That additional basis would justify a measure which one could describe as containing and detaining the removal of customs duties. As a consequence of that reference to article 299.2 and the thinking which I am explaining at the moment, the Committee on Legal Affairs has proposed a series of amendments to the annexes of the regulation to halt the removal of customs duties in any of the areas where they are currently in force. It is a question of maintaining the current protectionist structure of the taxes until the Commission presents its new proposals in the field of tax policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner knows, next week in Brussels a partnership meeting will take place in which the Commission will discuss the proposals with the governments of France, Spain and Portugal, the governments of the Autonomous Regions and the MEPs from those regions. Therefore, it would seem appropriate that the Commission approve and express its agreement with Parliament’s proposals – the proposals of the Committee on Legal Affairs – which are very reasonable and are in accordance with the Commission’s thinking but reinforce it by referring to the new article 299.2, which will provide for and allow the development of a special status. It does not make much sense now to totally remove the system when in a few months it is possible that the Commission will have to propose its reinstatement. This is the thinking, this is the problem, and I hope that Parliament will follow the recommendations of the Committee on Legal Affairs, approve the regulation and also approve the 19 amendments which the said Committee has proposed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ripoll y Martínez de Bedoya (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Good morning, Mr President. Firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Members who have presented amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the words of Mr Medina Ortega have clarified the approach and position which the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has agreed unanimously, on this essential issue, an issue which is important for the Canary Islands, but which affects all the other outermost regions of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With reference to the subject of today’s debate, the Canary Islands, I must say that few regions have lived or are living through such an intense process of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Since their incorporation in 1986, the Canary Islands have held significant and intense debates. There have been public demonstrations for and against the full incorporation of the islands, there have been governmental crises and even the resignation of the President of an autonomous government, the specific cause of which was the conditions for the accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">After thirteen years, it is time to make an assessment. To this end the regulation which we are debating at the moment in Parliament is very useful, since from this assessment we can reach conclusions which will allow us to determine the position we must take. The assessment is clearly positive, although we must recognise that there are enormous worries and concerns attached to it, as the rapporteur has explained effectively. These concerns stem from what we are debating here, but also from other issues which are being studied and dealt with by this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that at the moment in the Canaries there is a lot of uncertainty with regard to the future of bananas, since the Canary Islands are Europe’s top producer of that fruit, which is so important from economic, social, scenic and environmental points of view.</p>
<p class="contents">However – and I repeat – today we are talking about Regulation 1911/91 concerning the application of Community Law to the Canary Islands. The arguments and explanations which the rapporteur has given us today are clear and describe the long journey made by the Canary Islands to arrive at the process of incorporation into the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless it is essential in our opinion that this reform is carried out within the time frame laid down. This is an absolutely essential issue. We should remember the mandate of the Cologne European Council to the Commission; we should remember that before the end of 1999 there was supposed to be specific and special treatment which has still not happened; we should remember that at the moment we are debating the Commission’s legislative agenda for 2000. It is important that in this legislative agenda we include the special treatments laid down in article 299.2 of the EC Treaty for the French overseas departments, the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands, because, otherwise, we would reach a situation or position in which these European regions, which are vital to each of the Member States and to the European Union, are put at an absolute disadvantage in relation to the European Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">To end, I would like to say that our Group supports the 19 amendments and the legislative text, but asks that we do not proceed to a second reading, but that this regulation be approved within the time limits laid down. We ask the Commission to be sensitive to the rapporteur’s views, to the views of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and that, please, the regulation be approved within the envisaged time limits because, otherwise, the situation in the Canary Islands would be of great concern. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course our intention is not simply to support a colleague. In reality our position – now through this intervention and later through our vote – is that of Spaniards and Europeans, and perhaps even more as Spanish and European Socialists, who are expressing their solidarity with the Canary Islands and their men and women. I am speaking of a solidarity which the Canary Islands require in a specific and particular way, precisely because of the specific and particular characteristics of their geography and history.</p>
<p class="contents">Let it be clear therefore that what we want is to give a little more to the Canaries, to compensate for adverse conditions, and thereby prevent a situation where they have a little less than the other Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, Manuel Medina, has explained in a rigorous and full way the legal arguments which explain how the Canaries has been defended for centuries, within a Spanish context, by means of different mechanisms which allowed those distant islands to overcome the negative circumstances which I spoke of earlier, and, with the skill, tenacity and efforts of their men and women, firstly resist and then gradually build reasonably modern and prosperous societies.</p>
<p class="contents">We were aware of the problems of the Canary Islands when we negotiated the accession of our country to the European Community and the successive Treaties, up until Amsterdam, and the constant concern to always take that special situation into account was reflected in the special Protocol 2 of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, back in 1985, in Council Regulation (EEC) 1911/91, which approved the said Protocol, and in section 2 of article 299 of the EC Treaty, which describes the outermost regions of the Union, with special mention of the Canary Islands and lays down the very flexibility in the application of general rules in certain vulnerable cases which we are discussing today.</p>
<p class="contents">It was precisely Protocol 2, which I referred to earlier, which, applying traditional formulas to the new rules, established the so-called “APIM” (Tax on Production and Exports), a modest duty applied to certain products entering the Canary Islands, many of which originate from the Spanish Peninsular and others from other States.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment there is a process under way which will lead to the negotiation between the Spanish Government and the Commission, with a view to amending the said Regulation (EEC) 1911/91, which specifically regulates the APIM in question. The concern which this amendment has caused in the Canary Islands – and which we are recognising here – has increased as a result of a certain lack of confidence in the ability of the government of my country to appreciate the true nature and gravity of this problem and in its desire to tackle that problem in the said negotiation with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality there are only three alternatives. The first is the complete removal of the APIM, which would have very negative effects for the many small and medium-sized businesses on the islands which, although they make little profit from their production, survive thanks to the fact that similar products arriving from outside are taxed, and it is therefore still viable to continue producing them in the Canaries.</p>
<p class="contents">The second alternative is less harsh but ultimately just as harmful. It would consist of eliminating the APIM gradually until it disappears completely after a few years, perhaps maintaining them partially for a few products.</p>
<p class="contents">The third solution is the one which Professor Medina proposes and which we understand that the Canary Islands requires and wants, the one which this Parliament will probably vote for in a few moments. Based on the legal considerations of the EC Treaty, we argue that the APIM be kept as it is for now, and that it be consolidated within the obligatory reform of Regulation (EEC) 1911/91. We hope that this Parliament is up to the job and does not disappoint our fellow citizens …</p>

<p class="contents">In fact, when the Kingdom of Spain acceded to the European Community in 1985 the door was left open for an amendment of the status of the European model for the Canary Islands. In 1991, when Regulation 1911/91 was approved, we experienced Community adaptation with regard to the application of the provisions of Community Law in the islands.</p>
<p class="contents">At that point a transitional period of ten years was set so that the integration of the economy of the Canary Islands into the Community would not be traumatic for some local production sectors and, <span class="italic">de facto,</span> amongst other things, a tax on production and imports, the APIM, was established with a view to protecting the integration of small basic Canary Island industries into the Community Customs Area.</p>
<p class="contents">The said tax, which protected local industry in relation to imported goods, would be gradually dismantled between 1995 and the end of 2000. Curiously, this removal of the APIM has not had the desired effect amongst the sensitive industries in the Canary Islands and therefore the Spanish authorities, the Canarian authorities and the economic operators affected have requested that the Community authorities amend Regulation 1911/91 in order to stop the removal of the APIM until June 2000, which the European Commission appreciates.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, some of us, as Members from the Canary Islands, as well as considering it reasonable to extend the validity of this tax in accordance with the Commission’s proposal, have requested by means of amendments that it affect the most sensitive products, all the sensitive products produced in the Canary Islands.</p>
<p class="contents">We also request that this customs approach be applied to a new tax with a structure similar to the old APIM, with the aim of incorporating it into a package of specific measures of a fiscal nature which the Council, on the proposal of the Commission, must implement next year – as Mr Ripoll y Martínez de Bedoya and Mr Medina Ortega have just said – by means of the proposed permanent statute for the outermost regions – which include the Canary Islands – in implementation of article 299.2, which provides for differentiated treatment, as you know, with regard to the application of the provisions of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">This very week the Autonomous Parliament of the Canary Islands, during a political debate on this issue, unanimously approved an agreement which includes fiscal measures and asks Europe to provide for the establishment of a tax similar to the APIM.</p>
<p class="contents">Congratulations to Mr Medina Ortega on his report and on his receptiveness to the amendments presented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Following its examination of the APIM/Arbitrio on production and imports in the Archipelago, the Commission concluded that even if the majority of economic sectors could adapt to the requirements of the single market, the disappearance of the APIM on 31 December 2000 could irremediably affect certain product sectors. This point has already been made in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, in collaboration with the Spanish and the Canarian authorities, has identified the most sensitive products in a number of sectors. For these products the Commission considers it necessary to suspend the dismantling of the tax for a transitional period which will not go beyond 30 June 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">I note with satisfaction that Mr Medina Ortega's report largely supports the approach proposed by the Commission. However, he considers it regrettable that the measure proposed is reserved to a limited number of products and that it does not refer to the legal basis provided by Article 299(2) of the Treaty. I can assure you that the Commission understands this position perfectly.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like nevertheless to draw your attention to the fact that this constitutes a time-limited adaptation of the current rules. It must therefore be distinguished from any measure which could be taken on the basis of the new Article 299(2) of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal stipulates that the Commission, in collaboration with the Spanish authorities will examine before the disappearance of the APIM the effects of this tax on the sectors concerned. The Commission will submit, if necessary, a proposal to the Council based on Article 299(2) on the measures which would be necessary in order not to compromise the existence of certain particularly fragile local activities. The products included in the annex to this proposal are the result of work by the Spanish and the Canarian authorities and the Commission. Consequently, any amendment to the list of the products must, on the one hand, be justified economically and, on the other hand, be subject to a study by the Commission services in order to check the consistency of the measures with its other policies. The Commission has not yet received such justification which would enable it to study an amendment to the Regulation's annex. It is not therefore in a position to accept those amendments concerning the extension of the list of the products. However, I can assure both you, Mr President, and the rapporteur that in future negotiations on a proposal concerning the Canary Islands on the basis of Article 299(2) of the Treaty that the Commission will take account of your comments on the matter and the comments of Parliament during the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank you for your support for this proposal and I will undertake to draw the attention of the Commissioner responsible to this whole debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
