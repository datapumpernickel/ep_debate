<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bullmann (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Lisbon Summit has bequeathed a great heritage. It defined a major task and disseminated a courageous idea: that by the year 2010 Europe will become the most competitive area in the world. The summit placed its bets on the best Europe has to offer. It stated that we are on the road towards full employment. It also made it clear that we want to stake our hopes on the innovative power of the people of the European Union, on their ability to educate and train themselves, to take their destiny into their own hands, and to bring about their own prosperity and that of their families. This is the strongest productive force that Europe can release.</p>
<p class="contents">This central idea logically leads to a political approach which says that economic reform, social involvement, social cohesion and job creation go hand in hand. They are interacting facets of one and the same process along this path to success, and they must be of mutual support. They must not be played off against each other.</p>
<p class="contents">For many of us this is a challenge to our way of thinking. Many people who have striven their entire lives to achieve a common liberalised market will have to make some mental effort to realise that only social cohesion and employment policies can produce the social productivity which will make the common market a success. Others, who have prided themselves all their lives on the achievements of the Member States, will also have to make some mental effort to realise that the new enlarged common market calls for concerted efforts and new rules to ensure that the process to achieve success can be implemented everywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stockholm Summit comes precisely at this decisive moment. It will decide whether the ambitious goals of Lisbon can be implemented, or whether the citizens of Europe think that we are dealing with nicely worded but empty statements which would have no real impact on political reality. Those who want success in Stockholm must measure and compare how far we have come along the road to success. Above all, they must have the courage to set new ambitious targets so that we can move further along the road to success.</p>
<p class="contents">We are told that concrete objectives are difficult to set. Of course they are. But just take a complex issue like inflation rates, which is dependent on many decentralised actors making clever decisions. On the way to economic and monetary union we clearly managed to introduce a very successful process which has led to success which we would not have believed possible up until a few years ago. Take a complex issue like interest rate trends or the dismantling of excessive national debt. We have achieved all this with a common effort, and these are all complex matters which call for more than one participant. If we can achieve all this, then we will surely manage to give every schoolchild in the European Union access to the Internet. We will be able to set up conditions in which all schoolchildren will not only have access to the Internet but will make decisive progress in the rest of their school curriculum to ensure that, when they enter the European labour market, they will have the opportunities they need.</p>
<p class="contents">If we can achieve all this, then we will surely be able to offer every entrepreneur in the European Union a clear, easily comprehensible and simple regulatory framework, which operates in exactly the same way in Spain, Greece, Italy and Germany alike. If we can achieve all this, then we will surely be able to call upon the strongest productive power in Europe. We will be able to offer the still more than 14 million unemployed in the European Union real opportunities of taking part in this process of bringing about success.</p>
<p class="contents">We still have an employment rate of over 8% and I would like to draw your attention to a situation which was given short shrift in the debate in the Commission: the fact that we have a youth unemployment rate which is twice as high. This is a major problem, especially since we are saying here today that we want to make the demographic change manageable, and we want to rely on the intelligence in people’s heads and invest in heads. Much more could be done in practical terms to combat youth unemployment and to invest in the future of Europe. But for that very reason it is also proper for the Commission, in a preparatory paper in the run-up to Stockholm, to propose that in Stockholm we should look at very specific goals to increase the employment rate to 67% by 2005 and to strengthen the participation of women in the labour force to 57%.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the right goals to set and we, as the European Parliament, as the representatives of the people of Europe, want to see these goals documented in the final report of the Stockholm Summit. We think it is important that the people of Europe read about targets which they can readily understand, with which they can identify and in which they can see that their prospects of success in Europe lie. This will also help us to decide whether there is acceptance of the necessary enlargement of the European Union, which we all want. But we must also send out a clear signal that all who are currently disadvantaged and who want to contribute their resources will have the opportunity to do so. Whoever wants to must move forward courageously and overcome the rivalries between the European institutions. The people of Europe do not understand the petty jealousies over the allocation of competences. It must be made clear that the European Council is assuming its leadership role and that Parliament is taking up its proper place, the place to which it is entitled as the directly elected representative of the people of Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">Last year in Lisbon, the European Union, as Mr Bullmann has pointed out, set itself a goal which meant achieving over the next decade the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, allowing us to achieve sustainable economic growth with the creation of more jobs and greater social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bullmann has stressed this global vision, a vision that I share absolutely, to which, of course, the Commission’s synthesis report responds. In this synthesis report the Commission not only tries to define the progress made so far since Lisbon but also what our next goals are. And Mr Bullmann has stressed this point too.</p>
<p class="contents">In Lisbon people said we should set some structural indicators that would enable us to draw a better comparison between the situations in the various countries. In Nice we defined 35 structural indicators, which are the ones the synthesis report is based upon. There is no doubt at all that they are useful tools for seeing the progress that has been made, the concrete objectives defined and the timetables for achieving them. They are also a reference for the progress we can make in the next few years.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that in the way we designed them these indicators are not solely for use in the synthesis report; they will also be used in other Commission reports, such as the report on the implementation or fulfilment of the obligations resulting from setting the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines in motion.</p>
<p class="contents">The report – I am not going to repeat it – highlights what we consider to be the positive progress achieved during this period. There are clearly some elements, such as the progress made on certain liberalisations, that are without any doubt clearly positive. In other cases things are moving too slowly.</p>
<p class="contents">While success may focus, for instance, on the improved reorientation of the economic policy guidelines, taking the Lisbon objectives on board, or on subjects such as the approval of the taxation package, the European company statute or the adoption of the social Agenda in Nice, it is also true that there are areas where we are lagging behind, such as the Community patent, the Galileo programme, or others as significant as the lifelong learning strategy or the tax benefit systems, which are certainly fundamental for growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, the synthesis report highlights the good performance of the economy, the growth achieved last year and that expected next year, and the creation of 2.5 million jobs, which is, without any doubt, a fundamental point.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, the synthesis report aims to stress that the Lisbon objective is a global objective, as Mr Bullmann has pointed out. We must not just think exclusively about growth and forget about the other aspects of Lisbon. There is no doubt that macro-economic growth and stability are fundamental elements, but employment and social cohesion are too.</p>
<p class="contents">We have included in the synthesis report, as Mr Bullmann has mentioned, a series of specific proposals, ten priorities that the Commission would like to see approved at the Stockholm European Council, so that they will enable us to make progress in strengthening our commitments to structural and social change, which is fundamental for the sustainable economic growth that will enable us to reduce unemployment and improve cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner responsible for Economic and Financial Affairs I should like to say a little more about three points that I think are relevant: first of all, the maintenance and strengthening of a stable macro-economic framework. In addition to the objective already mentioned of achieving a knowledge-based society with better jobs, I believe it is important to achieve a stable environment allowing us to achieve the objectives of price stability and healthy public finances in the medium term.</p>
<p class="contents">In the current favourable economic climate, despite the slowing of American growth, I believe we have to continue the processes of fiscal consolidation and improving the quality and sustainability of public finances, taking into account aspects as important as the ageing of the population, for instance. When I say quality, I mean especially a fiscal policy aimed more towards creating jobs, supporting research and innovation, and increasing investment in human resources. When I say sustainability of public finances I mean the ability to meet future obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">The second of my concerns is that we have to strengthen the potential growth of the Union. It is a fact that good progress has been made on the reforms needed so that we can maintain a model of permanent growth. Yet in this period of economic boom we have a unique opportunity to improve the internal market for services and achieve greater openings in sectors such as energy, transport and others that benefit the consumer. We are aware, of course, that any liberalisation process has to be accompanied at the same time by a regulation control plan, which in the end will allow us to achieve positive effects without a negative impact on society.</p>
<p class="contents">My last comment refers to job creation and a rise in the activity rate: we must remember that two thirds of the difference between the gross domestic product levels of the United States and the European Union is due precisely to the different use of the work factor. It is therefore absolutely fundamental to set in motion all the necessary fiscal and social reforms, including early retirement, pension plans or labour regulations, which will enable us to improve this situation. Also fundamental are elements like education and training, business incentives and also public investment, essential for job quality. All this should enable us Europeans to make progress along the line defined in Lisbon, which we all want to be consolidated in Stockholm.</p>
<p class="contents">The reports we are dealing with here, the Bullmann report and the Gasòliba i Böhm report, include a large number of suggestions that are very close to the content of the synthesis report. My idea is to take into consideration all these references and indications, some of which refer to specific indicators, and analyse them to see to what extent some of the elements put forward can be incorporated in our future reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is right when it points out that for the Lisbon strategy to be successful it is absolutely essential to have the commitment of all the players involved in the process. From this viewpoint the two reports presented to the House today are without any doubt basic elements and a clear expression of Parliament’s commitment to cooperate in the Lisbon process, which – as I said earlier – we hope will continue and improve with the decisions made in Stockholm.</p>

I believe that both Mr Bullmann’s report and my own make a positive and constructive contribution to our thinking on how to achieve this goal and our ability to take stock and analyse the situation after the past year, before the Stockholm European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategic goal of the European Union economy is to turn itself into the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. All these objectives are highly demanding. The European Union will not give up its level of social cohesion as an economy based on well-being, which is one of the great features of European society, achieved and consolidated during the second half of the last century. At the same time it is a clearly dynamic economy, as it has been demonstrating over these last years.</p>
<p class="contents">But nobody can fail to see that having such strong social commitments, ensuring sustainable growth and also being the most competitive economy in the world are three highly demanding objectives, and to meet them we must therefore keep well on top of any possible obstacles to achieving this.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, something that may jeopardise the joint achievement of these three objectives is if the basic factors that ensure the competitiveness of the European economy are not implemented rigorously enough. I believe there are basically three of these factors.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, there are some markets that are still not open enough to competition, and given that they are basic to our production structure they have a negative effect on cost structures, including unit prices for goods and services. Mr Solbes has mentioned them: energy, transport and telecommunications. They are obviously fundamental factors, and if we compare them with the other leading world economy, the United States, we still have a gap to make up, clearly preventing us from approaching this desired level of competitiveness which we have set for 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">In second place is a subject that concerns me greatly and is very well expressed both in the Bullmann report and my own: employment. It is obvious that we cannot give up the idea of raising employment levels, which is one of the major goals set by the Swedish Presidency. But it is also obvious that to achieve this level of employment – and as both reports point out, with a more highly qualified labour force – we have to find a greater willingness to adapt, both socially – there are countries within the European Union that have very interesting formulas in this respect – and, as the 1995 Delors report said, in the sphere of labour market flexibility. This is an essential factor in achieving two objectives, that is, a higher employment rate and greater competitiveness throughout the productive structure, where of course the labour dimension is fundamental.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, education. I shall not labour this point, since the Bullmann report has mentioned it, as has Commissioner Solbes. This third essential element is that of quality education at all levels, from occupational training to specialist studies in higher education. This must lay the foundations – I am finishing here, Mr President – for us to get what we really need, something that Europe has not yet achieved in comparison with the United States. Although we have a very high level of scientific training and scientific innovation, we still have not closed the gap on the United States, nor have we overcome the existing difference to achieve a kind of technological development that can be turned into competitive goods and services. This is the third fundamental recommendation in this analysis and stock-taking of the Lisbon European Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have listened with particular interest to Mr Bullmann’s report on Parliament’s contribution to the Stockholm Summit and would particularly like to welcome the holistic approach of the report, namely that all parts of the agenda floated in Lisbon must be implemented if Europe is to achieve the ambitious target which we drew up, i.e. for Europe within ten years to be the world’s most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy, with the opportunity of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and increased social cohesion. Full employment must constitute a fundamental aim for EU economic and social policy. The strategy adopted in Lisbon is an important milestone in the development of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the employment targets in the Lisbon strategy, the Council agrees with the Bullmann report’s proposal for intermediate targets. We hope that the Council will be able to decide on this in Stockholm.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s Europe is better equipped than it has been for a long time to extend the opportunity to work to everyone who wants to, and is able to, work. The outlook for the European economy is still good. Public finances are strong. Prices are stable. Reforms of the product and capital markets are well underway across Europe. However, there is no room for complacency, as 14 million people in Europe are still out of work. Unemployment is a massive waste of economic resources and – what is worse – of people’s skills and ambitions. Having a job means the chance of providing for oneself and, in the long term, is the best way to achieve a society in which everyone can feel they are taking part.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stockholm European Council on 23–24 March will be the first in a series of spring summits aimed at encouraging development towards the strategic aims established in Lisbon. In Stockholm we should openly and critically assess the progress made in the last year. We intend to move the work forward both through Community legislation and what is known as the new open method of coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">The Swedish Presidency will work on not letting the Lisbon strategy be derailed by adding too many new issues. Nor do we need any new processes. Instead, the Stockholm European Council should highlight certain prioritised areas. Full employment and increased competitiveness will be achieved through economic reform and open and functioning markets, combined with a healthy macro-economic policy which stimulates growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I was interested in what the report from Mr Gasòliba i Böhm had to say on economic reform and growth and agree that the role a policy on economic reform has to play in growth and employment must not be underestimated. However, I would like to stress that economic reform must take place in conjunction with investment in training, a modernised social security system and improved welfare. This also requires a commercial climate which facilitates investment and the establishment of new growth companies.</p>
<p class="contents">I want us in Stockholm to highlight the directions for further progress in these areas. Let me name a few.</p>
<p class="contents">In Stockholm we expect to be able to establish the timetable for liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets. We aim to push on with reform of the financial markets, with regard to which the important Lamfalussy report will provide the foundation for discussions in Stockholm. Furthermore, we need to continue work on opening up the transport markets.</p>
<p class="contents">However, opening up the product and capital markets is not an end in itself. Instead, there are two reasons for this action: it is a tool for growth and increased employment. It is also a tool for increased consumer benefit – lower prices and a greater range and better quality of goods and services. In this context, we are also aware that external trade policy has a role to play, and we hope to be able to shed light on this issue too in Stockholm.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stockholm Summit should also emphasise the significance of new technology by developing the action plan for <span class="italic">e</span>-Europe and removing obstacles to the growth of biotechnology and its significance for innovation and growth. However, we must also take into account the moral and ethical dimension of biotechnology.</p>
<p class="contents">Expected demographic development in Europe poses a growing challenge. Low birth rates and an increasing proportion of older people threatens to considerably increase the maintenance burden for people of working age from around 2010 onwards. Demographic development must be tackled on a broad political front right now. This will require an extensive review of pension systems and systems for health care and care of the elderly. It will also require measures to increase participation in the labour market. The significance of improved conditions for families with children, increased equality and lifelong learning should be highlighted more clearly as means of meeting the demographic challenges. As more people take up employment, the focus on working conditions increases. The aim in Stockholm is to be able to agree on a definition of the concept of quality at work and its significance for growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress the vital importance which the successful development of economic and monetary union has for stability and welfare in Europe. The Swedish Presidency will be actively working to ensure that the introduction of notes and coins in euros in the currency union at the start of 2002 is an unqualified success. This is in the interests of us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I shall at least try to make my position clear on some aspects of this report which have concerned Parliament in reaction to the Commission’s initiative and the commitments announced by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Other Members have effectively summed up the most significant results of the Lisbon Summit already. The goal of full employment is once again proposed as the object of common attention and common commitment. We all know it will not be achieved tomorrow, but we declare it achievable under certain conditions. We have found a new determination to build the most open and competitive economic area in Europe based on the information and knowledge society, and updating the package of operational instruments which accompany that effort. But above all, we have asserted that these results can be achieved without adding a fourth process to the existing ones, through a solid combination of policies. There needs to be a complementary approach in economic policy, employment policy and social policy, and of course the policies being associated and combined to achieve the objectives must be compatible in terms of internal consistency.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the special spring European Council provides a clear opportunity for everyone to take stock of progress made and of the effective implementation of the processes and decisions which have been taken, noting any successes and any delays, through the open method of coordination. I would like to talk about that for a moment, because open coordination is certainly different from superimposing Community policies and guidelines on the policies of the national states and societies that operate within that framework, but it is also something more than empty coordination. Open coordination cannot be a magic formula, nor can it be an empty declaration, and it should mobilise public opinion in support of a European project that guarantees transparency and effective opportunities for verification.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not acceptable for the stability pact and convergence parameters to be backed by instruments and offices for checking, measuring and, where necessary, censure. They are backed by weapons and police forces, whereas economic policy choices consistent with the aims I referred to earlier, supporting competition and growth, active policies on employment, investment in human capital, investment in lifelong learning, equal opportunities and regaining regional structural advantages, are very often largely dependent on commitments that are so solemnly affirmed and proclaimed but so little verified or verifiable. That would disarm our advocacy, however prophetic, of the virtues of the European economic and social model.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, comparable data should be made available, together with a rigorous social glossary which would make it impossible to go on using the same words with different meanings, as has sometimes happened, but, most of all – which is worse – to go on using the same words and doing different things. Hence the importance of the proposal on indicators to stop us constantly changing policies to maintain the scientific phenomenon of perpetual motion, that strange experiment which keeps a process moving while at the same time preventing it from reaching any goal.</p>

The rapporteur proposes a dynamic combination of measures based on a complementary perception of economic reform, employment and social policy, illustrating the added benefits for each of these sectors. We can only hope that future follow-ups to Lisbon will apply the same policy and demonstrate the same soundness of judgment and consistency.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to comment, in particular, on the importance of the knowledge economy and of investments in human resources as a basic element of European policy. Lifelong learning is a prime means for the European economy of developing the human capital which a knowledge society needs at its disposal. We need more educated, suitably trained workers in all leading-edge sectors. Lifelong learning is not a new philosophy; it is a serious political proposal to allow human resources to adapt and evolve in the face of new developments.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to ensure that suitable information networks are created, to which all citizens have access, without exclusion and without a cost barrier. All current obstacles to lifelong learning should be dealt with and removed. This is a social cost which we need to bear in the belief that it will yield a maximum return, for the benefit of the European social and political model.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point which I should like to highlight is the free movement of students, teachers, instructors and researchers, in order to strengthen the role of education in the nascent knowledge-based European society. However, measures must also be taken to avoid the obvious danger of information poverty. Care must be taken to ensure that labour market flexibility does not lead to new forms of insecurity and marginalisation for workers.</p>
<p class="contents">In today's era of globalisation and huge technological changes in everyday life, citizens need to be given more opportunity to adapt and evolve and additional cultural choices. We need to strengthen culture in general in Europe and the cultural environment which is directly linked to the economic and social situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Radwan (PPE-DE)</span></span>  . – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are living in an age of globalisation and digitalisation, and we talk about a knowledge-based society. The whole of our society, our economic life, is on the threshold of major structural changes. What we have become used to is disappearing; things are changing. A policy to establish a regulatory framework is now more pressing than ever. The European Union has set itself the ambitious target of becoming the most dynamic economic region in the world by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, a number of conditions need to be met and we need to do our homework. The policy on training has already been addressed on a number of occasions. The resource Europe has is knowledge. This is where we must invest in our young people, in particular. We talk about new technologies such as the Internet. But we also need to talk about equipping people with new ways of thinking. My generation and the generation before that did not concern itself very much with the idea of being independent or becoming an entrepreneur. I think in future we should make young people in school more aware of this idea so that it becomes quite natural for them to embark upon an independent life.</p>
<p class="contents">But we also need to talk about flexibility in our labour markets. I fully concur with Mr Bullmann, when he talks of targets, but we are constantly experiencing just how little targets match up with concrete actions. We are all in agreement on the objective of making labour more flexible. But if we take a look at Germany and the new Industrial Constitution Act, then we realise that targets and actions do not always tally, which makes it all the more difficult simply to orient policies towards targets.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to make more effort in the area of high technology. The Internet has been mentioned. Access to the Internet in Europe is still too expensive. Its use in comparison with other countries is still too limited. Our approach to new technologies, such as biotechnology, needs to be more aggressive and more optimistic. But we should not restrict our investments to new technologies. We should also consider how to bridge the gap between the new economy and the old economy. I am fundamentally opposed to this demarcation. In Bavaria there is a carpenter who already achieves 70% of his sales via the Internet. If I may ask the experts here, does he belong to the old economy or to the new economy? I think he simply belongs to the economy. We need to bring them together and make them viable.</p>
<p class="contents">But – and I would like to warmly congratulate Mr Gasòliba i Böhm on his report on deregulation – we need to become competitive. We need to make our structures competitive. We have had very positive experiences when it comes to air transport, telecommunications and energy, and other markets such as transport, gas, the postal services and finances are also being considered.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately though, our goal must be to have competition only where it benefits the consumer. I would like to offer a word of warning that not every sector should be deregulated straight away just for the sake of positive competitiveness. An example is water. Water is a limited resource. We certainly cannot abandon the water market in Europe, with its high quality standard, to the vagaries of competition overnight in a sector specific or even case specific way.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection I support the issue of limiting competition – of limiting general European competition law to local and regional public services. Social structures and evolved structures are a form of capital for Europe: good training, good health, social tranquillity. We should not maintain structures just for the sake of maintaining them, we must develop them further; they can incorporate competitive elements. We can make them more effective and structure them positively. But we must not abandon political responsibility. It is a difficult balancing act. We will raise this issue again later in the year in the liberalisation debates in this House. But I think it must be possible to combine competition, subsidiarity and political answerability on the ground. I believe this is the route Europe must take to become more competitive and yet maintain cohesion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In 1995, when I was new to this Parliament, we almost exclusively discussed stabilisation policy. This area remains, but stabilisation policy has been supplemented by issues regarding growth, employment and social welfare. A changed reality has made this possible, but it is also a matter of political priorities. This has come about via Amsterdam and Lisbon and is now continuing in Stockholm.</p>
<p class="contents">It is sometimes said that the issues which we are now addressing – issues of employment and social welfare – are exclusively national. Yes, to a large extent they are local, regional and national issues. However, by setting out targets for meeting common challenges in the future, we create added value through a European policy. We do this partly through straightforward legislation in areas such as the work environment and labour law and partly through the open coordination method, which means establishing common targets for various matters. The process of monetary union and targets for inflation, interest rate development and budget deficits have proven the success of the approach. Now we are doing the same thing for employment levels, exclusion and demographic issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon process comprises three parts: economic policy, employment policy and social policy/social cohesion. It is important that there be a balance between these three areas, which are all vital to the process.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank rapporteur Bullmann for highlighting, in his report, this balance and the importance of maintaining it. I would like to emphasise two points in particular: education policy in a knowledge-based society, which is incredibly important, and, as I have said, the significance of tackling the challenges with regard to demographic development right now.</p>
<p class="contents">In Stockholm we need to focus, as we cannot manage everything at once. So let us focus on certain important issues so as to set the process in motion. Indicators are not an end in themselves, but simply a means of achieving established targets.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasise the role of Parliament. We have a role in legislation, but we have no clear role in the issue of the open coordination method. As this becomes increasingly important, we must have an Institutional Agreement in which the role of Parliament is strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">However, one ingredient is missing – we mention it in our report and hope that the Gothenburg Summit will address the same aspect – and that is also to link the ecological aspects to this process and to these issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the right ambition to have and must now be followed up effectively in Stockholm. However, it must not be the same as so many other EU documents – words without concrete results. We now need firm proposals. The 14 million unemployed have had enough of grand resolutions. I must admit that we Liberals are taking a rather guarded approach until we see the results of the Stockholm European Council. I would like to stress that Mr Bullmann has done a good job, but the report has become too wide in its scope and the large number of proposals has meant a loss of focus. We would have preferred a more concentrated approach and a clear list of priorities. We fully support the Commission’s criticism of the slow speed of reform in Europe. In this context the Council deserves the most criticism, but Parliament is also at fault.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to highlight a few important measures aimed at getting Europe moving: there needs to be further liberalisation of the energy markets, and the post and telecommunications sector – an area in which Mr Danielsson can act on his strengths. Other issues include reduced taxes, particularly on work, better conditions for small and medium-sized businesses and a more flexible labour market. In addition, we need to create a common financial market – an area in which very little has happened so far – and a connected <span class="italic">e</span>-Europe. Biotechnology must also be stimulated.</p>
<p class="contents">A more liberal Europe means a Europe with greater cohesion and greater social security, which means that people’s willingness to take risks and dare to try new things increases. Europe needs a policy in which jobs are created and citizens can choose their <span class="italic">own</span> future. It is a good idea to set out targets and constantly monitor progress and have relevant statistical indicators, but this never replaces concrete proposals. As a Swede, I hope that the Stockholm European Council will be a watershed, where decisions will be taken which pave the way for a competitive and liberal Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say to Mr Danielsson that a dynamic Europe also requires a common currency. Do not forget that. More and more people are wondering when Sweden will fulfil its commitments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that it is an interesting report and the comments that I shall make are intended to suggest a few improvements to the Commission. It is what is called constructive criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">My first point concerns the content of the report. I am extremely surprised that no reference is made to the marked disparities between countries and regions of the European Community with regard to the information society. It is a fact that the European Union is made up of geographical subdivisions which differ greatly from one another. The situation of the Scandinavian countries is quite different from that of the countries of southern Europe, and account should be taken of this in order to refine this analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that the Commission quite rightly talks of an integrated response. I would like to make some suggestions regarding three broad areas to make this integration operate more smoothly.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, with regard to sustainable development, it is vital that the Commission recognise that the Lisbon process lacks an environmental dimension. We must ensure that the Gothenburg report rearranges the order of Lisbon’s priorities. To give a practical example of this, in terms of energy and transport, it is not sufficient to say that liberalisation will enable us to lower prices, and, consequently, consumers and businesses will have greater access. We also need indicators showing the increase in public transport or the growth of truck-on-train technology. The issue of indicators will emerge and that is why we tabled a number of amendments to the Bullmann report.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, it is not enough for the Commission to say that it has made a statement on services of general interest. Parliament is currently considering this issue. Initiatives must be taken to limit the extent to which competition is introduced into various sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the role of education and training. You start off by making a fundamental observation about the general lack of training. The Commission should look into two issues more closely. On the one hand, the issue of balancing work, training and leisure time. Why not have a framework directive, or at least a Commission recommendation, to enable workers and citizens in general to benefit from the different patterns of training, work and leisure? On the other hand, there is the issue of public and private funding of this training, the problem of the responsibility of businesses, including for the training of their workers, which raises the question whether public money is well spent.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I believe that it would be a good idea if the Commission statement followed the example of the report on economic and social cohesion, in which Mr Barnier discussed European Union enlargement. Clearly, many of the priorities set out in the Commission statement should be reworded, in view of the European Union’s enlargement, for example, with regard to the labour market – where issues such as health and safety will become fundamental – social exclusion and social protection. This cannot be related to the issue of an ageing population, but simply to the creation of a whole new branch of social security, as the latest report from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development has just reminded us once again.</p>
<p class="contents">These are a few suggestions, Commissioner. I hope that they will be taken into consideration in the Commission’s next reports, particularly with regard to integration, sustainable development and the knowledge-based society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to give my response in terms of the content, our responsibilities and the method.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I believe that we cannot regard the European Union’s strategy on sustainable development, full employment and greater social cohesion as set in stone. The Lisbon process has many virtues and its objectives are extremely ambitious and well founded. It has a comprehensive and open method of coordination and reflects a clear understanding of the challenges of the information revolution. However, it still contains many areas of bias. The current framework to monetary, budgetary and financial policies encourages fiscal and social competition; the ability to carry out public policies is still compromised on a national level and is totally obstructed on a European level. I would say that this is negative integration, in the sense that Tinbergen intended, and it is not wholly positive integration.</p>
<p class="contents">These areas of bias are obvious in the current problem regarding indicators. There are comparable indicators at a national level, which are useful, but there are no European-level indicators to enable us to rank Europe’s position in the global economy and to apply common policies. Moreover, we do not study the impact that the choices made by one or more countries have on other countries. Why is Ireland being criticised? Is it for its policy of public spending in favour of growth or actually for its anti-Community social dumping policy?</p>
<p class="contents">I understand why Mr Bullmann says that growth is actually taking place but that we must not rest on our laurels. In this respect, it is disturbing that the Council and Commission do not evaluate the social and economic impact of the large, integrated financial market or that of the launch of the euro. That is why we should consider Lisbon to be more of a beginning than an achievement; we must work on ironing out these contradictions and, sooner or later, we will have to change this strategy in order to make progress. Mr Goebbels and Mr Bullmann have, moreover, tabled a good amendment to enable us to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Parliament should be able to make straightforward choices. In my opinion, the two reports, for which the committees voted unanimously, contradict one another. I support the Bullmann report, which recommends public investment and social legislation. However, I cannot support the report by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm which concentrates on deregulation and flexibility alone. I would like to stress, moreover, that if the internal market does not reach its goal in terms of essential services such as energy and transport, it is not due to deregulation, but because of a lack of infrastructure and common public regulations. I would also like to say that I disagree with the endless reduction in social security contributions, which is still being called for, which absolves businesses of any responsibility and creates poor workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, and finally, we should indeed help every European social and civil operator to make a choice in terms of economic and social policy. Yet, people are not familiar with these methods of coordination. They have absolutely no idea what they entail. We should, therefore, give thought to our responsibilities. On this subject, may I remind you that, in December 1996, following a report that I had presented, Parliament voted in favour of a resolution which confirmed its intention to hold an annual conference of the European Parliament on fundamental choices in economic and social policy, following an interactive debate between the various national authorities and a public consultation with the key players in civil society. I believe that we could take up this proposal again, in order to attract the attention of the citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Apart from anything else, their proposals would at least mean greater transparency. What is hard to understand is not their work, but why, supporting the outcome of the Lisbon Council, the Union is sometimes out of line with the principles it stands for.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, the 15 Member States do not have a common economic policy so much as a group of Community guidelines, laws and prohibitions. Faced with the challenge of globalisation, there must be more effort to give the Union common arrangements and policies based on a common history and culture, and every country must adopt a competitive flexibility. But it is not unusual for both to be harnessed only for purposes of economic growth and not for social progress.</p>
<p class="contents">In some cases, public administration needs to be reformed, but in others there is also a need, for the purposes of wealth production, for the individual Member States to reform developing sectors and realise their potential in terms of basic criteria through their infrastructure policy, and move towards a policy of wealth redistribution. Yet faced with the growth of insecurity and poverty, there does not seem to be anything else to do at national and Community level except represent it statistically as accurately as possible. However, while virtue in public accounting is fundamental, compared with growing poverty and insecurity, it cannot find meaning only in the reduction of social costs without any non-statistical consideration of demographic growth and of the sometimes strident justifications for the continual requests to reduce labour costs without a concrete participatory system.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberalisation enters into these considerations too, because, while we support it in terms of theoretical benefit to the final consumer, in practice it is not reflected in quality, safety or universal enjoyment. So roll on greater coordination of Community policies and better indicators to demonstrate their effectiveness. But it remains desirable that the Union should not only determine its future arrangements rapidly but should also make the principles it repeatedly proclaims increasingly applicable, binding and consistent.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yesterday, Alan Greenspan told us that the United States economy will only grow by 2.5% in 2001 and unemployment will rise by 0.5%, from 4% to 4.5%. Those are the statistics of a dynamic and competitive economy. For us, those statistics would represent a boom in economic growth, while the United States economy is considered to be in recession.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate the work done by Mr Bullmann and Mr Gasòliba i Böhm – in particular I fully support the Gasòliba report – but I think that it may amount to too little because Parliament is given too little to discuss and propose.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the Bullmann report talks about modernising the pension systems, a subject also mentioned by Commissioner Solbes. Well, if we are going to talk about practical things to be done and not just high-flown goals, Parliament should make its voice heard in a much stronger, more decisive, more rigorous way, and call urgently for a reform which leads to financially sustainable social security systems which are less unfair in terms of balance between the generations.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe, we are irresponsibly consuming the national insurance contributions of young people. What are they going to get, 20 or 40 years from now, in return for the high contributions they have to pay today? Reforms are needed, either of the parameters by raising the minimum pensionable age, or of the system by – as I believe would be appropriate – changing to a capitalisation system for compulsory national insurance, and not – that would be the last straw – just for supplementary national insurance.</p>
<p class="contents">In the dynamic economy dominating the world today – the United States' economy – there is concern about social security deficits which will begin to show up in 2025 and will have used up the accumulated capital reserves only in 2037. In Europe and in many European countries – I am particularly thinking of my own country, Italy – we are irresponsibly heading for disaster in the social security accounts. In Europe, we have no way of defeating the corporate resistance of those – I am thinking primarily of the trade unions – championing pensioners and people retiring on the backs of young workers – the lucky ones – and young jobless, supported by the very high national insurance contributions which depress employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very much in favour Tony Blair’s proposal for a Europe where people can work after the age of 65, because I come from a country where people retire at 55 and even younger, and their pensions are paid for by the contributions of younger workers.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, let us talk less about goals we all agree on – who would not want Europe to be a dynamic economy? – and a bit more about the choices, some of them painful and difficult, which need to be made as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seems an almost impossible feat to get 12 different economies with divergent economic situations to sing from the same hymn sheet. The fact is that the Member States accepted monetary union reluctantly, but are not about to sacrifice even more policy freedom in order to achieve the real convergence required.</p>
<p class="contents">The socio-economic performance indicators proposed by the Commission represent an attempt to bring about a form of socio-economic coordination nonetheless, without having to go through a legislative procedure bristling with pitfalls. It is far from ideal, but better some of a pudding than none of a pie, you might say.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this political reality, it is very foolish to nip this convergence process in the bud by proposing a confusing mass of indicators. The business community is already complaining of fact-finding overload. The national statistical offices simply do not have the resources or manpower for the job. And to saddle Eurostat with it would be putting the cart before the horse. The 27 indicators proposed by the Commission is on the excessive side as it is. We should start with around ten and then increase the number carefully, and where there is a pressing need to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a shame that the Bullmann report is sending the convergence process into the wilderness in its tender youth. I hope that the Commissioner will shortly explain in clear and specific terms to what extent, and in what kind of timeframe, the far-reaching proposals from the motion for a resolution can be put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, statistics do not tell the whole story. They provide a snapshot of reality. After all, we do not say that the United States has the greatest sporting prowess because they won the most medals at the Olympic Games. You only have to divide the number of medals per head of population for the US to drop like a stone down the international league table, and for most European countries to emerge with better sporting achievements than the United States. And of course Belgium has long been renowned for its skating prowess. In short, indicators are a means of steering policy but not an end in themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to say that, broadly speaking, my group is able to support Mr Gasòliba’s report, although, unfortunately, it devotes far too little attention to the drawbacks attending liberalisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As is so often the case, there is conflict not about the target, but about how to achieve this target. Some people believe that this target will be achieved through completely free entrepreneurial activity: others through controlling and regulating turbo capitalism. Of course, the truth lies in coming up with an intelligent combination of the two approaches. To make our economic area the most attractive in the world, our economy needs to be highly efficient. At the same time it needs to be human driven and take the form of a social market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bullmann has given us a lot of definitions of important structural indicators, which are intended to give us pointers for the correct approach to take. This in fact gives rise to the problem of increased burdens on medium-sized enterprises. That is why we support the proposal made by the Group of the Europe Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party that new statistics must not mean that medium-sized enterprises will have to shoulder a greater burden; existing material must be resorted to. Too much knowledge leads to all too frequent interventions, and this could blacken the prospects for the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem for the future consists in doing the right thing with the data and new facts at our disposal. It is therefore about fostering competition between systems, and private involvement. At the same time we also need rules to make sure that our systems are competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">A look at my country is enough to show what should not be done: the extension of codecision in Germany. In my country it is argued that, because of the dynamics of the economy, more works councils should be set up which, for practical purposes, means for all medium-sized enterprises. Just imagine it if you can: new works councils are to be set up not only for large enterprises, but also for medium-sized enterprises. Now, that is nonsense. Not even the Bullmann report would argue to that effect, and rightly so. There is everything in there, from the development of research to pension regulations, but thankfully he does not say anything about extending codecision. By sticking with this concept, the red-green coalition in Germany is treading a misguided path, which is neither covered nor called for by European analyses. So, on this point, Germany, the biggest country in Europe, is showing itself to be incapable of meeting the new challenges as the most attractive economic area in the world. No, the red-green coalition is doing this aspect of the European challenge a real disservice.</p>
<p class="contents">The token gesture that has been made to the trades unions in Germany because their influence is decreasing, is a poisoned chalice. Many in our group fear that the report before us contains too much detailed knowledge and detailed analyses. We must take this problem into consideration. The basic message that the European globalised world and the Europeans in this globalised world must take with them is that, above all, our economy must remain competitive and must not be restricted by this report. However, what we also need – which is missing in the report – is the next phase of the analysis. We need more global rules for global competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unemployment has finally fallen, even though the still high level of unemployment is deplorable. Nevertheless, 2.6 million new jobs have been created and the positive economic trends have been confirmed by good economic data, even though the pace has slowed down. The strategic approach of giving equal status to the policy areas of economic reform, economic growth, full employment and social inclusion has proved its worth. But it must be consolidated and implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">The US economic climate, however, is keeping Europe on tenterhooks. But a soft landing does seem possible. Nevertheless, Europe must be prepared for lower demand for its exports. For that reason, there is no alternative but to introduce structural reforms in the goods, services, capital and labour markets, which must lead to increased output potential and productivity. Mr Friedrich, extended codecision can even lead to higher motivation among the workforce and thus to increased productivity.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has made great strides in terms of structural reforms, which is underlined by the most recent progress report of the International Monetary Fund on the euro zone. This is also true for information and communications technologies and for the labour markets. At the same time a policy mix must be developed which will help compensate for the effects of a possibly negative impact on the EU internal market from reduced US demand, by increasing domestic demand. The Bullmann report and the synthesis report, with its ten correctly identified fields of action, rightly emphasise that the future of Europe lies in the ability of Member States to reform themselves, in the qualifications offensive aimed at increasing employment, in the modernisation of infrastructures, the expansion of the information society and in overcoming poverty and social exclusion. To this end, the instruments of privatisation and deregulation must be exploited to the full. But new instruments must only be used where restructuring and, hence, regulation are needed. Especially important is a clear regulatory framework in all areas, most notably for financial services, which have a high priority for increased investment activity, which is crucial in the EU. This is in the interest of the European model of a social market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that the open coordination process method is taken a step further. In this connection, a timetable, together with qualitative and quantitative objects, as well as intermediate goals, are needed. This proved to be crucial with the advent of the internal market and the introduction of economic and monetary union. In this case too, it must lead to the streamlining of the domestic market in the interest of the economy and employment. To this end, the European Parliament needs to play an enhanced role and be more involved in the process of coordinating economic policy. The Swedish Presidency has called for democracy and transparency in this area. I hope they are as good as their word. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to address one specific issue where the Commission and indeed all of us are rather weak: that is the issue of regulatory burdens. We need to be a little better informed about the kind of regulatory burdens which we might be creating wittingly or, more importantly, unwittingly in the legislation that we pass.</p>
<p class="contents">I see in the Commission's synthesis report no more than four or five paragraphs on this very important issue. Regulatory burdens and the reduction of regulatory burdens is a subject which is thick with rhetoric and clichés, but rather thin on action and practicality.</p>
<p class="contents">It means that as legislators in the European Parliament we are often legislating blind. We often deal with proposals that come from the European Commission which do not have proper impact assessments attached to them. We then table amendments when we do not know what the effect of those amendments will be.</p>
<p class="contents">That is clearly an inappropriate way in which to legislate and not a particularly effective way to pursue the goal of competitiveness. Therefore, I urge the Commission to reflect on this quite seriously and not dismiss it as just an add-on to the Lisbon process but place it at the centre of its reflections and perhaps think of new institutional ways of creating an agency specialised in these matters. Commission proposals ought perhaps to be subject to proper impact assessments and, similarly, MEP amendments, so that we actually know what we are doing when we legislate in pursuit of this overall aim of competitiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But would it not have sounded even better if the EU had chosen to create the most environmentally friendly, sustainable, just and equal economy? This appears not to be the case, particularly not in the report by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm, which is an ode to deregulation, privatisation and social cutbacks, i.e. the things which create deep divisions and environmental damage. For example, my own country Sweden has in the past been a very egalitarian country. According to many reports since joining the EU, it is now a country where divisions, antagonism and inequality are increasing the most rapidly.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to recommend all market fundamentalists to read the following in today’s <span class="italic">Guardian</span>, “California and New Zealand that were once keen privatisers are now both turning their backs on deregulation. They are ready to renationalize. California is turning dramatically left. New Zealand’s experiment in market fundamentalism has failed”.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, I wonder what the Swedish Presidency intends to do now. The Swedish Presidency was in fact recently praised by <span class="italic">The Economist</span> for the egalitarian traditions in Sweden. Are you now going to continue down the EU’s incorrect road towards deregulation fundamentalism? Or will you instead perhaps regain some sort of tradition of solidarity and try to move the EU in a direction which takes more account of environmental friendliness, sustainability and solidarity? It would be interesting to receive an answer on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am thinking particularly of the demand for full employment, but also the emphasis on dynamic growth, innovation and lifelong learning. However, I wonder how this links up with the Maastricht model’s emphasis on stability, inflation control, low wage policy and social savings. Has this belt-tightening policy been abolished on the basis of the Lisbon decisions? No, clearly not. The Commission’s current action against Ireland shows that the Maastricht model lives on, for in many ways, Ireland is a prime example of the growth policy which has been promoted as a result of the Lisbon European Council and which is now being punished by the EU. My conclusion is therefore that the EU has two contradictory economic models: one which is, for the time being, political reality and another which is a matter of dreams and visions about what is to succeed it.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a ‘dream of the left’ and a ‘dream of the right’, which both seem to be covered by the Lisbon concept. I naturally hope that, at the Stockholm European Council, the Swedish Government will highlight and prioritise the left-wing model which stresses the importance of full employment and a socially responsible development policy and rejects the trend towards liberalisation, deregulation, flexibility, etc. But we will have to wait and see what happens when we get to Stockholm. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish during this debate to take the opportunity of addressing economic growth, in particular in my own country of Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me immediately state that I support the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam which call for the need to coordinate broad economic policies of the various participating Member States within the single European currency. However, any proposals which are brought forward in this regard, whether it be via the European Commission or otherwise, must be fair and they must be balanced.</p>
<p class="contents">Ireland has consistently supported the European Union and this has been borne out in all of the referenda in my country, where the citizens – and it does not happen in every country – have been given the right to express their views in relation to Europe. I do not believe that the proposals which were put forward by the European Commissioner, Mr Solbes, were particularly balanced with regard to these proposed recommendations concerning the workings of the Irish economy at this time. It is important to substantiate this and it is important to note that for a number of years the economic growth in my country has been between 10 and 12% – in sharp contrast with the late 1980s when it was 0%. The provision for the current year is for a growth of around 8%. Unemployment figures are as close as you will get to full employment in today's Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We are one of the few Member States making massive provisions for future pensions. We are proud of the fact that many countries in the world are desperately trying to improve their economic situation and they are using the Irish model as a reference. And yes, Mr President and Commissioner, our inflation is falling. It is falling significantly – and am I wrong in stating that other Member States have higher inflation rates than ours? I did not hear that mentioned recently.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that the biggest sin we have committed in our country is to reward the people with tax cuts and increases in salary. Here, the Commission conveniently forgets that before the economic boom the citizens of our country were required to make major sacrifices in order to achieve that boom. But according to the Commission there can be no question of them reaping the benefits. Are we to be the victims of our own success?</p>
<p class="contents">It is for these reasons I believe that those detractors who are voicing concerns about the operation of the Irish economy are over-reacting. The majority of the people in my own country support our Minister for Finance and the only people who do not are those in opposition in my country and they are using the recommendation of the Commission for what they deem to be short-term political advantage. Any suggestions from any quarter that Ireland should suffer as a result of the success of the Irish economy is a very serious threat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">von Wogau (PPE-DE)</span></span>  . <span class="italic">– (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Heads of State and Government of the European Union have set themselves the goal of turning the European Union into a truly dynamic, competitive, knowledge-based economic area over the next ten years. We will have to make enormous efforts to achieve this and it will only be possible if we succeed in mobilising the forces which are currently slumbering in European enterprises and in European research and training establishments, in the context of an open market economy. We are on the right path. I found what Mr Prodi said yesterday very encouraging. Soon, the single currency will be introduced and an optimum currency area will be created through enhanced mobility within the European Union. We are moving forwards in terms of protecting intellectual property, which is also important if we want to mobilise research. I believe that the European patent is an important step along this road. We also need to move more quickly in liberalising telecommunications, energy and the postal services, if we want to get closer to these goals. We also need to create a European economic policy based on common principles and I am convinced that can only be done in terms of a social market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">But the question is this: who is responsible for this economic policy? Or are the responsibilities different? There are areas which are clearly allocated to the European Union: the area of competition, where the European Union has the strongest powers; the area of monetary stability, which is monitored by the European Central Bank, and the Stability and Growth Pact – these are the most important instruments. They are the areas which fall to the European Union. There are other areas where responsibility clearly lies with the Member States, such as taxes, social security systems and training. Here, Europe can only make a contribution through dialogue; it is not empowered to make decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the collection of data is concerned, which Mr Bullmann proposed, my opinion is that, clearly, for us in the European Union, the areas where the European Union makes decisions must be given top priority. In areas in which the European Union contributes through dialogue, the collection of data need only be accorded secondary priority. Where do I think these priorities lie? In which areas will we need more information before long? We need more up-to-date information for example on the development of GDP and its components. We need more data on the growth of services in the European Union. We know a great deal about production in the European Union but too little about the development of services. At the moment, we have inadequate data on the balance of payments of Euroland, and these are fundamental principles which underpin decision making, for example when the European Central Bank takes its decisions on interest rates.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards other data, the essential thing is to get a dialogue going in order to come up with the principles of benchmarking. I must make it very clear that, in the case of data collected in this area, I would regard it as disastrous if, once it is available, such data was misused for planned economic intervention in the economic affairs of the European Union, and we need to build in the relevant safeguards in advance. This data, which I believe, in full agreement with Mr Bullmann, we need, must be used to increase competition between Member States. By having common borders on the outside and open borders on the inside allowing the free circulation of people, goods, services and capital, we in the European Union have created competition not only between enterprises but also between Member States, which is aimed at offering the people of Europe the services they expect from the state at better prices and under better conditions. It is my firm belief that the data mentioned in the Bullmann report should be used for this purpose.</p>
