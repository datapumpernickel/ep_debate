The country is massive, rich in resources and has virtually no state structure that can guarantee stability and security for the population. Foreign troops and national militia, with countless child soldiers among them, have free play to plunder the country of its assets of gold, uranium, oil and diamonds to their heart's content, destroy fields and villages, rape women and girls on a massive scale and assist one ethnic population group in massacring another. The last shred of civilisation has left Congo. Even animals do not behave like this towards each other in the animal world. The human suffering is too awful for words: more than 2 million casualties and many times more injured, traumatised women and countless AIDS and malaria victims.</p>
<p class="contents">How does the international community respond? It sends a handful of lightly-armed UN soldiers, described by Uganda's President, Mr Museveni, as constituting a worthless mission. According to him, they stay in their cars while, 50 metres further along, people are being gunned down. On the diplomatic front, agreements are made about the withdrawal of troops and national reconciliation, but these result in precisely more fighting and more irreconcilability. Since the Ugandan soldiers left Ituri, massacres, plundering and rape have become the order of the day there too. This must stop at all costs. A well-equipped international armed force must be set up to assist MONUC and with an extensive mandate to protect the population as a matter of extreme urgency. We certainly do not only need French soldiers. Only far-reaching federalisation of the country with strong, regional governments can provide an answer. The European Union must insist on this. Without drastic reforms, without an actual, working state structure, the Congolese population is at the mercy of the wild animals among people, and only the rule of the jungle applies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We in the Group of the Party of European Socialists denounce once again the use of the rape of women and girls as a weapon of war and the recruitment of child soldiers. We denounce the problems concerning access to humanitarian aid and the presence of foreign troops on the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Finally, we denounce the neighbouring countries supporting the armed groups operating within the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to draw attention to the peace process and to the urgency of supporting it, further to the so-called Final Act adopted on 2 April in South Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not fail to see the wood for the trees. These massacres must not deter us from working for peace in the long term. The government of national unity provided for in the peace agreement must be formed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The country needs an integrating government able to compel armed groups to withdraw. The best means of achieving peace is to form a solid and stable integrating government.</p>
<p class="contents">The peace agreement timetable provided for the formation of the government of national unity on 28 May. The parties and the rebel groups have presented their lists to the Government. Paradoxically however, it is Mr Kabila’s government that is dragging its feet. Once again, I would urge the Congolese authorities to comply with the terms and timetable in the peace agreement. Similar problems are delaying the formation of a Parliament. The measures required to form a Parliament by 10 June, the date set in the peace agreement, are not being taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, it has become evident that the mandate of the United Nations Observation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) must be amended, as was previously proposed. The United Nations has a mere 5 000 men deployed in a huge country. The MONUC mandate needs to be extended to allow UN troops to intervene between the warring parties. At present they are only there as observers to monitor the cease-fire. In addition, UN troops should be allowed to intervene to protect the civilian population if necessary. This must however remain a United Nations mission. Under no circumstances should foreign troops be deployed, especially troops from countries with interests in the Great Lakes region.</p>
<p class="contents">French troops must also abide by the MONUC mandate. Clearly, the presence of foreign troops in this area has been at the root of many of the conflicts that laid waste to the region, including the Rwandan genocide. Consequently, it is necessary to ensure that the United Nations alone is responsible for guaranteeing peace. I therefore believe the House must continue to insist on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to call upon the Commission to direct as much humanitarian aid as possible to help the civil population of the region. These people have been suffering for a very long time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This time it is Ituri that has fallen prey to an upsurge in uncontrolled barbarism which is tearing apart the Dark Continent, and in particular the Great Lakes region, while the Western media look on in silence. Next time, next session, which other region among these African countries – which are, in spite of everything, rich countries, perhaps too rich in their misfortunes – will be giving us cause to lament? Of course, the lack of democracy and of inter-ethnic dialogue is blatantly obvious in most of the African Continent. The bases for social and economic development and for the establishment of democracy are being eroded by corrupt and clannish governments, supported, in most cases, by Western democracies with vested interests and by our industrial companies. All too often the health and education systems are reduced to the enrolling of the very young into local militias. However, it would be too easy to stigmatise these local regimes, or to let cultural or continental determinism lead us to accept as inevitable the fate of the hundreds of millions of people who still survive on the Dark Continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet again I have to repeat myself before the European Parliament in order to emphasise the European Union’s great weight, resources and capacity to act. The Community has an enormous amount of room to manoeuvre regarding the misery caused by local regimes and militias. It has enormous human resources at its disposal. It should not be difficult for a Union with 380 million citizens to mobilise the necessary forces to secure a sub-continent, a country and, even more so, a region. It has enormous financial resources: the creation of the basic infrastructures necessary for the development of these countries is an essential element in bringing to an end the era of conflict. It has enormous resources in terms of medical and hospital aid, and in terms of political and institutional transitional advice, the key features being, on the one hand, primary care and, on the other, the hope of lasting peace. We need to do all of this if we, in the European Union of which we are so proud, and which has rallied the hearts of our neighbours to the East and served as an example to Africa in establishing its African Union, are not to shut ourselves away, in our own little enclave of well-being, sheltered from the torments of the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union, with its resources, with its weight, or as a member of the United Nations, does not take action, what can we expect of the African Union, or what message can we send to it?</p>
<p class="contents">We can at least listen to the committed and pro-active voice of South Africa’s President Mbeki, urging support for peace and for the courageous efforts being undertaken by Angola and by those countries which have experienced at first hand the violence and the damaging effects of inter-ethnic atrocities</p>
<p class="contents">Closer to home, the crisis in Srebrenica has shown us that modern barbarianism is not something that is relegated to other continents. Let us hope that the painful example of Yugoslavia, which is imprinted in our common and Community memory, will give us the necessary impetus to enable us to take massive and immediate action in the Ituri region. Otherwise, how can we say afterwards, to the families and descendants of those who have died in this region, ‘We did not know, we could not do anything’? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two tribes, the Hemas and the Lendys have been fighting in the town of Bunia in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Hundreds of people have been injured. Many people have been killed and yet, despite the presence of French troops and UN troops in DRC, they are still fighting, they are still killing and there is much trouble and displacement of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">The key to all this, as I have said many times before in Parliament, is that until rural areas in Africa have security in terms of land, the economy, rural assets and rural development, there will always be conflict. There will be no democracy in Africa until people have something they can call their own, a stake in the local economies. We are trying to encourage democracy in these countries. Democracy cannot filter from the presidential palace down to the rural areas. It has to grow from rural areas and until we improve the economies of the rural areas, until we provide security for these people through land tenure, through police, a chamber of commerce, political representation, local schools, local hospitals – assets that they can call their own – conflict will continue. We seem to turn a blind eye to this.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been an MEP now for four years. I have lived in Africa for many years. My family has been there for 170 years and I know what it is like in the rural areas. It is about time the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers recognise that Africa is not like the US or Europe, where democracy can be understood. You knock on any mud hut in any part of Africa and tell the inhabitant that you have come from the European Parliament. Tell him: 'here are your rights, rights for your women, rights for your children, rights for you to assemble, to worship, to have democracy in your parliament.' As I found out with Mr Goebbels and Mr Van den Bos when we went to Ethiopia, these people ask only for water, seed, peace and security. At the moment they have no stake in their economies. Any rebel leader can come along and say: 'I will give you a hundred dollars, come with me, let us go and plunder, let us go and loot, let us go and fight', and they of course fall prey to that.</p>

The Congo has been called a continent in a continent and the disaster there is indeed taking place on a continental scale. The Ituri region should be one of the most beautiful in the world. If peace were to prevail, it could be a centre of tourism and prosperity. That is why – and I would like to make this very clear – our task is not to point the finger arrogantly at others but to provide help by attempting to deploy our troops in the country as part of a robust peacekeeping mission. We really cannot leave this task to the French, no matter how grateful we should be to them.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, we spend a great deal of time arguing over the role of the UN. We are moving towards an odd situation in which major powers want to create legitimacy and the UN, with all its shortcomings, is expected to provide the instruments. It has to be the other way round. The UN must provide legitimacy and the world's major stabilising factors must attempt to supply the instruments. For example, a politically and militarily united Europe, in partnership with the United States, can be a peacebuilding factor there, but a group of troops slung together arbitrarily without a mandate cannot. This is not an isolated or indeed a minor problem. In Africa, survival is the problem, and the Congo is its most acute manifestation. These conflicts are also inflamed, not least, by vested interests in the country's resources. We cannot leave the task to the Congo's neighbours, for in many cases, there are ethnic groups in these countries who also have an interest in fanning the flames of conflict in the Congo. As we have seen, the borders are artificial, with ethnically homogeneous peoples living on both sides of them. If there is to be peace, there has to be a new order, and we must make a robust and substantial contribution to achieving this at last. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This death and destruction weigh like lead weights on our consciences too. We cannot fail to feel responsible for the neglect, the indifference, the interests of our multinationals who are greedy for this large country’s resources, the colonial heritage, the misdeeds of the international and native communities which are, in reality, mixed, for neither is blameless.</p>
<p class="contents">We must act. The peace agreements are in jeopardy, and the different parties fighting are to blame for this in a number of ways, particularly where the various countries have failed to withdraw troops. There must be no more massacres like that which claimed hundreds of victims on 3 April 2003. Kofi Annan has reminded us that the perpetrators of criminal acts must answer for their actions to the international community. That is why we too must step up our efforts to create an international criminal court to try the perpetrators of such crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it is necessary to support and give effect to the calls of various social groupings and movements for MONUC to be given more power and a higher profile. It must fulfil its mandate by taking practical action, implementing peacekeeping measures in the territory, to ensure that there are no more massacres and to guarantee the security of the people, so that the situation in Ituri, where MONUC did nothing and was unable to act although informed of the potential danger of a massacre, is not repeated.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we need the boldness and transparency of a common policy which denies support to regimes which promote war and investigates the allegations made in the UN report against multinational and European firms which are unlawfully exploiting the Congo’s wealth. The report records both unlawful funding of the militia and unlawful exploitation of gold, diamonds, oil and coltan. It is no coincidence that so much gold, more than the country’s mining capacity, is exported from Uganda, as are so many diamonds, which are not mined in Uganda at all.</p>
<p class="contents">I genuinely believe we need to act as quickly as possible to bring peace and development in Uganda: the people need it. We must therefore launch a policy which is genuinely rigorous and transparent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sadly, this massacre is only the most recent in a long series of massacres in the east of the country. Beyond the Congo's borders, too – in Burundi and Rwanda – we have witnessed African genocide on a massive scale. Other major features are marauding militia who recruit child soldiers and devastate entire regions, and the ruthless exploitation of natural resources in the region, above all gold, uranium and, indeed, oil. This exploitation is carried out either by troops invited into the country – including some from Zimbabwe, for example – but also by non-invited troops, for example, from Uganda, who seize the country's wealth.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ask ourselves one question. Why are Europe and the world looking away? It cannot be because of the oil or gold or other natural resources. In other regions of the world with plentiful natural resources, as in the Gulf, we have an interest in stability, regardless of how we might choose to achieve it. Yet in Africa, we apparently prefer to leave almost everything in a semi-chaotic state in line with the concept of ‘might is right’. What I want is for all of us, within the European Union, to put our heads together for once and think about how we deal with Africa. Formal summits on Africa staged by individuals really are not enough. It may be appropriate to ask how we facilitate development in Africa through market access within the WTO framework. That is a debate which we should also engage in for once, and we should not only call for a robust mandate for the United Nations; we should also bring ourselves to the process.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution before us is almost a bit too restrained for my liking, for it makes very few demands of the Council or the Commission. It simply says at one point that we welcome ECHO's humanitarian role. It is indeed to be welcomed, but I think this is really not enough under the circumstances. If we call on the United Nations to do something and welcome the signing of an agreement in Pretoria in South Africa on 6 March, we ourselves must also send our own forces there in order to make our own contribution. I call on the Council and the Commission to take this step.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr Khanbhai expressed very well what this is all about on the ground, and also the frustration that we all feel about not being able to move from words to deeds fast enough so as to be able to stop all the violence that is taking place.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is extremely concerned about the continuing violation of human rights and international humanitarian law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, particularly in Ituri and the east of the country. We welcome the attention Parliament is drawing to this situation in its resolution this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that thousands have lost their lives in the past eight months in Bunia and the surrounding Ituri province in fierce inter-ethnic fighting. Over the past few days, there have been reports that up to 30 000 people have gone into hiding following further executions and massacres in Bunia. We share the concerns expressed by the United Nations Secretary-General about the danger that the situation might spin out of control. The Commission supports the work of the Ituri Pacification Commission and has been actively trying to bring the parties together.</p>
<p class="contents">The withdrawal of foreign troops from the region is, in principle, to be welcomed, but it is clear that the recent withdrawal of Ugandan troops from the area of Bunia has led to a dangerous power vacuum for the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN peacekeeping force in the Congo is gradually reinforcing its presence in Bunia, but it is clear that currently it has neither the mandate nor the military resources to provide security for the civilian population. What security means and what it often takes to ensure security should not, as many of you have said, be underestimated. We would welcome the deployment of additional peacekeeping troops in Ituri. There are undoubtedly links between efforts to secure peace in the eastern Congo and the current efforts in Kinshasa to form a transitional government for a reunited and peaceful country.</p>
<p class="contents">Long-term peace and stability for eastern Congo will depend in large measure on the success of this transition. The Commission, in its assistance programme, is fully involved in these efforts, whether through humanitarian or development funds. It is essential for all parties to the conflict to protect human rights and to respect international humanitarian law in the areas under their control. It is also necessary to end the impunity of those responsible for violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, given that the Democratic Republic of Congo is a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission appreciates the reference to ECHO's work and will of course pursue its humanitarian efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
