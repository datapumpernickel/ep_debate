Medicinal products are an integral part of a cure, and as time goes on, we are going to find that they are going to be increasingly integrated with pharmaceutical products to provide a cure for our citizens. I agree that at the moment, there is no harmonisation of the notifying bodies across Europe. I agree that we need more harmonisation and coordination, also for the sake of the competitiveness of the industry, which is a very important consideration, but, most importantly, with a view to assuring quality for our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I do agree that there is a big disparity in quality across the various notifying bodies, and this is why some coordination of standards and operations is important.

<p class="contents">This ruling is important because it concerns a highly sensitive matter, that of research and the patentability of research into what we call stem cells. All I would ask you, therefore, Baroness Ludford, is to understand that the European Commission will, of course, respect this Court of Justice ruling, and I and those of my colleagues who, like me, are directly affected by this patent issue will be obliged to work on this ruling and to analyse all of its implications.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask you to recognise that we need time, since this ruling was only delivered a few days ago. We will return to Parliament to discuss the conclusions we draw from it. This will not stop us, of course, from pursuing our work under the authority and impetus of the Polish Presidency so that, basically, we finally manage to resolve this patent issue, which has been pending in Europe for around 30 years now, and which we hope to resolve in a few weeks’ time, on the basis of the European Commission’s proposal to introduce one formal protection right today, under the Treaty of Lisbon, and through what we call ‘enhanced cooperation’ by 25 countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I continue to hope that the two countries that have not participated in this enhanced cooperation – Italy and Spain – will be able to do so. In any case, the door is open. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So, of course, the investment is not going to come and we will lose our leadership.

<p class="contents">To say, as you did, Ms Jazłowiecka, that electronic commerce is not working properly is an understatement. Electronic commerce accounts for, I believe, 5% to 6% of all trade.

<p class="contents">You referred to the blue-button proposals and ideas and to other very proactive ideas of the Polish Presidency. I will shortly be presenting a cross-cutting approach to bring into line all the EU measures in these areas, whether concerning remedies – because electronic commerce brings with it many administrative and fiscal obstacles or problems, which obviously hinder the development of the online market – payments, delivery, protection, consumer information or the development of the legal offer and the cross-border offer.</p>
<p class="contents">We have no plans to review the Electronic Commerce Directive, but we may announce additional measures with regard not only to notification and withdrawal procedures, but also to other issues relating to payments and delivery – areas which I have just mentioned and which will be addressed in green papers – data protection and dispute settlement.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are all of the measures that will be addressed in this strategy and in this proposal that the Commission will be making very shortly to the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to know whether the Commission is considering the introduction of top 20 solutions next year, in order to finally translate words into actions. It is only by doing so that European citizens can finally start believing in the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">One other question I would like to ask is whether the Commission might consider a citizen’s charter. This would make people feel they belong in the single market. This charter would list the rights and obligations of citizens in the context of the single market. I think it would be a step towards addressing the negative perception people have of the single market. Lastly, I think the biggest problem with the single market is not a legislative one, or one that involves the drafting or approval of legislation; but rather, of the adoption of legislation by the various Member States. The Commission might consider coming up with a governance plan sometime next year, one with specific deadlines and targets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It gives me an opportunity – in connection with this major effort to bring citizens, consumers and economic operators, on the one hand, and small and medium-sized enterprises, on the other, closer to the market, because some of them really feel that this single market was not made for them, that it is more an area of constraints than an area of opportunities – to pay tribute to the work of your committee, to this work that you yourself have begun in line with the report by Mario Monti. Mr Grech, we have taken up in this document, in the form of the top 20 concerns, one of your ideas, as well as the idea, as Mr Harbour knows, of this ‘introductory paragraph’ in the Single Market Act, this description provided by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to pay tribute to this work that we, Commission and Parliament, are doing together in a concerted manner.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very committed to ensuring that these top 20 concerns are followed up. I am not, and never will be, an advocate of intellectual, ideological or theoretical regulation. We are talking here about very specific issues, about practical concerns and obstacles, which we are going to eliminate one by one, and on which we will report once a year, during each of these forums.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the idea of a charter of rights for the internal market, which came out of the Kraków forum, is a positive one. We need to establish a clear and practical tool that helps citizens and businesses to understand their rights, and to enforce and exercise them. We are already doing this with the ‘Your Europe’ portal, which serves as a handbook of European rights, and this charter idea that you have announced could provide information on these rights and on their implementation to a far wider audience.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall support this idea because it is, as you know and as we wish, a practical idea for citizens and SMEs. I shall support it all the more because, together with other ideas, it will make what we do here, together, in Parliament, with the Commission and the Council, more accessible to citizens, businesses and those operating at local level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From our point of view, it represents a major source of growth and competitiveness for Europe, through the proper implementation of the Services Directive. The latter has already allowed for many obstacles to be eliminated in the sectors covered by this directive, which make up 40% of the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The figures I have available to me show that over 1 000 implementing laws have already been adopted. Today, 23 of the 27 Member States have finished transposing the necessary legislation. Four countries are still finalising this transposition: Germany, Austria, Belgium and Greece. The Points of Single Contact – to which many of you are committed, as am I, in order to make European laws more accessible to the citizens and to provide them with interactive tools – are up and running in 24 Member States. There is some delay in Slovakia, Slovenia and Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr van de Camp, I will shortly have completed my visits to each of the capitals, something which I promised Parliament I would carry out. In every one of them – I will shortly be travelling to Malta and Latvia as the final stops on this tour – I organised a workshop with all of the national officials responsible for implementing this and other directives, such as the directive on professional qualifications and the directive on public procurement. I am committed to ensuring that these laws achieve their full potential in every country, because there is nothing worse than making laws here in Brussels that are not implemented in the Member States, than having a legislative wheel that turns in Brussels and Strasbourg and another one that turns at the same time at national level.

We should move away from just talking about a financial-economic crisis, preferably as soon as possible and certainly in decision making tomorrow evening or at the end of the afternoon tomorrow, when matters will really come to a head.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what we also need to do is think – and not just think, but act as well – about what kind of economy we want for Europe, because the outside world is not standing still. This always makes me think straight away of the term ‘the digital internal market’. We have a unique opportunity, precisely as Europe, to turn this to our advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">In the current economic situation, we are looking for sources of growth and we are looking at how we can create jobs. There are a number of areas where this is ours for the taking and one of those is in the ICT world. Fifty per cent of European productivity and growth is in that area. If we employ the right tools and if we allow our European companies to make use of them, then we will get a much higher productivity out of it. This boils down to the field of competition and to us really providing the opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I would like to touch on a few things which are of the greatest importance. Broadband is one of them. </p>
<p class="contents">Broadband can increase GDP growth – there is no doubt about that – as well as opening up the wealth of public data available in Europe. To put it in a diplomatic way, we are not yet making 100% use of the huge potential of the digital market for kick-starting Europe’s economies. So let us go for open data, let us go for utilisation of all the instruments available to that end!</p>
<p class="contents">Europe’s digital strategy covers technologies in all policy areas, and it was presented in May 2010 as the first flagship initiative of Europe 2020. It ticks all the right boxes, but in the light of current economic developments, we need to focus on accelerating those measures that will bring the greatest benefit in the shortest term. That is what the road map is, and will be, all about.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the issues that need to be addressed as priorities? One point that has been made concerns the need to talk not about what is missing but about what we have to do, so what are the top priorities? One of them, on my list anyhow, is the digital single market. I no longer refer simply to the ‘single market’: it is the ‘digital single market’. Let us change our vocabulary to keep pace with the realities. We need very high-speed broadband connections, and we need them throughout Europe, so we must be aware that we have to invest and that, with that investment, we should be creating opportunities, putting Europe in a competitive position, promoting ongoing growth and creating jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance agree with this approach, particularly if it is combined with the right green adjustments. The problem is that the Single Market Act has been delayed, and therefore my question for the Commission is: you promised to present all 12 proposals before the end of 2011. Is this schedule still valid, or will it be the new year before some of the proposals are presented?</p>

Indeed, a number of them have already been presented. Some are even at a very advanced stage. Earlier, I talked about the European patent. We presented it more than a year ago now, and it may come to fruition, I hope, under the Polish Presidency, with a political agreement in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also add, to be completely objective, that, in addition to the 12 key proposals that we pledged to present by the end of this year, we are making progress on the other additional proposals, Ms Turunen. I would cite the example, under the watchful eye of Ms Kroes, of the additional proposal on roaming, which was, in fact, a specific request of many MEPs. Ms Kroes has not waited until next year. She has already presented this proposal, which is one of the additional proposals for the Single Market Act.</p>
<p class="contents">On the posting of workers, the aim of the new directive that you mentioned will be to harmonise the implementation, under the authority of my colleague, Mr Andor, of the directive on the protection of posted workers. At the same time, we want to eliminate the unjustifiable obstacles to the freedom to provide services. We want to ensure the proper protection of workers while improving the functioning of the internal market. This proposal will contain provisions on administrative cooperation, access to information for posted workers, the prevention of abuse and circumvention – we know that they exist – monitoring instruments, penalties and judicial remedies.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive that I just mentioned, for the implementation of the Posting of Workers Directive, will seek to ensure that it is applied better in practice. We think that the primary objective of this instrument will be to improve the information that is due to workers and businesses, to improve administrative cooperation so as to increase the effectiveness of checks, and once again, to prevent abuse, which we know exists. Our aim is not to overturn the case-law of the Court of Justice on this point, but we are going to draft this directive so as to improve the implementation of the Posting of Workers Directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are making progress on these two topics, Ms Rapti – on collective redress and alternative dispute resolution. I have nothing to add to what Mr Dalli said on that point. The contents of the Single Market Act, on which the commitments that I reminded Ms Turunen of just now, concerning these first 12 proposals, have been made, especially in the past, are not only my work. They are the result of a collective effort. They are the work of the three Commissioners who are present here and of 10 or so other Commissioners who worked together to develop this proactive legislation aimed at promoting growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore committed to presenting a proposal on alternative dispute resolution. I would simply like to say that this legislation will also cover e-commerce, and that we of course intend to address the issue of dispute resolution, since disputes occur quite frequently and hinder the development of e-commerce for cross-border sales.

One way of addressing the situation is to build an effective redress framework across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">ADR is a low cost, simple and efficient way of resolving disputes out of court, as you said, Mr Busuttil. The same can be said for ODR in the online context. My aim is to offer all European consumers and businesses a simple and accessible way of solving their problems without going to court, no matter what, where and how they buy in the European Union, whether online or in a shop. This will help to increase consumers’ confidence in the single market and to free up resources that can be reinvested in the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to create new structures and costs, but to improve the efficiency of the systems which already exist and to introduce effective and simple tools to solve consumer disputes where they do not yet exist. The proposal for a directive on ADR will build on what already exists in Member States. It will respect the great variety of ADR schemes put in place across the EU. It will leave it to the Member States to decide how they achieve the aim of full ADR coverage.</p>
<p class="contents">Those Member States with ADR schemes covering specific sectors can keep them, provided that those schemes respect the quality principles. They could, for example, cover the remaining areas by establishing a residual ADR scheme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have a question for Ms Kroes regarding roaming. As we know, it has recently emerged that the costs incurred by the industry in connection with roaming are extremely low. We are talking about EUR 1 per gigabit.

We want to have a directive with two sections, Mr Løkkegaard: a horizontal section comprising transparency and governance rules, which will apply to all collective management societies in Europe, and a second section including specific tasks for societies which manage copyright for online music services. I believe that, in this way, we will cover all sides of the issue thoroughly, while also taking on board many aspects that you yourself suggested in relation to collective management.</p>

Furthermore, 13 or 14 of us Commissioners have worked together for several months. That is not enough to succeed. We are presenting legislative proposals which are all aimed at proactively encouraging growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, we are well aware, and this is an understatement, that there is no public money left to hand out for creating growth, or at least not much. We must therefore adopt a different approach, because it is our duty to create growth. Citizens expect that. They do not only expect regulation, austerity, supervision and governance. This is the objective of the Single Market Act. I was very pleased to see, as Mr Harbour just said, that in the conclusions of Sunday’s European Council – which, I imagine, will be reinforced by the conclusions of the next European Council tomorrow – the issue of the Single Market Act was also included, perhaps for the first time, as a priority in the field of economic policy. It is our duty to pave the way for innovation (through the patent), investment (through funding for SMEs and risk capital), exports and mobility within this large market of 500 million consumers and 22 million businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The priority now, Mr Harbour, is for governments to take ownership of this Single Market Act. That is why it is encouraging to see that, at the highest level, Heads of State or Government are taking account of this act and even stating that they wish to proceed quickly with it, and that a fast-track procedure must be developed with Parliament, between colegislators.</p>
<p class="contents">I am now going to pursue the work that I have been patiently accomplishing at local level, Mr Harbour. One cannot be office-bound in Brussels and be a good Commissioner. I shall therefore continue what I have started. I have almost completed a tour of all the capitals to meet civil servants, national parliaments and economic operators, and I am now going to visit each Member State for a second time. I will be going out in the field, as we did together in Kraków for this internal market governance, which must be improved on the basis of our proposals and those of Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In general, everybody agrees that we should take opportunities, but in daily life, sometimes thoughts are a bit different from actions.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the issues that are a real challenge is that of connecting Europe’s facilities. Talking about my own shop, so to speak, out of the money that is made in the proposal as a reservation – EUR 9.2 billion for broadband investment – if you leverage the 9.2 billion, this goes up to EUR 100 billion. So do not tell me that there is no money for that type of investment. However, there, we badly need the involvement of the Member States and also the attitude and the approach of Member States. That is all connected: it is connected not only with our sectors but also with the sectors of everything that is at stake, such as the economy, creating jobs, culture, social welfare and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">So we must make full use of structural funds for broadband, and spend unspent funds. I was quite disappointed with the figures showing that the spending fund is not 100% accessible. The money is there but we have to make it available, and here the Member State is absolutely crucial. So we need regulation according to the fixed EU-wide end dates for the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). Michel is quite involved in that, agreeing with the radio spectrum policy programme.</p>
<p class="contents">And then there is the wireless services market: EUR 250 billion, double growth rates per year predicted for mobile data and the Member States to accelerate the allocation of spectrums for mobile communication. I am grateful to Parliament that we are near to reaching an agreement on spectrums. It seems possible that at the end of this week, there will be an agreement with Parliament. I am crossing my fingers and will be glad to help.</p>

<p class="contents">Again, I reiterate that consumer confidence in the market is key if we want growth. The market is demand and supply, and unless we give consumers the confidence in the market to increase their demand, then all attempts will fail. So what we are doing is buttressing consumer empowerment in the European Union. We are working with Ms Reding on a consumer strategy, which I hope we will bring forward very shortly and which will be based on issues that we can bring to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">One issue is safety: we already have quite good arrangements on safety, which, with Commissioner Tajani, we will be strengthening through the Product Safety Directive. Information is another issue, and here, Parliament has already contributed quite a lot in relation to labelling and other information aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">Redress is a further issue, which we talked about previously in relation to alternative dispute resolution (ADR) and collective redress. And then there is the question of enforcement, on which we would probably need rather more gumption in order to make all these directives we have mentioned implementable in the various Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If prime ministers or Heads of State or Government are committed to it, then their ministers are also more likely to commit themselves to it in turn. However, you are right; the process does need to be monitored. That is what I am doing, for example, in the course of my visits to each of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Since you mentioned citizens: how are they themselves going to take ownership of this single market? How are we going to reconcile them with the single market? Some very concrete tools exist. You mentioned the Points of Single Contact. I am referring to Solvit and ‘Your Europe’.</p>
<p class="contents">These are some of the tools that I check are working during each of my visits. They did not always work: in my own country, I discovered, for example, that until a year and a half ago, the Solvit system was being operated by an intern. Things have since improved. I am therefore performing these checks on the ground to ensure that the tools that are closest to citizens and businesses are working properly. This is the first priority in this national and European strategy for growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At my hearing before this House on 13 January 2010, I expressed my ambition to be the last Commissioner to mention the patent. That is why I am passionately committed to this proposal, which now has the support of 25 Member States. I hope that Italy and Spain will soon join us in supporting this proposal, which will help bring the price of the EU patent down to a competitive level.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Baldassarre, you mentioned small and medium-sized enterprises and young inventors. They are the ones for whom this patent, this single protection right, must be established first and foremost. I have met small and medium-sized enterprises and young inventors who, because of the high expense, do not protect their work, except for in two or three countries. This allows counterfeit products, which, in some cases, pose a risk to health and to the economy, to enter the single market by other means.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we are aware of what is at stake, and that is why we want to make a success of the legislative process under way, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, which have a right to this competitive advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">The first benefit for small and medium-sized enterprises, Mr Baldassarre, would be a reduction in the currently very high cost of the patent, for them as well as all the others who are the main casualties of the current situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Spurred on by you, Parliament has come up with another solution which would further benefit small and medium-sized enterprises. It would enable extra reimbursements to be granted to these enterprises for the translation costs arising from the patent process. I consider this to be a good proposal, which would be in line with the policy that we want to implement concerning the simplification of the patent system, the reduction of costs and the deals that we want to introduce across the board for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Tajani and I are, as you know, working on taking things further, as some national governments have done, with a national fund for patents, which could become a European fund. Personally, I think it is a good idea to go further, to go beyond the reimbursement of registration fees and translation costs by setting up a European fund. However, we need to explore this idea in the context of the next financial perspective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Personally, I am struck by certain examples of rising populism and protectionism in many of our Member States, which call for swift action on our part. Behind these movements, which are based on social or economic concerns, or sometimes on anger, there indeed lies protectionism, Mr Cutaş. The first victim of this revival of protectionism, or this national, or even nationalist, withdrawal, is the single market, along with what it represents today in terms of Europe’s strength in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We are working on one of the levers, but the 11 others are levers against protectionism, which does not mean that they are against certain types of protection. Europe must also be capable of protecting its citizens and its consumers better, but protection is not synonymous with protectionism. With regard to mobility, which is one of the 12 levers, we are working, as I said just now, on several chapters, including one on professional qualifications. We are going to promote mobility by simplifying the procedures involved in the mutual recognition of qualifications, and by making them more efficient. We are going to propose a European professional card to facilitate mobility throughout the Member States. This is something that Parliament is working on and would like to see introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when we in Europe are faced with a population problem in the shape of the falling number of people of working age, it is, of course, very important for us to have this mobility solution so as to overcome the lack of qualified labour in some countries, through the internal market. Some professions are directly affected, particularly in the health, education and engineering fields, and this is where we want to facilitate mobility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I wanted to ask the Commission about the precise timeframe within which it intends to put forward its revised directive, or its recommendations with a view to revising the 2005 directive. I heard Commissioner Barnier confirm that the Commission will table its proposal for a revised directive by the end of this year. I am delighted. We in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection were very much hoping for a series of amendments to the 2005 directive aimed at greater mobility, because this is really about ensuring that European citizens’ right to greater freedom of movement and mobility is guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection also called for the procedures for recognition of professional qualifications to be made simpler and more efficient, and I note that these recommendations will also be taken forward by the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, I would just like to mention the European professional card, to which we are really very attached, as we stated in the report we recently voted on in our committee. Our hope was that this European professional card could be backed up by the Internal Market Information System (IMI). What plans does the European Commission have for extending and reinforcing this Internal Market Information System if it is to accommodate more data and more information for the implementation of a European professional card? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It gives me the opportunity to confirm that the Commission will honour its commitments and that we will present – on 13 December, to be absolutely clear – this legislative proposal to revise the 2005 directive on professional qualifications. It is by means of this instrument, which is very important and which is, moreover, the subject of a collaborative effort between my own Directorate-General and a number of you, in your committee, that we will address the issue of extending the scope to cover a number of regulated professions. The number of regulated professions is not, in fact, a problem. We wish to carry out a country-by-country analysis, notably within the framework of our Europe 2020 strategy and of the memoranda of understanding concluded between the Member States. I see that in many countries, efforts are being made in this direction. Take Portugal, for example: as a minister explained in the Competitiveness Council the other day, the national efforts being made there have helped to open up and remove a number of barriers for some 15 professions.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the professional card, which you just mentioned, I want to use this idea, which, incidentally, comes from the European Parliament, as a means of simplifying the recognition procedures. The card must rely upon new technologies and, in line with your suggestion, Ms Le Grip, we are going to use the Internal Market Information System (IMI). It works well. Furthermore, in order to complete the list of tools that I outlined in my response to Malcolm Harbour, tools for bringing the internal market closer, namely, the one-stop shop Solvit and ‘Your Europe’, I will take this opportunity to mention the IMI system, which mainly affects public authorities. Today, we have between 6 000 and 7 000 authorities that are directly linked to each another via this system and which can ask each other questions and obtain a response, each in its own language. We are going to use this IMI system to develop the professional card system. The costs will thus be improved. Of course, before making any proposal, we will carry out an impact assessment on the implementation of this idea. This card must be voluntary for professionals. On the other hand, if it is to remain beneficial, it must be obligatory for the Member States, once we have achieved a result, adopting a bottom-up approach, with the professions in question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When it comes to market surveillance of safe products, for example, we actually have very good legislation, but we know that the Member States do not have sufficient resources to ensure that that legislation is implemented. This is also the case in the food sector, the animal welfare sector and others.

As you know, enforcement is a competence of Member States. This is a borderline which is quite difficult because the Commission is often held responsible for the final implementation in every corner in Europe, but we know that we cannot cross borders. Member States, in fact, have the full competence of enforcement in their own areas.</p>
<p class="contents">What we do is try to coordinate the enforcement aspects. On food safety, for example, we have systems such as RAPEX and the RASFF that I would say are working very well in all Member States, and in the health sector, also the information on health security. All these work, but we are constantly monitoring what is happening. As I said, we are in constant contact with the various agencies in the Member States at grassroots level to try to assist in whatever way possible – by training and also sometimes by subsidising initiatives that would ensure general safety for the whole of Europe and the protection of the food chain in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The food chain in Europe, I believe, is one – if not the only – sector that has a real single market in operation.

We are experiencing a crisis that can only be overcome by reviving trade. There is no doubt that SMEs are the pillar underpinning the European economy and there is no doubt that we need more Europe and less market fragmentation.</p>
<p class="contents">The digital revolution offers us many possibilities, and one of these is, without any doubt, electronic commerce. An increasing number of consumers buy online, but they only do so at a national level – things are more complicated at a European level. Market barriers do not help, and electronic commerce is almost non-existent at this pan-European level.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, and I have said this several times, the way out of the crisis is digital, and the time has come to go from poetry to prose. It is time for action. Our SMEs need concrete measures to increase their pan-European options and to develop their full potential in a market of more than 500 million consumers. Consumers, meanwhile, need a pan-European market that offers sufficient guarantees to allow them to trust in a true digital single market, in which they can buy products in the knowledge that their rights are assured, with freedom of choice and at a good price.</p>
<p class="contents">The Consumer Rights Directive is a good first step. I would like to know what next steps the Commission has in mind with regard to copyright, data protection, VAT, accounting rules, a single domain for online transactions, conflict resolution, product shipping, etc. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you will see, our agenda is very full, but over the next few weeks, and, in any event, before the end of this year, I am going to present a communication on the e-commerce strategy that I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">To be completely clear, we are not going to revise the E-Commerce Directive because, in the analysis that we carried out, and following consultation with our services and the Member States, it seemed to us that there was no clear requirement to revise this directive. We are going to clarify and cover a number of areas. Thus, I should like to cite the example of payment infrastructures, which, in fact, you mentioned. It is a very important subject because it clearly constitutes one of the obstacles to the development of e-commerce, both for consumers and for traders.</p>
<p class="contents">We will propose a regulation for the move towards pan-European payment instruments through the single euro payments area, which relates to bank transfers and direct debits. These are very specific but also very important matters. I note that this proposal is currently making progress within the trialogue framework, and I hope that it can be adopted before the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also preparing a green paper on an integrated European market for card, Internet and mobile payments. It will deal with questions such as security of payments, transparency, the cost of payments for consumers and traders, which you mentioned, market access for payment providers and standardisation issues.</p>
<p class="contents">In this strategy and in this communication, I would also like us to deal with everything relating to the fight against abuse and disputes, in collaboration, of course, with my colleague Mr Dalli, who, as we said earlier, will very shortly present his proposal on alternative dispute resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What I can say is that you are completely correct: unless consumers know of their rights and unless they have full access to exercise those rights, whatever rights that we put on paper are meaningless. Therefore, the directive has to consider issues of how consumers are going to be facilitated into exercising their rights of redress without abusing them. We are not here for abuse. We are here for exercise of rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, we already have organisations within the European Union. We have the consumer protection centres; we have the European consumer centres that are organised in all Member States to give advice to consumers on their rights, and also to assist them, even today, to exercise their rights, even for redress across borders. This is a function that we can consider: expanding the scope to maybe develop it into being the advocates of consumers when it comes to exercising their right of redress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Italy, the application of this directive created many problems, but I would like to highlight one in particular: seaside establishments.</p>
<p class="contents">Seaside establishments are peculiar to Italy: only in Italy are they so well developed; they are a genuine home-grown Italian offering. They are often family-run microenterprises which provide work for a large number of people, especially in the summer season.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time of general crisis, uncertainty regarding the future is an additional factor for this sector. One of Europe’s slogans is ‘think small’, but the danger is that it will be precisely these smaller establishments which will disappear to make way for large multinationals operating in the tourism sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore ask you whether it is possible to grant a derogation for this category or, in any case, to lay down special measures for this sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Morganti, I am aware of the sensitive matter of beach concessions. Our legal analysis of this directive – which has not been called the Bolkestein Directive for a long time now, and which was considerably enhanced by Parliament and indeed adopted by a large majority of its Members – under European law leads me to say that the renewal of these beach concessions cannot be agreed without an invitation to tender. Therein lies the problem. I well understand the difficulty that this poses for small concessions, but we have to prevent large enterprises or large companies from having some sort of monopoly. I am engaged in constructive dialogue with the Italian authorities on this issue, Mr Morganti.

I was Environment Minister, I have also been Minister for Fisheries in my own country, and I know all about monitoring marine and coastal zones. These are matters often dealt with by public authorities or by volunteer professionals. We are talking about something else when we talk about beach and seaside concessions, which, in some cases, do actually have safety issues.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr Morganti, at least give me some credit because, as a Commissioner, it is my duty to act as guardian of the Treaty, along with my colleagues, and to ensure that European law, resulting from the work of the colegislators, is implemented rigorously, fairly and objectively. It happens that the choice made by the colegislators, that is, you here in Parliament and the Council of Ministers, was not to exclude that profession. I am well aware that other professions were excluded, professions which are, incidentally, covered by specific texts. However, the one to which you refer and find problematic was not excluded from the Services Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the only thing I can say is that I will try, as intelligently as possible in my dialogue with the Italian authorities, to find pragmatic solutions, but ones that are in keeping with European law, by which I am bound. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To continue the debate which we had last night on public procurement – which, may I remind you, honourable Members, currently accounts for 17%, maybe even 19%, of Europe’s GDP – the text which we are to present in December will cover both the simplification of public procurement, specifically the issue of concessions, and, as you are aware, an instrument that I am preparing with Mr De Gucht, on the reciprocity that we expect of other countries in terms of their opening up their markets in return for us opening up ours.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, I am all for electronic signatures and electronic procurement – and Ms Kroes will, of course, support this work as it falls within her duties. Last night, I pointed out that we have to make use of all modern communication tools, as we do elsewhere with local authorities through the Internal Market Information System (IMI). The situation is clear, Mr Kelly: we will promote the development of the single market through this simplification of public procurement using electronic procurement and electronic signatures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The idea of a passport will be one of the proposals we put forward in December in the public procurement package. Obviously, we must look closely at what it will mean, because the word ‘passport’ does not have the same meaning when it concerns the instrument used, the document used by citizens, as the passport that I will propose for venture capital or the public procurement passport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
