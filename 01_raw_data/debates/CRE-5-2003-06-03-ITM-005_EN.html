We now have a majority. The House has been divided and different groups have had the opportunity to put on the record their preferred optimum solution amongst the options available.</p>
<p class="contents">I came to vote today with my colleagues in the ELDR. I departed only once from that list: to show support for what was available. Tomorrow, when we vote in the light of a Commission opinion, I would make the strongest appeal to Members of this House to give the largest possible consensus. I understand that many people have deep reservations about aspects of what this final statute may contain. However, I and the rapporteur will need to go to other institutions, and we have to go fortified by the weight of this House. We can go with a 'yes' or we can go with a 'no', but there is no debate on the basis of 'yes, but...'.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask people to reflect overnight and when we come tomorrow to vote in the light of the Commission's opinion, to give to those charged to represent this House the widest, most thorough mandate possible to say: 'This is what is available; this what we bring forward; and this commands the support of a great majority of Parliament'.</p>

<p class="contents">As was already the case with the Directive itself, the issue is not the proposal’s substance or its actual political content, which in fact I consider quite positive, since it seeks to introduce rules and suitable practical methods for correcting any possible financial imbalances resulting from the implementation of the Directive in question. In other words, the Member State responsible for the expulsion decision must reimburse the Member State which enforces that decision, on the basis of the real costs of the operation, up to a maximum level, which should be reasonable, comparable and balanced, and should cover transport, administration and accommodation.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, since we have before us an initiative on the application of Directive 2001/40/EC, which was rejected due to its lack of a legal basis, we are once again unable, by the same logic, to adopt any stance other than a rejection of this initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In such a situation, and as long as the global misery of capitalist exploitation, war and violent conflict and disrespect for human rights continue, nobody should be deported from Europe, and there should be no mutual recognition of deportation orders. </p>

Fundamentally, the draft directive does not in fact seek to establish substantive conditions for expulsion, but only deals with the mutual recognition of expulsion decisions already in force. In other words, it does not specifically cover Community expulsion decisions on the basis of a rule adopted according to the terms of Article 63 of the European Community Treaty. Rather, it covers expulsion decisions taken on the basis of national law. This directive, then, concerns the applicability of decisions; it does not define the substantive law on expulsion. Article 63(3) of the EC Treaty, however, only provides for the latter and says nothing about the mutual recognition of decisions taken on the basis of national law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rapporteur’s vision is centralist rather than federalist. She reduces national legislations and legal ordinances to an unacceptable level of subordination, in the belief that blanket application of Community law is the panacea which will solve all Europe’s problems.</p>

The fact is that we often know nothing about how MFA is handled once it is transferred directly into the budget of the beneficiary country’s central bank. Above and beyond that, moreover, given the exceptional character of MFA, it should be an occasional, short-term and one-off subsidy, in contrast to current practice in several beneficiary countries. I also think that it would be a positive step to make MFA exceptional by definition, for example, and to transform it, through suitable inspection provisions, into a crisis prevention system.

<p class="contents">The proposal contains many positive features. For example, the aspects relating to equality are emphasised, improvements demanded for disabled people in the labour market and full employment declared to be an overarching objective.</p>
<p class="contents">A proposal by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is based on the view that a general reduction in taxes is beneficial to employment. We do not share this view. The facts show that there is no connection between tax levels and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">We choose, however, not to vote against this proposal, but to abstain. The reason is that if the PPE-DE Group does not get this proposal through, that group will vote against the whole report. If the whole report were to fall by the wayside, that would be far more serious than this individual proposal going through.</p>

Information sharing and ‘best practices’ must become a reality beyond the Union’s territory. The training of students and researchers is a key sphere of action for increasing well-being, information and the quality of life, to which the Union is committed, in particular through the various association agreements and development funds.

The Statute needs to be adopted as a matter of urgency due to the imminent completion of the current enlargement process. We are in favour of the principles underlying this step, even though we disagree with certain provisions concerning the sum and taxation of remuneration for Members.</p>
<p class="contents">The compensation system for Members did need to be rendered more comprehensible, but the text proposed does not seem to us to respond fully to this need. That is why the French Socialist delegation wished to amend the text by voting for Amendment No 8 to Article 7 of the draft Statute, which it tabled alongside other political groups. We feel that intelligent implementation of this principle means that remuneration would be adapted to different standards of living in the various Member States, even if certain inequalities would have to be corrected. We are sorry that this amendment was not adopted.</p>

I actually wanted to vote in favour of Amendment No 8 to Article 16, rather than against it, as I am of course in favour of differential weighting of living expenses.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, by way of an actual explanation of how I voted, let me say that I have always been in favour of a Statute for Members of the European Parliament, but the reasons why I voted against the Rothley Report were as follows: I cannot understand why, today, we have not managed to make the actual costs of travel transparent and take them into account. Before now, the Statute always had to serve as a pretext for such a rule not existing. Now, we want a Statute, but we are rejecting transparency and the accounting for the real costs. I find that dishonest; we cannot explain it to the public, who, when they travel on business, can of course claim only the actual costs. Nor do I think it right that we have not substantially raised the pensionable age. <span class="italic">(Applause) </span>In Germany, we have just had a debate on increasing the retirement age for people at large, and I think the same should obviously apply to us. Apart from that, I am also in favour of us paying the same taxes as those who elected us, so as not to give the impression that we are establishing special rights for Members of this House.

For years already, we have been wrestling with a solution to the issue of MEPs’ salaries, and opinions can differ very widely, particularly when it comes to whether the current national system is preferable to one applicable right across the EU. The one thing, though, that the creation of a new Statute must not do under any circumstances is to create privileges and new rules that cannot be got across to the public. In view of the ongoing debate about how best to secure Europe’s pension schemes, people will see the idea, contained in the Statute and in an amendment, of pensioning MEPs off as early as 60 or 63, as a provocation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not only in my own country that people are, at present, being told that they will have to work for longer; in the European Parliament, on the other hand, the intention is obviously to guarantee politicians early retirement, which is not what social policy demands. Neither can I, nor will I, vote for a Statute for the Members of the European Parliament in this form.</p>
<p class="contents">The same goes for the rule on lump sums for expenses.

<p class="contents">The text addresses a number of technical issues that needed to be resolved in any case within the context of the recognised autonomy of the European Parliament to organise its correct internal functioning. It also goes much further, however, by presenting a statute that standardises at European level all aspects of the situation of members of parliament and cuts essential links with their countries of origin, in particular remuneration.</p>

<p class="contents">One such aspect concerns setting a monthly parliamentary allowance that is the same for all Members, regardless of which country they represent. Members of the EP are elected in national constituencies. Consequently, they are, and must remain, bound to these constituencies. Establishing a single monthly allowance fits in with a federalist view of the mandate of an EP Member, by seeking to transform today’s national Members of the EP into future ‘European MPs’. This is a vision that we do not share.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, as we have emphasised, the social realities in the countries of the EU differ greatly, making it inevitable that if this measure is implemented, in various countries, including Portugal, there will be enormous inequalities and disparities between the pay of workers and that of representatives and holders of public office, which would be quite incomprehensible. In other words, the salary of Members of the EP must be based on the salary of the Members of the national parliament of the country in which they are elected. Hence our vote against the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have worked in the field of equal treatment for men and women for decades. Our constant watchword was ‘equal pay for equal work’. Discrimination on the grounds of nationality is no more defensible than that on the grounds of gender. Legally speaking, too, Article 12 of the EC Treaty prohibits any discrimination on the grounds of nationality. Although the European Court of Justice has been consistent in adhering to this principle in its rulings, the fact that MEPs are a special case meant that it could not apply it here.</p>
<p class="contents">The amount of remuneration is a matter of dispute. Comparing it with the present parliamentary salary, a Dane would regard 50% of a judge’s salary as a lot of money, whilst others wonder why the work of an MEP is meant to be worth only half that of a judge. Whatever the case may be, it is not the MEPs who determine what they are paid; it is the Council of Ministers that has to approve this proposal. Moreover, this new regime will not apply until the next Parliament, that is, to our successors.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the pension, I am amazed that the draft report proposed that it be payable from the completion of an MEP’s sixtieth year.</p>

One, in which I have joined, is about the way in which we can call a halt to the financial privileges that cause the electorate to regard MEPs in a suspicious light. The other is about the way in which membership of this House can be made more attractive by higher salaries, lower taxes and the highest level of Member protection against legal cases. I have always been in favour of a uniform salary for all MEPs, provided that this salary is significantly lower than that in France, England and particularly Germany and Italy. This uniform salary must remain subject to the national, regional and local taxes in the Member State of residence, as is the case for uniform salaries received by people working for international companies in different countries. Guaranteeing the same net income by extremely low European taxes is a completely superfluous privilege for MEPs. In addition, immunity must only protect freedom of speech of those elected and not lead to impunity in other matters. The EU's enlargement must not affect political diversity. The allocation of ever fewer seats in this House to each Member State prevents smaller movements from being represented. Unlike some other Dutch people, I have only ever seen a statute as a means to an end, never the main aim. Since the final document serves the opposite from what I have upheld, I am unable to give it my support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A single European system would mean: subjecting Members to tax arrangements different to those applied to the citizens who voted for them; establishing Members as representatives of a hypothetical ‘European people’; detracting from their standing as representatives of their own peoples, whereas they are genuine equals of the members of national parliaments, and disengaging them a little further from national and popular ties of belonging to a Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, despite having voted in favour of some specific aspects, I have in the end voted against the report, because I wish once again to adopt a position of principle at a time when institutional reform, by autocratic methods, with the Convention at the very centre, appears to wish to develop in a very negative way and balance in the context ...</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, it says quite clearly that the objective of opening up to international trade is world integration, including ‘regulatory convergence’. But while it is possible to support the idea of increasing trade to the benefit of all, it should also be added – which the report fails to do – that every country, or every region, has the right to protect its model of society.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is much too indulgent towards the European Union’s trade policy, in particular its all-out adoption of free trade areas. Such areas are useful if they reflect a desire for controlled opening. But in reality Europe has so many of them and they overlap so much that no one knows what their real effects are and they are causing us to lose control over our trade relations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the Mann report again shows, the chief aim of creating regional free trade areas (FTAs) is to ensure the EU has political and economic stability in its relations with the countries concerned (the ‘strategic geo-political interests’) so that nothing can get in the way of the sacrosanct free movement of goods, services and capital. But what of peoples’ access to basic rights? What about an assessment of the social, environmental, cultural and economic consequences of such liberalisation?

<p class="contents">We read in the report that ‘...the constraint placed by the need to obtain consensus among WTO members complicates and slows down multilateral negotiations. By moving faster than the global trading system and sharing its goals, FTAs serve as catalysts for change.

<p class="contents">Although the benefits of these free trade areas are undeniable, because the WTO has not clarified the situation, these areas are developing in a framework which lacks legal certainty. Furthermore, we must bear in mind the potentially damaging consequences of a ‘harmonising’ strategy in the least-developed countries, whose ability to participate in trade negotiations is sometimes limited and cannot be overstretched, if we really want to see fair results. Consequently, although I broadly agree, I feel that more prudent and gradualist guidelines needed to be defined and this is why I was inclining towards abstaining from the final vote.</p>
<p class="contents">The result of the vote on paragraph 21 of the proposal, however, has persuaded me to vote against the report. In this field, which is so sensitive, it is crucial to uphold the decision-making procedure that was agreed on by consensus in Nice, as proposed in Amendment No 12.

<p class="contents">This report raises the fundamental questions underlying the partnership and gives pertinent answers which I support, in particular the need to stress the political dimension of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership in order to foster democratisation and peace, support for Mediterranean civil societies, the systematic inclusion of the human rights issue in follow-up, and the establishment of a genuine Euro-Mediterranean parliamentary assembly at the next EuroMed ministerial conference in Naples in December 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall vote in favour of this report in order to give strong backing to the inclusion of these objectives in the MEDA programme. But this programme alone is today insufficient to cover relations between the EU and its Mediterranean partners.</p>
<p class="contents">No additional resources have in fact been provided to this day (for 2003 the MEDA regional funding plan will have EUR 32 million and the ‘Euro-Mediterranean investment and partnership facility’ EUR 25 million), and the discrepancy between Europe’s financial effort for the ten new members and its commitment to the Mediterranean is spectacular, not to say scandalous: EUR 185 of aid per capita for the East, half a euro per head for the Mediterranean.</p>

<p class="contents">As everyone knows, the main aim of MEDA, which, in 1995 simplified and combined a disparate series of instruments, is ‘to reform economic and social structures and mitigate any social or environmental consequences which may result from economic development’ in the Mediterranean basin, in three areas: 1. Strengthening political stability and democracy; 2. Creating a free trade area; 3. Attaching priority to the social and cultural spheres.</p>
<p class="contents">The MEDA programme has therefore become the main component of financial cooperation in the Euro-Mediterranean partnership (through non-refundable aid from the Commission or through other instruments coordinated with the EIB). The results achieved by the MEDA I programme and the first two years of MEDA II, however, are such as to indicate that this model of cooperation should be continued and even stepped up (as the rapporteur suggests), substantially for the same reasons that led in 2000 to this successful programme being extended and relaunched for five more years, as the best possible means of achieving the aims of successive European Councils – Lisbon (1992), Corfu (1994) and Essen (1994): to enhance the EU’s Mediterranean policy, to enable the Mediterranean Basin to become an area of cooperation guaranteeing peace, security ...</p>

However, they raise for the first time the question of the interpretation of Articles 38 and 24 of the EU Treaty, introduced by the Treaty of Nice, concerning the conclusion of international agreements by the European Union in the fields of the second and third pillars.</p>
<p class="contents">Those articles were drawn up and adopted with culpable negligence despite the warnings I gave in my counter-report on the Treaty of Nice. We are seeing the consequences of that today: the national parliaments used to have the right to ratify such international agreements, but they have lost that right today and the European Parliament for its part has gained no equivalent right.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the States are now trying to find a national power of scrutiny by way of the ‘constitutional reservation’ that may enable them to go back to their national parliaments. But that is far from being a perfect solution.</p>
<p class="contents">We see here the consequences of badly negotiated treaties. The Convention on the future of Europe ought to correct that and bring the national parliaments back into play. Unfortunately, it seems to want to go in the opposite direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this very reason, it is unacceptable that the Council should have declassified the text of the two draft agreements with the USA, only one month before these, the first agreements in this sphere between the EU and a third country, were due to be signed.</p>
<p class="contents">These agreements are all the more significant in political terms because they are being signed at a time when ‘security’ measures are being implemented that endanger citizens’ rights, guarantees and freedoms and when the US is holding hundreds of people under arrest at its military base in Guantánamo, without having accused them or put them on trial, or when it demands that other States give it total immunity from the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">The current wording of the agreements raises some fundamental issues, such as extradition to a country which still applies the death penalty and which has legislation that in the name of the ‘war on terrorism’, breaches fundamental rights; personal data protection, applied retroactively, and a lack of control, specifically of the so-called joint investigation teams.</p>

Joint EU/USA investigating teams will operate uncontrolled in the ΕU, in violation of national constitutions and domestic law.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an agreement at the expense of the citizens of the Member States of the ΕU. It does not result in any differentiation in the domestic law of the USA, such as the repeal of the death penalty or the discriminatory provisions in the 'patriotic law' which deny non-US citizens legal aid, changes to the legislation of states in the USA which are incompatible with European law, or an end to the inhumane detention of prisoners of war, including citizens of Member States of the EU in Guantánamo.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on our peoples to organise mass demonstrations against a dangerous agreement which, on the pretext of combating terrorism, will escalate prosecutions against the grass-roots, anti-imperialist movement by extraditing the fighters at its vanguard to the USA, together with anyone in general whom the USA considers suspicious; to prevent the legalisation of uncontrolled activities by the US prosecuting authorities in the ΕU and to stop their governments from ratifying any such agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These days, the EU functions as a single state, with a number of guarantees in place to prevent people from being punished for something that is allowed in their own countries. Extraditions from the EU to other countries outside it go even further than that and are downright dangerous. This is certainly true for countries using a different penal system, such as the United States of America, where prisoners of war are locked up without any rights in camps that do not fall within the scope of American law and where the International Criminal Court is not recognised. It is a matter of some importance to us Europeans that capital punishment exists over there and that innocent suspects first need to admit their guilt before they can negotiate a reduction of their sentences. People living in Europe need to be protected from being subjected to that American system. Anyone who does not travel to that country of their own free will and on their own initiative must have the guarantee that nobody forces them to go there. This is why I reject the draft agreement on extradition and judicial cooperation, discussed in the Justice and Internal Affairs Council on 8 May. I support the rapporteur's attempts to at least take a stand against military courts of justice, against what is going on at Guantánamo, and against discrimination against European citizens, and I fully share his view that any future change to this agreement should not be made outside the normal, parliamentary procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
