<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey</span></p>
<p class="contents">The two recent earthquakes in Turkey registering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Akkuyu, while energy reserves produced by the Atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the EU spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes. Turkey's nuclear plans B which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region B prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons, as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan.</p>

<p class="contents">The aim of this convention, which came into force on 24 October 1996, is precisely to achieve and maintain a high standard of nuclear safety at world level by means of national measures and through international cooperation. It further aims to ensure that nuclear installations are equipped with continuing protection against potential radiological risks, so as to protect individuals, society at large and the environment against the harmful effects of the ionising radiation that can be emitted by such installations.</p>
<p class="contents">The convention, as you will be aware, also covers the prevention of accidents which have radiological effects and the limitation of such effects when incidents of this kind occur. I would also like to remind Members that, as a candidate for membership of the European Union, Turkey will – and this is a pre-accession condition, which is an important point – sooner or later, as part of its own pre-accession strategy, have to adopt a set of policies geared towards adopting the entire <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> in good time, and including therefore all provisions already in force on nuclear safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would just like to add the following. Turkey is only looking to increase its energy potential by 2% with this unit. Nevertheless, rumour has it that it plans to buy Candu reactors of the type acquired by Pakistan and India which were used for nuclear weapons. In this respect, the issue requires closer examination, because the sensitive situation in the Caucasus region could heighten people’s suspicions. </p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the safety of these plants. In areas of high seismic risk, it is not enough just to have secure, earthquake-proof buildings. Speaking as an engineer, I can tell you that we carry out tests to investigate the effects of certain risk factors in extreme circumstances. However, we cannot carry out tests on nuclear plants which are in operation; it is just not possible. With this in mind, it goes without saying that nuclear plants a priori should not be built in areas prone to earthquakes.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, and because Turkey is situated on the periphery of the European Union, we should be helping it to become a more secure, peaceful and cooperative country. That is our role and this is the point of my question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is, of course, a highly sensitive issue. Furthermore, it will be evident that this is a matter that does not only affect Turkey, in view of that country’s proximity to the existing territory of the European Union. It also affects other states neighbouring the EU with which we maintain relations. We understand your concerns and will certainly take account of them, particularly during the discussions that we will be having with Turkey to define that country’s own pre-accession strategy agenda. This question will naturally be one of our key concerns, and the European Commission will not fail to take this into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report includes, as you are aware, statements for the Minutes, with votes against, abstentions and explanations of vote.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Since May 1999, that is to say, since the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam itself, this report has also contained the acts for which the Council does not act in its capacity as a legislative body, except for certain acts of limited importance, such as decisions of a procedural nature. In this case, the report may also contain the results of a vote, if the Council sees fit. In addition to this, and in accordance with the internal regulation approved in 1993, and subsequently replaced by the Council’s decision of 31 May 1999, the General Secretariat publishes the results of any votes and explanations of vote in press releases, after each Council session, whenever the Council acts in its capacity as a legislative body, as well as in other cases, by means of an ad hoc decision taken by the Council itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force and whenever the Council has acted in its legislative capacity – and this is an important distinction in terms of the way ministerial meetings work – the results and the explanations of vote as well as the statements recorded in the Minutes have, to all intents and purposes, been published, on a regular basis. As the rules governing publication are the same for producing the monthly reports of the Council’s acts and for press releases, the final vote will be shown in exactly the same way, wherever it is published, apart from any error which may conceivably occur. </p>
<p class="contents">As for the questions by Mrs Frahm and Mr Sjöstedt, I can confirm that, under the terms of Article 255(2) of the Treaty, as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam, general principles and limits on grounds of public or private interest governing this right of access to documents shall be determined by the Council, acting in accordance with the codecision procedure with this Parliament, on the basis of a proposal by the European Commission. As you know, any such proposal will have to be tabled in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam, that is within two years of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, or in other words before 1 May 2001. You will understand that, as the Council has, as yet, not received any proposal from the Commission in this regard, I cannot answer the detailed points you have raised in your questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to say, Mr Newton Dunn, that the results of this kind of process for transparency are quite obvious to us and we consider them to be unquestionable. We have no problem, Mr Newton Dunn, in repeating this information to you in writing, but we will not be able to go any further than what has been said here, because that meets the requirements of the Treaty exactly. We therefore consider that the General Secretariat of the Council is at present making available to the public all essential information regarding the Council’s functions as a legislative body. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to say that transparency does not only apply from the Community institutions “outwards”, it also applies between the institutions. By this I mean that there are aspects of the form and procedure of the Community institutions’ workings which are not accessible to the other institutions, and not only as regards the Commission’s relationship with Parliament, but also as regards the Commission’s relationship with the Council. As a matter of fact, at the last conference, this issue was raised and discussed on several occasions. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the preparatory group for the next Intergovernmental Conference. The matter is still open. Genuine transparency of the institutions’ workings and the way they are presented throughout Europe is an extremely important issue and one which, in my opinion, needs to be studied again, particularly in the context of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference. We have no doubts about this and we think that the Members taking part in this preparatory group will have an opportunity to raise this issue again. I believe that the Commission’s proposal should make provision for greater transparency in terms of the way the various institutions function, but I think that there is always room for improvement in this matter. For our part, we are prepared to study any proposals made in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People sometimes get the idea that the Council is the place where issues are dealt with in an opaque way and that Parliament is where they are dealt with in a transparent way. This is not true. We share your concerns about the way the institutions operate and the effects that this can have externally. We therefore have the same concerns and interpret fundamental principles in the same way.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">What may be true, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, is that occasionally we do not have the same views on the exact way in which the transparency process itself may or may not work in terms of genuine transparency. By this I mean that it is often dangerous to imagine that publishing a certain kind of document or that ensuring transparency in some of the institutions are factors that will improve the democratic nature of these institutions, because in reality this is frequently not the case. We know – and I do not want to go into this in any great depth – that when, on occasion, transparency exceeds certain limits, we automatically end up with informal conversations and deals being made behind the scenes. We must strike an overall balance on transparency and this balance lies exactly halfway between realism and rhetoric. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This Intergovernmental Conference will, at the outset, concentrate on improving the way the institutions operate, particularly taking account of the desire we all share for them specifically to become more democratic, more transparent and more efficient. All of this must nevertheless be done whilst respecting a broad framework – that of the overall acceptability of any solutions we may devise to achieve these three aims.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that transparency will be a permanent fixture on the European agenda and it will, of course, feature on the agenda of this Intergovernmental Conference. I can assure you that this is an issue which the Portuguese Presidency will keep before the Member States and the representatives of the preparatory group for the conference. It must therefore be able to count on the support of the Members of the European Parliament, who will surely rally behind this proposal. We will then see, at ministerial level, how we can follow this up. It should nevertheless be noted that we have just concluded the Treaty of Amsterdam, which was approved last May, and that there is a raft of implementing measures on transparency which are still in progress. The question is whether it is premature or not to start a new initiative on the subject of transparency. My feeling is that, in spite of everything, this issue will always have to be on the agenda, because the public is clearly concerned about it, and because it is linked with the need to make the European institutions accountable to the public. As far as we are concerned, they will be. We shall try to achieve a consensus on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Council is aware of the critical level of anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay to which Mr Ortuondo Larrea refers. Nevertheless, at the last Fisheries Council of 1999, held on 16 and 17 December, the Member States involved in this area of fishing, namely France, Spain and Portugal, considered that applying the precautionary principle which sets a TAC reduced from 5 000 tonnes to 2 000 tonnes, as the Commission proposed, was excessively cautious. A compromise solution was therefore reached in order to achieve a balance between the need to reduce the biological risks, that is the species of fish being affected, and the socio-economic problems caused by fishing limits. This was achieved by fixing the TAC at an intermediate level of 16 000 tonnes instead of the 33 000 set in 1999. It was also stipulated that this would be revised in the light of new scientific information on preserving species, of which we hope to see examples in the first six months of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Southern stocks of anchovy in ICES zone IX, the TAC was fixed at 10 000 tonnes for the whole of 2000 as opposed to 13 000 tonnes in 1999. Fishing quota transfers between Portugal and France were reduced proportionally from 5 008 tonnes in 1999 to 3 000 tonnes in 2000, for fishing in French waters. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to state that this transfer will not increase the pressure of fishing on anchovy stocks overall, over the whole Community fishing area. In accordance with the principle of relative stability, 90% of stocks of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay are allocated to Spain and only 10% to France. </p>
<p class="contents">Without this transfer from Portuguese waters, the level of the Bay of Biscay TAC would have to be multiplied by ten in order to grant adequate catches to France. That is why I think that this is quite positive from Portugal’s point of view. This situation would obviously be even more damaging to the level of stocks than the risk referred to by Mr Ortuondo Larrea, which we also understand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I understand that Portugal is affected by this. However, it seems to go against all reason and intelligence that 80% of the anchovies, which, until 1995, were being fished in the Portuguese fishing grounds, through an agreement between that Member State – Portugal – and France, should now be fished in the Bay of Biscay and that the Council of Ministers wishes to maintain that this has no effect on the anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay or the Cantabrian Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been shown, as we have been claiming since 1995, that this move is appalling, and, if Portugal and France wish to reach an agreement, that is fine by us, but these anchovies should be fished in Portuguese fishing grounds and not in the Bay of Biscay. Today, scientific studies show that the anchovy population in the Bay of Biscay is in danger of extinction, and now there will be measures to restrict the amount of anchovy which can be fished in that Bay.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know if you are aware, representatives of the Council of Ministers, of your responsibility over these last few years, and in 2000 as well, for the plight of the families who live on anchovy fishing in the north of the Iberian Peninsular. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Court also stated that the principle of relative stability had not been violated since the anchovy quota allocated to Spain in zone VIII had been maintained at 90% and France’s at 10%. Apart from this, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, the Court is of the opinion that the transfer effected between Portugal and France does not violate the principle of exploiting living sea and freshwater resources in a rational and responsible way, on the grounds that the fishing pressure in zones VIII and IX neither increases nor adversely affects the overall quota of these resources allocated to Spain. </p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, the Council reiterates its opinion that without this transfer, greater account would be taken of France’s possibilities for anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay. The Council therefore reiterates its opinion that fishing pressure would be greater and more damaging to population numbers than the solution which was eventually chosen. In concrete terms, 3 000 tonnes represent 57.5% of Portugal’s fishing opportunities in 2000 against 5 008 tonnes or 73.9% in 1999. These numbers represent, in our opinion and in the opinion of the Council, a real improvement in terms of conservation in comparison with the level of 80% laid down in Council Regulation 685/95. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Measures to combat the continuing ethnic cleansing of Serbs and Romanies in Kosovo</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 2 December 1999, NATO's Defence Ministers made a strong appeal for an end to the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo's minority communities. In its resolution<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> referring to specific atrocities committed against Serbs and Romanies, Parliament also vigorously condemns the continuing violence against the Serb population and calls on the leaders of the Kosovo Albanians to fully respect UN Resolution 1244. The resolution also stresses that previous persecution of the Albanians cannot constitute a pretext for killings, abductions, detentions, intimidation, arson, looting, destruction of property and the taking-over of houses etc. In the light of the above, will the Council reconsider the funding for the reconstruction of Kosovo, as requested by Parliament? What other practical measures will it take to put a stop to ethnic cleansing?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We genuinely share your concerns about the threatening situation which exists in Kosovo for ethnic minorities, for both the Serb and Romany populations, and the incidents of discrimination, harassment and intimidation which continue to take place in that region.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has always stressed the need to seek prosecution of all those who have perpetrated such acts and of those who continue to perpetrate such acts. The Council once again reiterated the need, in its December conclusions, to fully implement Security Council resolution 12/99 and has consistently supported Bernard Kouchner’s efforts to implement measures to guarantee effective protection of minorities in the region and, in particular, to guarantee that measures facilitating the preservation of the region’s multi-ethnic make-up are effectively implemented. </p>
<p class="contents">In our contacts with senior political figures amongst the Kosovo Albanians, we have stressed – and the Portuguese Prime Minister did this very recently – that persecution of the Serb population, the Romany population and other ethnic groups is totally unacceptable. It will not be tolerated, and must stop immediately. </p>
<p class="contents">It has been communicated explicitly and repeatedly to Kosovar leaders that international support will depend to a large extent on the way non-Albanian minorities are treated. I think that this is an extremely important point: this sense of conditionality, which underlies the European Union’s position, is being maintained by the Council and will continue to be maintained. </p>
<p class="contents">We have fully supported the efforts of the United Nations mission and the international security forces in Kosovo to prevent further outbreaks of violence against minorities and to protect the populations under threat. </p>
<p class="contents">KFOR and the UNMIC police consider one of their two main tasks to be preventing any form of maltreatment on the grounds of a person’s ethnic origin. The Council therefore expressed its satisfaction, in its December conclusions, at the substantial contributions announced by the European Commission, which will indirectly assist in returning the situation to normal, together with similar contributions made by Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, Mr Alavanos, the Council is also aware that the total amount of resources made available to the appropriate international organisations in Kosovo does not match the desired amount, in terms of what the various Member States have been able to raise, and this has limited the real ability of these organisations to act on the ground. We shall nevertheless continue to devote all our attention to this problem because the entire credibility of the authorities and of the organisations representing Albanians in the region also depends on the ability of these organisations to prove themselves capable of implementing measures which will guarantee the region’s multi-ethnic nature. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe – as I think we all do – that Portugal, its former president, Mr Soares, and its government, maintained a cautious and middle-of-the-road stance during the bombings in the Balkans. Today’s political statement on this issue was very positive indeed, and one which I welcome. However, there is some concern over the lack of progress made despite the good and honest intentions expressed by the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, we have recently witnessed the eradication of Serb, Romany, Turkish, and Croatian minorities in Kosovo and we are now wondering what will happen next. The United Nation’s, and Mr Kouchner’s, mission in Kosovo ended in failure. This failure is illustrated by the fact that after an entire war that was waged to put an end to ethnic cleansing, we now have ethnic cleansing from the opposite side. </p>
<p class="contents">And so I would like to repeat my question as to whether the Council intends to take more specific action to debate these issues with Mr Kouchner, who has a major responsibility for the situation in Kosovo today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The structure being implemented in Kosovo is under the auspices of the United Nations. It is a structure to which the European Union has given as much support as it can and to which the countries of the European Union have contributed in various ways. </p>
<p class="contents">There is one thing, however, that we cannot deny, and that is that Mr Kouchner’s efforts to return Kosovo’s internal situation to normal have been extremely positive. This is undeniable, even if you – or indeed we – consider that some of the results of these efforts, for reasons beyond Mr Kouchner’s control, have not been as effective as we would all have liked them to be. </p>
<p class="contents">I have one last point to make, which is about the European Union’s responsibility and, specifically, in this case, about possible action by the Council in this matter, and the responsibility of the international community, which has overall responsibility for the situation in Kosovo. Therefore, the responsibility of the European Union has to be seen in a certain context. It is the international community, and specifically the United Nations, which should be held responsible for implementing Resolution 12/99 and, in particular, for the thinking behind this resolution and for the compatibility of this resolution with reality. </p>

I think that, at the moment, particularly in the last few months, there have been some positive developments in terms of the resources that will be available to Mr Kouchner, in order for him to be able to do his job efficiently. I heard Mr Kouchner speak at the Council of Europe ministerial meeting on this issue, and I think that many of the concerns he expressed then about the lack of resources needed to overcome some of the problems have now been addressed. In other words, he has been given these resources. There are two fundamental questions in particular. Firstly, an increase in police numbers would be an important factor in guaranteeing the safety of the civilian population and, in particular, in protecting certain sections of the civilian population. Secondly, an increase in appropriations would allow some officials who have important roles in the administrative and operational process in Kosovo to be kept on. </p>
<p class="contents">The issue which we should all raise, and I did so myself, in a diplomatic way, a while ago, concerns the very substance of Security Council Resolution 12/99. I know that this is an extremely delicate issue, but we should all be questioning the logic behind this resolution and its chances of being implemented. We advocate that it should be implemented in its entirety. Nevertheless, we must look at this resolution, and this is also something that the United Nations Security Council will probably have to do sooner or later. We will have to do so because, as has happened in the past in other contexts and in other strategically important situations across the world, we must be in a position to assess a certain kind of process, and a certain kind of logic and balance – which were in fact the logic and the balance which led to this resolution being approved – should be maintained in future.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have to do, and we in the European Union are already doing it, is to guarantee Mr Kouchner all the necessary resources, and you are right, Mr Rübig, we have a duty to our citizens to explain to them regularly and openly whether or not these resources are being properly used. We in the Council will be trying to provide information on this matter during the Portuguese Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it would probably take us more than one Parliamentary sitting to discuss this.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I would nevertheless like to say that we know that the situation in Kosovo is also closely connected with that of all the countries and regions surrounding it. The situation in Kosovo will not be resolved in isolation. It will be resolved when there is stability throughout the region. This leads, of course, to the measures being taken within the European Union, both in terms of stabilising the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in terms of the new contractual relations which we are trying to establish with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. There is also the raft of positive measures which we are trying to implement together with Albania, in addition, of course, to the pressure we are putting on the Serbian authorities, specifically the support we are providing to Serbian towns with democratic structures, through the “Energy for Democracy” project. </p>
<p class="contents">These actions, taken together, and as a result of the synergy between them, may also create a framework for resolving the situation in Kosovo.

I would like to point out that in May 1999 we adopted a new system for supporting rural development which was the fourth Community reference framework for sustainable rural development. This was, as you know, one of the changes made during the Agenda 2000 negotiations and it changes the way in which agricultural issues are dealt with at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">Through the European Agricultural Guarantee and Guidance Fund, the EAGGF, this Community support framework is designed to help reverse the trend of abandoning rural areas, an issue you are quite right to raise. On the other hand, the European Regional Development Fund, the ERDF, also contributes as part of its role to promoting social and economic cohesion, by redressing the main regional imbalances and encouraging rural areas to take part in development and conversion. In this regard, we should bear in mind that the ERDF also contributes to promoting sustainable rural development and to creating sustainable employment in rural areas. This combination of instruments enables us to implement a policy of rural development which today, furthermore, is one of the ways in which the common agricultural policy – in one of its dimensions – and regional policy also, have developed and changed. We think that this is one of the most fundamental issues within the concept of multifunctionality which is now associated with changes in the common agricultural policy, and the EAGGF, of course, has a crucial role to play in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">During the Portuguese Presidency, we will be continuing discussions on the CAP, by adapting some of the common market organisations with a view to developing the Union’s rural areas in an appropriate way and guaranteeing an improvement in farmers’ incomes, paying particular attention to measures which could have an impact on small family-run farms.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the Portuguese Presidency will continue, if and when the new WTO round begins within its term of office, which is by no means guaranteed, to ensure that the presence of Community production on international markets is strengthened. It will also continue to ensure a greater balance between exported Community farm products and preserving the multifunctional European agriculture to which I have just referred. </p>
<p class="contents">The Portuguese Presidency also attaches importance to reinforcing food safety policy and I think that the Portuguese Foreign Minister and President-in-Office already referred to this aspect this morning. We think that the role of food safety, specifically in terms of everything linked to public health, is one of our presidency’s essential tasks. It is therefore one of the priorities of our programme. We shall be developing it in four parallel schemes, in the Agriculture Council, the Health Council, the Consumer Affairs Council and the Internal Market Council. At the Santa Maria da Feira European Council meeting in June, the Portuguese Presidency will present a report on this issue specifically in the light of the information the Commission presented in its White Paper a few days ago.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that the task we now have of establishing a European agency is crucial in order to give credibility to the single market, to stabilise confidence in this market, to break down some of the tensions between Member States in this area and even – it has to be said – to give the European Union a common approach for its dealings with third countries in areas of food safety. </p>
<p class="contents">This is what we shall be trying to achieve during the Portuguese Presidency and we hope, at the end of it, to be able to present the result of our efforts to this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Council of the European Union is aware of the problems faced by the homeless, of which, as you know, there are many causes, ranging from drugs and violence against women and children to long-term unemployment. It is an extreme manifestation of the phenomenon of social exclusion and of poverty, which the Council is attempting to combat in various ways. In fact, there are so many causes that there must be a greater variety of political initiatives to address these problems as well as further debate, as there is in all of the areas in which the Union intervenes, and in line with all of the policies to be developed in this area.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The first area in which there must be political action is that of combating violence committed by men against women and children, which often causes women to run away, either with their children or alone, which in turn may have serious consequences. It might also be violence committed by men and/or women against children that makes these children leave home, which today leads to phenomena such as drug addiction, prostitution and so on. In order to combat these violence-related phenomena, Parliament and the Council last December adopted the Daphne programme, which is an action programme designed to combat violence against women and children, and which will shortly come into force. This programme will support action carried out by NGOs in this field. At the beginning of May this year, the Portuguese Presidency will be organising a conference in Lisbon on violence against women.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to combating drug addiction, I would remind you of the programme for the prevention of drug addiction adopted in December 1996 by the European Parliament and the Council, with the aim of promoting a multi-disciplinary approach, which was to take particular account of the implications of this phenomenon for society and for individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to combating unemployment and social exclusion, I would like to remind you – and I think that various references have already been made to this today, both by the President-in-Office and by various Members – about Portugal’s initiative to hold a Special European Council at the end of March this year, specifically dedicated to the issues of employment, economic reform and social cohesion, all combined with an innovative and knowledgeable approach. One part of this initiative specifically seeks to combat social exclusion. It also seeks to encourage social inclusion by actively promoting concrete measures and greater coordination, both of employment policies and of the whole raft of policies which could guarantee an increase in European competitiveness, thereby increasing the development of our own economy. This would have obvious consequences in terms of our ability to remedy all of these negative knock-on effects which cause social exclusion and which are obviously linked to poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Still on the subject of concrete measures for combating social exclusion, we should remember that the European Commission announced that it will be proposing a five-year action plan under Article 137 of the Treaty, which seeks to combat social exclusion. The Portuguese Presidency has already committed itself to starting work on this as soon as it receives the Commission’s proposals. This, Mr Papayannakis – and I would like to remind you of my own participation in the last Intergovernmental Conference – was an issue that brought some European countries together during that conference. We also achieved, if I may say so, the feat of bringing it into the scope of the revised Treaty of Amsterdam. I think that this is an issue which we should always bear in mind. It is therefore a key issue, which will enable us to show the public how useful Europe can be to them. If we do not do this, we will find it difficult to persuade them to take an interest in a greater Europe. However, this is a problem which will outlive the six months of the Portuguese Presidency. We will do what we can in these six months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I appreciate and fully support his point on the need for multiple policies and a multi-disciplinary approach and also the need to combat the underlying causes of exclusion which can lead to homelessness and include the problem of drug dependency.</p>
<p class="contents">My specific question concerns the problem of homelessness and whether a new presidency could take a new initiative to try to overcome some of the difficulties the President-in-Office alluded to with regard to support at intergovernmental level.

I think that it is also obvious that our ability to act is linked to the Commission’s own scope for intervening, through its right of initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">I have spoken about the Special European Council and about Portugal’s initiative in convening it, and I have spoken about the future, because there are two complementary ways of seeing the issue of social exclusion. One of them is the series of measures which must be adopted immediately in order to deal with the specific effects of social exclusion. The second is to create internationally competitive conditions, which will enable us to improve the economic fabric of the European Union, and this will have positive knock-on effects on the problems of social exclusion. The Portuguese Presidency does not have a magic wand with which it can, in six months, resolve problems that have always existed. It is prepared to act on proposals by the Commission in any area for which there is Community competence. It also has the opportunity and the desire to promote the whole raft of measures which may be presented, specifically by non-governmental organisations, but also through the intergovernmental collaboration which is traditional in these matters. We should, however, also bear in mind, Mr Papayannakis, that we cannot act in an area which will have such a big financial impact, armed only with the measures a presidency can propose in the space of six months. We therefore think that all the measures we have highlighted in terms of long-term strategies, regardless of the fact that we know that in the long term, some of the homeless may be dead, will help us to guarantee sustainable policies in the European Union. We will try to move these strategies forward as much as possible during our presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am thinking in particular of the whole debate in which we participated on renewing the Lomé convention and on establishing the new contractual framework which will succeed the Lomé Convention. I think – and I say this with the authority of someone who has been involved in the negotiations both on Portugal joining Lomé III and in the negotiations on Lomé IV, as president of the Portuguese delegation – that these issues today are very confusing for the general public and especially for governments, and I think that they must be also confusing for Members of this House. How can we judge the real effectiveness of appropriations allocated to development aid in combating the negative factors they are supposed to address?</p>
<p class="contents">The Portuguese Presidency’s immediate priority will be to hold an informal meeting in January of development ministers, the purpose of which will be to define a European strategy for development cooperation. We therefore think that it is extremely important, specifically within the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee and in the overall framework of preparing for the next UNCTAD, for us to be able to adopt a collective, organised position in order to have an idea of how the Union’s resources are being used for development aid. Why should we do this? Because our own national parliaments are concerned, just as this Parliament needs to be, at Community level, about the way in which these appropriations are being allocated and used. We are anxious to guarantee that these discussions are useful and productive and that they yield concrete results, chiefly as regards future action at international level.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We also think that the new contractual model defined for the Lomé Convention is a more responsible, balanced and efficient model than the one operating under the previous Yaoundé and Lomé Conventions. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to say, as a Summit between the European Union and African countries may yet take place, that these development cooperation issues and a general understanding of how development issues might be addressed in the framework of a bilateral relationship between these two zones will, of course, be paramount in our concerns. It will also be one of the central themes of this agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But there are some questions still outstanding. There does not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against AIDS in the programme. The situation of AIDS in Africa now is so serious that more people are dying of AIDS than are dying in conflict. I hope that the Minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue. Medicines are available in the United States but the United States is not making them cheap enough for the people in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask the Minister what precisely he is doing about the situation that is developing in Ethiopia where there is drought, where the crops have failed, and where, in six months’ time, we will inevitably be back to the situation as it was some years ago in Ethiopia with famine and people dying in their thousands. At the same time, there is a war going on between Eritrea and Ethiopia and the armaments industry in Europe is not short in sending guns, after which we will send the bread. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no contradiction between our two positions, quite the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless we wish to act like megalomaniacs, we cannot in the course of one presidency perform an exhaustive inventory of all possible and imaginary situations relating to all the enormous issues we face, particularly in the area of external relations.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can understand, it would be easy to do so. All we would have to do is get a directory of development and put all the items in our programme, one after the other. We are sufficiently responsible to realise that we should only include those which we will be able to manage during the term of our Presidency and – we should always be aware of this – within governments’ ability to act and within the scope of the Council. We must understand that there are limitations on what we can achieve, particularly in terms of managing national indicative programmes. You have mentioned Ethiopia, which falls within the scope of national indicative programmes, but there are, as you know, several Community actions to combat AIDS, and in this respect, you are right, and the United States will probably not do any better. Indeed, in terms of development aid policy, I think that Europe has absolutely nothing to worry about for the simple reason that our behaviour in this area compares very favourably with that of the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Your question switched to the subject of arms, a broader policy issue which I do not think falls within the scope of this question but which the Council will, of course, address in the future, if it sees fit and if it decides to put it in a specific context. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Questions Nos 14, 15 and 16 will be taken together at the request of the Council, although initially they appear to be different questions.</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 14 by Ioannis Marinos (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-1999-0809_EN.html">H-0809/99</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: European Culture</span></p>
<p class="contents">Europe is basically a cultural concept, and the European Union will be able to maintain its special position and influence worldwide only if it accords basic priority to its cultural dimension by linking it closely to the economic dimension. It is regrettable that there is insufficient awareness of this and of the fact that culture is a major economic asset. This is the reason why only very scant funding is allocated to this field, funding which the Council and the Commission are cutting back as far as possible. The same is unfortunately happening to another major economic asset, namely sport. If, however, the right approach were taken to sport, it could make an impressive contribution towards tackling the key problem facing the EU, namely unemployment, and very significant additional sources of revenue could be secured from the exploitation of sport internationally. Because it has adopted such an approach, the USA now dominates the international music and entertainment industries and thereby influences the ideas, choices and education of the younger generation in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council intend at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to recognise culture as a major economic asset and to accord it the priority it deserves?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 15 by Camilo Nogueira Román (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-1999-0814_EN.html">H-0814/99</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: European employment policy</span></p>
<p class="contents">With a view to the Intergovernmental Conference, will the Council introduce a European employment policy endowed with the necessary concentrated funding, bearing in mind that official EU statistics show that there is now a direct link between unemployment and low per capita income?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 16 by Philip Bushill-Matthews (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2000-0005_EN.html">H-0005/00</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Presidency of the Council</span></p>
<p class="contents">Currently, the EU Presidency is rotated between Member States according to a formula agreed by the European Council. Given the imminent launch of a new IGC, this would seem an appropriate time to reconsider the formula.</p>
<p class="contents">The UK Conservatives in the European Parliament believe Member States that hold the presidency should set a strong example in their transposal of EU legislation into national law and in complying with EU legislation once it is in force.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Council therefore add to the agenda of the IGC discussion of a mechanism to ensure that a Member State can only hold the presidency if it demonstrably shows sufficient respect for EU law?</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, will the Council comment on the suggestion that any Member State in the bottom half of a 'league table' for both transposal of directives and for cases pending before the Court of Justice, should be barred from holding the Presidency of the Council of the European Union?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that these factors have played a role in the various positions adopted by the Union in its external relations. An example of this is the way we have conveyed our concerns within the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor does the Council underestimate the importance of culture and sport in economic terms. As this is the case, I would like to point out, Mr Marinos, that if the cultural dimension of European policy is to deserve the attention of the competent authorities, this will have to be done with due regard to the principle of subsidiarity, taking into account what has to be done at national level as well as at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Nogueira Román’s question on employment, I refer to what I said earlier: this issue is still of concern to members of national parliaments and to national governments, and it will, of course, occupy a central place in the Portuguese Presidency’s programme. Some people even say that it is too high in the Portuguese Presidency’s order of priorities, given that Portugal does not even have a very high level of unemployment. However, we shall be conducting our presidency with a European perspective. I think that the Lisbon European Council and the initiative to which I referred earlier meet this requirement perfectly.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Mr President, that the issues you have put to me are connected with the questions by Mr Bushill-Matthews and Mr Nogueira Román. On the subject of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, I would like to say that the Council can only refer you, gentlemen, to the conclusions of the Cologne and Helsinki European Councils, which defined the mandates for this conference. It should therefore continue to be the responsibility of the conference itself, which is an intergovernmental structure, to study how the issues you have raised could be incorporated into its work within the scope of its mandate. Of course, the extensive support which the Portuguese Presidency is attempting to give to the role of the Members of the European Parliament who will be taking part in the preparatory group will enable them to speak about and channel this Parliament’s concerns via this preparatory group. The President of the European Parliament will also have an opportunity to make progress in this area, at ministerial level.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the rotating presidency, this is not an issue which the Portuguese Presidency intends to raise on its own initiative at the next Intergovernmental Conference. However, if anyone does wish to address this issue, we shall take account of that, and we shall table it for the Conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Please allow me to remark on how well-versed and well-informed he is on European affairs. </p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, in my case, he did not provide what I would call a satisfactory answer. Since the Council recognises the fact that culture is a major economic asset, it should, in my view, demonstrate this in practice. Saying that the cultural dimension is governed by the principle of subsidiarity and that it is therefore national governments who are responsible is, I am afraid, just an excuse. My question, which has not been answered, is why, when the European Parliament is looking to increase appropriations to fund cultural programmes within the European Union, the Council and the Commission are cutting back on appropriations and at times cutting them out altogether. This is a true example of the Council’s indifference towards culture, despite its assurances to the contrary that it is a matter to which it attaches great importance. </p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to ask the Council if it is prepared henceforth to support culture with the same readiness as it supported bananas, hops, cows and Indian hemp. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These cultural dimensions, however, almost always have their own economic dimension in turn, that is the level of resources which can be called on specifically to provide aid for cultural initiatives. This is a dimension which it is difficult to go beyond within the framework of the European Union, and especially within the framework of the Council. </p>
<p class="contents">For our part, we shall be attempting to strengthen and consolidate the European position on cultural goods and services and on activities in this sphere, because we believe that this is an identifying feature which is crucial to the Union’s image and to the Union’s own particular identity. This is, and will continue to be, connected with developments within the World Trade Organisation. As you know, both we and the Council have addressed this issue appropriately. In specific terms, we have been able to find a common language in terms of the mandate given to the Commission for the next round of WTO negotiations, at which this will be a central issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would like to add that with regard to cultural policy, and in particular the audiovisual dimension, the Portuguese Presidency will be paying very close attention to extending and enriching European audiovisual policy by adopting a Media-Plus programme which could go some way towards allaying Europe’s main fears. We also intend to initiate a new debate, a more innovative one, on the issue of Europe’s film heritage, given that this must be one of the most important factors in the development of a European cultural identity and of a European audiovisual economy. The Presidency will also concentrate on discussions about creating a digital television system in Europe, which will be the subject of a conference that we shall be organising during the Portuguese Presidency, in conjunction with the Commission, in February 2000. </p>
<p class="contents">But, Mr Marinos, in the EU context, culture is an issue which is repeatedly raised in connection with IGC agendas. If, by chance, it were possible to agree to include the cultural dimension in what has been called the fifth negotiating box of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, then this could be suggested, both by Member States, and by the Members of the European Parliament taking part in the preparatory group. Of course, if consensus could be reached on this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference, there might eventually be progress. It remains to be seen whether or not there is a consensus on this. We will soon see, and for our part, we will bear in mind any suggestions on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
