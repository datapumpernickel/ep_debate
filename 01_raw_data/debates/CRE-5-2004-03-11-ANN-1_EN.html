<p>(EN) Over the last 20 years, the EU has been working on strategies to improve food security in Ethiopia and has been among the major donors in providing food and humanitarian aid. In this context, the EU has advocated the replacement of external aid by internal food security mechanisms. The Government of Ethiopia has designed a five-year food security programme, the Coalition for Food Security (CFS). This initiative is aimed at addressing the root causes of food insecurity, moving from emergency interventions to a long-term security policy. The EU commends the political will of the Government of Ethiopia to work together with stakeholders through the CFS in addressing the root causes of food insecurity. The EU remains a committed partner in development and will seek to provide assistance, with sufficient flexibility, to enable the government to translate its vision into action.</p>
<p>In order to avoid funding problems, it is crucial that the international community focus on a consistent support to initiatives within the framework of the the CFS, as opposed to promoting a number of scattered initiatives, a view underlined by Martti Ahtisaari, UN Special Envoy for Humanitarian Affairs in the Horn of Africa. Experience has shown that a higher harvest does not imply that food security will be achieved all over Ethiopia. Some food insecure areas still depend on aid, even in surplus years. This is a matter of distribution and of purchasing power. It is crucial to provide incentives to farmers to produce. The EU is committed to address the fundamental problems through support to the Coalition in its long-term food security policy.</p>
<p>At the CFS meeting last December, the EU strongly encouraged the Government of Ethiopia to fully integrate the CFS objectives in its Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Programme (Ethiopia's poverty reduction strategy) to avoid efficiency and financial losses due to programme duplication and the risk of missing linkages between food security policy, economic growth and poverty reduction.</p>
<p>EU assistance to Ethiopia from the European Development Fund takes into account this long-term vision. The National Indicative Programme provides for an “A” allocation (allocations to cover programmes and projects) of € 384.2 million and a “B” allocation (allocations to cover unforeseen needs and contributions to internationally agreed debt initiatives) of € 153.7 million. The sectors of concentration are transport (rehabilitation and upgrading of the road network) (€ 211 m), food security (€ 54 m) and macro-economic support (€ 96 m).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0088"></a>

<p>The safe disposal of obsolete ships is an international problem. The fate of four of the 13 naval vessels from the US National Defence Reserve Fleet docked in Hartlepool rests on a UK High Court decision. The remaining nine ships, still moored in the James River, feature on the US Maritime Administration’s (MARAD) list of ‘40 Worst NDRF Scrap Ships’. Problems include corrosion, on-board fuel, asbestos, and PCBs. An audit by the Department of Transportation Office of the Inspector General reports that ‘Environmental dangers associated with MARAD's old, deteriorating ships are very real and increasing daily. These vessels are literally rotting and disintegrating as they await disposal. Some vessels have deteriorated to a point where a hammer can penetrate their hulls…’.</p>
<p>In the light of the problems related to the need for the safe scrapping of obsolete vessels, what new regulatory initiatives does the Council consider are needed to ensure that EU waters are not used as toxic highways for transporting ‘ghost ships’ for scrappage, and does the Council consider that the Basel Convention banning the export of toxic waste from industrialised countries to developing countries should be amended?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) As the Honourable Parliamentarian will be aware, there is no Community competence as far as shipping and this particular issue is concerned.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, decommissioning of ships was raised at the meeting of the Environment Councils on 27 October and 22 December last year. There, some Member States urged the EU to take appropriate economic and environmental measures and to clarify certain legal aspects of the issue in particular in relation to the Basel Convention.</p>
<p>The Presidency - the Irish Minister for Maritime Transport Dermot Ahern - discussed this issue and the concerns raised at a recent meeting with Commissioner de Palacio, during which he invited the Commission to come forward with appropriate proposals.</p>
<p>So far, the Council has not received a proposal from the Commission. Whenever the Commission does make a proposal, the Council will, of course, welcome the views of the European Parliament.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member will be aware, the EU co-operates closely with relevant international organisations such as the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the Basel Convention in this area. In the IMO, EU Member States have already worked actively together on a related issue - supporting a proposal for the creation of ‘Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas.’ This proposal aims at creating mandatory monitoring and reporting on routed maritime traffic, ensuring the utmost extra care is taken by vessels navigating through particularly sensitive sea areas. Furthermore, the IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) recommended at its 49<span class="sup">th</span> session in July last year, that the Secretariat of the Basel Convention make all relevant information available of this issue.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0094"></a>

<p>(EN) Over the past few years, the Council has been taking a special interest in the promotion of women in rural development. In the reply to Oral Question No <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2003-0415_EN.html">H-0415/03</a>, put by the Honourable Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou on the interim review of the common agricultural policy and the situation of women in rural areas, it was pointed out that the Agriculture Council had approved conclusions on the valuable contribution of women to rural development, which were based on the Spanish Presidency's memorandum and the results of the Conference on Gender Mainstreaming, organised jointly by the Presidency and the European Commission in Santander (Spain) in June 2002. It was further indicated that the Greek Presidency had launched a debate on employment in rural areas, on the basis of a working document initially examined by the Special Committee on Agriculture in June 2003. That debate, which broached the issue of the promotion of female employment in rural areas, was followed by the adoption, during the Italian Presidency, at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting in July 2003, of Council conclusions stating that:</p>
<p>– "Maintaining employment in rural areas depends on economic activity and, in large part, both on having young people set up there and on creating conditions conducive to the presence of women on the land and, hence, on measures to support those two groups of workers.",</p>
<p>and that the Council:</p>
<p>– "calls on the Commission to follow up the Agriculture Council conclusions of 27 May 2002 on incorporating the gender perspective, in order to consolidate the economic and social cohesion processes under way, by means of increasing involvement of women in rural development activities;".</p>
<p>The Irish Presidency, in turn, also attaches great importance to the promotion of women in the countryside. When speaking before the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 26 and 27 January 2004, the Irish Minister responsible for rural development, Mr O'Cuiv, emphasised that it was important for rural policy to make investments in the rural economy in order to generate the employment and living conditions necessary to maintain the rural population, especially young people and women. He further highlighted the need to recognise and reward the vital role played by women in rural communities.</p>
<p>The interest shown is borne out by the conference on the improvement of conditions and quality of life in rural Europe, to be organised by the Irish Presidency in Westport on 31 May and 1 June 2004, at which gender equality in the countryside will be specifically addressed.</p>
<p>I would also remind you that the Council's preparatory bodies are currently examining the proposed Directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between women and men in the access to and supply of goods and services. Adoption of this Directive will mark a major step towards equal opportunities for women in general and, hence, for rural women too.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Irish Presidency of the Council will certainly have consideration given to any relevant legislative measures which the Commission may place before it during this six-month term.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0095"></a>

<p>1 May 2004 will be a historic day on which western and eastern Europe reunite on peaceful terms.

At the present time, ten hours a week of employment gives entitlement to a residence permit, which opens the door to the Member States' welfare systems. By changing the definition of employee/self-employed person so that the work should cover the individual's upkeep, the discriminatory transitional rules would be avoided.</p>
<p>Does the Council intend to take the initiative to redefine the terms employee/self-employed person in order to prevent the misuse of Member States' welfare systems and avoid discriminatory transitional rules for the new Member States?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) As the Honourable Member is certainly aware, the acquis on the freedom of movement for persons will apply as from the date of accession, subject to specific transitional arrangements as set out in the Act of Accession.</p>
<p>Under these arrangements, by way of derogation from Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EEC)N° 1612/68 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community and until the end of a two- year period following the date of accession, the present Member States will apply national measures, or those resulting from bilateral agreements, regulating access to their labour markets by nationals from acceding countries (other than Cyprus and Malta). Depending on how liberal these national measures are, they may or may not result in full access to labour markets.</p>
<p>The current Member States may continue to apply such measures until the end of a five-year period following the date of accession, subject to notification to the Commission by those Member States concerned no later than at the end of the two-year period following the date of accession.</p>
<p>This transitional arrangement may be prolonged for a further two years in those current Member States where there would be serious disturbances of the labour market or a threat of such disruption.</p>
<p>In addition, Austria and Germany may apply flanking national measures to address serious disturbances, or the threat thereof, in specific sensitive service sectors on their labour markets, which could arise in certain regions from the cross-border provision of services.</p>
<p>Moreover, safeguards may be applied by Member States up to the end of the seventh year, allowing for Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EEC) N°1612/68 to be wholly or partially suspended, in order to restore to normal the situation in the region or occupation affected.</p>
<p>During the transitional period, it will be up to the present Member States to determine the conditions for access to their labour markets and, therefore, to their social protection systems.</p>
<p>In addition, it is to be noted that, during the transitional period, acceding countries' nationals legally working in one of the present Member States at the date of accession will enjoy access to the labour market of that Member State on condition that they have been admitted to this labour market for an uninterrupted period of 12 months or longer. These nationals will not, however, enjoy access to the labour markets of other Member States applying national measures.</p>
<p>Finally to answer to the concrete question raised, the Council recalls to the Honourable Parliamentarian that it would only act in the context of a proposal presented by the Commission and that no particular proposal of measures of the type suggested by the Honourable Parliamentarian has been presented at that stage. But, the Council also underlines that the functioning of the specific transitional arrangements provided by the Act of Accession will be reviewed in the future, on the basis of a report from the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0100"></a>

<p>(EN) One of the most significant issues undermining long term poverty reduction is the huge level of debt owed by the poorest nations.</p>
<p>As stated in the Monterrey Consensus, agreed in March 2002 by the Heads of State and Government of the UN Members States, the EU recognises that sustainable debt financing is an important element for mobilising resources for public and private investment and that external debt relief can play a key role in liberating resources that can be redirected towards activities consistent with attaining sustainable growth and development.</p>
<p>Achieving the Millennium Development Goals is a key objective for the European Union and the wider international community. The commitments made by EU member states at the Monterrey Conference reflect the Union’s leadership role in international efforts to achieve the MDGs. The importance of achieving the MDGs was reinforced by the European Union by the agreement of Council Conclusions following the Orientation Debate in January 2004. Progress in this regard will be reviewed at the April 2004 GAERC.</p>
<p>The HIPC initiative has already provided significant levels of debt relief for many poor countries. The EU objective remains to ensure that within this initiative the eligible countries can reach and maintain a sustainable level of debt in the long term, thus reinforcing their efforts to reduce poverty and promote growth. The EU has provided more than half (around 60%) of the financing of the HIPC initiative. In addition, all Member States have announced their intention to go beyond the HIPC targets.</p>
<p>We have to recognise that the HIPC initiative has had mixed effects in macro-economic terms, positive in terms of stock reduction, unclear on interest flows. However, the whole concept of a Poverty Reduction Strategy was born with the HIPC. This initiative was also a catalyst for a better and wide-ranging donor co-ordination.</p>
<p>I would also like to point out that, apart from the relief of multilateral debt through the HIPC Trust Fund and other initiatives, the EU Member States have provided significant relief of bilateral debt owed by developing countries.</p>
<p>The EU objective remains to ensure that, within the HIPC initiative, the eligible countries can reach and maintain a sustainable level of debt in the long term, thus reinforcing their efforts to reduce poverty and promote growth. The EU is also examining ways of ensuring long term debt sustainability for countries after they exit the HIPC process and for all other low income countries.</p>
<p>The EU is convinced that the responsibility for long-term debt sustainability is shared between HIPC and the donor/creditor countries.</p>
<p>The GAERC on 27 April will consider a second Commission progress report on commitments agreed by the EU at the 2002 Barcelona European Council and announced at Monterrey. One of these commitments concerns long term debt sustainability in the context of the HIPC. The GAERC discussion will enable Ministers to review the current situation in relation to debt relief. The Council has mandated the Commission to undertake a comprehensive monitoring exercise in relation to the eight EU commitments made at Monterrey. In the view of the Presidency, any effort to amend the commitments at this stage of the process would only affect the credibility of the exercise. It would also risk opening up all of the commitments for review. This might have implications for the credibility of the EU’s commitment to following up on the Monterrey consensus.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001 the Council agreed on a comprehensive action plan on terrorism covering all the sectors of activities of the European Union. In that context it should be noted that major progress has been achieved and, in particular, the Council has adopted Framework Decisions on the European Arrest Warrant and on the definition of terrorist offences. In addition, agreements have been finalised with the United States in relation to extradition and mutual assistance in criminal matters.</p>
<p>At the moment Council bodies and the Commission are reviewing the 2001 action plan in the light of new developments, notably the implementation of the European Security Strategy approved by the European Council.</p>
<p>Although not specifically related to the events of 11 September 2001, it should also be borne in mind that Eurojust is now operating in the Hague and it is frequently called to co-ordinate investigations and prosecutions relating to terrorist activities within the Union. Moreover Europol has a role in the terrorism field and it has concluded agreements on the exchange of non-personal and personal data with the USA.</p>
<p>With regard to organised crime, the position is that this is an area, which has been, and continues to be, a priority for the Council. In particular, the 2000 new Millenium Strategy on the Prevention and Control of Organised Crime and the 2003 Mid-Term Review on its implementation provide a detailed framework for the development and improvement of international co-operation in the sphere.</p>
<p>During the Irish Presidency, the Council has been active in ensuring that organised crime can be tackled as effectively as possible throughout the Union. In that regard I might mention that at the JHA Council on 19 February 2004 arrangements were put in place to review the effectiveness of existing instruments and measures to combat organised crime originating from the Western Balkans. In addition, the Presidency has introduced proposals to promote the development of co-operation between the public and private sectors for the purpose of combating organised crime.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0113"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council authorities hold regular consultations with the Commission and the other institutions on the subject of problems related to their presence in Brussels and take a coordinated approach in their dealings with the Belgian authorities.</p>
<p>The European institutions exchange information on buildings and transport plans both at the level of heads of administration and within the Interinstitutional Working Party on Buildings Policy.</p>
<p>The Council's medium-term accommodation needs have been estimated at new needs of + 66 000 m² and + 92 000 m² if the existing peripheral buildings are vacated for new sites near the Justus Lipsius building.</p>
<p>On the basis of these estimates, in March 2003 the Council concluded a contract to build and purchase the Lex building (+ 58 000 m²) at 145 rue de la Loi.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the Belgian authorities and the Member States, it is currently examining the takeover and restructuring of Block A of the Residence Palace (currently + 35 000 m²) situated at 155 rue de la Loi.</p>
<p>It will therefore be possible in the long term to group together the Council departments in three neighbouring buildings : the Justus Lipsius, the Residence Palace and the Lex.</p>
<p>This regrouping plan has been discussed with the federal and regional authorities and is based inter alia on the "Verhofstadt-de Donnea" proposal of Spring 2003. Consultations with the Belgian authorities take place within the Brussels-Europe task force where the Council General Secretariat is represented by its Director-General of Administration.</p>
<p>As regards corporate transport plans, the Council General Secretariat would point out that it is currently drawing up such a plan for the occupants of the Justus Lipsius building. Transport plans for the occupants of the other buildings will be drawn up at a later stage, in accordance with the provisions of the decree of the Brussels Capital Region of 5 February 2004.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0115"></a>

Cockle fishing in public places is not regulated by any British authority, a fact which is exploited by Mafia-type organisations which carry out cockle fishing on a massive scale using untrained cheap labour (the workers, according to the press<a href="#defann_14_1" name="refann_14_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, earn between one and two euros for nine hours' work a day). No safety measures are provided for, and, obviously, no taxes are paid.</p>

It also reviewed case studies of successful new forms of company structure and organisation in France, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Slovenia and Ireland.</p>

<p>(EN) In accordance with the conclusions of the Agricultural Council of June 2003, the Commission proposed a reform of the current Common Market Organisation for tobacco.</p>
<p>As for other sectors, the aim is to promote the competitiveness of European production, increase market orientation, encourage sustainable development and improve the effectiveness of support to producers’ incomes. It was also necessary to address the criticisms expressed by a growing number of political leaders and citizens.</p>
<p>To analyse all the direct and indirect implications of the proposed reform, the Commission carried out and published a preliminary economic analysis and a detailed Extended Impact Assessment of its three options. In this context all stakeholders were consulted.</p>
<p>The analysis tools available in the Commission demonstrated that the proposal for decoupling current aid would not have a negative impact on the income of the farms concerned. On the other hand they showed that there could be a possible reorientation of production, and in particular the abandonment by producers whose market receipts do not cover their variable production costs. This could have a negative impact on employment in the regions concerned.</p>
<p>The Commission’s extended impact assessments were able to quantify such effects extending as far as the stage of first processing. There will certainly be some effects beyond this stage, but they would be very difficult, if not impossible, to quantify accurately. In this respect, the Commission must accept the limits of econometric modelling.</p>
<p>The Commission proposed not only that the single farm payment should be introduced gradually, but that it should be accompanied by a mechanism, the restructuring envelope (205 million €/year), intended to increase the funds currently available for rural development measures in the regions at risk.</p>
<p>As things currently stand there is no established econometric model at Union level for the tobacco sector. The Commission therefore asked two University teams which already had quantitative models at Member State level to apply these to tobacco policy and assess the Commission’s proposal for full decoupling.</p>
<p>The Commission is confident that these studies, which are meant to be available in October 2004, will assist the Commission by adding another perspective regarding the possible impact of its proposals on the two main producing Member States.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the analyses which have been carried out in respect of the tobacco sector have been conducted in the same way as the Commission has done for other sectors. Such analyses and impact assessments will remain an essential element of the process of producing Commission policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0129"></a>

<p>The Commission's proposal on the reform of the COM in cotton is not only liable to put a million cotton-pickers out of work in Spain and lead to the abandonment of 600 cottonfields and numerous indirect job losses: it also in no sense creates any genuine incentive for the formation of professional organisations in the sector.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that producers wishing to join such a group should be granted an aid per hectare of only EUR 10. This aid does not amount to a genuine incentive to join an association which will, furthermore, lay down rigid rules which all members will have to comply with. This lack of incentives will mean that most producers will have no interest whatever in joining such organisations.</p>
<p>Can the Commission explain why it is not possible to promote professional organisations in the cotton sector in a meaningful fashion, so as to permit them to manage all coupled aid (the only form in which the Commission's proposed system can work)?</p>
<p>Can the Commission also explain on what grounds it states in its proposal that coupled aid may be received by a farmer who does not meet the conditions defining professional organisations, given that this could be an obvious incentive for receiving aid without having to fulfil any other production-related criteria?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In order to allow cotton producers and ginners to enhance the quality and to organize the deliveries of the cotton produced, it is proposed to encourage the establishment of inter-branch organisations made up of cotton producers and at least one ginner.</p>
<p>These inter-branch organisations will have to establish rules on certain aspects of the delivery contracts between the grower and the ginner with a view to obtain a quality which is adapted to local economic and environmental conditions and for which there is a market demand, taking ginning requirements into account.</p>
<p>The Commission’s proposal provides for an obligation to follow the good agricultural and environmental practice, notably until the cotton plant is mature. Therefore, the coupled aid cannot be granted for nothing.</p>
<p>The aid supplement of 10 € per hectare for membership for the inter-branch organisation is quite sufficient to cover the administrative costs involved. It is in the interest of the producer to be a member of an organisation designed in order to ensure that ginners obtain cotton of good quality at an appropriate special price. A non-member would have no such commitment from the ginner.</p>
<p>Thus, the membership for the inter-branch organisation can be of common interest for the growers and ginners, without any need for supplementary support from the Community budget.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0096"></a>

<p>(EN) On the basis of the information available to the Commission, and as set out in the Chairman's Report of the technical meeting of October 2003 on the Ebro transfer, the scientific and technical work necessary for the completion of the detailed protection plan for the Ebro delta will still take some time to finalise. This is because, in depth studies, monitoring programmes and measurements need to be carried out in order to develop a detailed understanding of the hydrology, chemistry and biology of the delta and the lower river Ebro. Only when this information is available will it be possible to design a management programme to protect the lower river and the delta.

<p>The main water purification plant in Dublin was built with the help of large EU subsidies.

Untreated sewage sludge is being discharged illegally by the competent Irish authorities into the Irish Sea off Dublin. It is alleged that the plant’s capacity limits for waste water and sewage sludge treatment are being significantly exceeded, and that the plant was designed on far too small a scale. Discharge takes place through pipes added on after the plant was built. Since the discharge point is downstream of the testing points, analyses of the purified waste water do not show up any pollution problems. According to my source, it would be easy to ascertain the quantities of sewage sludge discharged by comparing the amounts of sludge generated with the amounts treated.</p>

<p>(EN) The Honourable Member’s question is addressing one of the key threats to the quality of Community waters, discharge of waste water. Indeed, waste water discharge from the Dublin area had been a matter of concern for years. However, this problem has been solved and compliance been achieved with treatment standards under relevant EU legislation, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive.</p>
<p>The new waste water treatment plant was completed and made operational in April 2003, and officially opened in June 2003. It provides for high level of treatment, ensuring not only biological treatment, but also removal of nitrogen and ultra-violet disinfection of the treated waste water – thus taking account of the environmental characteristics of Dublin Bay.</p>
<p>Construction of the plant has been financially supported by Community Funds.</p>
<p>As regards sewage sludge, there is binding EU legislation banning discharge of such sludge into rivers or marine waters, and the new Dublin treatment plant provides for sufficient capacity to treat the sludge resulting from the treatment process.</p>
<p>Following contacts with the responsible Irish authorities, the Commission is not aware of problems with the functioning of the newly commissioned treatment plant; neither has it received complaints from citizens or the Irish non-governmental organisation community.

<p>(EN) In response to several complaints, the Commission opened an infringement procedure in relation to the La Breña II dam project. A letter of formal notice was notified to Spain in October 2000, pursuant to Article 226 of the EC Treaty. This letter was based on non-compliance with Article 6 of Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora.</p>
<p>In response to the letter of formal notice, the Spanish authorities provided complete information in relation to this project and requested the opinion of the Commission pursuant to Article 6.4 of Directive 92/43/EEC. This opinion was requested due to the possible impacts of this project on the Natura 2000 site “Sierra de Hornachuelos” which hosts the priority species the Iberian Lynx. The Commission is expected to take a decision in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The area in question on the edge of the site is not identified as of great significance for the lynx and will not as suggested represent a barrier for migration between different lynx populations. The flooded area of 626 hectares represents 1% of a site of some 60.000 hectares. Moreover, the compensation measures are substantial and should outweigh any marginal impacts that may occur.</p>
<p>It is also important to underline that the compensation package has received the approval of the Donana Biological Research Station, the Department of Ecology of the University of Cordoba, the regional environmental competent authority as well as the Iberian Lynx Working Group convened by the Spanish Ministry of the Environment.</p>
<p>The Commission has ensured that EC environmental law is complied with in this case: first by sending a letter of formal notice and second by a thorough assessment of this file in the framework of the requests for an opinion of the Commission and for EC funding.</p>

The most recent figures available to the Commission are the estimates in its 2003 Report to the Parliament and the Council on the Application and Effectiveness of the 1997 amendment to the EIA Directive<a href="#defann_25_1" name="refann_25_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which can be consulted on the Directorate General Environment web-site.<a href="#defann_25_2" name="refann_25_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> These suggest that across the Union as a whole, between 11,500 and 15,000 EIAs are carried out each year, the majority in France, Sweden, Greece and Germany. This may be an underestimate, as in particular Member States with decentralised or federal systems may have difficulty in registering all EIAs in their territory. EIA must be carried out before consent is given for projects: the question of suspending projects pending improvements does not therefore normally arise. When the Commission considers funding applications for projects (for example under the Cohesion Fund or the European Regional Development Fund) it ensures there is a satisfactory EIA before a decision is taken.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission has seen information about possible disclosures from the same sources as the Honourable Member. If the reports are correct and if such disclosures included personal data that originated in the Union, data protection rules applying here may indeed have been breached but it would of course be necessary to examine the facts in much more detail to make a clear determination. Questions that would need to be addressed would include who exactly made the disclosures; whether the “discloser” was subject to Community law when making the disclosure; if not, whether the transfers to the “discloser” from data controllers who were subject to Community law were made in conformity with Community law; and many more.</p>
<p>Detailed enquiries of this kind are, however, not for the Commission to conduct, but rather for the data protection authorities in the Member States. The competent data protection authorities in this case would be those linked to the specific flights concerned (e.g. The United Kingdom authority would be competent for data collected concerning a flight between Boston and London-Gatwick, whilst for data collected on a flight between Boston and Amsterdam, the Dutch authority would be responsible. Given Northwest’s links with KLM, the Netherlands Data Protection Commissioner appears to be the authority most likely to be concerned and the Commission has therefore ensured that this authority has all the information that it has).</p>
<p>The Commission recalls its Communication to the Parliament and the Council of 16 December. This announces inter alia that the Commission is launching the procedures under Directive 95/46 for a Commission decision finding that “adequate protection” is provided for transfers of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data to the United States Bureau of Customs and Border Protection. The Commission does not consider that this is called into question by the Northwest Airlines issue. First, the facts concerned relate to 2001, and the Commission believes that a good deal has changed since then. In particular, levels of awareness in the United States Government about the importance of taking into account privacy concerns of their European partners have certainly improved in the last year or so. Second, the proposed adequacy finding concerns CBP, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security. This Department is something of a pioneer in privacy matters within the Administration, thanks to Congress’s creation of a Chief Privacy Officer within the Department who is answerable to Congress. The Commission believes too that Secretary Ridge’s is strongly committed to ensuring that privacy concerns are properly addressed.</p>
<p>All this being said, the differences with which the UE and the United States address privacy and data protection seem certain to persist and will continue to make this an area that requires vigilance, continued co-operation and dialogue and careful management.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0080"></a>

<p>After its accession to the EU on 1 May 2004, the Czech Republic is planning to resume more intensive open-cast lignite mining operations in North Bohemia, which would result not only in the demolition of two villages and several churches and castles, but also in greater cross-border environmental pollution due to increased power plant emissions. This has given rise to protests from Czech environmental groups.</p>
<p>What steps is the Commission taking against this questionable environmental policy, and how is it promoting cleaner methods of generating energy in the accession countries?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The exploitation of open-cast lignite mining operations and the subsequent combustion in thermic power plants has, by nature, an impact on the environment.</p>
<p>Community legislation aims at conciling the protection of the environment with the needs of energy production in order to contribute to sustainable development. Lignite exploitations are subject to detailed environmental impact assessments and the public has the possibility to participate in the elaboration of certain plans and programmes related to the environment. Major efforts have also been made to restore land to a natural state following lignite exploitation.</p>
<p>The Czech Republic has undertaken major efforts to do so and has, overall, been very successful in fighting air-pollution. In the period from 1990 to 2001 the emissions of all pollutants observed fell significantly, in the range from 35% to 91%. These reductions are mainly due to desulphurisation measures and the decline in production. At the same time, the Czech Republic has fully transposed and implemented the relevant Community legislation to limit emissions into the air.</p>
<p>In particular, the Czech Republic has made a great effort to adapt the lignite-combustion installations to the requirements of the Directive on emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants.</p>
<p>All the Directive’s requirements are in place, including the National Emission Reduction Plan, which was adopted by the Czech Government in February 2004. The plan aims to cut the volume of emissions, produced by the country's 111 big power and heating plants, by 20,000 tonnes altogether by the year 2008, and to radically reduce the emission of nitrogen oxides by 2016. Neighbouring countries are notified and consulted about large combustion plants that are likely to give rise to significant trans-boundary effects on the basis of the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) legislation, which is also fully transposed and implemented. In particular, the latter enables the likely national and trans-boundary environmental effects of proposals for new mining operations to be considered and possible mitigation measures required.</p>
<p>The Czech Republic is bound to the Union’s strategy on renewable energy sources, which foresees to double the share of renewable energies in gross domestic energy consumption in the Union from 1997 to 2010 (from 6% to 12%). In 2002, the Czech Republic produced only about 4% of its electricity from renewable energy sources, mainly derived from hydro power. The government is committed to meet the Accession Treaty commitment of 8 % renewables share in electricity production in 2010.</p>
<p>Finally, it has to be underlined that the decision with regard to the overall choice of a Member States’ “energy mix” does not fall under community competence. However, the Commission as guardian of the Treaty ensures that Community environmental legislation is fully respected. The Commission also encourages the new Member States – as well as the current Member States – to apply as much as possible sustainable methods for the production of energy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0081"></a>

On the basis of this information, the Commission publishes annual monitoring reports.</p>
<p>The Commission – in its role as Guardian of the Treaties – controls that national legislation conforms to all the relevant provisions, and in particular to the Basic Safety Standards.</p>
<p>Where the Basic Safety Standards are not applied correctly in practice, the Commission can also initiate inquiries and, if necessary, take action against the Member State concerned. Such an initiative is usually originated following complaints informing the Commission of alleged non-compliance, but the Commission can also act on its own initiative, according to its knowledge. To this end, the Commission examines any information that could indicate an infringement of the Basic Safety Standards.</p>
<p>The Opinions delivered by the Commission under Euratom Treaty Article 37 address whether the submitted project is liable to result in the radioactive contamination of the water, soil or airspace of another Member State. The Opinions for the reprocessing activities at Sellafield and La Hague, as for other installations, were based on the general data relating to these plans provided by the national authorities of United Kingdom and France respectively in accordance with Article 37 and the provisions of the Commission Recommendations on its application. These Opinions were delivered after consultation of the group of independent experts referred to in Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0104"></a>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>Twelve years after the submission of bids for the Thessaloniki Underground project and the cancellation of the competition by the Greek authorities - without any reason being given -, the announcement of the call for tenders has given rise to a new problem in the implementation of the project. In particular, the Official Journal of the European Communities (TED, S Series, of 11.2.2004) announced that the procedure had inadvertently been described as 'open' by the Commission services and was advertised as such in OJ S of 6.1.2004 instead of 'closed' (which is correct), as the initial document of the ATTIKO METRO of 29.12.2003 shows.</p>
<p>On what grounds has the procedure been changed from an open to a closed one, who is responsible for the error and to what is it due? How is it permitted to change the terms of the call for tenders after the procedure has been completed? Is it possible for the project to be awarded to a body or company (ATTIKO METRO) without any competition and for contractors to be excluded, since in a closed competition only those contractors who have been invited by the awarding authority may make bids? Is Greek legislation on public procurement contracts in line with Community law (Directive 93/37/EEC<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>), and what measures will the Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties, finally take to ensure that it is respected?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) By way of its letter of 29 December 2003, ATTIKO METRO, the contracting authority for the procedure in relation to the construction of the Thessaloniki Metro, sent to the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities a notice for a call for tender using a restricted procedure for the construction of the project in question, which was published in the Official Journal on 6 January 2004. Following delivery to the contracting authority of a specimen of the published notice, Attiko Metro found that, due to an error of the Publications Office, the notice was published in the section of the Official Journal reserved for the open procedures, whereas the tender in question was meant to be a restricted one. Therefore, Attiko Metro addressed to the Publications Office an express request for the error to be rectified. A corrigendum, superseding and replacing the previously issued notice, was published in the Official Journal on 11 February 2004. It stated that the mistake was due to an error of the Publications Office.</p>
<p>There has thus been no change to the procedure and its conditions, the publication error having been rectified by way of a corrigendum.</p>
<p>ATTIKO METRO, which is a contracting authority and not a construction company, has been designated by law by the Greek State, which passed to it all its competences, as responsible entity for the design, construction, organisation, administration and development of the urban railway networks in the departments of Attica and Thessalonica. Therefore, ATTIKO METRO was entitled to launch the procedure in question and sign the relevant contract, becoming thus the project owner and responsible for its execution. Therefore, ATTIKO METRO can act as a contracting authority in this particular case in conformity with Community legislation on public procurement. It will have to apply this legislation for all procedures which fall under the Community public procurement law, which it uses in the framework of this project.</p>
<p>Directive 93/37/EEC concerning the award of public work contracts provides in its article 7, paragraph 4 that the contracting authorities shall award their public work contracts by open or restricted procedure. Therefore, ATTIKO METRO had the discretionary power to use the restricted procedure. In this respect, it should be noted that the restricted procedure is subject to the publicity rules, since the contracting authority has the obligation to publish a notice for the expression of interest (article 11, paragraph 2). Furthermore, the choice of the contractors who are invited to submit an offer is not arbitrary, but is based on objective qualitative selection criteria announced in advance in the relevant notice and pre-qualification tender documents (article 22, paragraph 1).</p>
<p>Directive 93/37/EEC concerning the award of public work contracts has been correctly transposed in the Greek legal order and the Commission, in its role of guardian of the Treaty, ensures its correct application, using the means devolved to it by the Treaty and in particular article 226.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In flagrant violation of the international agreements and commitments entered into by the United States and the EU at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Doha, the United States is bringing severe pressure to bear on Morocco in an effort to impose a free trade agreement with disastrous consequences in terms of health and access to medicines. The promise given at Doha stated 'we affirm that the TRIPS Agreement can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of WTO members' right to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all'. The obligation to accept an extension to the 20-year patent term required by the WTO, and the proposed provisions extending patent protection on health products would be nothing less than a crime against the Moroccan population.</p>

This initiative implements one of the actions of the Commission’s Action Plan on “Simplifying and Improving the Regulatory Environment” of June 2002<a href="#defann_34_2" name="refann_34_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In its Communication of February 2003, the Commission sets out a comprehensive and ambitious plan to reduce the volume of legislation as well as to simplify and facilitate access to Community legislation. The specific actions to reduce the volume of legislation include consolidation, codification and repeal or declaration of obsolescence of legal acts. At the time, the Commission estimated that the codification programme, once completed as planned by the end of 2005, could alone reduce the acquis by as much as 35.000 O.J. pages compared with the 22.500 pages that represent the 25% objective for reduction set in the Commission’s Communication to the Laeken European Council in December 2001<a href="#defann_34_3" name="refann_34_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>

While the Commission noted satisfactory progress on a broad range of actions, it also had to acknowledge delays in implementation of some of these due to, among other factors, the need to allocate resources to priority tasks such as translation and publication of the Community Acquis in the languages of the accession countries.</p>
<p>However, the Commission is confident that the corrective actions it took in 2003 will allow more decisive progress during 2004 and 2005. The Commission will present a second progress report in April 2004 and a final implementation report will be presented by the end of the year. At that time, the Commission intends to present a more complete picture of the achievements made during several years and the implications in terms of reductions of the volume of Community legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The tragic incident of 5 February 2004 recalled and demonstrated the dangers related to the exploitation of irregular labour, which is one serious form of trafficking in human beings. At the same time it relates to the problem of undeclared work, which gives no protection or rights to workers.</p>
<p>As far as trafficking in human beings is concerned the Commission has already been pushing forward harmonisation of national criminal laws and procedures in the Member States in order to comprehensively address the phenomenon. On 21 December 2000, the Commission issued a communication entitled 'Combating trafficking in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children; two proposals for framework decisions'. Further to that communication the Council adopted the Framework Decision on combating trafficking in human beings on 19 July 2002.</p>
<p>The act addresses trafficking in human beings not only for the purpose of sexual exploitation but also for the purpose of exploitation of a person’s labour or services, including at least forced or compulsory labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery or servitude. The Framework Decision includes a common definition of offences related to trafficking in human beings as well as provisions concerning penalties, the liability of and sanctions for legal persons, and criminal procedures. Special attention has been given to children as victims of trafficking in human beings. According to Article 10 of this Framework Decision, Member States shall take the necessary measures to comply with it before 1 August 2004. The Council will, by 1 August 2005 at the latest on the basis of a written report from the Commission, assess the extent to which Member States comply with the Framework Decision.</p>
<p>In addition to the process of legal harmonisation, the Community financial programmes such as AGIS are an important tool to develop, strengthen and evaluate policies, practices and cooperation in the fight against human trafficking. With a view to further activities at Union level the Commission gives high priority to the Brussels Declaration on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Human Beings which also paid attention to trafficking in human beings for labour exploitation. On 25 March 2003, the Commission set up an experts' group on trafficking in human beings. On the basis of a report of the Experts Group and in the light of the experience further the Framework Decision the Commission will decide about possible further measures to combat human trafficking for the purpose of labour exploitation.</p>
<p>The problem of undeclared work has been addressed in the European Employment Strategy since 2001. The Commission stresses the necessity of policy aiming at transforming undeclared work into regular employment. In the new Employment Guidelines<a href="#defann_36_2" name="refann_36_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, transforming undeclared work into regular employment is identified as one of the 10 priorities. Member States are committed "to develop and implement broad actions and measures to eliminate undeclared work, which combine simplification of the business environment, removing disincentives and providing appropriate incentives in the tax and benefits system, improved law enforcement capacity and the application of sanctions. They should undertake the necessary efforts at national and EU level to measure the extent of the problem and progress achieved at national level."</p>
<p>On the basis of the National Action Plans (NAPs), which were forwarded to the Commission in October 2003, national actions aiming at transforming undeclared work into regular employment were assessed. The assessment was reported in the draft Joint Employment Report, which was presented by the Commission in January 2004<a href="#defann_36_3" name="refann_36_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. Several Member States mentioned in their NAPs special measures directed at foreign workers or illegal immigrants. Emphasis was placed on illegal immigrants and included improvements to the registration process of immigrant workers and increased sanctions for employers hiring workers without work permits. The United Kingdom 2003 NAP did not mention any of these actions, although it reported on several measures to eliminate undeclared work. They include reforms in tax and benefit systems, preventive actions, sanctions, campaigns to raise public awareness and the creation of several interdisciplinary teams to further the co-ordination between relevant authorities for improved control of undeclared work, including through the exchange of data. Further monitoring of action by the Member States will be undertaken by the Commission in the context of the European Employment Strategy.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission has launched two major studies on undeclared work since its 1998 Communication on this subject<a href="#defann_36_4" name="refann_36_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. The first one, published in 2002, reports on the effectiveness of the different policies<a href="#defann_36_5" name="refann_36_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>. The second one, ongoing, focuses on the measurement of undeclared work, the situation in the accession countries, the gender dimension and good practice. The study will be completed in the first Semester of 2004.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The position of the European Union is that it recognises the need for measures by Israel to defend its citizens against terrorist attacks; however, it has expressed serious concerns about the route marked out for the security barrier. This goes well beyond the “green line” and has led to confiscation of Palestinian land. It has caused considerable hardship to the Palestinian population, including problems of access to health, education, water and agricultural land. At the same time, the route of the barrier sends a damaging political signal, implying that a two-state solution to the conflict may become physically impossible to implement.</p>
<p>On the issue of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) hearing, the Commission understands the concerns that Member States have expressed about involvement of the ICJ in this case. The Commission has no plans to intervene in the hearing.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to measures that could be taken, within the framework of the European Union’s relations with Israel, the Commission has expressed its concerns on the route of the separation barrier on many occasions. These have also been shared with the United States, which has expressed similar concerns. In line with the United Nations’s General Assembly Resolution on this matter, the Union has called on Israel to stop and reverse the construction of the barrier inside occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem. The Commission understands that Israel is considering changing part of the route of the barrier to address some of its social and economic effects.

<p>EU Member States and the European Community are shareholders in the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development which provided $150 million in support for the British Petroleum (BP) oil pipeline project in the South Caucasus region (the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline project).</p>
<p>This project came under renewed criticism in a recent article in the 15 February 2004 edition of the Sunday Times which alleged that BP concealed both substantial procurement fraud and potential massive environmental damage: the coating used to seal the pipeline's joints against leakage is reported to be faulty, and cracks were already reportedly found in November 2003 before the approval of the funding from the EBRD.</p>
<p>Does the Commission agree that BP is, therefore in breach of its legal obligation to disclose all risks of 'material adverse effects', and will it indicate what action it plans to take so that the Community and the Member States use their influence at the EBRD to ensure that these allegations are thoroughly investigated and, if they are found to be true, that EBRD financial support for the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline project is suspended?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) Board of Directors, where the European Community is represented by the Commission, approved a loan of €105.8 million in favour of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline project on 11 November 2003. A further loan of €105.8 million was approved for the account of participants.</p>
<p>The article of 15 February 2004 in the Sunday Times was also drawn to the attention of EBRD Directors by a letter from a group of Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) on 20 February 2004. In response to these allegations and concerns expressed by Directors, EBRD Management has provided the following explanations:</p>
<p>With regard to the allegation that BP concealed substantial procurement fraud: BTC confirmed to the Bank at the outset of the project that it will comply with a set of detailed procurement rules which were reviewed by EBRD. The allegations of a conflict of interest related to the procurement date back to late 2002 and early 2003. An independent BP audit was carried out. All accusations have been thoroughly investigated and considered to be unfounded. As no breach of procurement rules was identified BTC had no obligation to inform EBRD of the report or the investigation.</p>
<p>With regard to the allegation of potential massive environmental damage: The applied coating has an extensive track record in North America as well as in Europe. BTC and BP sought references from a number of the major clients who used the product. All responded positively and none indicated any design problems. Following the Sunday Times article the senior lenders’ independent engineer reviewed the allegations and confirmed that the field joint coating paint is technically superior to other paints used and that BTC is using the latest and most appropriate technology. The problems identified by routine quality assurance testing stemmed from inappropriate application during cold weather rather than from the product itself. The cold weather application has been changed by BTC and procedures are in place to correct the cracked field joint coatings identified in Georgia and Azerbaijan and these have been successfully applied over the last month. Field joint coating has traditionally been an area of considerable dispute between experts. The matter has been the subject of considerable discussion amongst the lenders and their consultants and EBRD remains comfortable that BTC is addressing the issue in a responsible and totally professional manner. In Turkey, BOTAS uses a different product under the Lump Sum Turnkey Contract. The independent engineer will review this issue once more during its routine monitoring visit in spring and comment on the quality and reliability of the joint coating in its subsequent report. Please note that the report by Derek Mortimore was completed in 2001. Mr Mortimore has not been involved in an inspection of the pipeline itself but was purely providing advice on various pipeline coating technologies. BTC pipeline construction only commenced in May 2003 long after Mr Mortimore’s assignment terminated. Cracks in the joints only appeared in November 2003 and have been appropriately addressed. Should cost overruns occur to rectify further complications with the field joint coating, the Sponsors will be obliged (based on the Participants Agreement) to inject further equity.</p>
<p>With regard to the allegation that BP is in breach of its legal obligation to disclose all risks of "material adverse effects": BTC Co did not inform EBRD, or other lenders or relevant Ministries of the technical problems with the field joint coating material and its specific application. The assessment and testing of joints is a routine part of the pipeline construction process. Only if a problem could potentially (and after investigation) have a material adverse impact on the project is BTC required to report this to the lenders and its engineers. The hairline cracks in the joint coating have had no material adverse effect on the project. It is inevitable that technical problems occur during the construction of a large and challenging project. The loan documentation includes requirements for regular technical reviews by independent experts and a comprehensive completion guarantee. To pass the technical completion test in 2005 and to achieve a release from the Sponsors’ corporate guarantees the completed pipeline must comply with highest international standards which will require certification by the lenders’ independent engineers. BTC is required to report technical problems which could have a material adverse effect on the completion of the project. Currently BTC is in compliance with the reporting requirements under the financing agreements."</p>
<p>At the present time the Commission, along with the Member States, as represented on the Board of Directors of the EBRD, sees no reason to call into question the above assurances provided by EBRD Management.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0125"></a>

<p>(EN) The specific Community legal instrument for the levying of taxes, tolls and user charges is Directive 1999/62/EC<a href="#defann_39_1" name="refann_39_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. It is targeted to heavy goods vehicles of 12 tonnes and more. Road tolls may be required for the use of motorways or similar other multi-lane roads as well as for the use of bridges, tunnels and mountain passes.</p>
<p>It is to be underlined that Member States levying tolls on goods vehicles below 12 tonnes and for passenger vehicles do not have to comply with the provisions contained in Directive 1999/62/EC as such vehicles fall outside its scope. Whether these vehicles are tolled or not, is a matter of subsidiarity, where Member States can make more efficient decisions taking into account local circumstances, provided they comply with the general Treaty principles, such as non-discrimination and proportionality.</p>
<p>As to the vehicles covered by the Directive, the weighted average tolls shall be related to the costs of constructing, operating and developing the infrastructure network concerned. The source of financing does not change anything in the amount of the toll or in its applicability.</p>
<p>In order to further develop the transparency of tolls and to implement the “user pays” principle, the Commission made in July 2003 a proposal for a Directive of the Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 1999/62/EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures<a href="#defann_39_2" name="refann_39_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, covering all goods vehicles of more than 3.5 tonnes using roads on the Trans-European Network (TEN). An important element of this new proposal is the hypothecation of revenues, which brings further benefits to the transport sector and to the users.</p>
<p>In relation to Union support to the project no Cohesion Fund or European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) grant was made to assist the construction stage. To the Commission's knowledge all the construction costs were covered by national public finance. The Commission awarded a Cohesion Fund grant to support the planning, design and land acquisition costs of the tunnel in 1993. That grant was finally fixed at € 6 million based on a total eligible cost of € 7.2 million. The full grant was paid in 1996.</p>
<p>In general the Commission is in favour of public - private partnerships to fund the provision of infrastructures. It is not unusual for Community grants to be made to projects that are funded by infrastructure charges / tolls. Where such charging is foreseen the grants are calculated after an analysis that takes account of the costs of the investment and of the revenue to be generated.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) A significant increase of Community investment in research, a further reform of the Cohesion Policy, and the continuation of the reshaping of the Common Agricultural Policy are, indeed, three features of the Commission’s proposals for the Union budget for 2007-2013, as they are presented in its Communication on the next Financial Perspectives.</p>
<p>These three characteristics must not be considered in terms of pure accounting. They are internally closely related, are components of a coherent political project, and participate of the same spirit: maximizing the use of Union financial means, by focusing them on the fields of highest relevance for the future of the enlarged Union, while allocating them through the most efficient instruments.</p>
<p>In this framework, in support to Union competitiveness, growth and employment, a key priority of the proposals is to make of the Union a performing knowledge-based economy, as foreseen in the Lisbon agenda. For this purpose, alongside education and innovation, the Union research policy must be reinforced, concentrating the efforts on 5 axes corresponding to 5 major structural issues in this field: stimulating the creativity and excellence of European research by supporting individual teams in competition at European level; strengthening research capacities by supporting infrastructures of European interest and a reinforced support for human resources; fostering public/private partnerships in fields of both public and industrial relevance; creating “poles of excellence” through networking and joint projects at laboratory level; and improving the co-ordination of national and regional research programmes and policies.</p>
<p>During the current planned period 2000-2006, Structural Funds funding for Research and Technological development, including R&amp;TD infrastructures and equipment as well as regional innovation strategies, innovation clusters and technology transfer projects, has been estimated at nearly 10 billion € for Objective 1 regions and over 2 billion € in Objective 2 regions.</p>
<p>For the future and in a converging evolution, in conformity of the orientations of the 3<span class="sup">rd</span> Cohesion Report “A new partnership for Cohesion: Convergence, competitiveness and cooperation”, it is proposed to refocus those Structural Funds towards the Lisbon and Gothenburg priorities, including research and development as well as innovation, for all European regions, as well as for territorial cooperation programmes.</p>
<p>As for agriculture, the Commission’s proposals take full account of the financial framework for market and direct aid support for the period 2007-2013 for the enlarged Union, fixed by the Heads of State and Government at the Brussels European Council of October 2002.</p>
<p>All these proposals take place in the context of a proposed general increase of the Union budget, allowing to respond to the needs of a Union of 25 and more Member States in a “globalised” world.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0130"></a>

<p>(EN) The goal of the reform process undertaken by the current Commission is to transform the institution into a modern administration of the highest quality. The administrative and financial measures already taken or under way seek to maximise the Commission’s capacity to deliver an effective public service to Europe’s citizens.</p>
<p>The ten Commissioners who will join the Commission on 1 May will be full members of the College and will play a full part in the decision-making process. Each will be associated with the work of one of the present Commissioners in order to ease their integration into the Commission's work. No changes are expected in the allocation of portfolios among Commissioners during the term of office of this Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0132"></a>

<p>According to the Commission's third report on economic and social cohesion, the increase in Greek GDP mean that four regions will exceed 75% of the average Community GDP: Attica (78.1%), Central Greece (104.2%), Western Macedonia (75.4%) and the Southern Aegean (83.9%), and they will now no longer be Objective 1 regions. Moreover three other regions are very close to the 75% mark and are very likely to have exceeded it by the time the final decisions are taken. These are: Central Macedonia (73.6%), the Peloponnese (70.2%) and Crete (70.7%). However, many of these regions fall foul of an unfortunate statistical phenomenon: even though the per capita income remains relatively low, the fall in the Community average owing to enlargement will artificially push them past the 75% mark.</p>
<p>Does the Commission intend to take this aspect into account and, if so, what initiatives does it intend to take? Does it intend to make fresh proposals for specific support measures for these regions before the final decisions are taken so that resources from the Fourth CSF are correctly but equitably, distributed?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In the Third cohesion report – adopted on 18 February 2004 – the Commission sets out proposals for the reform of cohesion policy after 2006. The Commission proposes that for the next generation of convergence programmes, the successors to objective 1, eligibility should be determined using data for Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per head in Purchasing Power Standards (PPS). The Commission proposes that the eligible regions should be those defined at NUTS II with GDP per head below 75 % of the average of the enlarged European Union.</p>
<p>The statistical effect of enlargement results from the expansion from 15 to 25 Member States which will reduce average GDP per head by around 12.5%. Thus a number of regions of the current Union would see their GDP per head rise above the 75% threshold in the enlarged Union, while remaining below it in the Union of fifteen, even though their objective circumstances will not have changed.</p>
<p>The contained in the Third cohesion report specifically address the regions affected by the statistical effect, recommending they should be treated in a way that would yield a level of support that “would be higher than decided in Berlin in 1999 for the so-called “phasing out” regions of the current generation”.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
