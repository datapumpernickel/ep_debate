<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andreasen (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has always given the highest priority to the fight for human rights. It means a lot to us that individual persons each be guaranteed both their fundamental freedoms and their basic rights. It is therefore a special honour for me to be rapporteur for this report with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the Guantánamo detainees’ right to a fair trial.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone in this House agrees that international terrorism must be fought. There is therefore no intention behind this report to place a question mark over the fight against terrorism. It has been prepared in order to emphasise that, even in a just cause, there are some quite fundamental rules that have to be obeyed, namely respect for the individual person’s rights, as laid down in the UN Convention on Human Rights and in the Geneva Conventions. In this case, it is, as has already been pointed out, particularly a question of the right to a fair trial and to treatment in accordance with international law.</p>
<p class="contents">Since January 2002, approximately 660 people from 38 different countries have been held prisoner at the American naval base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. We know for certain that 87 of them, and perhaps more, have now been released, but by far the majority of them are still there. They do not know of what they have been accused, they have still not been brought before a judge, and no one knows whether or, if occasion should arise, when they are to be so. The detainees are in a legal vacuum. They are regarded either as ordinary criminals or as war criminals. As ordinary criminals, they should be safeguarded by American law but, according to a court of appeal in Washington, the naval base does not fall under American jurisdiction since it is not a proper part of the United States. Another court of appeal in San Francisco has rejected this argument, but this court of appeal is also the court in the United States whose decisions are most often overturned in the Supreme Court, so it is doubtful whether its pronouncement will be of any consequence. On its own initiative, the American Supreme Court has decided to investigate whether American jurisdiction should also apply to the Guantánamo naval base, and a response is awaited by no later than June of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor, according to the American authorities, are the detainees at the naval base prisoners of war, and they are thus not protected by the Geneva Conventions, either. The detainees were not part of a regular army when they were taken prisoner. They had no rank or uniforms and did not openly bear arms. Instead, the detainees are regarded by the American authorities as illegal combatants who do not come within known legal systems and who can be detained for an unspecified period without being tried or given access to lawyers.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the situation of the prisoners. They do not know what they are charged with, and whether or when they can be given fair trials. This is a clear violation of human rights and a breach of international conventions, and the report therefore requests the United States immediately to bring the detainees out of the legal vacuum they are in and guarantee them immediate access to legal assistance, which will clarify the legal status of each individual detainee. It is important to emphasise in this connection that the report applies not only to the European prisoners, but to all the prisoners and to their individual rights as human beings. The report supports the Council position according to which the Third Geneva Convention of 1949 on the treatment of prisoners of war is to be interpreted in such a way that, in case of doubt, the detainees at the Guantánamo naval base are to be treated as prisoners of war until and unless it is decided that they do not fulfil the conditions. Thereafter, they may, if occasion should arise, fall within either the Third Geneva Convention, which applies to legal combatants, thereby affording them status and protection as prisoners of war, or within the Fourth Geneva Convention, which applies to civilians.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report, we also request the American Government to confirm that the temporary military commission, set up in November 2001, is complying with all the international laws, just as we request the American authorities to give representatives of the states concerned and of international institutions, as well as family members and independent observers, access to the detainees as visitors.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and the United States have always been allies. We have always had, have now and shall in the future retain a good relationship with the United States. The report states that the transatlantic relationship is invaluable and irreplaceable and could be a formidable force for good in the world, but only if basic human rights – such as the right to fair trial and the prohibition on arbitrary detention – are respected and remain the core values shared by the United States and the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore call upon the United States fully to comply with the obligations it has itself assumed in relation to international law and international humanitarian law. The report recommends to the Council that the issue of the conditions under which the Guantánamo detainees are being held be addressed at the summit that is to take place between the EU and the United States in June 2004. We want a common action plan for the fight against terrorism to be devised – an action plan that combines resolve and action against terrorism with full respect for international humanitarian standards.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank my fellow MEPs in this House for the many positive contributions I have received from them in connection with this work and for the almost unanimous adoption by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy of the proposal for a recommendation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the honourable Member on his report. It touches on an issue which is central to our concerns in the European Union, namely the protection of fundamental human rights. No-one in this Chamber doubts the vital importance of the fight against international terrorism, nor will or should any of us ever forget the horrible tragedy which we saw on our television screens when those planes crashed into the twin towers in New York on 11 September 2001. But we all understand the essential need to combat this evil in a way which strengthens the cause of freedom and human rights. The terrorists win if we lose sight of this fact.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States, as the honourable Member pointed out, detained several hundred men during and after the fighting in Afghanistan and some have been detained for as long as two years or slightly more. Some of them are nationals of our Member States but wherever they came from they need to be treated fairly and humanely, as the report says. We welcomed the release of a number of detainees recently and we look forward to the release of more in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has been a staunch and committed member of the international coalition against terrorism. However, as the European Union has repeatedly underlined at both the sessions of the UN Commission on Human Rights and the UN General Assembly Third Committee, it is imperative that we and our allies uphold the values of international human rights and humanitarian law when fighting terrorism. The forthcoming session of the Commission on Human Rights will provide a further opportunity to tackle the issue of human rights and terrorism, and to build on the endorsement by the Third Committee of the proposal that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights should examine the protection of human rights when fighting terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I need to make it clear – and I do so without in any way suggesting a lack of interest in this problem which rightly is of considerable concern to many Members of the House – that the European Commission does not have competence in a number of the areas which are raised in this report. In the absence of a common position on this question, it is for individual Member States to make diplomatic representation on behalf of their nationals. Equally, the question of the agenda for the US Summit is a matter for the presidency and for the United States. However, I am sure that the Council will take note of this report and of the strong feelings of many honourable Members on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">The House is very keen to have answers to a number of questions. Are these men to be tried and if so for what crimes and under what jurisdiction? Are some of them to be released to the jurisdiction of their own countries, and if so, will guarantees be sought and obtained for their humane treatment? There are many more questions which are raised by this case and are touched on in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make this clear: to ask these questions is not to question for one moment our strong partnership with our friends and partners in the United States in the fight against terrorism – terrorism which has a global reach. But one of our most potent weapons against this evil is our unshakeable commitment to the principle of freedom under the law.</p>
<p class="contents">We as Europeans must avoid the danger of raising these issues in a confrontational way which ignores the trauma which the people of the United States have suffered. That is why I welcome the fact that the honourable Member has raised this subject in his report in such a careful and measured way and I am glad to have had the opportunity to respond to him today.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial that we always try to keep in mind how the fight against terrorism and the promotion and protection of human rights impact on each other. We constantly underline that the fight against terrorism must be conditioned on maintaining respect for human rights, not the other way round. I would even go one step further. In my judgment, fostering human rights should become an integral part of the fight against terrorism. Only then can we hope to defuse the social tensions on which terrorism feeds.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again I would like to congratulate the honourable Member on his report. It raises issues of considerable importance. It raises the sort of issues which I have had to tackle before in other circumstances, for example in reorganising the police and security services in Northern Ireland and basing that reorganisation on the fundamental proposition that the forces of law and order are there to protect and maintain human rights and should have no truck with the undermining of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We all stand four-square in the fight against the evil of terrorism and the lethal combination of terrorism and technology. But we also, I believe, stand four-square in our belief that the best way of fighting terrorism is to retain a proper respect for human rights.</p>

I do not take a religious perspective, but it is clear that it is not only Europeans who feel strongly that the situation at Guantanamo Bay offends against our sense of justice. One of the senior justices in the United Kingdom, Lord Steyn, branded the proposed military tribunals at Guantanamo Bay as a stain on US justice and the term 'kangaroo court' springs to mind. The British Court of Appeal has branded the detention of prisoners there as a legal black hole.</p>
<p class="contents">The Bush administration has argued that the Geneva Conventions are obsolete when it comes to dealing with terrorists and has chosen to apply neither these conventional laws of war nor the criminal law in which human rights norms should apply, that is the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or the US Constitution. It has tried to straddle both by inventing a new, residual category of 'unlawful combatant' in the potentially unlimited war on terror, which is transformed from a metaphorical to a literal term. However, that status is unknown in international law.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, the denial of the prisoners' right to access to normal civil courts and the protection of the US Constitution has been backed by the US courts on the grounds that Guantanamo Bay – even though the US is in actual control of the base – is not sovereign US territory. But it is welcome that the Supreme Court has now said it would decide on whether the US courts have jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="contents">I would end by saying that I regret the absence of the Council in this debate since, as Commissioner Patten has pointed out, the Commission does not have jurisdiction, and the failure of the Council to adopt a common position and a strategy to implement the upholding of the rule of law in Guantanamo Bay is a sad omission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I value the way in which the rapporteur has tackled the topic. It is positive that he, in line with my group's approach, has strengthened the foundation of this report. I should like to share with him my appreciation for the good working relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">This topic touches the very heart and foundation of our constitutional state. More than two years after the United States transported some 660 foreign detainees to Guantanamo Bay in the framework of the fight against the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, there is, unfortunately, still uncertainty: uncertainty about the charge, uncertainty about the duration of the detention, uncertainty about the possible judicial process, uncertainty about legal aid and uncertainty about contacts with the country of origin. In short, there is a legal void. The American Supreme Court is now looking into the question whether the American courts are competent to assess the legal status of the detainees.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the great effect that terrorism has had on our American ally in the wake of the dreadful attacks of 11 September speaks for itself, we are now a few years further down the line and the prisoners on the Cuban base have still not had access to the courts. This situation cannot, and should not, be sustained. Precisely because the transatlantic dialogue is so meaningful and irreplaceable, it is important to keep the lines of communication with our American friends open. Allies are allowed to make urgent appeals to each other. I appreciate that the Convention of Geneva of 1949 is no longer fully adequate to accommodate new threats such as terrorism. It is important that international law should develop in such a way that a legal basis is in place for addressing new security issues. Even the worst terrorist is entitled to a fair trial. That is a basic principle underpinned by international law. I would mention by way of example both the <span class="italic">habeas corpus</span> principle and the need to properly safeguard the administration of justice, as well as, among others, such important treaties as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights, the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, and the Convention of Geneva, to which the rapporteur has already made reference. All those treaties involve the task of guaranteeing a humane treatment of prisoners and the right to a fair trial. In the final analysis, this is about human dignity; every person counts. I gladly subscribe to what the rapporteur has raised in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I urge the Council to continue to bring the case of the Guantanamo detainees to the attention of the authorities of the United States. This case is deserving of this, and more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this American concentration camp on Cuban territory, international law and American law have been outlawed to almost universal indifference. The whole world can see this place where there is no law, this legal black hole as Amnesty International calls it, but does nothing. Individual liberties won with great difficulty over hundreds of years have met their death on the beach at Guantanamo Bay.</p>
<p class="contents">As the victim of the 11 September attacks, the United States was perfectly within its rights to arrest, charge and try everyone presumed to have been involved in those attacks. But there was absolutely no need to act unlawfully, or to lock the 660 detainees in animal cages that are floodlit day and night. The days of the lawmen of the Wild West are over. Nowadays, no one should be able to set themselves up at one and the same time as accuser, defender, judge and executioner – you might as well say torturer.</p>
<p class="contents">Such, however, is the macabre scenario adopted by President Bush for his ‘offshore’ justice in Guantanamo Bay. With the allied governments wallowing in cowardly silence, it was time for the European Parliament to react in a credible and audible manner. Mr Andreasen’s report on the Guantanamo detainees’ right to a fair trial therefore comes at just the right moment and I congratulate the rapporteur on behalf of my group.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution on which we shall be voting tomorrow is addressed to the Council and calls on it to adopt a common position on this serious violation of the fundamental principles of law. As Commissioner Patten very rightly pointed out, such a common position is very sorely lacking. But that call will doubtless remain a dead letter so long as the absurd method of unanimous voting continues, allowing Europe’s voice on foreign policy and human rights to be silenced by just one dissenting vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the Swedish media, they will be arrested and interrogated when they land in Great Britain this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">A further four Britons still in Guantánamo Bay will not be released, at least not yet. The Swedish detainee, Mehdi Ghezali, is also still there, with no immediate prospect of being released. That is how the situation has looked for more than two years.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the Swedish citizen is concerned, the Swedish Government indicated at the beginning that the issue should be taken up with colleagues in the Council of the European Union. Here we are today, more than two years later, and this is as far as we have got.</p>
<p class="contents">Like so many of these detainees, Mehdi Ghezali is young. The people concerned are young, and quite a few of them can even be regarded as children. Mehdi Ghezali’s family has heard nothing at all from him for 13 months. The officials from Sweden’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs who have been able to visit Mehdi Ghezali are not allowed to tell his family how he is. His lawyer has not been able to visit him, either.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Patten said that we must have a good relationship with the United States. Yes, we must have a good relationship with the United States, but we must also have good relationships with all other nations. I think that the old saying, ‘It takes two to tango’ is apposite in this case. The United States’s conduct on this issue does not, unfortunately, encourage much in the way of confidence. Of course we remember 11 September, but I also remember the pictures that, in spite of everything, have come out of the base at Guantánamo Bay, showing young people sitting handcuffed in cages.</p>
<p class="contents">We are committed to human rights. We cannot just have debates at regular intervals about them. They must also mean something, and I therefore wish genuinely to thank Mr Andreasen for a very good report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a very important initiative and this is an opportune time for it to be brought forward. The existence of internment-without-trial camps in Guantanamo Bay has to unacceptable to anyone in a civilised society. Any prisoners captured during the invasion of Afghanistan should have been treated according to international law and, at the very least, should have been classified as prisoners of war. They have the right to a fair trial. They should also have the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty in a court of law, have access to legal representation and have the right either to be charged or released.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish presidency should be doing everything in its power to ensure that these people are not denied their basic human rights for a minute longer. I agree with what Mrs Ludford said concerning the failure of the Irish presidency to be here today, which is an appalling message to send out to the European Community and indeed to the international community. As Commissioner Patten said, it is up to the Council to raise this matter with the United States, and the EU Council has failed abysmally to do so on any occasion. I would also question why it is that the Irish presidency is not here today. Is it because that presidency is afraid of offending the United States by saying something at that country would take offence? The Irish presidency is also letting down the Irish public, which views this matter as an absolute scandal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The detainees are not a bunch of scouts that have got lost on an outing. All the evidence suggests that the detainees have been treated humanely. Pictures from the naval base show cells considerably better than those in many of the EU countries’ prisons.</p>
<p class="contents">It is only a few of the EU Member States that are actively participating militarily in the fight against the reactionary forces that would use terrorism to change the direction in which the world is moving. That is a fight we leave to the United States and its true allies. To listen to some of those with a professional hatred of the United States, one would imagine that, in their view, the Taliban and al-Qa’ida are a species of freedom fighter who wish to help poor and oppressed peoples. They are the opposite. The terrorists must be given the kind of fright that will deter them from continuing with their criminal acts. Only by crushing their networks can freedom and democracy be developed in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The detainees at the Guantánamo naval base are not soldiers in an organised army. They are not an underground movement in an occupied country. They are terrorists who fanatically oppose the human rights that some in this House now believe they should enjoy. Some of the prisoners have acquired citizenship of EU countries. When, subsequently, they take part, with or without visible weapons, in an armed struggle in which some of our soldiers are killed, then they are traitors and must be treated as such. I am certain that there are EU countries which would not have shown the United States’s forbearance, but would have shot a whole lot of them on the spot. It is unfitting that we, who are not waging war in Afghanistan and who have not ourselves been exposed to genuine terrorist attacks in our countries, should think we should tell the United States what to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank Commissioner Patten for making it clear that the Commission has no competence in this area and add that the Council has no such competence either. I wish to recommend to Parliament that it vote against the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, all the demands made by this resolution to treat the detainees either as innocent bystanders caught up in American crossfire in Afghanistan or common-law criminals subject to due process are legally not sound, and not necessarily desirable either – particularly if we are to protect Europe's security and people from further attacks. Also, the state's first duty is always to protect its innocent citizens from future attack from any such terrorist groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The US would not waste valuable public resources detaining those who pose no security risk. Indeed, after exhaustive enquiries, many have been returned home, including three juveniles – one who in an interview to the British press testified to the humanity of his captors and was grateful for formal English-language instruction on the base. The rest – including the EU citizens involved – are undoubtedly dangerous or a source of ongoing useful intelligence and should either be tried for war crimes, if appropriate, at standards compatible with international norms or held in humane conditions as illegal combatants for the duration of the war, with Red Cross and consular access, until Mr Osama bin Laden is captured and formally surrenders his terrorist network and their declared war on the West.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not accept that habeas corpus applies in emergency situations like times of war or national emergencies, so its inclusion is totally inappropriate. No prisoners of war during the Second World War were allowed to have a fair trial – everyone knows that they were detained for the duration of war. Furthermore, historically, citizens of any country – and the UK in particular – who in times of war went abroad and fought against their own armed forces or their allies were potentially indictable for treason, historically a capital offence and even today a very serious offence. Therefore, the Liberal motion before us today will not be supported by me, as its primary purpose is to bash the United States of American in its global war on terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Terrorism and terrorist groups have won when the rule of law is set aside. Mr Camre, the rule of law is not an enemy, but the basis of a civilised society. When you discard it, you discard your civilised rights. One has to look at the charges brought against these individuals. If charges had been made, then they would have the right and the opportunity to defend themselves, but no charges have been made. Three of my constituents are amongst those about to be released. What of their families? What of their concerns? What of their human rights? I start, as I believe everyone in this House starts, from the notion that people are innocent until proven guilty. The two previous speakers would seem to accept the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">The calls made in this House are not anti-American. Indeed, we have asked the United States to uphold the rights of the free world which are at the heart of its own constitution. Here we come to the crux of the matter: the argument that somehow these people are outside US national jurisdiction. They are not, and it was on this basis that the Supreme Court petitioners called for the releases of detainees that we have seen recently.</p>
<p class="contents">They should be subject either to US law or to the rule of international law: legal representation, a fair trial and the right of appeal. It is in exceptional circumstances that the unexceptional, normal and rational rule of law is most needed. Mr Camre, I cannot agree with you. You have denounced these people and even you will not give them a fair trial. We must never forget that 11 September altered the American psyche forever. Hence the actions that have been taken. This House has therefore chosen a noble route: not to condemn, nor to cast out those who have been detained – perhaps in horrific circumstances – but to ask quite simply that the rule of national or international law be upheld and fully respected. I, the PSE Group, the ELDR Group and other Groups will uphold those principles. It is a sad day when all the Members of this House cannot do the same.</p>

<p class="contents">Fortunately, regarding the cases of Mounir El-Motassadeq and Abdelghani Mzoud, the courts in both the United States of America and just recently in Germany have stood up for the most fundamental human rights principles of all, one of which is the right to a fair trial. This illegal confinement is not in America’s interests, but only makes the legitimate fight against terrorism more difficult. That can only succeed through cooperation and lawful courses of action, and it is actually giving into terrorism to ignore them.

It is a recipe for feeding hatred, not for coming to terms with the awfulness of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a debate about defending democracy and the rule of law, and an appeal to the good sense and the democratic instincts of the American people in circumstances where good sense and democratic instincts are all important.

We have seen the United Kingdom derogate from Articles of the European Convention on Human Rights in order to legitimise the internment in Belmarsh of UK residents.

That is quite extraordinary because the holding of the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay runs contrary to human rights. The prisoners have no access to an independent lawyer, and we do not know who exactly is being held or what precise charges are being brought against them. Under such conditions, there is reason to be concerned about the detainees’ mental health.</p>
<p class="contents">Without the prior assistance of an independent lawyer, we can say that there is an obvious risk of negotiation to reach an agreement and doing so in order to get the charges reduced. If that is the case, detainees will be able to choose to plead guilty, even if they are not, in order to escape the death penalty. It is clear that President Bush and the US leadership want show trials with confessions because it is presidential election year.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament’s position must therefore be intransigent against terrorism, but also intransigent on respect for international law. It is unacceptable to sentence someone before a verdict has been reached. That is what is happening here, sometimes even in this Chamber. We must all therefore denounce this legal black hole in which the detainees find themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">We can all remember the horror of what happened, but we do not want terrorism to win and we must demand fair treatment for all and show that we defend values that respect the law. Ladies and gentlemen, that is the best means we all have of combating barbarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
