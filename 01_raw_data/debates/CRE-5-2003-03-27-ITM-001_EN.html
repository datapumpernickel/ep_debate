<p class="contents">The aim of this research programme is to speed up the development and evaluation of new vaccines and drugs through a partnership between Europe and some fifteen developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The Commission believes that it is in the Community's interest to be associated with an initiative of this kind, particularly against the background of creating the European Research Area. It proposes to do this by applying Article 169 of the Treaty, under which the Community may, in implementing the framework programme, participate in research programmes undertaken by several Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's specific proposal is to provide for a financial contribution of EUR 200 million from EU funds, which is earmarked in the Sixth Framework Research and Development Programme. I would like to highlight the fact that this is a new departure in institutional terms, as this will be the first time Article 169 of the Treaty has actually been used. Setting up the programme of clinical trials, the EDCTP programme, is an example of putting the European Research Area into practice. This will provide real added value for Europe and for developing countries, and I would like to illustrate a few aspects of this.</p>
<p class="contents">This programme will enable us to integrate national and Community efforts by networking and pooling activities which up to now have been disparate and uncoordinated. The platform to be created should make it possible to transfer research results more rapidly so as to assist clinical development in developing countries, and I wish to emphasise that this will involve those countries' full participation. It will enhance the impact of public investment by means of a more coherent and targeted approach. It will enable us to assemble a critical mass of expertise and resources needed to carry out large-scale clinical trials by optimising the use of European research results, particularly those of public research. It will increase clinical development capacity in developing countries in terms of infrastructure and training.</p>
<p class="contents">The EDCTP represents a new approach which will bring industry and the public sector together in risk sharing and developing new kinds of partnership which are urgently needed to combat the disastrous effects of these diseases. Industry has a key role to play in all the activities under the EDCTP programme. The programme will finance research and development products for which industry can not expect any return on its investment. Public financing will make research more attractive to industry, without taking industry's place. The creation of new solid and effective public/private partnerships is a vital condition for the success of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in the history of European research, we are in a position to adopt an ambitious programme which brings together the Member States' research activities and establishes a genuine partnership between Europe and Africa for clinical trials, a partnership which I hope will receive your support and thus get under way as quickly as possible. Let us seize this opportunity today and provide ourselves with the means to take full advantage of this first opportunity. We will earn the gratitude of researchers in Africa and Europe, and above all the peoples of sub-Saharan Africa, on whom these terrible diseases are taking a heavy toll.</p>

Over 40 million people are now carrying the HIV virus, 36 million of them in developing countries and 28 million in sub-Saharan Africa alone. Malaria, a disease that reappeared in the 1970s, kills around one million people a year. Lastly, there are now 8 million cases of tuberculosis, with 2 million deaths a year, 1.9 million of those in countries of the South. These three terrible diseases, which are incidentally by no means the only ones to be decimating the populations of poor countries, militate against the development of the countries affected and keep them in a state of poverty which, in turn, prevents them from setting up a health system worthy of the name. Humanity must break this vicious and fatal circle if it wishes to survive.</p>
<p class="contents">It was with these appalling facts in mind – and in their hearts – that the Commission, Commissioner Busquin, the European Parliament and the Council agreed upon and drew up a programme of EUR 600 million under the Sixth Framework Programme on Research and Development, for which I was appointed general rapporteur. This involves putting in place a new instrument under Article 169 – and this is a first, as the Commissioner has reminded us – with the financial participation of several Member States, Norway, the Commission, and, we hope, the private sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted, and proud, to have been appointed rapporteur and I wish to sincerely thank my colleagues in my new group for entrusting me with this new task, and also to thank all the other Members who gave me their help, not to mention the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, and my assistant.</p>
<p class="contents">From the outset, we worked collectively and diligently. This House, which received the proposal from the Commission on 28 August 2002, acted swiftly and the ITRE Committee discussed it on three occasions, on 7 October, 11 November and 2 December 2002, before voting on this report and its amendments on 23 January 2003, that is to say within six months, taking into account the opinions of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, represented by Mrs Sandbæk, in accordance with the enhanced Hughes procedure, of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, represented by Mrs Evans, and of the Committee on Budgets, represented by Mr Hudghton. Following those votes, a trialogue meeting was held with the Commission and the Greek Presidency in Strasbourg on 11 February.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore worked quickly, stressing the importance of a North-South partnership and focussing our action on clinical trials and on the reception structures that needed to be built up in the countries of the South, and in particular in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. It was important to avoid over-extending the scope of the programme and the consequent risk of lessening its impact. We need to heed the first victims of these terrible diseases and the people who are helping them to fight them. We need to develop new products adapted to the needs of the populations of these countries and to take them into account when we define priorities. Lastly, and above all, we need to act quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">At the trialogue meeting on 11 February 2003, we called on the Council to add a reference to other infectious diseases in a new recital. We called for provisions on easy access to these new products. We also called for the involvement of the NGOs and of the WHO, and, lastly, some Members called for more sustained appeals to be made to the private sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I immediately went on to thank and recognise the role of the Greek Presidency, the Council and the Commission, and my fellow Members were satisfied with the extent to which our requests were taken on board by the Council. We accordingly drafted compromise amendments, which of course involved everyone making certain concessions, so as to come to an overall agreement at first reading. I therefore invite you to support those amendments today, even though I recognise that some points are unsatisfactory, and I have certain reservations myself. But we need to make decisions quickly if we are going to act quickly. Every day that passes thousands of men, women and children die of these diseases. Yes, we need to act quickly and to do everything to make this programme a success, so that it can serve as an example and open up the way to other programmes of the same type for other diseases also associated with poverty. Those diseases may be less well known and perhaps of less interest to the media, but they are just as terrible and just as destructive of lives and consequently of societies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It sets up a new fund for a new project, but it is designed to be tied together with the existing work which is already going on in the participating Member States and Norway as regards research into these diseases. The statistics are quite horrifying – 90% of the world's HIV virus carriers live in developing countries and 95% of TB sufferers are in developing countries. So clearly, a significant amount of work is required to be done to tackle these problems. The Committee on Budgets – without dissent – approved the proposed EUR 200 million contribution from the EU which, of course, is in addition to the EUR 60 million which the EU has pledged to the global health fund. The global health fund, of course, is not available for research.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that any new work – or the consolidation and coordination of existing work – in the field of research into these diseases must be focused upon the needs and conditions existing in developing countries. That is the idea behind the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad to see that Parliament, at various stages, has spelled out how this project could and should be managed and how the progress can and will – I hope – be reported. If we have to apply a total of EUR 600 million as this project envisages – EUR 200 million from the EU, EUR 200 million from existing Member State funds and, hopefully, EUR 200 million from other donors and industry – then it is important that it be spent wisely and successfully. I would hope that since a significant proportion of that is public funding – taxpayer's money – the ownership of new procedures can remain with the public sector and be made available cheaply to the people who really need it most. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, I want to say that this programme is very laudable and commendable. It is a highly-needed initiative which deserves a lot of attention and support. To enhance the impact of the European contribution, we must improve what is already being done, and this must entail more coordination and consultation. Material and non-material investment in the control of the major communicable diseases in poverty-ridden countries must be increased and, most importantly, new tools to prevent and combat the three diseases are needed here and now. Affordable, effective, accessible and safe vaccines, drugs and microbicides are urgently required to prevent or ameliorate malaria, HIV and tuberculosis.</p>
<p class="contents">It is imperative to ensure that the beneficiaries, the end-users of these new tools, are fully involved in their clinical evaluation and application. It is therefore heartening that the Commission's proposal for a European Developing Countries Clinical Trials programme (EDCTP) addresses the important issue of human capacity development in the societies most affected by the three diseases. It is, however, very disheartening that the Commission, after two years, has still not provided any substantial information about the Member States' common activity, the very activity which forms the basis for mobilising Article 169.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as I know, the European Economic Interest Group is currently a structure which lacks defined programmatic content. So here is my question: can the Commission provide me with any examples of how Member States have so far collaborated and jointly implemented activities within the EDCTP concept?

I very much welcome this initiative, which could be a real step forward in the battle against HIV/Aids, malaria and TB in the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been said, it is a rapidly growing problem, usually affecting the poorest and most vulnerable in society who have less access to health care and education – many of whom are women. In fact, they make up two thirds of the world's poor and bear the main burden of poverty. Therefore, the role of women as sufferers, main carers, educators and as active members of communities in the developing countries is key to finding the right solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at HIV/Aids, by the year 2000, 9 million women and 4.3 million children had died of Aids, and these figures are going up. In sub-Saharan Africa, 55% of HIV infected adults are women. Women face greater danger of HIV infection for biological and social reasons, because of lack of control of their sexual health and lack of access to preventative information.</p>
<p class="contents">So the focus of the opinion of the Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities Committee was on ensuring that drugs and treatment are affordable, that people in developing countries are central to the programmes and that the products developed and used in trials are suitable for local use. Simple practical matters such as how to store drugs safely and how to administer or take drugs are crucial. That is why grass-roots groups such as women's organisations must be fully involved in developing programmes and ensuring that training is given to health care providers in the use of products – whether in the home, the community or in institutions. Training, capacity-building and infrastructure must be developed to enable these clinical trials to be carried out effectively and to ensure the long-term success of this programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, the best aspect of this work is that the Commission’s proposal is an unprecedented innovation in that, although Article 169 is an excellent formulation, it is being applied in practice for the first time, and, by taking this line, we are creating a genuine, tangible partnership to address a real problem concerning the northern and southern hemispheres. This initiative is so astute that it should be repeated in both the research sector and other key areas of the Union’s foreign relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Since I agree with the position set out by the rapporteur, I will make three very brief remarks. Firstly, I think that it was a positive decision not to extend the programme to related diseases, not because they are less important, but because we should not disperse our resources and efforts. Moreover, the results can be used to improve the treatment of other diseases and can form the basis of new research activities, thereby contributing to resolving other health issues related to the problems experienced by developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, regarding Amendment No 13 – involvement of the private sector – I believe that it is particularly important to involve the private sector in the programme because this will enable additional funds to be leveraged, encouraging businesses to invest more in diseases which affect developing countries. In this connection, a debate on tax differentiation mechanisms could be an extremely interesting incentive.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point concerns the protection of intellectual property. Involvement of the pharmaceutical industry is essential for the success of the programme. We must have differentiated pricing for medicines sold in developing countries and, in my opinion, we need different labels as well to prevent fraud. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Corbey (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the health crisis in developing countries is unprecedented. Given the huge need for drugs, the lack of attention on the part of the pharmaceutical industry is astounding.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome the Commission’s initiative to set up a platform for clinical trials. It is an excellent idea to bring all the activities in the Member States and the developing countries together under one umbrella as far as possible. Individual research activities are useful, but not necessarily useful enough. Article 169 offers the perfect basis for joining forces; indeed, a united effort is exactly what the developing countries need – and also exactly what Europe itself needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe can make a difference in the world if it pulls together. Europe can address the health crisis and social distress. For this, public leadership is required, and today we see a glimmer of the public leadership that the EU should have.</p>
<p class="contents">I give Mr Caudron my sincere thanks for the energy with which he has handled this dossier. I support his approach and wish to raise once more the three concerns I have spoken about before now.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we have to see to it that industry is involved in this project. This is only possible if we set up a credible programme. As it is, industry is bringing out few new products. It is a good time to set up joint projects, therefore. There must be a reasonable return on investment for industry, but the emphasis must be on the public interest, the development of affordable drugs. We must not deceive ourselves that public research institutes can manage the task alone. For this reason, we must not invest in bureaucracy, but in cooperation with the private sector, too.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must focus on developing specific products. We all know that a great deal needs to be done in order to combat the health crisis, but it is not necessary to fund malaria nets out of this budget, useful though they are.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis are a good place to start. These three diseases claim the most victims and are spreading with devastating effect. There are, however, other diseases, such as sleeping sickness and river blindness, which have been neglected. We should be concerned about a disease like leprosy rearing its head again. New means are necessary to combat this old disease. I ask that the Commissioner and the Commission continue to give due attention to this, too.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Busquin, I welcome the fact that the health crisis is high on your political agenda, and I also thank you for the letter you recently sent to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. We support this clinical trials project wholeheartedly. Europe certainly needs a flagship: a model of cooperation which bears fruit. Making this fruit visible will enable this project to act as a stimulus for joining forces in other fields, too. Europe is not doing the world justice if it does not work together, and it is not doing itself justice if it does not derive any inspiration from the cooperation in the field of clinical trials. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis are poverty-related diseases which are rampant in the developing countries. It beggars belief that in some developing countries, for example, there is a shortage of teachers because half of the teaching workforce has AIDS. It is high time that the European Union pays special attention to this problem, and so I join the previous speakers in welcoming the Commission’s initiative to invoke Article 169 of the Treaty in order that the Sixth Framework Programme for Research can be used to develop new clinical interventions to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.</p>
<p class="contents">By establishing networks and coordinating national and regional research programmes, the EU can make a sizeable contribution towards a more efficient policy on research into the development of methods for combating the three above-mentioned diseases. Involving the developing countries themselves, through the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership, enables the work to be much more purposeful and means that the research is brought closer to the people concerned. I think that that last point, in particular, is extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">In his excellent report, the rapporteur also dotted a few more i’s and crossed a few more t’s. I welcome that, but I should like to make a couple of short comments. The research programmes should not just focus on the development of new drugs, but also on the question as to the simplest way to administer those drugs. How often does one hear the complaint that, although patients in remote areas of developing countries can find their way to a health centre, when they get the drugs home, they stop taking the medication as soon as they feel better. This results in the development of resistant forms of the disease, as has happened with malaria. This is clearly counter-productive.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point to which I should like to draw attention is the synergy with other European programmes. A large amount of money and high-quality research is required. The Commission’s proposal to set up the Erasmus Mundus programme will shortly be given the support of our Parliament. Students from all over the world will then be invited to come and study in Europe. I should like to ask that students from developing countries, in particular, be given a special chance to take part in this, because the developing countries need highly qualified researchers.</p>
<p class="contents">EUR 600 million has been allocated for the present proposal, and another 200 million should be coming from the private sector. By helping the researchers, industry, too, can and must make its own considerable contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It has also given rise to proposals and debates in the other committees, as we have seen in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, through the rapporteur for the committee’s opinion, Mrs Ulla Sandbaek, and her pertinent questions.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, as Mr Caudron said, we are at a very special moment, a crucial moment, in terms of the relationship between the developed world and the developing world, because our main concern is to promote a kind of humanitarian relationship, a relationship which has connections with the suffering of the developing world, and therefore the European Union’s main concern at the moment should be to stop the horrendous war taking place in Iraq which is obscene and brings shame on the West. It is a form of cooperation and, together with this request which the European Union should make, programmes such as the one we are discussing are examples of how much the old Europe, the European Union, can contribute to a world which is different from the one proposed in other places.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress the significance of the proposal being made, because it represents going to the very heart of the problem of these three great diseases which successive reports by the WTO have shown to be the most significant, causing death and suffering throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that the Horwitz circle, the circle of poverty and illness, cannot only be attacked on one front, and that, while it is true that it is necessary to increase the economic capacity of all countries in order to reduce diseases, it is also the case that we must deal with specific issues which will allow for research, facilitate access to medicines, achieve a different kind of cooperation and also call into question, sometimes, aspects such as intellectual property. Because those of us who are researchers, doctors and university professors know that the knowledge we have today is not just due to our own efforts, but is an inheritance from centuries of effort on the part of human intelligence aimed at improving the conditions of mankind and is not therefore the exclusive property of an industry, but is part of a common inheritance.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore important that programmes such as these serve to initiate new stages in support relationships, and because of this inheritance I believe we have an historic debt to Sub-Saharan Africa stemming from the earlier era of colonialism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His work has certainly fostered excellent cooperation between us and has facilitated the success of this excellent proposal. This is due to the courageous initiative taken by Commissioner Busquin, and involves allocating a total of EUR 600 million to large-scale research with the objective of combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis under the EDCTP programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of the importance of that objective and the means being implemented to achieve it, it is vital for us to stress that basic ethical standards need to be respected in relation to this research. We equally need to emphasise that the results of that research should be available for use in the general interest, and that we need to cooperate with developing countries and encourage scientific and technical development in those countries. The ethical principles in question are those set out in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and those defined in the World Medical Association’s Helsinki Declaration on ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects. The European and Developing countries Clinical Trials Partnership must apply the good clinical practice defined in Directive 2001/20/EC on the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The EDCTP programme should encourage the training of specialists and capacity building in developing countries, step up technology transfer to those countries and mobilise additional resources for the fight against these diseases. The Community will ensure that these strategic decisions and the implementation of programmes are in line with the objective of placing on the market products that are at the same time effective, accessible at the lowest possible price and easy to use, and adapted to the specific conditions prevailing in developing countries. These decisions should be based on the active participation of stakeholders from the developing countries, scientific experts from the North and the South, representatives of patient groups, and the NGOs and the WHO.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, our Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance hopes that the results obtained through this programme will be considered a public good, and will therefore not be subject to intellectual property rules such as those defined in the TRIPS agreements, so as to guarantee developing countries access to the treatments resulting from this research at the lowest possible price. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, governments in the developing countries cannot afford to pay the high prices for the medicines needed to combat the disease. Developing countries must be given the right to distribute these much-needed medicines to their own people under their own licensing terms.

The programme is also useful, for example, on account of the close correlation between the scourge of AIDS and the hunger problem. AIDS weakens the young adults, a group which traditionally determines the degree to which a people is able to withstand famine. In addition, existing efforts must not be replaced, but rather stepped up. I should like to ask that the Council and the Commission take pains to ensure that this programme provides a stimulus for Member States and research institutes.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, there are two aspects that are often neglected with regard to the combating of AIDS. In a proactive approach, marital fidelity and celibacy are essential elements to be stressed when giving information. Encouraging results can be seen in this regard in a number of African countries. I would therefore urge Commissioner Busquin to bring this to the notice of his colleague Mr Nielson once more.

The rapporteur has already cited the figures. Millions of people in developing countries are dying of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis every year. They are poverty diseases, as has also already been said.</p>
<p class="contents">These diseases account for a large proportion of serious illness, but up to now have had only a small research budget. The help that has been offered up to now has been predominantly therapeutic, and also in the form of information regarding causes and prevention options. What is special about the project that we are now discussing is that it has the potential to give an impetus to the development of new technologies and new safe, effective drugs for combating these diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">The research taking place in this field in the European Union is very fragmented, and very few networks have been established, which has resulted in organisational and economic obstacles to large-scale research and trials. It is right, therefore, that this proposal makes use of Article 169 of the Treaty, which indeed enables the participation of the European Union in joint research and development programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been said, this is a first, and in my view the experiment is definitely worth the while. I hope that it will constitute a good start to more intensive cooperation in many fields within the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">A very important criterion for our group was that the countries where these diseases are widespread be involved intensively in the setting up, and participate fully in the implementation, of the programme from the outset, and that a large number of the trials take place on site there. Another point important to our group was that the programme should make a contribution towards capacity-building in the developing countries and ensuring the availability of good, affordable drugs in those countries. In addition, we, too, value the involvement of the private sector.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I am of course proud that the Netherlands has managed to qualify to be allocated a seat of the executive office of the EDCTP. The Netherlands will devote maximum efforts to making this project a success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Gérard has worked quickly but he has not been sloppy or careless. We have been able to put across important points despite working quickly. This is innovation. This is a new use of Article 169 which will lead to considerable leverage, with EUR 200 million from the EU plus EUR 200 million from Member States and we hope for at least that much from industry.</p>
<p class="contents">In this area the market has failed, as it so often does, and there has been, until now, a certain lack of public leadership, with a particular bottleneck in the clinical trials aspect of finding new products.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard that it is the biggest killer, that 5 million people die a year, 95% of them in poor countries. Yesterday, we grieved publicly for the victims of the irresponsible and immoral war in Iraq by wearing black armbands. We should be wearing them every day for the victims of these killer diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, of course, a multi-pronged attack. This point has been made by other speakers. Other actions are needed but this particular action is research. It is for clinical trials which will lead to the development of new products, in particular a new vaccine for tuberculosis, much better diagnostic tools, and combined medicines for HIV/AIDS which are easier to take and have fewer side effects. That is what we want at the end. That will be the outcome of these clinical trials.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made the point that they must be targeted. Despite the complexity of the problem let us keep in mind the whole time what we want at the end. We must strengthen the clinical research capacities in developing countries. One of the tragedies of our planet is the waste of human intelligence and creativity in countries which have been politically discriminatory or else riven by poverty. We must encourage that intelligence and creativity by having infrastructure, training and everything else. Everything must be anchored in the developing countries with an understanding that, should we find these things, should we find a better vaccine for tuberculosis, better drugs for HIV/AIDS and better diagnostic tests, they will be available to those that need them. It would be the greatest obscenity to do this work, discover the products and then find that those who need them cannot use them. I am very pleased that has been emphasised and I thank Gérard Caudron very much for his work as well as, of course, Commissioner Busquin.</p>

We have promised the developing countries that we shall eradicate poverty there, something that will not be possible if we do not overcome diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malaria.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, now that it has been debated in Parliament, the proposal is better than it appears, for the Commission’s proposal gave far too much emphasis to the purely medical aspects. Like other speakers in the debate, I believe however that success depends crucially upon preventive work and efforts made <span class="italic">before</span> the disease has broken out.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of access and prices is of course incredibly important. What we must not forget is that treatment with what are known as retardant medicines is, however, an extremely complicated form of medication that also requires a functioning medical and health care system.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to put the same question that Mrs Sandbæk put to the Commission: has any work already been begun? What have the Member States done? What, in practical terms, has the Commission done? Noble intentions and fine words on paper are no longer enough. What, instead, is required without delay is practical action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These and other infectious diseases can be cured by the use of effective medicines. Through the research programme, the European Union is contributing financially to the fight against these diseases and we can hope that this will give people suffering from AIDS in the developing countries a chance of getting effective and affordable medicines for their terrible affliction.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets has given this report a unanimous welcome. We should, however, be clear that the provision of funding for the research programme will not in itself solve the problems. The misery of poverty, underdevelopment, the lack of education and political lack of interest encourage the spread of AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. This is where everyone in positions of responsibility must increase their commitment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only are tuberculosis, AIDS and malaria a cause of suffering for many, many people, they have also became real obstacles to the economic, social and cultural development of entire regions of our planet. Furthermore, they undermine the other initiatives we are taking to create a fairer world. It is therefore vital that the initiative we are considering today, which aims to combat these scourges of poverty by injecting considerable sums of money – over EUR 800 million – into the development of new drugs, should be approved at first reading and implemented as soon as possible, because the situation is urgent. The lives of 5 million people a year are at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">We have every right to be proud of this important initiative, because it is a model research programme to be jointly undertaken by the European Union, the Member States and associated countries, and we have the right to hope that it will inspire other actions so that similar attention is focussed on other diseases that are taking a heavy toll on the poorest people on our planet.</p>
<p class="contents">This initiative is, however, also a model for the new philosophy needed for North-South relations – relations which do not involve exploitation, domination or paternalistic aid, but rather relations based on partnerships with a view to promoting the technological independence and development of the countries concerned, and their active participation in the implementation and coordination of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">By the same token we should also be considering the price of patented drugs, and the development of public health services in developing countries. I of course have in mind GATS and TRIPS, where the concept of partnership has been swept aside in favour of ideas about intellectual property and liberalisation. I wish to plead once again for cooperation and the development of synergies within the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Busquin for having given us, through the Sixth Framework Programme, the resources to develop this programme, and I would also like to thank Mr Caudron once again for the quality of his work. I would also like to say that I believe that we are just at the beginning of a long haul. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is terrifying because it presents a tragic view of the health situation in countries where the three major scourges of this century which we are discussing are concentrated: AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis claim more than five million victims every year. AIDS is the most recent scourge with, however, 90% of cases found mainly in developing countries and 70% in Sub-Saharan Africa: there are more than 40 million infected people. Malaria reappeared in the 1970s and claims one million victims each year. Tuberculosis, which has been eradicated from western countries, kills two million people each year, perhaps also, as with malaria, owing to the so-called developed countries irresponsibly lowering their guard.</p>
<p class="contents">It is encouraging because of the figures on the new effort being made by all the Member States, which have appropriated EUR 600 million for research in addition to the 100 million stipulated by the Fifth Framework Programme. It is now important that this programme reaches the recipients directly, overcoming the usual problem of the extremely high cost of medicines, especially for countries which do not have the necessary budgets and which need considerable assistance. I would therefore reiterate a proposal which has already been put forward in order to cut these costs: the abolition of all royalties for medicines, making, if possible, not just the European Union pharmaceutical companies assume their responsibilities but those all over the world. In conclusion, it is important for our political activity not to be yet again an end in itself, restricted just to debate in this Chamber: for once, when the Member States and other countries, in conjunction, intend to take real action, let us give an example of pragmatism and responsibility. Certainly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights matters more than market rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria are diseases connected with poverty, and in fact, as has here been said, five million people a year die of them, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. It is a vicious circle. Poverty is a barrier to the development of a viable system of medical treatment, while at the same time the diseases prevent development and overcoming poverty. We need swift action, adequate resources and a comprehensive system of cooperation to break this vicious circle. A new kind of cooperation is needed. When would we get 300 000 people to attack disease in the poor countries? Instead of bullets we should be using medicine.</p>
<p class="contents">This project of ours is unparalleled in terms of its objectives and scope, and all the better for that. A lack of cooperation and a lack of clinical trial facilities and trained staff in the developing countries have been a barrier to investment up till now. We need to obtain a critical mass by combining expertise with resources. We also need a situation where no one makes money from medicines, which are literally a matter of life and death, destined for poor countries.</p>
<p class="contents">AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria betray the presence of a crisis in society, as they are responsible for the deaths of so many. My question to the Commission is this: could we in the Union develop teams responsible for social crisis management, for example groups of one hundred thousand people consisting of doctors, nurses, engineers and teachers? Might this not be what we in the European Union need to help others? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first ground for satisfaction is the fact that this report marks a return to research in sectors such as the pharmaceutical sector, where Europe does too little. In my opinion, the Sixth Framework Programme and the resources which have been made available under this programme bear witness to Europe’s desire to commit substantial resources to research in this sector, which not only has economic value but social and political value too. It is not by chance that holding patents and having the possibility to produce medicines and being able to influence their cost, particularly in developing countries, means being able, on the one hand, to press ahead with a development policy for us, and on the other, an aid policy for developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the Members have stressed how this research, which proposes to help combat diseases by increasing knowledge in order to produce new drugs and to improve existing ones, combines with other policies which we, as Europe, must press ahead with in the education and employment sectors, because education, employment and health are the only factors which can contribute to the achievement of democracy in those countries which see Europe as an increasingly firm point of reference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that this report is the result of his excellent work carried out as rapporteur on the Sixth Framework Programme for research and technological development, to which, moreover, I contributed as draftsman for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs at its initial stage.</p>
<p class="contents">The partnership which we are establishing by applying Article 169, is an innovation, apparently without precedent, and we therefore warmly welcome it: it is a genuine, tangible contribution to the fight against poverty diseases, a fight in which the European Union has shouldered its responsibilities by taking up its position on the front line, as the leading world donor. The allocated budget – EUR 600 million – is in addition to the series of initiatives implemented since Durban which aim to strengthen and make more effective the fight against these diseases which chiefly affect developing countries: I will mention only the Global Fund, set up at the Genoa G8 summit, and the European Community action programme.</p>
<p class="contents">This continuity is certainly a very positive signal, but we increasingly need to do more: five people die of AIDS in Africa every minute; in 2001 malaria and tuberculosis killed one million and two million victims respectively; in short, these three diseases are, in fact, holding back the development of the affected countries and are playing their part in keeping them in poverty. This is why it is necessary, or rather essential, to invest and concentrate all the efforts necessary to obtain a systematic response from the whole of the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">This coordinated cooperation between the Member States, the European Union and the private sector, which is using a new, coordinated approach for a long-term Community strategy in the fight against these three diseases, has the considerable merit of actively involving the developing countries themselves, enabling real improvements to be made. Therefore, in order for this involvement to be effective and efficient, it is essential that it takes place with the maximum transparency, so that the efforts and resources deployed are tangible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the rapporteur, Mr Caudron, said at the beginning of his speech, I believe that we are facing a challenge where time is of the essence. That is why the will of Parliament, the Council and the Commission to work together in an attempt to coordinate their efforts as swiftly as possible is, as I see it, key for the success of this action, which although it will not of course solve all the problems, will nevertheless make Europe's efforts in the field of research and development more effective. What sets this programme apart is that it involves the participation of partners from Africa, where the programme is to be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to your various contributions, I think that the compromise amendments that you will have to vote on shortly very much reflect the concerns and aspirations expressed by you individually. It is clear, as I have already said, that this project will not be able to solve every problem, but it is a step forward that should provide us with a model for other actions in the future. But first of all we need to put this programme into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason that I wish to say, on behalf of the Commission, that we are able to accept all 36 compromise amendments, which reflect the spirit of the Commission's original proposal whilst improving and enriching it. I would like to emphasise once again the quality of Parliament's work and of the support the Commission has received. We have not only had support, our proposal has also been strengthened and given a higher profile. I regard that higher profile as being very important, because this is a new departure for us. So it is now up to the Member States to demonstrate the same determination and will, which is always a problem when we try something new.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme itself marks a turning point. I would also like to mention, as some of you raised this point, that the programme forms part of the Commission's programme of action in a broader sense. In dealing with AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis we are of course entering the sphere of research, but development, trade and other areas are also involved here. So this is not an isolated initiative, we will be integrating the programme into the EU's overall strategy in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">By the same token, I would like to say that the joint programme, which is the stage we are embarking on now, is being set up on the basis of the programmes of each individual Member State. We already have a good deal of knowledge about those programmes, Mrs Sandbæk, and we therefore know that there is some duplication of effort. That is to be expected, but it demonstrates that we are not as efficient as we might be. So it is now up to us to put that right, in conjunction with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, we require a legal basis to apply Article 169 of the Treaty. The Commission will therefore have to wait for the tripartite agreement between the Commission, the Council and Parliament to be concluded before it can get the Member States to act without further delay to implement this joint programme. We will only make our financial contribution once the joint programme is under way.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, Mrs Sandbæk, let me reply to your specific question. Concrete actions are now under way, particularly in the area of anti-malarial drugs. Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain have already mounted operations with three clinical sites in Africa. A second very concrete example is that of the health school in Vienna, which trains African researchers in the methodology of clinical trials. So these are some examples of this type of activity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish by very warmly thanking the rapporteur, Mr Caudron, and his shadow rapporteurs, Mr Nisticò, Mr Piétrasanta, Mrs Corbey and Mrs Flesch, and all the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, including its chairman, Mr Westendorp y Cabeza. I also of course wish to thank the other committees for their contributions. I have in mind the Committee on Development and Cooperation and its draftsman, Mrs Sandbæk, and the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to comment on the extent to which cooperation between the successive presidencies, that is the Danish and Greek Presidencies, has contributed to progress towards an optimal solution acceptable to everyone. Mr Caudron has been in a very good position to observe this. I therefore wish to thank the Danish and Greek Presidencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we have all gained a sense of the scale of the tragedy that these diseases represent for developing countries, and particularly for Africa. We therefore hope that this experiment will yield a positive outcome and that it will open the way for similar initiatives on diseases that are neglected at present. That is by way of response to a number of questions. I believe that this first example will enable us to demonstrate that by virtue of initiatives carried out under Article 169, we now have an additional instrument that will allow us to carry out even more effective actions at European level. We should look at the possibilities which that prospect opens up.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, I wish to thank Parliament for its very effective and helpful contribution.</p>
