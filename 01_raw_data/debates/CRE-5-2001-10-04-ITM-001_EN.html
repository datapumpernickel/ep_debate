<p class="contents">This is a third reading and it is a conciliation procedure that we have been following for a long time. I would like to welcome the dialogue that has existed between the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament, which has been very helpful. Naturally, the result of a conciliation is never entirely good for all parties. It is usually fairly good, but with a few drawbacks.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that of the first amendments presented by the European Parliament at first reading, the other two institutions have accepted some important amendments. For example, taking into account in product safety not only the producers’ liability but also that of the distributors; clear information on the possible risks in the languages of the different States of the Union; faster exchange of information; greater cooperation between Member States to prevent dangerous products from reaching the market; and also, the withdrawal of products which are considered dangerous, even if they are already being marketed. Furthermore, although not in the form that our colleagues from the United Kingdom wanted, an amendment aimed at including the special nature of several charities in the United Kingdom was accepted. I believe that a major part of the European Parliament’s proposals were included.</p>
<p class="contents">However, not all of them were included, and at second reading we presented only seven amendments which intended to include what had not been accepted by the other institutions. These amendments referred to something very important for us: the inclusion of the services in a proposal on which the Commission is working, the results of which it is committed to producing in 2003. I believe this is a very important proposal for us, because safety of services should rank on the same level as the directive we are reviewing today.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to take account of the precautionary principle; this means that when there is a well-founded suspicion that a product is not safe, we should apply this principle of precaution which people talk so much about and which is seldom applied in reality. And the possibility that there is an external certificate which supplements the official certification. There is also an agreement on comitology which in this case is not what Parliament wanted either, but there is a proposal of continued and regular information to the European Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Some matters which caused us concern in the final proposal were also clearly accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to emphasise a matter proposed by the Commission itself at the beginning, which is the ban on exports to Third World countries of products which are not considered safe in Europe. This proposal was not accepted by Parliament by a few votes, and is naturally not included in the final document. I have to say, as rapporteur, that this is perhaps what concerns me most. I believe that we run a real risk that, as we are seeing daily, unscrupulous people export to Third World countries products that are not safe. This is an issue that is of enormous concern to me. We have the verbal undertaking of the European Commission that there will be very strict controls to ensure that this does not occur, but it would have been safer for it to be included in the proposal and for there to be no risk of exporting products which we Europeans consider dangerous to Third World countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, despite the rapporteur’s great regret that the express ban on the export of unsafe products to the Third World has not been included in the directive, I believe, as I said in the beginning, that it is not the best proposal for the Council and the Commission, perhaps it is not the best one for Parliament either, but it is the result of a conciliation procedure in which a very fruitful dialogue has indeed taken place between all the institutions and with which I am very satisfied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need uniform safety standards, not a range of different standards. The proposal before us is intended to create these uniform standards. In recent years, consumer confidence has been badly dented, firstly by various acts of fraud against consumers, and secondly by the very welcome research in this area. This has repeatedly revealed that some consumer goods on the market no longer complied with current safety criteria. It is therefore even more important and necessary that this report is before us today. Our thanks are due to the rapporteur, whose efforts have made this possible.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important that this general product safety directive should apply irrespective of the type of marketing undertaken, and that a decision is taken which reflects developments in the market place and therefore also includes distance marketing and electronic commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the issue of consumer safety, the task is not only to protect children and older persons as the weaker groups in our societies, which is always emphasised; safety standards must apply to everyone. It is therefore only right and proper that we should seek to ensure that goods which no longer meet our safety standards and have to be withdrawn from sale do not end up by circuitous routes in third countries where they could pose a risk to health.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that one of the most important points arising in this context is the involvement of the trade. Ensuring compliance with these current safety criteria cannot take place solely via the public authorities; the dealers themselves must play their part in ensuring that this relationship of trust between dealer and consumer is enhanced and improved in future. However, this will still require appropriate controls, and the directive is only as good as its regulation. Monitoring measures will therefore be very important. This network of regulatory bodies in the Member States is essential, and we hope that it will come into operation as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add one final point, namely the speed of response by the European Parliament and the European institutions to this type of emergency and the consumer protection which had become necessary in the wake of the BSE crisis, foot and mouth disease, and other types of consumer fraud. We have been discussing this issue for nearly a year now, and I think we should consider how we can respond to emergencies more quickly and introduce urgently-needed measures, and perhaps also how we can improve and, above all, speed up our internal processes and inter-institutional processes in this context.</p>

<p class="contents">For those of us who have to explain back home how this Parliament influences legislation, the timetable and content of the general product safety directive could be something of a model. Progress here has been relatively swift; the Commission proposal submitted 15 months ago has now gone through every stage, with all of the three parts which make up the triangle of forces involved now having made their own distinctive contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as regards Parliament, there is the rapporteur. Mrs González Álvarez has taken a consistent, thorough and dedicated line throughout the passage of this legislation through Parliament. She has known when to hold firm and when to make concessions. Those of us who have felt that occasionally we did not prevail when we should, owe it to her that the door is open for further and better changes after these initial steps.</p>
<p class="contents">Twenty-one of our thirty amendments have been accepted by the Council. I am particularly grateful, in respect of the UK, for the clarified exemption for charity shops and street markets from the obligation to provide information on origin, which would have been beyond them. This was not a Community-wide problem, but in countries like the Irish Republic and Britain it mattered very greatly, and much good has been done by the clarification provided.</p>
<p class="contents">We have the clear recognition now of the precautionary principle itself. There was an uncommon delay before the other institutions were prepared even to write this into the preambles, but they have done so and it is now one of the markers which will guide us as we look at how product safety legislation develops. We were not as successful as I would have wanted on withdrawal and recall, and we shall return to that and other matters later. It is important that we should be required to consider the safety of services and to examine proposals to this end in reasonably quick time. In this we were simply holding the Commission to a principle which it supported in theory, but must now deliver in practice by 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we shall have to look hard at the failure to ban the export of unsafe products to the rest of the world, as the rapporteur has said, and the nature of the safety indications which imported products have to carry. One has only to look at the CE mark to see the imperfections there. This was one step forward, but an important one. I congratulate the rapporteur. She has certainly earned our quality mark in these debates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs González Álvarez, who has done an excellent job.</p>
<p class="contents">The report before us makes for a significant improvement on current legislation governing the safety of products. Of the points agreed, I particularly welcome the fact that stronger action can now be taken at Community level under the rapid alert system where there is a serious risk to consumers, so that dangerous products can be taken off the market. It is important that we have adequate and independent certification to comply with the relevant product safety criteria and clear labelling for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the Commission will be reporting regularly to Parliament is significant, as is the reference to the precautionary principle and the duty of the relevant authorities in Member States to interpret this in relation to all products. My Group believes that all consumers, both within and outside the European Union, should be treated equally. As the rapporteur has stressed several times during discussions on this directive, safety should be assured for all consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also glad that agreement has been reached on antique and charity shops and car boot sales, as by their nature they cannot provide information about second-hand goods but do provide a very valuable service. Overall, we need a good balance between ensuring that products put on the market are safe and seeing to it that the measures proposed to that end can be implemented in practice. This report partially achieves that and the consumer organisations which have welcomed earlier drafts of this directive will welcome this one, too. Our top priority is to ensure that consumers are protected and that they have the right to know which products are dangerous and what is being done about them. This report makes significant improvements to existing legislation and hopefully will have the support of Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This creates great advantages, but also disadvantages, for the consumer. Although there are numerous institutions in the EU Member States which are responsible for quality assurance and consumer product regulation, product recall is unfortunately becoming far more common. The purpose of this report is to enforce the precautionary principle in respect of any product placed on the market, and identify suitable approaches.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself am a producer of consumer goods and so I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur for her proposed solutions, for the task is to protect producers as well as consumers. One option is to harmonise the regulations governing the authorities responsible for product safety. The network of information which will be required in this context will be broad. It is therefore appropriate to expand the existing directive first of all and revise it after a thorough appraisal of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The market cannot be regulated. This is why preventive safety and health measures are especially important. The report contains numerous references to the fact that in the Member States, operators' and producers' rights take precedence over the rights of consumers. The purpose of the report is to change this situation. I fully support this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Due to the wide range of products available and the resulting risks to consumer safety and health, a new legislative approach is required. The report makes no secret of this fact. It also makes it clear that an export ban must be adopted for dangerous products. This issue has yet to be considered in detail, and in my view, the proposed period until 2003 is not too long for this process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is surely one of the issues which European and, I might say, world public opinion cares about most, as well as being one of the most important for Europe’s identity. There are arguments on which Europe has intervened effectively but which do not receive the general support of public opinion and the citizens. There are other, more specific and sector-based topics, on the other hand, which have received approval. This, however, is a general topic which has received the general support of the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">On reading the documentation relating to this procedure as a whole, on how it developed and how it is concluded today, I find a vagueness in many chapters and recitals, as well as in many expressions that are or will be binding on this subject. It is a vagueness that is quite common in acts of the European Parliament, the Commission or the Council, but which, in this case, could perhaps have been more fully corrected.</p>
<p class="contents">My concern is not the delay in reaching the position that is emerging today in the report, but rather that more specific detail should be given regarding interventions, the form these take, controls and the procedures by which they are enforced, and the flexibility and dignity of the controls – in other words they should not be humiliating for the producer or the consumer. I think that, in this sense, we could have been more specific and, at the same time, more respectful of the rights of producers and distributors, but always, of course, in the consumer’s interest.</p>
<p class="contents">For instance, I find that expressions such as ‘dangerous’ and ‘serious risk’ are insufficient; they could certainly be used in a standard or a regulation – at national or other levels – but, as these arguments are so delicate and liable to affect the daily lives of consumers and thus of society and the community, we could, perhaps, have been more explicit.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the future, bearing in mind what I have said regarding controls, I think that the three-yearly report required of the Commission should be drawn up at shorter intervals, without waiting three years, so as to prevent situations from arising over the three years that need to be remedied with specific provisions. That is why I believe that this point may warrant further consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This directive recasts an existing directive of 1992, which has now been updated, reinforced and completed. The overall aim of this directive is to impose a general obligation to market only safe products and to ensure both a consistent and a high level of protection of consumer health and safety throughout the EC and the proper functioning of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Improvements in consumer health and safety represent one of the political priorities announced by this Commission. The directive before you today is framed within the actions intended to achieve this objective. Before us lies now the important task to ensure that the new provisions have full effect in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me again express my appreciation for your support and confidence in ensuring the rapid adoption of this important directive. I hope it will be seen in coming years as a keystone of our efforts to ensure the safety of the European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
