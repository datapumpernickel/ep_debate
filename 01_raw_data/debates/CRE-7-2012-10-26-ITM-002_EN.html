<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Štefan Füle, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold">− </span>Madam President, honourable Members, Belarus held parliamentary elections on 23 September. It will not come as a surprise to this House to hear me state my disappointment at the way they were conducted. The day after the election, the High Representative and Vice-President Ashton and I issued a joint statement expressing the European Union’s regret that Belarus had missed yet another opportunity to hold elections in line with international standards.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore share the assessment of this House, expressed both in the statement by President Schultz, Chairman Brok and other Members of the European Parliament, regretting the undemocratic nature of the parliamentary elections. This assessment is also reflected in last week’s Council’s conclusions and, I expect, will also be mirrored in your resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the assessment of the OSCE Election Observation Mission: ‘many OSCE commitments were not respected, despite some improvements to the electoral law’. It also notes that ‘while there was an increase in the number of candidates put forward by parties, prominent political figures who might have played a role in this context remained imprisoned or were not eligible to register due to their [so-called] criminal record’ – ‘so-called’ was my addition.</p>
<p class="contents">Our assessment of internal developments in Belarus remains pessimistic; things are not getting better, and the grip on civil society is being tightened. There is no sign of willingness by the Belarusian authorities to address our core concerns: respect for human rights, the rule of law and democratic principles. Last week the Council adopted conclusions and decisions regarding the review of restrictive measures: the so-called rollover of the existing sanctions. Both express our concern about the internal situation in Belarus as well as the state of play of the European Union’s bilateral relations with the country. The outcome of the Foreign Affairs Council also confirms the continuity of our established and consensus-based policy, namely the will to continue our policy of critical engagement and call for the immediate release and rehabilitation of all political prisoners and the discontinuation of restrictive measures, while at the same time reaching out to Belarusian society.</p>
<p class="contents">In the current situation, where there are few signs of progress from Minsk, we can, however, look at how to invest in the future and, at the same time, how to keep technical and diplomatic communication channels between the European Union and Belarus open. We have an interest in keeping a working relationship with Minsk. Technical dialogues and cooperation continue with the Belarusian administration, and we are keeping the country engaged within the multilateral track of the Eastern Partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">The main drive behind our policy is our commitment to strengthening engagement with the Belarusian people and civil society. It remains an essential aspect of investing in the future of Belarus. We must continue our engagement with Belarusian society as a whole, promoting people-to-people contacts. We are not trying to isolate the Belarusian people. It is particularly regrettable that the authorities are not taking up our offer to negotiate visa facilitation and readmission agreements between the European Union and Belarus. However, the Member States are striving to make optimal use of the flexibilities offered by the visa code to waive and reduce visa fees for some categories of Belarusian citizens or in individual cases.</p>
<p class="contents">The European message should be brought to as many ordinary Belarusians as possible, including through our assistance projects. This is a priority. The European dialogue on modernisation with Belarusian society is an important part of this engagement and an essential aspect of our policy, providing a rare positive element in this overall sombre picture. The participation of the Belarusian authorities in the dialogue is an issue. It is needed because their absence raises questions about the viability of the dialogue. From our side, we continue to stress to the administration that we would welcome their constructive participation at technical level.</p>
<p class="contents">Our financial assistance to civil society has increased five-fold since the 2010 post-electoral crackdown and clearly this cooperation still has great potential. Let me also inform you that we are currently looking at how to further rebalance and better target our aid for civil society.</p>

We are not concerned about who governs Belarus. There are many shades of opinion in this House, and views as to which party would represent the best solution for Belarus vary. What we really want is for that country to be governed by people elected by the citizens of Belarus in free and fair elections. These are not just empty words. We are firmly convinced of the universal nature of fundamental rights and that they stem from the inalienable dignity of each human being. We are deemed to be behaving like bandits simply because we wish the people of Belarus to be able to benefit from the same rights and freedoms that the majority of other Europeans enjoy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is no surprise that the parliamentary elections of 23 September failed once again to meet international standards. Let us be frank: nothing will change as long as Mr Lukashenko rules Belarus with an iron fist. Elections without fair competition are not elections. They are no more than a farce. They have resulted in a parliament in which, literally, there is not a single opposition member to be found any more.</p>
<p class="contents">There is sometimes a tendency to resign ourselves to the isolation of Belarus but such apathy would be totally wrong. We should not lose faith in change and we must continue to work for the liberalisation of Belarus. I am pleased that Commissioner Füle demonstrated this morning that he is of the same opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Sanctions are only partially effective. The pressure really needs to come from below. The Belarusians themselves have to want a different kind of government, a different life. There are democratic movements in Belarus. They need to grow and for that they really need our support. That is why I call on Commissioner Füle to continue to work on strengthening civil society in Belarus as part of the new Neighbourhood Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to put pressure on the Belarusian regime to simplify visa requirements for its citizens and make visas affordable. This would enable us to have more exchanges. A Commission proposal is on the table but Minsk refuses to sign it.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, the Belarusian economy is also going downhill rapidly and the gap between it and the European Union is getting wider all the time. The country had good reason to join the customs union with Russia and Kazakhstan. It depends on investment and loans from Russia, and increasingly also from China. These countries do not ask any questions about the human rights situation in Belarus. We must not stop doing that and, above all, we must not stop supporting the Belarusians themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, you will be aware that I value you and your work. Good work has been done, too, on this resolution under the leadership of Mr Rouček, and I am grateful for that. Unfortunately, I have to give the House the sad news that although, on the one hand, we are taking positive steps, as is the case today, on the other, my country is helping to make the situation worse for the people of Belarus. </p>
<p class="contents">It was revealed some 10 days ago that the Polish Foreign Ministry had issued 30 tax return forms to members of the opposition in Belarus, demanding payments related to maintenance allowances paid to them by Poland. This enabled the Belarusian authorities to identify the opposition members concerned. Only the day before yesterday, in fact, all of the grants awarded to the opposition in Belarus by Poland were published on the Foreign Ministry’s website. As if that were not enough, pressure was put on the press to refrain from publishing information on this scandal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to offer a heartfelt apology to all Belarusians, and assure them that Europeans and the rest of us Poles do not think in the same way as certain civil servants in the Foreign Ministry. I consider such behaviour to be outrageous, and wish to offer an apology, and draw it to the attention of the President, the Commissioner and the House. First and foremost, however, I would like to apologise to all Belarusians for the action taken by the Polish side. This is inappropriate for Polish policy and inappropriate for European policy. We should all be supporting the Belarusians, not informing on them and reporting them to the Belarusian authorities.</p>

I shall not respond in kind, however, but will instead focus on the case in hand. I do indeed believe that this House is an appropriate place in which to comment on how Member States are honouring their commitments. I believe that what has taken place in Poland is disgraceful and intolerable and will bring shame upon us. I also believe that my comments in this House are not detrimental to Poland or the people of Belarus.

Otherwise, everything is following an all-too-familiar pattern: the election observers deliver their detailed verdict on the obviously-not-free-and-fair nature of the elections, we adopt our motion for a resolution and the Council imposes a few more sanctions or extends the existing ones. Beyond the Bug, the new parliament remains without an opposition and, therefore, exempt from criticism and correction, while those who want to see a different Belarus are still excluded, persecuted or locked up. The daily lives of Belarusians are still governed by the arbitrariness of politics and the greed of oligarchs. </p>
<p class="contents">In the description and assessment of this development, there is barely anything to choose between the political groups of this House. I also believe that nobody expected any other result or any changes to take place in Belarus. However, if that is true, then I must, at this point, reiterate the doubts I have already expressed on repeated occasions. Sanctions appear to be ineffective as a tool. They have not previously had any serious impact, either in Belarus or elsewhere. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Füle has spoken again on the EU’s current activities as regards Belarus. We consider much of that to be worthwhile, such as the direct engagement with civil society under the European dialogue on modernisation. The problem with these activities, however, is that they fail to address Belarusians in their specific circumstances as consumers and workers. People want to discuss the job market, not industrial relations, co-determination rights or compliance with International Labour Organisation or environmental standards and so on. However, if these sessions are not used to tackle the issues of social justice faced on both sides of the Bug, then the foundations of the autocratic system undeniably still in place in Belarus will barely shake. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude with the following point: when we lived in a divided Europe, it was extremely important that, in spite of all the criticism levelled at those in power, a line of communication was kept open. Historically, we have shifted from sanctions to dialogue. It seems to me that, at present, we are moving in the opposite direction. In view of the obvious ineffectiveness of this policy, the question is: what do we do when we have exhausted all the options, when we have tightened the last thumbscrew? It is better to begin to confront the political leaders of Belarus with our arguments and demands in the context of political dialogue. That requires the EU Member States to cast aside their contradictory policy. The use of sanctions against repressive states does nothing to alter the repressive system of the State in question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Laughable was the damning verdict of Belarusian political analyst and author Valery Karbalevich. At numerous half-empty polling stations throughout the day of the elections on 23 September, independent observers and voters witnessed a crushing blow being dealt to Lukashenko’s regime. The repressive government in Minsk reaped what it had sown. If you systematically rig elections, you need not be surprised if civil society reacts accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Karbalevich rightly concludes that distrust of the Lukashenko regime has come out into the open with these elections.

The power pyramid there is monumentally stable. Once again, we have seen elections without choice, recognised by the OSCE and other international organisations as undemocratic and unfair. However, I agree entirely with Commissioner Füle that even in this situation we need to continue a critical dialogue with Minsk and not isolate the people of Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">The electronic archives show that over 18 years as many as 116 European Parliament resolutions on Belarus have been adopted, mostly in response to specific events in the country. I believe that it is time to prepare a more wide-ranging report that would try at Parliament level to propose ways of breaking the deadlock in EU-Belarus relations and modernising Belarus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I respect the policies which he is proposing and consider them prudent. The observers who were present during the elections on 23 September found that the ballot was not conducted impartially, and claimed that many civil rights, such as the right of assembly, right of association and freedom of expression, were not respected by the authorities; irregularities were also noted in the counting of votes.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the assessments give no indication of imminent change in the internal political situation in Belarus – a situation which has remained unchanged since 1994. The expulsion of the Swedish ambassador is a case in point. It is now clearly evident that Russia’s plan for the Eurasian Union is fully under way. Within the scope of the Neighbourhood Policy, amongst other things, the Union should redouble its efforts to encourage respect for human rights, freedom of expression and democratic principles in the country – though this should, of course, always be done with great care. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The next one could be one sentence long: ‘We reiterate the findings and positions stated in our previous resolutions’. It looks as if the President of Belarus has invented a time machine. This is the only reasonable explanation for why and how a country in Europe can freeze itself in today’s dynamic and interconnected world. There are very clear indicators which can measure whether elections are free and fair. They apply to every country in the world, and Belarus cannot be an exception. There, no elections have been recognised as free and fair since 1995: in other words, the legitimacy of all elected representatives is insufficient. If we talk to them we do not talk to the Belarusian people: it is as simple as that.</p>
<p class="contents">So what can we do? Stay and wait? Engage and support? Punish and sanction? Everything has been tried so far, with ups and downs, but the final result is zero. The option is to invent something completely new, which would shake the people in Belarus and wake up a critical mass – not very realistic. Another is to follow an enhanced version of the current long-term strategy: a roadmap to democracy. Its course should be to gradually raise the awareness of the Belarusian people and Belarusian society, because change can be supported in Brussels but it should be prepared and should happen in Minsk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In view of the critical situation, the EU has rightly suspended the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement concluded with Belarus.

We must bear in mind, however, that Belarus is still our partner within the framework of the Eastern Partnership. All of our efforts should be focused on Belarusian society, especially on those sections of it that can have some kind of contact with the outside world. I am thinking of students, people working in companies and those engaged in economic activities. As regards private entrepreneurs, I think that we should focus on people working as independent journalists, on those who represent the future of Belarus. I believe that is an area where many institutions and countries could make an effective contribution to shaping a new civil society in Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">Such action is vital to ensure that Belarusian society is adequately prepared when the conditions are right for change. I feel that some of the instruments we are developing in this House and in the European Union could prove helpful in this regard. I should like to express my satisfaction with the efforts of the European Commission, particularly as regards the European dialogue on modernisation. I believe that many of the assessments made here are correct. Accordingly, I should like to call for instruments that could help to create something that would serve as a sound foundation for further development of the relationship between the European Union and Belarus, to be put in place at the earliest opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following on from what Ms Jaakonsaari said, I would like to refer to a project that has been running in my home province of Lower Austria since 1989 between the city of Baranovichi in Belarus and the municipality of Stockerau. It is a twinning arrangement under which people in Baranovichi are able to make contact with Austrians, an exchange takes place via school projects and children from the city are able to travel to Stockerau and experience a different environment. </p>
<p class="contents">It also encourages us in Stockerau to discuss the situation in Belarus. With personal contact comes a far greater personal interest in how the people we have got to know actually live. The towns and cities partnered with Stockerau were invited to participate in the municipality’s 1 000th anniversary celebrations. They laid on a real feast for us and a really close connection has developed. Examples of this kind of human political action help ensure that democracy can be felt in countries whose democratic standards lag far behind our own. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is difficult for us to get close to the public in this country. With this type of gesture we would get close to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank Commissioner Füle for his sensitivity when delicate political problems are considered in these countries with which we must have contact, above all contact with the people and the public in these countries.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These elections represented a rubber-stamping exercise to support a foregone conclusion. The Lukashenko regime, now in its 19th year, has been ruthless in its persecution of political opponents and gagging of the press as part of a desperate attempt to cling on to power by whatever means.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, one man’s hubris has come at the expense of the hopes and dreams of a generation of Belarusian people, denied the opportunity to determine their own future in an atmosphere of fairness, transparency and freedom from fear, including fear of the KGB. Our only hope must be that the citizens of Belarus will eventually be granted the chance to vote for their own leaders, and live the lives that they choose. We in the European Union and in this Parliament should afford them every assistance to achieving that noble goal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would be grateful if you could allow me the minute and a half allotted to my political group. </p>
<p class="contents">Once again, we have witnessed a parliamentary election in Belarus that was no such thing. What was new, however, was President Lukashenko’s cynical recommendation that Europe could learn a thing or two from this electoral manipulation. Fortunately, the days of such hubris are numbered, even if this dictator has followed the example of North Korea and already marked his youngest son out as his successor to the throne. Events in Moscow leave me questioning, however, whether Mr Lukashenko really is Europe’s last dictator. </p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, 10 seats in the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly remain empty, as we cannot tolerate the presence among us of representatives of a parliament that has no legitimacy. The Foreign Ministers have extended the sanctions against the regime, which is the right thing to do. We must be careful, however, that these measures are not undermined. There are around a dozen known agents who acquire foreign currency via private and bogus firms and organise exports and foreign investment, the proceeds of which end up in the dictator’s pockets. Instead of an entry ban for the regime’s supporters, we should adopt arrangements facilitating visas and travel for the Belarusian people. </p>
<p class="contents">The appeal and attraction of a Nobel-Peace-Prize-winning European Union will not be lost on Belarus. However, we should avoid giving Mr Lukashenko’s truncheon-wielding lackeys the opportunity to practise dispersing mass demonstrations, as we succeeded in doing in Germany. The ‘soft power’ we can exert should also include targeted economic sanctions – which means, for a start, that Lufthansa must cease its maintenance of President Lukashenko’s government jet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I said, I fully share the concerns expressed by Members regarding the political situation in Belarus. Let me reassure you that, together with High Representative and Vice-President Ashton – and I am very glad that this is actually the first occasion for her new managing director, Felipe Fernández de la Peña, who is also dealing with Belarus, to participate in this debate – we will continue to encourage the Belarusian authorities to take steps to fully implement Belarus’s international commitments to democratic principles and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that, under these circumstances, we have every interest in seeking to increase the impact of our policies on Belarus. We will continue to call for the unconditional release and rehabilitation of all political prisoners and insist that the development of bilateral relations between the European Union and Belarus remains conditional on progress in the field of human rights, the rule of law and democratic principles. I share your opinion that the forthcoming world ice hockey championship is an opportunity not to be missed for us to make our policy more visible and clear and to have an impact.</p>
<p class="contents">Our policy of critical engagement with Belarus is a long-term challenge. The European Union’s policies are principled and have the clear goal of including Belarus in the family of democratic and open nations. However, we know that, for political and economic reasons, bigger changes in this country are likely to take time. We discuss our policy of critical engagement towards Belarus regularly and, as you can see, our policies and messages stay calibrated and balanced.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much for the views you have expressed during the debate and for the draft resolution. There have been a number of critical remarks but, in addition to the critical remarks, some concrete suggestions on which we will reflect. In a situation like this, the principled position has to be combined with creative thinking, reaching out to those who would sooner or later deliver on the change.</p>
<p class="contents">I also very much appreciate your call in the draft resolution to strengthen the dialogue for modernisation. I believe that, with even greater involvement of the Member States and with your support, we can turn this dialogue into an effective instrument for change.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add a personal remark. Time is not on the side of political prisoners, but I firmly believe that time is on the side of democratic change. Change will come sooner or later. It is inevitable and it is a strong European lesson to a European country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
