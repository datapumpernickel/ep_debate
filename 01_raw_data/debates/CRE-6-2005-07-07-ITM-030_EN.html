These people were amongst thousands who were detained in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, during and after the demonstrations that began on 6 June and that lasted several days.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirty-six people were killed in these disturbances. Although some 4 000 people have now been released, several thousand remain in prison or in unofficial police detention centres. In view of this situation, the European Union must remain resolute and demand that the investigation of these events continue without obstruction by any of the parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it seems clear that the opposition has neither the intention nor the means to carry out a violent uprising which could ultimately compromise the election victory which it claims to have won. Nevertheless, we cannot claim victory on behalf of the government which, according to the various recounts, appears to have lost the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must therefore send a clear message to the government, warning it that it must cease all repressive and provocative attitudes, particularly towards members of the opposition, human rights activists and independent journalists, since that hostile attitude may lead the country into a situation of chaos that will benefit nobody.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Union must demand that the government fulfil its responsibility to guarantee the security of the citizens and of the new Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The answer is of course that, while our hearts go out to the victims and their families, we must <span class="italic">never</span> allow cowardly acts of terror to disrupt our democratic institutions and processes. To do otherwise would in fact give the cowardly terrorists the sick satisfaction and perverse pleasure they seek to achieve by perpetrating such monstrous crimes against humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">Ethiopia is, unfortunately, a country with a long history of poverty and famine. It is also a country with a long history of autocracy and state terror. During their fourteen years in power, the governments led by Prime Minister Meles Zenawi have continued to amass a shameful human rights record. Many critics of his government have been routinely subjected to harassment, imprisonment and torture. Last month, after the recent parliamentary elections in the country, opposition demonstrations in the capital Addis Ababa were met with brutal attacks by the Ethiopian police. The demonstrators, mainly university students, claimed, with good reason, that there had been widespread electoral fraud. The security forces fired indiscriminately on the unarmed demonstrators, killing at least 36 and injuring over 100. An estimated 5 000 people were arrested and thrown into military detention centres. Following international reaction, many have now been released, but a large number are still in detention.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few years, Ethiopia has received – and continues to receive – a considerable amount of development aid from the West, much of which is from the EU. Many argue – quite rightly – that we ought to reconsider how this aid to African countries is given, because it would appear that in some cases at least – and Ethiopia is an example – the granting of financial help may bring about the collateral danger of helping to establish a non-democratic regime the policies of which further lead to national poverty. I ask you to support this motion for a resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The elections afforded the opposition and all of Ethiopian society an unprecedented voice, which is to Prime Minister Meles Zenawi’s credit. The presence of international observers, of which our mission was the most significant in terms of numbers and professional commitment, was a key factor in instilling confidence among the electorate, who turned out in their droves and 90% voted. The delegation sent by Parliament felt the sustained applause of voters queuing up on 15 May and for this reason the EU’s electoral mission feels an enormous responsibility. It is crucial that the Ethiopian people have their expectations of true election results fulfilled and the mission will do all it can to ensure that this happens.</p>
<p class="contents">Nobody can know for sure what the election results will be because the process got into serious difficulty at the stage of counting the ballot papers. In addition to the delays in publishing the results, there were a large number of complaints from all parties, including the party in government. Concern among the population with regard to those delays and complaints was at the root of the tragic events of 6, 7 and 8 June, on which the mission immediately spoke out publicly. We called at the time for an independent inquiry and we continue to do so. Specifically, we call on the government to release those held in breach of constitutional guarantees and of human rights; we call for elected candidates and other opposition representatives, along with human rights campaigners, to be allowed the freedom to perform their duties; we call for media freedom and for opposition representatives to be allowed access to the media; we called then and call now on the opposition to hold back and discourage others from carrying out or calling for an insurgency, from calling for people to break constitutional law and from fomenting inter-ethnic conflict, which will ultimately only help those with a vested interest in ensuring that the results of the popular vote are never disclosed, those who, in turn, would stop at nothing to force the electoral process to be disrupted, leading to a spiral of violence and economic and political chaos; we call on both sides – government and opposition – to comply fully with the 10 June Agreement aimed at addressing complaints, which is backed by the main contributors, including the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point I wish to pay tribute to the representative of the Commission, who played – and continues to play – an outstanding role in Addis Ababa. Our mission has been restructured to meet requests from both sides that we should observe this process of looking into complaints and I shall therefore be back in Addis Ababa next week.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall finish, Mr President, by saying that the situation is very delicately and dangerously poised. The risk of civil war is not mere rhetoric. I have just heard the news that the main opposition announced this morning that it is pulling out of the complaint investigation process due to its representatives allegedly being obstructed. Accordingly, any demonstrations of interest in the Ethiopian process, however constructive or well-intentioned they may be, and this is clearly the case of this Parliament initiative, could be taken the wrong way, or could be used for nefarious purposes by those who have a vested interest in breaking up the democratisation process in Ethiopia.</p>
<p class="contents">My duties as head of the electoral observation mission have not finished. It is an independent mission, and the work is not yet done. I therefore ask Parliament to appreciate that I feel it is my duty not to take part in the vote on this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No attempts are made to hark back to the time of King John; instead, the resolution makes it quite evident that we are aware of the gravity of the situation in one of Africa’s poorest countries. Ethiopia was a founding member of the Organisation of African Unity, but the country is still troubled by the unstable situation in Somalia, as well as by conflicts with the medieval regime in Eritrea. One of its neighbours is Sudan, which has been trying for several decades now to resolve the internal conflicts in its north and south and the disastrous situation in Darfur. In the past, Ethiopia has suffered coups and been ravaged by drought and war in Uganda.</p>
<p class="contents">In a situation such as this, it is absolutely crucial to strengthen the faith of the Ethiopian people in democratic systems. I agree with Mrs Gomes, the leader of the election observation mission, in this respect, and it is only right that the resolution should also emphasise this point. That by itself is not enough, however; we must not tolerate the violation or circumvention of the laws of any country, especially when the country in question boasts a high electoral turnout, which is an indication of the public’s enormous interest. Support must be provided to enable a thorough investigation of all complaints. We must step up our efforts, however. A country such as Ethiopia, which is striving to improve its agricultural and industrial situation, needs our assistance. A number of countries have already provided such assistance in the past, and programmes of this kind should be given a major boost. Aid for Ethiopia must be clearly targeted at solving fundamental problems, instead of benefiting the government. It is just as important to send experts to the country to help train farmers, and if necessary to provide assistance in identifying and securing water sources, as to offer places to study at secondary schools and universities in the European Union. There is an old proverb that says; ‘give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish, and you feed him for life’. We should take this as our guiding principle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has become evident that there is a need, over and above purely humanitarian approaches, for a rigorous and well thought-out Africa policy to be developed. I have to say that I was shocked by what the Commissioner had to say on this point. Speaking as a Bavarian Member of this House, I have to say that, when I recollect that the Commissioner was, in his former incarnation as Belgium’s foreign minister, one of the prime movers behind the attempt to impose sanctions on Austria, that model European democracy, to hear him now give it as his opinion that it would be counter-productive and wrong to apply sanctions against Zimbabwe’s Mugabe, one of the most infamous dictators in the world, then I have to say that this application of double standards is something we simply cannot accept.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to make it abundantly clear that we, in Europe, can be credible only if we do not just potter around showering Africa with money, but instead, put together a political strategy and a perfectly clear concept of what human rights are.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree unreservedly that we cannot, of course, go around making ourselves out to be the ones who can teach the world. We have enough to do to put our own house in order, but, Commissioner, I do believe that it is necessary, as a matter of urgency, to impose sanctions on the dictators in Africa and exert pressure on them.</p>
<p class="contents">South Africa’s President Mbeki, who parades himself around the whole continent as a model democrat and peacemaker, is himself basically no more than a Mugabe in disguise, or else he would long ago have come out in opposition to the wrongdoing in Zimbabwe. That much is clear enough when you listen to what the representatives of the churches in South Africa have to say on the subject, and this is a cause we should take up.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this context that we have to consider the portents for Ethiopia, and beware. Ethiopia has already experienced enough catastrophes in the shape of dire famines, wars and civil wars, a dictatorship bearing the unmistakeable mark of Soviet-style communism, followed by another civil war and a war of secession, war among its neighbours and more of the same besides; it is now heading for a new one. We now see yet another dictatorship coming into being, and that in a country that has massive potential, a country that is one of the oldest independent states on earth, with an ancient people, predominantly Christian in culture, that until recently had never had to endure colonial hegemony, a country that had fought Fascism and European militarism, a country that was once the pride of Africa and the symbol of independent self-supporting development. We must not allow this country to disintegrate into clans in the same way as its neighbour Somalia, into multiple divisions along tribe and party lines, with most of the parties based on tribal allegiance.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we need to throw a massive amount of weight behind democracy and human rights in Ethiopia. It is not often that I find myself agreeing with Mr Kohlíček, but today I have to add my voice to his. We have to support decentralised projects in agriculture and in irrigation, thereby preventing it from being only those at the centre and the bureaucrats who benefit, but, on the contrary, enabling a new community to come into being, from the bottom up, on the strategically vital Horn of Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not represent London – or England – but I will say that we Scots stand foursquare beside our nearest neighbour, our friends, our colleagues and indeed our families in London and elsewhere. Tomorrow will be for questions and for reasons. Today is for decency and humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">In our interconnected world, an attack on the rights of the innocent in London, in Ethiopia, anywhere is an attack on the rights of us all. And in the light of today’s events, it makes it all the more imperative that those of us on the side of human rights and the rule of law speak with a clear, loud and forcible voice in the world. If we agree on nothing else, it must be that illegal violence against the innocent is never and can never be the answer.</p>
<p class="contents">On the widespread abuse of human rights in Ethiopia, I wholeheartedly endorse the earlier comments of my group colleague Mr Romeva i Rueda and would add that press freedoms must not be forgotten in this debate. The freedom of the press is pivotal to a free society and a free world. These freedoms are also being widely infringed in Ethiopia and I would add my condemnation to that of the House.</p>
<p class="contents">There is little debate within the House on the substance of the motion for a resolution before us, but events outwith this House make it all the more important that we protect these rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yes, you heard me correctly – I envy Ethiopia, but not for its government, as there is little cause to do so. I envy the Ethiopian people for their belief that so much depends on them. I do not believe there is a single European country that can boast an electoral turnout of almost 90%, as recorded in the elections held in Ethiopia on 15 May of this year. Such a high turnout merits our respect and our support, and a country that can achieve this deserves democracy. The only problem is that democracy comes at a very high price in Ethiopia. Thirty-six people were killed and several thousand imprisoned, although fortunately 4 000 of the latter have recently been released.</p>
<p class="contents">The word solidarity is one of enormous importance for the people of my country, Poland, and indeed it also holds great meaning for the European Union. This solidarity should be extended to Ethiopia too, and the country should not be condemned to oblivion, even if it is a long way from Strasbourg. We should not allow ourselves to forget Africa, and our thoughts should not only turn to it once a year, or whenever Bob Geldof organises concerts.</p>
<p class="contents">The non-attached Members fully back the motion for a resolution, because it amounts to nothing less than a political translation of Ernest Hemingway’s wise saying, ‘ask not for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like all of you, I followed very closely the development of the electoral process in Ethiopia. I followed it before the elections, and I have to say that the electoral campaign was a model of democracy, with access to the media for everyone. It was from the time that the elections started that there was a genuine problem. I was obviously a witness to the serious incidents that occurred on 7 and 8 June 2005. I intervened personally. Mr Solana intervened. You should know that I was in contact almost every two days with Prime Minister Meles to inform him of the EU’s concerns about the progress of the elections and, more specifically, about the human rights violations that were committed during those incidents.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the messages that the European Union and others have sent, and continue to send, to the authorities have some effect, as shown by the government decision to release approximately 3 800 people arrested without charge following the demonstrations. We have had many telephone contacts and, on each occasion, Mr Meles has responded to our request. I spoke with him and President Barroso three days ago in Libya. There are apparently still 600 to 700 detainees, many of them held in secret. Prime Minister Meles told me that he was trying to speed up settlement of these issues and that the majority of these detainees would probably be freed if they were being held for no reason. The Ethiopian authorities have to respect not only their laws but also international human rights standards. We have asked for the International Committee of the Red Cross to be allowed to visit those who are still prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the events of 7 and 8 June, it would be desirable if the Government were to authorise an independent inquiry in order fully to establish the facts and the charges. Prime Minister Meles told me that he was in a position to respond to this request and that he was going to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the electoral process, I am very pleased about the progress made after the serious risk of matters going off course, just as I am very pleased that it has been possible to make a start on dealing with the electoral dispute. I have asked all the political parties – I have met them all, including the opposition parties – and their leaders to observe the maximum restraint so as to enable the national election administration to complete its work independently.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has also arranged – in response to a request from the opposition parties – for representatives of each party, including the opposition parties, to sit on the committee set up to receive complaints. There too, we have obtained satisfaction. We were also the only key player in negotiating a code of conduct for the media. This code is well on the way to being adopted by all the parties, and it is more than likely that it will be adopted fairly quickly. The Commission and the EU as a whole very much want Ethiopia to conclude the electoral process not only in the interests of the country’s stability but also because of the terrific signal that real democratisation of the country would send out. Both through the European Union’s election observation mission and through the political dialogue conducted within the country itself by the Commission’s representative, the Commission is at the forefront of the initiatives and is playing a constructive role appreciated by all the Ethiopian parties. We shall continue to support the process.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like sincerely and publicly to thank and congratulate the honourable Member, Mrs Gomes in view of her remarkable work as head of the European election observation mission and the excellent collaboration she has made possible between herself and ourselves. We have had contacts, and I appreciate the degree to which she has helped bring our positions closer together. I wanted very much to say that she has gone beyond her simple role as head of the observation mission and that she really has been a quite remarkable facilitator.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the European Union will continue to engage in constructive, but firm and demanding, dialogue in order to continue to have a positive effect on the process under way in Ethiopia. This process is obviously a delicate one. In each camp, extremists are only waiting for a mistake to be made or for an opportunity to spark things off. I think that this collective responsibility – involving Parliament, the Commission and the Council – should forestall this worst case scenario and keep each camp committed to the legal framework and current electoral and political process.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, even so, to add something. Without taking sides, I should like in any case to say that the influence of the European Union is, to some extent, helped by Prime Minister Meles’s open approach and, above all, by his considerable confidence in the European Union. He sees the European Union as an institution and a reality to believe in and to respect. Hence, his relative promptness in responding to our requests and entreaties and, indeed, our demands. I am convinced that, if we can continue to support the process, we shall play a conciliatory role, and democracy could quite easily come into its own again in Ethiopia.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister Meles told us that he would accept the verdict of the electorate when it is announced by the institution that is to make known the precise results. If, for example, it were necessary to hold fresh elections in a number of constituencies etc., he would fall in with this. We shall see what comes of the matter. In any case, each time that he has committed himself to do something, he has done it. It was important that I informed you of this.</p>
<p class="contents">The picture I am painting is not as black as that painted by certain speakers. Of course, the situation is a delicate one. Naturally, it is risky. Of course, it is dangerous. Who would imagine otherwise? Since I have been a Commissioner, however, this is the first time I have been aware that, when the various institutions – Parliament, High Representatives, the Commission and delegations on the spot – work together, including with the Member States and using all the instruments available to the European Union, they are effective. That is certainly the case where Ethiopia is concerned. I have the feeling that we have been really very useful, but I should like again to thank Mrs Gomes from the bottom of my heart because she has been of great help to us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
