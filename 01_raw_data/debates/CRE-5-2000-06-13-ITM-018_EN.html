<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vidal-Quadras Roca (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the dismantling of obsolete nuclear installations and the correct treatment and final destination of the resulting radioactive waste are an issue of great industrial and environmental relevance within the debate on the future of the energy supply necessary for the world’s sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, we now have the necessary scientific and technological knowledge to ensure that these operations are carried out in conditions which are safe for the workers involved and for the public in general, and it is the role of the public authorities to supply the appropriate resources and ensure that the legislation in force in this field is respected. To this end we should welcome the Commission’s document on the historical liabilities from the Joint Research Centre installations. This document establishes the financial and technical bases for the dismantling of obsolete nuclear installations and for the closing of others which are still operating, as well as for the final storage of the radioactive waste already generated and waste resulting from the proposed process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s document has been considerably improved and supplemented after its passage through this Parliament’s Industry Committee, and also as a result of the rigorous reports of the Committees on Budgets and the Environment.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I will mention six points in relation to which our parliamentary work has made particularly significant contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Parliament considers that a programme of this scope and duration cannot be left to the whim of each year’s budget. Therefore, we ask the Commission and the Council to immediately begin a tripartite dialogue on this issue during which the three institutions will set a specific, stable and sufficient budgetary action line. Of course, the expenditure incurred cannot in any way jeopardise the funds destined for research within the successive framework programmes. Given that this point, Commissioner, is, if you will pardon the expression, the weakest in the document, and recognising that with in the current financial perspective there is no easy solution to it, I would ask you to make a clear statement about this in your speech.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Member States that are affected must fully participate in the development of the programme, since this will be implemented subject to the respective legislation on nuclear safety and radiological protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, all the operations must be carried out in a totally transparent manner, in such a way that the workers who participate in them, and the populations in neighbouring areas, are fully and reliably informed and, of course, listened to.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the experience gained and the technological advances which stem from these operations must be taken advantage of in similar situations in the applicant countries, who should be persuaded to participate in them by means of the PHARE and TACIS programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, Parliament will monitor the programme in detail by means of receiving an exhaustive and accurate annual report.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly, a committee of external independent experts will advise the Joint Research Centre and assess the technical quality and safety guarantees of the programme during its development.</p>
<p class="contents">I would not like to conclude without acknowledging the loyal cooperation of the staff of the Joint Research Centre, who have constantly gone out of their way to provide the information requested of them, as well as the valuable contributions of the various Members of Parliament with whom I have maintained useful and constructive exchanges of view, in particular Mrs McNally, Mrs Ahern, Mrs Maes and Mrs Buitenweg.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that any issue relating to the nuclear industry is inevitably controversial and hindered by excessive emotion, the fact that the final agreement on the text which the Industry Committee has communicated to Parliament has been unanimous, provides a measure of the maturity and responsibility of this House when it comes to supporting an objective which is both desirable and urgent: a definitive, safe and clean solution with regard to the nuclear installations which have come to the end of their useful life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, the Commission is proposing a very strange method of financing the estimated needs. Instead of setting aside funds within a budget line, it suggests finding the necessary finance from money which was originally intended for other purposes but which was not actually spent. As the rapporteur, with whom I worked extremely well, has already remarked himself, this is an extremely peculiar financing method, and I can think of at least three reasons why this is so. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the safety of current and future generations cannot be made dependent on the fact that there may be some money left over somewhere. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is giving the Commission a very ambiguous message. Indeed, the budget authority decides on how much money should be spent on certain matters, but hopes at the same time that some money will be left over for something as important as decommissioning nuclear plants. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this financing method is also at odds with the principle of transparency. Indeed, it is not made clear how much money is reserved for decommissioning activities. The rapporteur claims in his report that the nuclear plants in question have been operated for decades with a view to providing direct support to the nuclear industry, which has been able to make use of the results free of charge. Is it a coincidence that there is little transparency in such a contentious area of policy? </p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets has rejected this working method. As already indicated, it proposed to convene a trialogue and to include the solution which emerges from this exercise in the budget procedure for 2001. Moreover, this trialogue can also serve to plug a democratic hole. Indeed, the budget instrument can serve as a big stick in order to secure a say in the programme content. I hope that Parliament can support this proposal made by the Committee on Budgets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should also be concerned, however, at the conditions in which this initiative is being undertaken, very late in the day, on the basis of partial information and in the utmost confusion regarding the funding of this action programme, despite its urgent and important nature.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only are there no budget provisions, but the regulations in force mean that financing arrangements are particularly uncertain. There were no provisions, even though all this was anticipated long ago. We have been aware, ever since the nuclear installations were built, that one day they would have to be decommissioned and that this would not be a simple matter. So the fact that there are no provisions is indicative of the fact that no one wanted to make provisions for this so as not to undermine the pro-nuclear dogma.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication provides an opportunity for us to prioritise as a matter for concern the issue of the decommissioning of nuclear installations, a matter of the utmost topicality of direct concern to the European Union, its Member States and the candidate countries, not just the JRC and the Commission, an already highly topical matter which is going to become ever more urgent in years to come. This is why we consider it so important that Parliament should be kept fully informed in order to have all the facts at its disposal when debating the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication makes the pertinent comment that the Euratom Treaty, signed in 1957, envisaged the establishment and rapid growth of the nuclear sector. The time has now come, however, to decommission the installations in this sector. Clearly, then, this Treaty and the role assigned to the EAEC have now also proved to be truly obsolete.</p>
<p class="contents">While the European Union must respond, above all, to the problem of historical liabilities deriving from nuclear activities, then we consider it a matter of urgency to re-evaluate the Euratom Treaty and the role of the EAEC in the course of the negotiations currently in progress within the context of the Intergovernmental Conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The dismantling of obsolete reactors and the disposal of spent fuel are essential to the future of Europe’s nuclear research and energy sector. Nuclear power is currently the most important and versatile form of energy production and will remain so far into the future. For example, in addition to normal production, many modern plants can utilise the plutonium that would have been used for nuclear weapons prior to decommissioning. Serious research into renewable energy sources is possible when we have another form of cheap energy at our disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Assurance of nuclear safety is one of the most important preconditions of the Union’s enlargement eastwards. Both the candidate countries and the Union have to work hard, via the TACIS and PHARE programmes, for example, to make sure that obsolete and disused nuclear plants can be made environmentally safe in a sustainable way. This, however, must be done in a controlled way. Calls for the dismantling of plants in Eastern Europe which are obsolete but which are in working order may lead to an uncontrollable downward spiral in the energy sector. Nobody wants to drive the countries of Eastern Europe into a situation where they are completely dependent on imported energy.</p>
<p class="contents">We must invest more in the disposal of radioactive waste. For example, several years of effort have been made in Finland to solve the problem of disposal. A sustainable model for a solution already exists. I hope that the political will to grapple with this issue as swiftly as possible will be found elsewhere in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was an exemplary way of setting about proceeding on what is a very difficult issue. Of course with hindsight this is something which should have been considered long ago. However, the European Commission and the Joint Research Centre have listened to the comments made by the European Parliament about this matter of concern. I accept that they are trying their very best to put forward a solution which enables them – who know as well as anyone else the seriousness of the situation – to tackle this problem. The methodology, however, is quite inadequate and can only be very temporary.</p>
<p class="contents">We have this historical liability but, colleagues, this is not something that can possibly be funded from current research. This is not current research. We would be stealing money from research programmes which are badly needed and a top priority for the European Union if we financed the decommissioning from that budget That would be a completely incorrect use of research funds. These installations are the property and liability of the whole of the European Community, not uniquely of the research programmes. Conclusion 9 spells that out most clearly, and I fully support it.</p>
<p class="contents">The traditional budgetary procedure is inadequate and inappropriate for the reasons that have been stated by colleagues. Not least, it is far too uncertain for a very important task like this. The trialogue is urgently needed. I support Amendment No 20 which says that the present situation, the present conclusion, is adequate for this year only. That means that we must have a trialogue meeting called within days after the passing of Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca's report. We must ask the chair of our committee, the Commission and the Council to get together before the summer so that a solution can be found for next year's budget.</p>
<p class="contents">This work must be done in the safest possible conditions. We cannot have any corners cut in an area where it would actually be dangerous to do so. It must be done properly and properly financed; no cutting down on the amount of cooling time. Certainly not! We face a time-bomb in the Joint Research Centre: the imminent loss of very many skilled people who have the knowledge from their time at the Joint Research Centre. Those people are getting older and will retire. We have to have emergency measures to ensure that people with the appropriate skills are brought into the workforce at the Joint Research Centre.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we must look at the historical liabilities, but I urge colleagues to support Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca's report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr President, the nuclear plants in the joint research centres date back to the 60s and were intended to provide direct support to the European nuclear industry. These installations, therefore, should not be considered research installations in the sense that is understood today. </p>
<p class="contents">It should not, therefore, be the case that the Fifth Framework Programme should single-handedly carry the cost of decommissioning. But the proposed alternative, namely to dip into budget lines which have not been used over the year, demonstrates how little insight there is into the budget discipline. It begs the question how seriously we take ourselves if, every year, we need to look for any left-over funding in order to clean up the nuclear legacy. And how seriously will the electorate take us if we deal with public health and taxpayers’ money in this way? </p>
<p class="contents">My group will therefore support Amendment No 12 in order, in consultation with the Council and Commission, to reach a final budget decision for 2001 onwards. In addition, my group is of the opinion that we should not only find a budget for installations which are out of action. We should already make provision for the future decommissioning of plants which are still in operation at the moment. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, my group is concerned that in a number of Member States, notably Italy where most plants are located, legislation on the storage of nuclear waste is still in its infancy. This can lead to complications during decommissioning activities and can also result in additional financial problems. Also, it goes to show once again that the drafting of minimum safety standards with regard to the design, construction, operation and decommissioning of nuclear reactors within the European Union is a matter of extreme urgency. I have also suggested including this in the Euratom Treaty at the forthcoming IGC negotiations in Nice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca, for his conscientious approach and his efforts to reach agreement on an issue of such sensitivity for our citizens. Agreement is not consensus, as political groups and indeed Member States differ strongly on nuclear matters. Nevertheless we can agree on the necessity of dealing with decommissioning and the safe handling of nuclear waste as an urgent requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">Nuclear power is not sustainable and should not be promoted, as it still is under the outdated Euratom Treaty which goes back, as has been said, to 1957, and which aggressively promotes nuclear power but does not adequately protect the public health of our citizens. It is not subject to the democratic control of the European Parliament because it is not part of the treaties of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the European Parliament has a budgetary role, which is why the Commission's budgetary proposals are not acceptable. We can only accept it for the year 2000 pending a more correct budgetary solution in 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">On nuclear waste it is important to emphasise that no solution has been found. Only certain Member States create nuclear waste, and these are the states that should therefore pay for dealing with it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur for proposing to convene a trialogue so that the European Parliament can play an appropriate role in managing in a sound manner, as Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca has indicated, our terrible legacy of nuclear waste which future generations will have to deal with and which, with its dreadful effects, can devastate all life on earth.</p>
<p class="contents">There are obsolete nuclear power plants all over the EU, not just the ones that we are considering with the JRC. This has important implications for the future, so that we can deal soundly with the situation. I thank the Commission for its proposals in general and, in particular, Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca, for the way he has involved colleagues in trying to find a solution to this problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the absence of appropriate assurances on safety, the relevance of the nuclear industry to a changing world economy and environment is likely to continue to be a controversial issue.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a growing unease even with the safest and most modern facilities about our increasing dependence on nuclear energy. Already we have examples of new installations not being commissioned and a re-examination of policy by some Member States. With regard to European policy and its relevance to Member States, I believe we should introduce a period of reflection before embarking on further dependence on nuclear energy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are living in a time of increasing awareness of the environment and public health. On these issues, the public are seeking assurances beyond reasonable doubt. This is their entitlement and in the light of the many failures and accidents in the nuclear industry, I am not satisfied that they can feel safe with what is happening.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision last week to close Chernobyl is belatedly welcome. There is now no credible reason for any further delay in closing the Sellafield installation, which has one of the worst safety records in the industry. The impact of Sellafield on public health and the environment is now a matter of fact. The sordid history of management and attempts to conceal serious accidents are a matter that cannot be taken lightly particularly in Ireland where our people are exposed to serious risks with no redress as far as decisions on safety are concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now that these plants have reached the end of their working life, we are left with the legacy of decommissioning these plants. </p>
<p class="contents">Recital C of the resolution of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy states that Europe boasts a high level of expertise when it comes to decommissioning nuclear plants. The European Commission communication, however, shows that this does not go much beyond managing old nuclear plants and storing radioactive waste. A problem in this respect is the fact that the total decommissioning process takes up several decades. It will therefore be some time before we have learned from practical experience how to decommission old nuclear plants. In addition, there is no solution in sight as to how to solve the problem of radioactive waste. </p>
<p class="contents">It will be evident that this state of affairs also has a bearing on finances. The European Commission suggests transferring the funds of the R&amp;D budget, which might not be spent, to a new heading intended for decommissioning. This raises the suspicion that decommissioning is seen as unimportant. In my opinion, this is a gross underestimation of the cost of decommissioning. It also implies that the price charged for electricity generated by nuclear energy is too low. If you ask me, it would, in summary, seem more appropriate if industry and the Member States, which have also enjoyed the fruits of the JRC, were to carry the cost of decommissioning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, I saw the need to open up stores of waste which were deemed fit some decades ago and met the requirements of the time, but now do not meet our current high standards. We must bear in mind that times change and the standards change with them.</p>
<p class="contents">I note that the procedure proposed by the Commission for the financing of the decommissioning and waste management work on the research reactors has a familiar ring to it. It sounds rather like the Tomlinson procedure which was adopted for financing Parliament's building in Brussels. That was by transferring unexpended funds in odds and ends of budget lines on a year-by-year basis. So, perhaps colleagues should be cautious before we criticise this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I recognise the widespread view that funds should not be taken from research lines under the Fifth Framework and that research money should not be used for this purpose. I see a certain irony in such thoughts coming from those people who also demand the internalisation of external costs, i.e. the inclusion of decommissioning costs in the overall cost structure, when the procedure now put before us is pretty much the same thing.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the proposal for a trialogue. It seems the sensible approach. The work must be done and has to be paid for somehow. I am very sorry to hear colleagues propagating ancient myths like "no solution has been found for dealing with nuclear waste". I am afraid Mrs Ahern has lost contact with the facts in this matter because she is quite wrong in her statement, and we should not let such myths distract us from the issue at hand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think there are times when we could use a little more perestroika and glasnost in the structures of our administration, particularly where the Joint Research Centre is concerned. A report was compiled in 1998 investigating the Joint Research Centre. This report also contains remarks regarding the nuclear sector, ranging from the question of whether the personnel are qualified to whether our own European safety standards are being observed. The ghost of this report haunts our corridors precisely because it has not been published. That is not the way to go about things. If our aim is to develop a strategy for handling nuclear material then we must lay all our cards on the table.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">People could not therefore be more justified in demanding that the aforementioned 1998 report at last be published, and that it be made clear what lessons were drawn from it as regards the handling of nuclear material at the Joint Research Centre. We are indeed prepared, on the basis of a clear analysis and a clear inventory, to develop a strategy aimed at the degradation of dangerous waste accumulated over the years. But first we must have clarity. Glasnost and perestroika are what we need when it comes to handling nuclear material in our own installations.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The JRC’s nuclear activities present us, however, with a twofold problem: that of reducing this type of activity, on the agenda now more than at the time the JRC was set up under the aegis of Euratom, and the problem of the historical liabilities from nuclear activities involving the matter of decommissioning, at an estimated cost of more than EUR 500 million, all told, though there is every possibility that this gross figure has been underestimated, as is generally the case in nuclear matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, although four JRC sites are concerned (Ispra, Karlsruhe, Vienna and Petten), there are still six of the fifteen Member States (Ireland, Luxembourg, Denmark, Greece, Portugal and Austria) that do not benefit from this research.</p>
<p class="contents">This whole business has a past history, a historical context which, as the very title of the report indicates, merits serious analysis, both of the origin of the research and of the transfers effected from various countries to the JRC. This is why, in the first place, we are not in favour of dealing with the problem of cost as a side issue. Using appropriations that have not been used may prove an incentive not to use all research appropriations in order to be able to invest them in decommissioning.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a serious reassessment must be made of the research appropriations and the cost of research in relation to decommissioning and of the consequent impact on the cost of nuclear energy, which must also be re-evaluated. Thirdly, we are therefore in favour of Kathalijne Buitenweg’s proposal to set up a specific budget line and to determine this by a trialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">We should like, however, to draw the Commission’s attention to the fact that problems exist not only in terms of the budget, but there are also technical problems, and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has useful points to make in this trialogue. Decommissioning operations are not compatible with the principle of annual budget payments and all the countries have appropriate internal procedures. The objective of the trialogue is therefore to reach an agreement between the three institutions on an appropriate regulation which will serve as a legal basis for financing the operations.</p>
<p class="contents">Only on this condition, which must lead us to make proposals for the 2001 budget, will we accept the interim measures for the current budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must therefore not only carry out the operations in the strictest observance of the current safety rules but we must also be able to reassure the local population that the operations will be of the highest quality, and they must therefore be based on the greatest respect for the quality of the whole of the environment and human life. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can no longer shirk its responsibilities, which are now being diluted in the internal debate between the Commissioners on how to finance the operations, but it must guarantee definite, substantial, appropriate, continued financial support for the decommissioning and management programme, ensuring the success of the entire operation in the medium term. </p>
<p class="contents">As Parliament has already stated, the deactivation of obsolete installations and waste management will have to be financed from dedicated funds, not from capital intended to fund research. At the moment, Europe is having to expand its research and technological development capacities, particularly but not exclusively in the field of the new technologies we have discussed today, but also with a view to closing the gap between Europe and its competitors, the greatest of which are the United States and Japan. </p>
<p class="contents">I am also concerned by the uncertainty which clouds the action programme, in terms of the final storage of the waste. As we are aware, the rules and regulations which apply are the responsibility of the Member States on whose territory the Joint Research Centres lie, but the legislation in some States, particularly in Italy, on the final storage of waste is still at the preparation stage. The absence of national regulations and the uncertainty regarding the actual volume of waste may create fresh financial problems which will have to be taken into consideration.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank the Commission for issuing this communication very promptly.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem before us today has been at the forefront of the discussions we have had during debates on the Fifth Framework Programme. What we must be aware of – and many of you are unaware of this – is that for a long time this problem has effectively deadlocked any agreement on the Fifth Framework Programme because the Council wanted both to reduce the appropriations for the JRC while at the same time paying all the costs of decommissioning, as it were.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we are clearly in a situation where the Commission has come up with a budgetary instrument to at last start decommissioning and, in spite of everything, to undertake the necessary action on waste, but in a climate of great uncertainty, as the Commission knows well. So, as we have been quite rightly saying again and again, what we have to do is organise a trialogue as quickly as possible and find a legal basis, i.e. a regulation that makes it possible to provide multiannual financing for a concerted programme in this area. Not only does it need to be done, but it needs to be done quickly. This matter, Madam President, must be added to the current budgetary trialogue negotiations and I should like you to draw the attention of the President of Parliament, Mrs Fontaine, to this. I should also like the chairman of the parliamentary Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy to make his fellow chairman on the Committee on Budgets aware of this. Discussions have to start now, not in three or four months’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to make a historical point regarding Euratom. People have criticised and are still criticising the Euratom Treaty. We should be aware that the Euratom Treaty was the first example of a treaty offering protection to the public. It is thanks to the 1957 Euratom Treaty that we in Europe have the highest level of nuclear supervision and protection in the world. It warrants praise rather than brickbats. What is obsolete about it is the fact that there is a treaty specifically for nuclear energy. What we need to do tomorrow is incorporate this treaty, as it stands, into the European Community Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that he will promote this dialogue at every given opportunity. In any event, I would like to thank him for his report. </p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about the management of the nuclear legacy, Commissioner, but legacy usually implies a gain and you can refuse it if you so wish. This legacy, however, cannot be refused. We are lumbered with it and will have to deal with it in some way or another. As one of the old opponents of nuclear energy, precisely because of those unresolved issues, I am not speaking with a sense of satisfaction but more with a sense of: “You see, we told you so all along”. We are lumbered with this legacy and it is not fair, really, to saddle future generations with problems. </p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to make one comment regarding the report. If Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca says that possible lasting solutions have not yet been implemented, I cannot agree with him, because I do not consider the storage of this waste a solution. From this point of view, I also beg to differ with Mr Chichester. I think that a genuine solution has not been found or cannot be found. </p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Euratom Treaty is concerned, I would go along with what you are saying, Mr Desama, but I would press for a critical overhaul of the Euratom Treaty, maybe on the Commissioner’s initiative. In that way, we could see how an incorporated treaty would have to be reviewed, as I find your proposal highly interesting from this point of view. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also argue for a programme for decommissioning which is not modelled on too narrow-minded views and for our, as from now, taking into consideration the problems of our future partner countries, as we will have to deal with their legacies from the past too. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to expressly ask the Commissioner whether he would be prepared to publish the internal audit report of 28 April 1998, because, at the end of the day, there is little precise information available. I would, therefore, also ask whether the NIRAS [Belgian Institute for Radioactive Waste and Fissionable Materials] report on cost development could be published, for example. In my opinion, it is absolutely vital to achieve this transparency which our fellow delegates are pressing for, so that, in future, we can have nuclear energy pay for its legacy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would stress certain points which have been already been touched upon several times, starting with the premise that essential health and environmental obligations must always take precedence over economic objectives, although these cannot be disregarded.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be recognised that, for some time, the comparison between the cost of the different sources of energy has been distorted by underestimation of the cost of decommissioning the installations and waste management. Therefore, the cost of decommissioning nuclear installations must not be taken solely from European Union resources but must also be the responsibility of the Member States which are involved in the construction of installations. In terms of the budget, the cost must not be taken from the research heading but a separate line should be created, as has been suggested.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must use this undertaking to gain fresh experience which will allow it to tackle the extremely serious issues regarding the ex-Soviet Union and the countries of the East which are candidates for enlargement. These territories contain many nuclear power stations which will have to be closed or decommissioned in forthcoming years. We must avoid the repetition of tragedies such as Chernobyl, the consequences of which have still not all become manifest, particularly with a view to the future lives of the communities affected by that disaster. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it has to be said that the current situation of the Joint Research Centres, particularly the situation of the Ispra site, is the result of a past policy which did not take the problem of the disposal of nuclear waste into due account. The issue of the safe disposal of the waste is, to say the least, worrying. We need a specific and – in my opinion – short or medium-term project to promote the safety of the citizens who live in those territories and the surrounding environment. </p>
<p class="contents">It might be useful, in this regard, to capitalise on the experiences of the other countries of the Union, for example, England, Germany and France, where, although the disposal issue has not been completely resolved, it has been targeted for some time now. In a country such as Italy, in particular, where there is no specific legislation, we will have to rely on the abilities of the Ispra research scientists for the disposal of radioactive waste from that site. </p>
<p class="contents">I tabled two questions on the Ispra issue but I did not receive satisfactory responses. I, too, call for the 1998 Commission internal audit report to be made public so that a comprehensive, exhaustive assessment of the issue can be made. I feel that there is a need for Parliament’s voice of democracy to be genuinely heeded in this case, so that we can guarantee to the local communities that they will not be in any danger. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to pay tribute to the sense of responsibility displayed by the Members of Parliament today in relation to a complex problem. Finally, I should like to express my pleasure at the support which Parliament is offering the Commission’s initiative to launch this action programme in difficult overall circumstances, as you have highlighted.</p>
<p class="contents">Before getting to the heart of the matter, I should like to respond to three Members of Parliament, Mr Lang, Mrs Maes and Mr Mantovani, on the matter of the internal audit report for the Joint Research Centre of 28 April 1998. With reference to this subject, I shall simply say that this is no more than a draft report which has not been accepted by both sides, which may be surprising given that it is now the year 2000 and the report dates back to 1998, but I am only noting the fact.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the report then, I shall simply say that it concerns the problem before us today and much more, since it concerns all the activities of the Joint Research Centre. A number of points raised in this report have already been answered. Having said that, I share your wish for transparency and I would like to inform you that this draft report and the subsequent exchange of letters have been officially conveyed to the chairmen of the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only suggest that you familiarise yourselves with these documents, and I shall remain available to discuss the matter. I consider transparency to be absolutely crucial and I share your feeling on this. The documents are available and we are available to discuss them. Let me remind you, however, that this is a draft audit report which has not been subject to examination by both parties.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now come to the report before the House this evening. All these problems, as you have pointed out, are due to the infrastructure and installations built under the Euratom Treaty in the early 1960s, in the face of the European Atomic Energy Community, in order to further the development of nuclear energy. Most of these installations have now been shut down and have become obsolete, and they have been maintained in a secure state pending decommissioning. It must be stressed that they are currently being kept in a secure state with a view to decommissioning in future.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, indeed, generally accepted that this delaying strategy, which has also been implemented by many Member States, is in fact extremely costly and that faster decommissioning would make it possible to manage the sites and the waste generated, as well as the available resources, better. The Commission therefore decided to initiate an action programme to tackle, in a general and in-depth fashion, the decommissioning of obsolete installations and the management of the waste generated since the 1960s. Indeed, I attach particular importance to the Community’s assuming the responsibilities arising as a result of the nuclear activities carried out in the Joint Research Centre at the start of the Euratom Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The ultimate objective of the action programme is to enable the land and buildings concerned to be reassigned for non-nuclear use, level 3 of the recommendations of the International Atomic Energy Agency. This is a process which must, as you have pointed out, respect the environment and the health of the population, but one which will extend over around fifteen years at a cost which may be in excess of some EUR 230 million. Indeed, this sum applied only to installations already shut down. Initial calculations of the costs of the future decommissioning of installations still being used for research suggest additional costs of EUR 220 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Implementation of this action programme has already started. It is being carried out under the supervision of the Joint Research Centre, which is providing its experience and the personnel necessary, and with the assistance of a committee of independent experts from the Member States. When I say independent, I mean not only independent of the Joint Research Centre but also independent of industrial interests, since this is a problem that has been mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the most sensitive and problematic aspect of the matter: financing.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution which the Commission adopted initially, as you mentioned, was to use the appropriations from heading 3 that remained at the end of the year by means of a transfer subject to the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Committee on Budgets pointed out, however, this is not really an appropriate solution, and I am willing to acknowledge this, for a long-term programme. The fact remains that this proved to be the only way to get the programme under way after twenty years of waiting and two refusals by the Council and the European Parliament to finance these operations form the research budget, which I find perfectly understandable. So this initial solution was adopted as a pragmatic option. I accept that Parliament, in its capacity as budgetary authority, was unhappy with this, but I thank the House for its understanding and for authorising, as I said in December, this initial step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, from a personal point of view, I would prefer a much more structural solution, as you stressed in your report, and in your proposal to convene a trialogue you are sending out a clear message: the matter is specific and sensitive enough to warrant being examined by experts from the three institutions. Indeed, I share Mr Desama’s opinion in requesting that this trialogue should be convened as quickly as possible. This is what we want, and, I think, what Parliament wants too. We have every reason to adopt a pragmatic and responsible approach. This is the approach Parliament favours and which I myself favour, and the Commission is already looking into the options which might be put before the trialogue in order to avoid the pitfalls inherent in this type of activity. This may lead us to investigate an approach which bypasses the constraints of annual budgetary payments, as you pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, in the preliminary draft budget 2001, the Commission has already made proposals in line with the concerns expressed by Parliament, particularly regarding specific budget lines. I think this is a matter to be discussed in the trialogue but also with the Committee on Budgets to ensure that the budget for 2001 can already include the first “positive transactions” on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I noted a number of requests from Members of Parliament, particularly the legitimate request for greater transparency. Let me tell you, to this end, that the Internet site requested is already operational. This is not a problem. Any citizen who so wishes can find information on the subject. Generally speaking, the necessary internal arrangements have already been made in the Joint Research Centre so that it can fulfil its role as the awarding authority fully and effectively and can assume total control of the external firms carrying out the main body of the work.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are left with the legitimate question of what is to become of the installations that are still operating. Mrs Plooij van-Gorsel spoke of this. The Commission does not wish to dodge the issue, as it specified in its communication. The Commission also mentioned that the solutions adopted by Member States are not easy to apply at Community level. I should therefore be very much in favour of the trialogue tackling this question too: not just the matter of the installations already shut down but also that of the installations still operating, which will probably present a problem at some point in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever the case, I must thank Parliament for its interest and for its responsible proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
