<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Khanbhai (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, a family in a mud hut in rural Africa without access to clean water, electricity, hospital or community centre is simply devastated when it discovers that a member of the family is suffering from any one of the three diseases HIV/AIDS, TB or malaria. The patient has no access to a clinic nearby that can test, diagnose and treat him and, even if there is one, he cannot afford the treatment. The patient's family is in crisis, not only because of illness but also because it has to find the money for treatment that will include the cost of transport and additional nutritional requirements. This is the reality!</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, my objective was to produce a report with recommendations that would support a programme of action that is possible to fund, practical to implement, and most beneficial to those who are the poor victims of such infections. Such a report requires wide consultation with colleagues from all political groups, the European Commission, the pharmaceutical industry, UN agencies, NGOs and civil society, so that a consensus based on facts can be achieved and appropriate action taken to target the problem, making most efficient use of limited resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I had that wide consultation, and I want to thank all colleagues who were so helpful, in particular Dr Fransen and her team and Commissioner Nielson's department. Dr Fransen has worked in Africa herself, so she was a mine of information. I also want to thank all colleagues from all political parties, especially in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, related committees and, of course, the secretariats, who were extremely helpful.</p>
<p class="contents">The report promotes the following: a global fund financed by G8, the EU, oil-rich nations and others to finance access to and supply of medication and treatment; a global strategy to implement a programme of action to treat and prevent communicable diseases; tiered pricing of medicines from the pharmaceutical industry to ensure wide access to treatment; support for health infrastructure to scan, diagnose, treat and monitor patients, as supply of medicines in itself is inadequate; use of incentives – both financial and legislative – to enhance research and development to produce new medicines and vaccines by both industry and the public sector; the European Commission to work closely with the governments of developing countries, UN agencies, NGOs and civil society to implement the programme. It promotes appropriate future legislation to give more flexibility in the implementation of TRIPS to encourage transfer of technology for local manufacture of essential medicines wherever this is viable.</p>
<p class="contents">There are four paragraphs in the report which require minor changes because of errors or difficulty in implementation. My intention in paragraph 14 was to ensure that if we are to find the lowest prices for medicines for poor countries and for the patients in these countries, we must ensure that the developing countries do not impose import duty and taxes on imports of essential medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">Developed countries – the EU and the USA – do not impose export taxes when they export medicines from their countries. So there is a mistake in paragraph 14. I want to make an oral amendment, which I hope colleagues will accept. It should read: "Calls on developing countries to abolish tariffs and taxes on imports of essential drugs and equipment in order to make health care more affordable;". This paragraph really refers to import taxes in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to make an oral amendment to paragraph 9 to replace "10%" with the word "appropriate", because you cannot dictate to the European Commission and the Committee on Budgets what exact percentage of money should be spent – there are budget lines, which are already agreed in other committees and in other reports. So "appropriate" is the word, rather than "10%".</p>
<p class="contents">In paragraph 20, I would like to propose an oral amendment, which I hope Members of this House will support, to delete the second part which begins "in which a doubling of the budget ....". Again, the same problem applies: you cannot in a report like this put a fixed percentage when other committees have agreed budget lines and the Commission has budget appropriations fixed by the Council of Ministers for doing the job it is doing. These are minor changes.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to clarify the issue of the patent life of medicines, as some colleagues have expressed concern. A new drug costs about USD 500 m to research, test and bring to market. Unless this sum is recoverable, nobody will invest in research and the development of drugs for diseases of the poor. No government can finance such investment so we must encourage the pharmaceutical industry to continue to finance research. Their patent is in any case irrelevant after seven or ten years as new drugs are developed and doctors will change a treatment regime, thereby precipitating the fall in price of that medicine still under patent. The real trick – and this is what I have been trying to do in this report – is to secure tiered pricing for all medication – new and old – so that the poor patients benefit whilst the industry continues to pay for research and development.</p>
<p class="contents">My Amendment No 1 addresses this problem and I have inserted the word "review" to replace the word "reduce", in order to cooperate with colleagues concerned about this issue. So I am not throwing it out of the window, I am asking us to review it in WTO. If there is justification for amending it, so be it.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this House will give me full support for this report, which I did not try to make political. It concerns something that we must do for the poor so that we can tell the world, especially the poor, that the European Union is concerned about their problems and will take the lead in fighting disease and poverty throughout the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the reasons for this is that medicines are for the most part too expensive for the people of those countries. And medicines are often unavailable altogether. Of the more than 1 450 new medicines which have come onto the market in the last twenty years, only thirteen are intended for tropical diseases. There is a severe lack of effective medicines in developing countries. They are either non-existent or too expensive. It would appear that investment in treatment of tropical diseases is not profitable enough for pharmaceutical companies. A more tragic example of the failure of the market is hard to imagine. These sad facts give the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy cause to propose drastic measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we propose a system of differentiated pricing. Medications should be made available free of charge or at affordable prices. For this, it will be necessary to prevent re-importation, and the industry’s cooperation will be essential in this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the matter of patents. Rapporteur Khanbhai mentioned the great importance of these. Nevertheless, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy proposes to shorten the period of patent protection for essential medicines in developing countries. This is important, since in 2005 and 2006, the TRIPS Agreement is to be implemented in developing countries. By then, there will be major problems in combating AIDS and also tuberculosis. If the system of differentiated pricing works, this measure will not be necessary. But should it not succeed completely, it would be an important weapon in the battle against disease in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">A third point which is also of extreme importance to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy is an extensive European research programme. This is necessary to tailor pharmaceutical research more to existing needs. Therefore more research into, and investment in, treatment of tropical diseases, but also investment in remedies which can be used in developing countries. Remedies which, for example, do not require refrigerated storage.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation with the developing countries is essential, and a substantial increase in the budget to go along with this. I thank the rapporteur for his cooperation and for his willingness to listen to other committees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The international community should long before have taken the HIV epidemic more seriously and generally gone to much more effort, through research and preventive measures, to reduce the spread of malaria in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Lack of funds, especially in the area of research, has long been acute. Of course, we welcome initiatives of the type which Bill Gates carried out, but this type of preventive work cannot, and must not, depend on the efforts of single individuals. It must primarily be a task for public bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution under discussion today constitutes Parliament’s rather late response to the Commission’s initiative of last year. The resolution should be seen in the context of the work we are currently carrying out with regard to the budget for next year, in which we propose, at least on a preliminary basis, considerable increases compared with the proposals of the Commission and the Council. We believe there is a need for more capacity within the Commission in order for it to be able to play a leading role in this area. There is also a need for more money for operational initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation with regard to the diseases we are discussing here today is critical. More resources are needed, but there is also a need for new and innovative forms of partnership – especially between the public and private sectors. We must ensure that incentives are created for increased research. Partnership between the public and private sectors is vital, as too of course is partnership with non-governmental organisations. I hope the Commission, and especially Mr Nielson, will see this resolution, as well as our efforts in other contexts to increase budget resources, as a strong incentive and support for the Commission with a view to the latter’s playing the leading role in the fight against HIV, malaria and TB, a fight which I believe we all feel is so important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report reflects a twofold realisation, both of the extent of the scourge and that of the financial and human resources necessary to combat it. It enables us to take several steps forward in a debate that is essential for the very survival of part of the world. It also clarifies Parliament’s position on many crucial points such as the need to significantly increase resources assigned to improving health systems and to fighting communicable diseases in developing countries, the will to overcome the opposition between prevention and treatment, which are two essential and complementary aspects of the fight against disease, and the emergence of a new concept of public health as a global public asset. In addition, it clarifies and provides an interpretation of the safeguard clauses in the TRIPS agreement on intellectual property. It also confirms the fact that the issue of the price of drugs is at the heart of the debates on access to treatment and the importance of research and development and, above all, it stresses the need to focus efforts on diseases that particularly affect the South, as well as forgotten illnesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament’s position is therefore now clear and coherent, but, above all, it is just and fair. There is the feeling that we are finally beginning to ask the right questions and, from now on, we need to provide the right answers. It is now time, ladies and gentlemen, to make the move from good intentions to positive action. In the immediate future, there are two main areas of action in which we need to intervene. The first involves interpreting agreements on intellectual property in a way that is more favourable to the health of the developing world. Public opinion is ready for such progress to take place and the withdrawal of actions brought against South Africa and Brazil has created a very distinct psychological climate. Many ambiguities still remain, however. The fourth WTO ministerial conference in Doha should enable us to go further in officially and formally proposing guarantees on recourse to all the components of the safeguard clauses established in the TRIPS agreement, confirming in particular that in the case of compulsory licences, drugs can be produced in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The second front on which we should expect short-term progress is the global AIDS and health fund that was launched in New York and Genoa. An interim working group has been implemented. It will make proposals in the next few days. The principle is therefore now established. We must insist, however, that this fund should start to operate in the coming weeks so that treatment gets to patients as soon as possible, and we must ensure that its statute and procedures are fair. What does this mean in specific terms? It means that the fund should be operational before 15 December, the deadline, so that the Commission can make its contribution to the 2001 budget, and so that the definitive structure of these funds and the composition of its statutory bodies respect the rule of equality between representatives from Northern and Southern States and also between the NGOs from these two areas. It also involves, and I will end here, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, clarifications on the contribution of the European Union. The Union committed itself in Genoa, as stated by Mr Prodi, to allocating a budget of EUR 120 million to the global health fund. This amount is not currently entered under any budget item. The Commission must confirm to us today that this amount will not come from and will not be deducted from other funds earmarked for development and that it is indeed an annual contribution that will be entered in the budget on the specific line from 2002. I thank you in advance for including these particular details.</p>

On the contrary. There is reason for calling upon all the EU countries to live up to their pledges in Gothenburg to increase their aid to the promised 0.7%. The EU is most certainly the world’s largest donor region, but that does not say as much about our own efforts as about the deficiencies of others. Even if we are not at present supposed to be criticising the United States but instead continuing to support them, it has to be said that the United States’ role in this context has not been particularly distinguished, to put it mildly. There is both their deficient contribution to the UN and the insufficient development aid they have provided. The issue of their contribution to the UN has now been sorted out, so we can hope that the issue of development aid will also be sorted out. Prevention is, of course, better than cure, and development aid is an effort at prevention. It is sad that it is so easy to get expenditure on military systems authorised and that it is so difficult to get expenditure on the preventative work of development aid authorised. We must be clear that, in our contemporary world with its TV channels, the very poorest people also know that there are very large inequalities in the world. In reality, it is amazing that they do not react more strongly than they in fact do. There is no doubt that the refugee ship we heard about this summer is only the first small portent of what is to come.</p>
<p class="contents">Following this introduction, I wish to turn to the rapporteur’s report and thank him for all the work he has put into this matter. Crisis conditions, to put it mildly, prevail in a long list of developing countries. A huge effort is therefore necessary when it comes to HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Anyone who has been in any doubt as to whether this can simply be left to private companies can no longer, after the debate that has been conducted in recent years, be in any doubt that an effort is required, partly from the donor countries. We cannot leave this to the free market. It has actually been rather humiliating to discuss this matter, but that is why it is all the more gratifying that the EU has now done something in this area and, for example, totally untied the funds, which means that developing countries can buy wherever it is best and cheapest to do so. We must not only concentrate on medicine. We must, of course, also concentrate on restructuring. It is incredibly important that we should ensure that people are helped to help themselves and that we should see to it that systems are devised for which developing countries themselves can take responsibility and which they can, above all, manage, including when we are not there to support them. Both medicines and infrastructure are required in this matter, and I would urge us to continue to make a major effort to help developing countries to help themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rod (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, given the millions of deaths in developing countries, the European Commission’s proposal for an action programme against communicable diseases in developing countries is a strong initiative that contributes to affirming the right to health on the international stage. If the European Union wishes to play a distinguished role in this fight and to make its action have a real impact, public health must become a priority for its cooperation in developing countries, and therefore be actually reflected in its budget. This is why we are opposed on this point to the rapporteur’s oral amendments. This is a shame, because we have done a great deal of preparatory work with Mr Khanbhai, in order to strengthen his initial resolution, and the votes of the Committee on Development and Cooperation enabled us to achieve a broad consensus. At the same time, the media coverage of the actions brought by the pharmaceutical industry and the United States against South Africa and Brazil, which produce or import generic anti-AIDS drugs, lifted the veil on the economic stakes and pushed the European Union to specifically commit itself to the side of those poor populations needing access to treatment. Although it makes sense to tackle the fight against tuberculosis, malaria and AIDS in a single programme, we do, however, need to distinguish between the specific problems posed by these three diseases. In the case of tuberculosis, although there is a vaccine for the prevention of this disease, its effectiveness is highly disputed and there is an ever-increasing amount of resistance to treatment. There is no vaccine for malaria and although drugs to treat the disease are inexpensive, they are decreasingly effective due to increased incidences of resistance. There is no vaccine for AIDS nor any treatment that is accessible to the people from the South, as the pharmaceutical laboratories that own the patents keep the prices at an exorbitant level.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we regret that diseases such as filariasis, trypanosomiasis, sleeping sickness, the Ebola virus or various forms of diarrhoea are not the subject of the Commission’s communication as they are causing an ever-increasing number of deaths.</p>
<p class="contents">Effective and coherent action against these diseases should therefore offer different solutions depending on the case, but also combine measures on several levels.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, prevention involves education and information campaigns, particularly aimed at at-risk groups, such as women and young people, conducted on the ground by influential local figures. For the prevention of AIDS, therefore, promoting the use of condoms is a public health duty. The best form of prevention remains the guarantee of good housing and working conditions, nutrition and health. Development policy as a whole and all Community policies should therefore contribute to the key objective of improving public health.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, we need a more general discussion about the environment. For example, by increasing the amount of stagnant water surfaces, damming policy has caused the number of parasite diseases to rocket.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is essential that we improve or even create health structures and train the staff required for the detection, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of these diseases. The European Community development aid programme, specifically within the framework of the EDF, should be focused on health services, which have been neglected for too long due to budgetary restrictions imposed by structural adjustment. The local health NGOs should be able to receive funds in order to carry out their day-to-day work of prevention and of supporting patients. They should be involved in drawing up aid programmes in this field and be incorporated into public health action.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, everyone should have access to treatment. This means that medication should be sold at cost price to people in developing countries. Another solution would be for these countries to have licences that authorise them to produce generic drugs. In fact, the only way to free the people of the South from the grip of the multinational firms on price fixing for drugs in the long term is to establish a regional or local pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The TRIP agreements should be interpreted in the same fashion, and should reaffirm the right of developing countries to use compulsory licences in the event of a health emergency. Pharmaceutical firms need to be made to respect human rights. In fact, following the media pressure over recent months, some of them are taking a greater interest and have promised to reduce their prices. These measures are isolated, however, limited to a few products for a few countries and will take time. Moreover, they are still rejecting the principle of compulsory licences. This rejection of compulsory licences forces us to question the duration of the protection of patents. We could also ask ourselves whether a reduction in the duration of patents is not, after all, an excellent stimulant for research.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we need to give new impetus to research, and this is a fundamental point. We need to find new preventive and curative treatments that are more effective, and more importantly better adapted to local populations. For this purpose, an international research centre on Southern diseases, financed by public and private funds, would enable us to completely free research from the purely mercenary interests of certain manufacturers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and this is what I believe to be the most important point in this debate, is the fact that we know that the very people in the South who are dying from these diseases are urgently waiting for our help, and have been for a long time. I think that we should broadly develop all of these structures. All these concerns have been largely incorporated into Mr Khanbhai’s report. This is why we call on you to vote in favour of the report, and we hope that all of these speeches will for once not go unheeded, because the people of the South need us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This seems to me to be a silent genocide that is hardly mentioned in the international press.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that some of the proposals in the report are very good, in the sense that these deaths will not be eradicated unless basic health services are available in each one of those countries and unless, as other Members have said, there is access to the treatments, to the medicines which can put an end to these illnesses. At present, they are not available. Therefore, the proposal for a Commission plan and also the proposal that we contribute to an international fund to fight against these diseases seems right to us.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I believe that we have to look into the deeper causes. The rapporteur rightly indicates in paragraph 13 of the resolution the fact that demanding structural changes of these countries sometimes prevents them from using sufficient public funds for the health services. It is an infernal vicious circle, because unless there are sufficient resources for these basic health services, for improving the people’s quality of life, for them to have access to housing, food and work, it will be difficult to eradicate these diseases. It is a vicious circle that causes a very large part of the population of the Third World countries to be in this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Mr President, that prevention, better quality of life for these people, access to medicines and access to a basic health service, as the report proposes, are essential elements for a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur also points out very clearly that it is necessary to increase development aid. It is already more than twenty years since the United Nations proposed that 0.7% of the GDP should be allocated to development. Today, only a few Nordic countries in Europe attain that 0.7%. The majority of European countries do not reach 0.7%. Some, like mine, do not give 0.25%. It is deplorable, because this development aid is vital precisely for these populations to be able to access basic health services.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end, Mr President, by recalling the multiplier effect that the participation of women may have in each of these programmes. As a member of the delegation for relations with the countries of Central America and Mexico, I was involved in projects financed by the European Union and I could see how the participation of native women in that zone had a multiplier effect, because women can help their daughters and their fellow women to learn. Therefore, the participation of women in these plans to eradicate these diseases is fundamental. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since then, however, nothing much has happened. The Commission has acknowledged the right of poor countries to issue compulsory licences, but what does the Commission intend to do to bring about the necessary transfer of technology so that poor countries themselves can produce medicine? Why have we not yet seen initiatives to enable African technicians in African factories to produce medicines to combat tuberculosis, malaria and HIV? Economically speaking, this is possible. We are not talking in terms of huge investments to start up local production. The necessary transfer of technology might, in addition, be envisaged in terms of allowing those employed in the medical sector in the EU to spend a couple of years in developing countries, working on such technology transfer programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial to improve the skills of doctors, scientists, nurses and technicians in the poorest countries. They must be involved in research and development, not by inviting them to European conferences – where they are likely to receive subsistence allowances – but by providing the institutions in which they work with equipment, training and communication facilities so that well-educated people living and working under incredibly difficult conditions are motivated to remain in their own countries. Five malaria vaccines have now been developed – an extremely important step, given the fact that malaria is the disease that kills most people. And what is the EU doing? True, we have plans to set up a European platform to test the vaccine, even if there is already a fully developed African platform. Does it not make sense for the vaccine to be tested by Africans in Africa, or are Africans only good enough to act as subjects of experiments by European scientists?</p>
<p class="contents">Let us forget all about setting up this European Clinical Trials Platform<span class="italic"> </span>and instead support the pan-African network, AMVTN, which is just about to be converted into a fund. It would save a huge amount of time and thus save millions of human lives, and it would save money. It would also show that we recognise other people’s right to take charge of their own destinies, and it would provide them with the necessary transfer of technology. It would be a fantastic first step on the way to taking action. We have heard enough fine, but empty, words. I should like, then, to thank Mr Khanbhai. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martelli (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, despite global growth over recent decades, progress remains inadequate and unequally distributed. Poverty, injustice and appalling conditions, from both a social and a health point of view, are still the bitter reality for many developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirty per cent of the world’s population live in conditions of extreme poverty, a situation exacerbated by continuous population growth and the inadequacy – or, rather, the decline – of policies for development aid, assistance and cooperation. Europe is a relative exception, but not to the extent of correcting a worldwide downward trend.</p>
<p class="contents">New challenges in the developing world, such as urbanisation, environmental degradation and pollution, local warfare and the scourge of AIDS, together with the previously unthinkable resurgence of malaria and TB, threaten to drive us back.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, I am suspicious of statistics, which all differ, anyway, between the various Directorates-General of the Commission, as we have seen, and not uncommonly seem subservient to ideological prejudices. There is no doubt, however, that the explosive growth of the richest countries has left the poorest countries even farther behind.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the indicators of poverty, that of women’s poverty stands out: the majority of poor people, the poorest of the poor, are women, just as most illiterate people are women and women continue to work more and to earn and count for less.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be difficult to deny or underestimate the importance of the link that still persists between poverty, disease, illiteracy and population growth, a link which has its most obvious proof in the scale of women’s poverty, the suffering of women and gender inequalities.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the reports of both the Commission and Parliament seem to me to be evasive, not to say reticent, on the subject of population. The reports concentrate on the fight against AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, going at length into sophisticated technical analyses and proposals for reforms, which may serve to improve our measures for combating poverty – especially on the question of drugs and health services – but do not propose any measures to improve the effectiveness of policies on population control, healthy and sustainable fertility, or free and informed maternity, as if this subject had disappeared from our view. Yet this is still the crucial issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us consider the facts: in purely numerical terms, never have so many people been torn by poverty as this year. Yet, because of the continuing population growth, today there are more poor people in the world than all those that have ever lived throughout history. Since the end of the last century, the world population has grown fourfold, from one and a half billion to six billion. The greatest growth has been in Asia: India, China, Indochina and, in particular, Indonesia.</p>
<p class="contents">The population trend in the rich countries is, conversely, now stationary, but the balance achieved depends on a longer life expectancy, which makes up for the slump in the birth rate.</p>
<p class="contents">Africa, in turn, has seen a population explosion, mainly due to the fall in infant mortality. This trend seems today to be more contained, not because population policies have been successful but because of epidemics, especially, as has been said, of AIDS, TB and malaria. Africa challenges us and moves us, but Africa is not the whole world and is itself diverse in its various parts. It certainly has more need than any other region of a population policy more concerned with the condition of women.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout the rest of the world, not only in the rich countries, population growth has slowed down somewhat over recent decades, but if you look more closely you will see both that the birth rate has fallen and that life expectancy has increased, and that means a population that is continuing to grow and which, in most situations, is ageing, as well as cases of overpopulation in certain regional and local areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, if we want to be more effective in fighting poverty, we cannot avoid or ignore the matter of population control. It is true that it is linked to economic and cultural growth, but we are not without suitable tools and appropriate experience in the field of prevention and contraception. History teaches us that there has never been so much growth and so much poverty. Experience shows that it is no use trying to dry out a flooded room without turning off the taps. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report draws specific attention to the triangle of poverty, health and education, no part of which can be ignored without action in the other two areas coming to nothing. Poverty has sometimes been compared to war: it takes prisoners and it kills. The only difference is that death from poverty is slow and the victim him/herself is branded as the culprit.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore also want to remind our Member States of the 0.7% target, to give some credibility to our calls for altruism in the pharmaceutical industry. I would particularly support the establishment of a global infectious disease fund and the introduction of compulsory licences to improve the availability of medicines. Both will take great initiative on the part of the EU and their successful implementation will require the goodwill of key global movers and shakers as well as institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In any action taken, however, it has to be borne in mind that, without viable basic health care, no other developments are possible. Good basic health in itself also prevents more dangerous infections, and it makes it easier to identify infections early on and stop them if basic health care has been provided for. We must not forget the importance of people’s attitudes: if there is not even any functional basic health care in place, apathy grows and then people cannot in all fairness be asked to take seriously infection risks that might develop into fatal illnesses in the years to come. No matter how fearful the prospects of communicable disease are, making us feel a spontaneous need to take specific action as a consequence, it should never be done at the expense of basic health care.</p>
<p class="contents">It can, therefore, be said with some justification that EU aid with regard to basic health care has been totally inadequate for a long time now. For that reason, doubling the EU’s financial aid resources for basic health care can be considered to be the most essential matter from the point of view of all the other objectives. We should bear in mind the Copenhagen Social Summit pledge to attain universal and equitable access to primary health care. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Access to medicines will be a key issue at Doha in a few weeks' time simply because developing countries feel hugely disadvantaged by rules which are applied universally, even though countries are of unequal strength, both economically and institutionally. They will be calling clearly for the TRIPS Agreement to be applied fairly. The global spotlight, therefore, will be firmly on the role played by pharmaceutical companies in the HIV/AIDS catastrophe.</p>
<p class="contents">Only 0.1% of the 25 million people living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa have access to lifesaving drugs or indeed for the drugs for the opportunistic infections such as meningitis, drug-resistant diarrhoea, oral thrush and those other infections. There are now alternatives – cheap copies of life-saving medicines. In Brazil, Thailand and India their laws allow them to ignore drug patents. In India for instance, companies are marketing a drug for the treatment of that drug-resistant diarrhoea, at 1.8% of the price charged in Pakistan where only the patented version can be bought. Four years ago Brazil waived the patent rights on HIV drugs and allowed local companies to produce cheap versions. Prices in Brazil have fallen by 80% and they have halved the number of deaths from HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">I come to the point made by Mr Khanbhai on research and development. If so much commitment is made by the pharmaceutical companies to R&amp;D, how come they actually spend twice as much on marketing as they do on research and development? According to the UNDP's recent figures less than 10% of global spending on health research addresses 90% of the global disease burden. Of the 1223 new drugs marketed between 1975 and 1996, only 13 of those drugs were developed to treat tropical diseases and only 4 of those 13 were the result of the pharmaceutical industry's research. And why is it that they charge more for the same drugs in Africa, than they charge in the northern hemisphere?</p>
<p class="contents">I would argue that these facts very clearly speak for themselves. They have – and this is a very important point to make and it will be made in Doha – a virtual monopoly which means that they can control prices. They are virtually saying "no" to cheap, affordable generics for very sick people in poor countries. Globalisation is meant to be about freer markets and about increased competition. The big four pharmaceutical companies act like a cartel: they bully developing countries and they deny them their rights to those drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">During the Uruguay Round they secured agreement on patent rights for 20 years. The TRIPS Agreement was a clear example of the powerful vested interests of the developed world at this time. All this threatens the whole credibility of the World Trade Organisation and any chance we have of believing in the developments at Doha, or if we ever have a new round of fair, multilateral trading systems. There is now a clear need for a clear and new interpretation of TRIPS allowing for the flexibility which clearly exists in that agreement. We need to ensure that it is the interests of poor countries that are put first. This is an issue of fundamental social justice.</p>

We have here a global problem of the highest order. Our own citizens who are HIV positive are able to access long-term treatment with effective medication. For patients in developing countries, the medicines are too expensive and the medical infrastructure to provide care for them is lacking. Also, if a patient is not disciplined in taking his medicines regularly and in the correct dosage, they lose their effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The pharmaceutical industry only lowered its prices under the heavy pressure of global public opinion, and those prices are still far too high. A further lowering of prices must be realised through industrial and government cooperation. Only a very broadly established, very expensive and dogged international campaign can effectively tackle this large-scale problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Khanbhai’s excellent report provides a clear overview of all the important aspects of the transmittable disease. We join him in welcoming the European Union’s campaign programme. It is well thought out and deserves to be carried out with the greatest urgency. May I ask the Commissioner whether he has sufficient personnel resources available for this? I advocate a very substantial provision in the budget over the coming years for the AIDS fund, without detriment to present provision for poverty relief. Does the Commissioner consider this feasible and can he also tell us the situation regarding the setting up of the fund?</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a requirement that the twenty-year patent protection term specified in the TRIPS Agreement be considerably reduced for essential medicines. The pharmaceutical industry must, of course, be able to continue investing in research into vaccines and cheap medicines, but must gain its profits in the rich countries and not in the epidemic-ridden Third World.</p>
<p class="contents">Results will not be achieved without large-scale information campaigns. Sexual behaviour and attitudes towards women, in particular, will have to change dramatically. Women’s right of self-determination is fundamentally at issue here.</p>
<p class="contents">A great responsibility also rests with the developing countries themselves, not only with the governments and the NGOs, but especially with the religious leaders who can wield moral authority. If they refuse to cooperate, they will be partly responsible for the misery. Only a collective effort can end the situation whereby millions of our fellow humans die, countless children are orphaned and economies are ruined needlessly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is appalling when we take account of the fact that three communicable diseases are killing five million people per year in poor countries and ten thousand people per day in Africa alone and that, moreover, the number of victims is increasing. This is very true in the case of AIDS, where there is no known cure, whereas there are cures available for tuberculosis and malaria. Despite this, malaria, which a few years ago appeared to be on course for total eradication has, as the report highlights, become the main cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa, whilst tuberculosis, for which there are simple and effective treatments, continues to be the disease most widespread throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The cause of this situation is simple. Drug manufacturing is monopolised by large pharmaceutical corporations, whose prime concern is not public health, but profit. The recent ignominious action brought by certain pharmaceutical corporations against South Africa is characteristic of this intolerable situation, even though public opinion did, to a certain extent, cause these corporations to back off. The report’s proposal that aims for the European Union to recognise on the international level the right of developing countries to produce and sell generic drugs within their countries, without costs resulting from intellectual property rights, is the least we can do. Another example of this would be to impose specifications on the pharmaceutical corporations obliging them to produce drugs for these diseases, which the report says are neglected by the industry because they are not profitable enough.</p>
<p class="contents">The report limits itself to mentioning a reduction in prices. Millions of people in poor countries will only be able to have access to minimum treatment if certain drugs, particularly malaria drugs, are free of charge. The report tries to reconcile the protection of patents with access to healthcare in developing countries; we reaffirm that industrial patents, and more specifically those patents involving the pharmaceutical industry, should be completely abolished. They do nothing to protect the intellectual property of the inventor, they only serve to guarantee the corporations a monopoly position and therefore the enormous profits that they earn to the detriment of public health and life itself.</p>
<p class="contents">The heading of the report says that the fight against infectious diseases contributes to poverty reduction. In fact, most of these diseases are diseases related to poverty, even to malnutrition. Only an improvement in people’s standard of living would be effective in eradicating most of them. Having said this, however, for the benefit of the advocates of the market economy and capitalism, the simple fact that it is organically incapable of providing the most basic treatment and daily food for a considerable proportion of humanity in the twenty-first century, even though it has scientific and material possibilities like never before, irreparably condemns it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More differentiation, more individual care, increased personal choice and especially improved efficiency have been the most important aims. Often these changes give rise to criticism, especially where the general availability of healthcare is concerned. To many of us, it is unacceptable on principle that a higher place on the waiting list should be for sale. This would mean that a person’s health would be governed by his income. And we do not want that.</p>
<p class="contents">It is all the more remarkable that the above situation is simply the harsh reality throughout the world. Indeed, the Commission proposals under discussion today demonstrate that the availability of adequate medicines to the poorest, despite repeated promises, still leaves much to be desired. There is much less indignation in the West concerning this. In a world of increasing globalisation, however, we cannot shirk our international responsibility. Our own healthcare problems are dwarfed by those of the majority of the world’s population.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore support the measures proposed. We will have to operate on two levels to combat these diseases. In the first place, by participating on a micro level in healthcare improvement projects. As far as I am concerned, these projects could be funded and executed via bilateral channels. The European Union could play an important role with larger infra-structural projects which involve NGOs from several Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In the second place, by creating on a macro level the necessary conditions to facilitate those projects on a micro level. Policy direction is an important instrument here. I particularly welcome, therefore, the paragraphs on the TRIPS and the WTO in the European Parliament’s resolution. Especially since they provide the European Union with an important task. I only need to see a concrete reference to the forthcoming meetings in Qatar. I hope that the Commissioner responsible will nevertheless carry out our recommendations at that conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not, of course, but changing lifestyles and the arrival of effective drug regimes have, at least, helped us turn a corner on the long road that we walk. The forecasts when I was health minister fighting these issues were not the same as the forecasts now.</p>
<p class="contents">But in the South the picture is very different. Ninety-five per cent of the five million new cases every year are in low-income countries in the South. There are 25 million people living with AIDS in Africa and 6 million in the new-growth area in Asia – South and Southeast Asia in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Where AIDS is concerned we face a vicious cycle of infection, incapacity and poverty alongside the 16 million deaths we have already seen: two million deaths a year in Africa, a quarter of all Africa's deaths. Ten per cent of people between fifteen and fifty years of age are living with AIDS, and there are 10 million orphans. The people who expected to be looked after in their old age are now unable to have that care and support because their children are dead. That is the scene confronting us.</p>
<p class="contents">When <span class="italic">The Economist</span> went to Zambia and looked at a particular hospital, it saw two-thirds of the patients there dying of AIDS. People's limbs, they reported, looked like broken broomsticks. When they were asked what they were desperate for, they did not say retroviral drugs, they said food, because they were too poor to be able to afford either. Poverty hastens death, and deaths accelerate the survivors' descent into poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">In Zambia the department of health then estimated that half the population would die of AIDS. That is a human disaster. We are facing human disasters in America now. The world is looking at the headlines, the world is taking action, governments are coming together, people are demanding and subscribing to solutions. But they are not doing that where AIDS, TB and malaria are concerned. It is not terrorism, but it is a health terror and horror that is preventable. That is why the honourable Member's report is so important and fundamental. I congratulate him and the Commission on the work that has been done on this matter and everyone who has participated.</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty reduction goes hand in hand with the war against disease, disability and death. We desperately need more resources for drugs and vaccines, but must also ensure their adequate distribution to people, so that drugs do not sit in storage deteriorating. We must have adequate education, monitoring and research. It has rightly been said that research should be conducted in Africa, by Africans, for Africans and, where appropriate, with the support, cooperation and partnership of the Western world, along the lines of the IAVI initiative between Oxford and Nairobi.</p>
<p class="contents">TB too, of course, is a killer. It accounts for two million deaths a year, 95% of them in developing countries; it is the leading cause of HIV deaths; one infected person can pass it on to ten others. Malaria is the third killer; 90% of deaths from Malaria occur in Africa – one death every 30 seconds. In the past four minutes, eight people have died from malaria. I want us and the Commissioner to keep those people who are dying of these diseases in mind and see what we can do. The honourable Member has provided the words in this report; now it is time for the Commission to act.</p>

It is a proven fact that countries with a high standard of health and generous investment in this area achieve higher levels of development, including economic development. Some of us have already observed that we must persuade the governments in these countries to spend more on this area of healthcare and education, and I naturally underline this political demand as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet it would be cynical in the extreme if we failed to point out that the structural adjustment programmes which must be undertaken by these countries to secure loans and funding from the international financial institutions now require them to spend less on prevention, public health and education. One point which is very important, in my view, is the involvement of women in devising birth control programmes and other reproductive health campaigns. Women – and I am not saying anything new – are extremely vulnerable to poverty. Furthermore, as the HIV/AIDS infection rates in southern Africa show, women are also affected by this disease to a far greater extent than men.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say a few words about one of the most pressing issues addressed in the Khanbhai report, namely the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). I believe that in future, too, the European Union must assist the developing countries to benefit from the opportunities already afforded by the TRIPS agreement. Naturally, this is set forth in the provisions of the TRIPS agreement, but has not always been accepted by the pharmaceutical industry, as the case of South Africa shows. In my view, the proposal outlined in paragraph 41 of the Khanbhai report on reducing the period of patent protection is essential. I believe that when we talk about poverty, we must also identify tangible measures for the reform of the WTO. Otherwise, we will also lose credibility. As many of the previous speakers have pointed out, it is high time we took practical steps in this direction.</p>

Shortly after that pronouncement some frightening statistics were published; every 24 hours, 35 000 human beings died of hunger in the world. In two years, hunger caused more deaths than the two world wars put together.</p>
<p class="contents">The year 2000 arrived and the situation has only got worse. According to the World Health Organisation, extreme poverty – misery – is the chief cause of suffering in the world and is also the one which each year claims the greatest number of human lives and yet we are still talking about poverty and how we are going to remedy it.</p>
<p class="contents">A few months ago, before the summer, at our Brussels headquarters, the United Nations together with the EU organised the Third Conference on the Least-developed Countries dedicated in particular to analysing the causes, consequences and solutions of poverty. We also set an ambitious target: to reduce poverty by half by the year 2005. Some studies lead to the conclusion, Mr President, that by what we are doing, with the plans and projects we intend to carry out and above all, with the resources we allocate and those which are intended to be allocated, that objective cannot be met.</p>
<p class="contents">Our concern now is to combat the international terrorism fostered by some notorious fanatics. True, that is the problem of the moment but, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the root of the problem. The problem is poverty throughout a large part of the world. Until we solve the problem of poverty, especially the extreme poverty – misery – in which hundreds of millions, around 1 500 million human beings, and I am using cautious figures, live, we will continue to be exposed to situations such as those we are experiencing now.</p>
<p class="contents">Between 13 and 19 September some of us were visiting some of the poorest regions of the planet, in the south of the African continent. Mozambique today has 19 million inhabitants but within 9 years only 13 million will still be alive; the remaining 6 will have died of Aids.</p>
<p class="contents">Today Mr Khanbhai in his report proposes a series of measures to combat Aids, malaria and tuberculosis in the context of reducing poverty. During a visit to a field hospital way out in the middle of the African savannah, my colleagues and I witnessed how victims of a cholera epidemic are dying – believe me, right now – in a Dante-esque spectacle such as occurred in Europe in the Middle Ages.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also happening at other hospitals which are not in the middle of nowhere. In Mocuba, there is a provincial hospital where women give birth next to patients with Aids, tuberculosis, leprosy, meningitis, and infectious diarrhoeas of all kinds.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these diseases which today can be cured and eradicated, there are drugs. It is a problem of resources, and above all, it is a problem of political will.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Khanbhai, I congratulate you and thank you for the important contribution you have made in your report. But, Mr Bashir, you know your native Africa better than I do. Let us make no mistake, the problems of poverty in the world are today of such magnitude that these measures, with the present resources, are like a drop in the ocean. Some day we will realise this. Either we fight against poverty with all our energy and all our resources until we conquer it, or poverty with its many faces – now taking the form of terrorism – will conquer us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should just like to add one fact: in the UK and Europe drugs cocktails have decreased AIDS deaths by 75%, in sub-Saharan Africa, where two-thirds of all people infected with HIV live, only one person in a thousand receives drug treatment. Education is crucial to prevent people being infected with HIV in the first place, but access to drugs really does make a difference.</p>
<p class="contents">The drug companies are our partners. But it is crucial that they act with integrity. I will never forget the representative for SmithKline Beecham sitting in our EU/ACP Joint Assembly in Brussels, banging the table and saying that they had lowered the prices of essential medicines. And then later in the year Mr Nielson was told they were going to lower them all over again. Which is the lowest price – the one they told us in the spring, or the one they told us in the autumn?</p>
<p class="contents">I went to Gabon and South Africa and met doctors who are desperate to use those drugs, who have read the Internet press releases saying that the prices have been brought down; yet when they ring up they cannot actually acquire the drugs to treat those patients.</p>
<p class="contents">I have asked SmithKline Beecham what is the genuine, long-term cost of production of these drugs. They will not say. I have asked them how long they will commit themselves to these lower prices. They will not commit themselves. I have asked them why, if they are seeking a partnership with developing country governments, they face legal action, not just in South Africa but in India, Brazil and elsewhere. They just will not answer.</p>
<p class="contents">We send a clear message to the drugs companies in this resolution: prices are too high and legislative action, including compulsory licensing in cases of national emergency, is needed to deal with it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to Mr Khanbhai, it is no good claiming that you are seeking consensus, including NGOs for example, and then putting forward your Amendment No 1, opposing a reduction in patent protection. Name one NGO which supports that position.</p>
<p class="contents">I will always remember that SmithKline Beecham's key anti-retroviral drug was not brought onto the market because of privately-funded research. It was publicly-funded research. They used a dormant patent to acquire that protection for their own commercial gain. Let us have some clear speaking in this debate.</p>

In Africa, 10 000 people die every day from AIDS, malaria or tuberculosis. Why is there not a similar response? Regrettably, the harsh truth is that the developed world does not place the same value on human life in Africa. It is a terrible indictment on all of us who live in the world's richest countries that this scale of human tragedy continues to occur into the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">Several years ago malaria seemed close to being eliminated, today it is the most common cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa. Tuberculosis is the most prevalent disease in the world, and 35 million people are infected with AIDS, with half of all new HIV infections occurring in the 15-24 year-old age group.</p>
<p class="contents">I acknowledge that the EU Commission contributed EUR 4.2 billion for health assistance during the 1990s. However, as the rapporteur pointed out, although EUR 700 million were allocated for health in 1998, the amount for 1996-1998 was only 4% of the total EU development budget. This indicates how low down it has been on the list of our political priorities. I hope this will now change with the publication of the new policy framework by the Commission and its proposed programme of action for the years 2001-2006. Its three-prong strategy of better deployment of existing resources, increasing the affordability to people in poorer countries of key drugs, and support for more research is indeed welcome. However, the proposals need to be developed further and underpinned by a greater financial commitment, indicative of a greater political priority.</p>
<p class="contents">The best means of achieving this is by taking on board the excellent proposals put forward by the rapporteur, Mr Khanbhai. His call for the EU to devote 10% of our development aid to tackling this problem, his emphasis on preventative action with the 15-24 year-old age group in relation to AIDS, and his proposal for a global fund for infectious diseases and the establishment of an EU research agency should be the cornerstone of any new EU policy in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has been made quite clear during today's debate. A holistic strategy is therefore required to combat them. Tackling poverty is one approach, but I would like to focus on other priorities which I believe are equally important: information and education, prevention, and of course treatment. These are the three areas which must be considered if we want to make progress, particularly in Africa, where the problem is most acute.</p>
<p class="contents">This means providing information and sex education for children and young people, for without a change in sexual behaviour, the problem cannot be mastered. A proportion of the available resources must therefore be allocated for this purpose too.</p>
<p class="contents">The sexually active population must have the opportunity to practise prevention. I should particularly like to mention Senegal as a positive example, where religious and political leaders have worked together to halt the spread of AIDS through prevention. A similar approach has also been adopted in Uganda. If politicians and a country's spiritual leaders work together on this issue, a great deal can be achieved. The Côte d'Ivoire, for example, has therefore appointed a Minister for AIDS and HIV. I believe that these are models which deserve our support.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another important problem, which is how to prevent the sick from being ostracized. This is a major problem. We must dismantle social taboos and not only ensure that those who are living with infection receive the medication they need, but also encourage their positive integration into society. This is the only way to create a climate which ultimately halts the spread of disease in a holistic way.</p>

<p class="contents">In the eight months since the Commission adopted an ambitious programme for action targeting the major communicable diseases, a number of events have reconfirmed the need for action, for the global mobilisation of efforts and financing, and for the political will to achieve our aims. Health is fully on our agenda now, and the same is true of our own Member States. Health in developing countries is, together with education, one of the six priorities for the Commission for 2002. Investing in health is a key strategy for economic development and poverty reduction, and hence a crucial component of a sound development strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to highlight and express my strong agreement with the remarks made by Mrs Korhola and Mr Bowis on the need to organise basic health care in a manner that actually works. In this regard we should bear in mind that annual per capita spending on public health services in sub-Saharan Africa is between USD 2 and USD 6. This is the economic framework before us. Reconciling the low capacity of health systems with, in particular, care and work on administering anti-retroviral drugs to AIDS and HIV-positive patients is an extremely difficult task.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention one case that illustrates this. In Botswana USD 100 million has been mobilised jointly by Merck, one of the big pharmaceutical companies, and the Bill Gates Foundation. They are doing everything they can to organise their work on the ground and use these advanced types of medicine in ongoing treatment. Their experience is that very little has been possible. The absence of infrastructure in this area, of educated nurses and of the conditions required for these types of advanced medicine, which are very difficult to administer, to work, shows that even concentrated, well-funded efforts spanning one-and-a-half years in a place that is better organised than most others in Africa has not done the trick. This is also why the pharmaceutical companies are warning against highlighting too uncritically the use of anti-retroviral drugs as the solution. That warning has to be taken seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">Our programme for action has been moving forward. We are speeding up the actual disbursement rate in the field of health. I would not go as far as to express satisfaction at this, but the situation is improving. We are disbanding dormant projects and improving projects that need to be improved. All this work is taking place.</p>
<p class="contents">Now a few remarks on financial allocations. Firstly, I appreciate the remarks made today by Mr Khanbhai concerning the mechanics of how we allocate this money. We would like to get away from input-related targets. They are advantageous in being easier to communicate regularly; however, we are seeking to focus on output and processes rather than on input. An important aspect of this debate is the fact that the budget does not reveal directly how much we are actually doing in areas such as health and education. It must be borne in mind that macroeconomic support, our budget support, is in fact linked to health and education. That link provides the answer as to how much – or how little – we are doing. At present it is extremely difficult to quantify this specifically but we are working on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Khanbhai also referred to a change relating to the import of drugs and the need to abolish tariffs in this regard. This is definitely something that must be done. It should be borne in mind that liberalisation on a regional basis, which we are urging our partners to move forward on, is also an answer to this problem. Furthermore it can solve the problem of creating a better basis for starting up medicine production in developing countries. If you cannot access a neighbouring market from a given African country investing there in order to do something in this area is not a good idea.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of access to medicines, an issue brought up by many, is currently being discussed at the TRIPS Council in Geneva. The discussions have sought to strike a balance between the need to pursue access to affordable medicines and the implementation of the TRIPS Agreement. A declaration for the ministerial meeting in Doha is now being prepared. May I state most clearly that the EC has no intention of applying pressure on or criticising developing countries that invoke their rights under the TRIPS Agreement. It is in the interest of all WTO members that the TRIPS provisions be clear, so as to provide for lawful and correct implementation of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">As to paragraph 41 on Mr Khanbhai's report, the current review process within the TRIPS Council of certain provisions does not include the patent periods, nor the so-called "ever-greening" of patents mentioned in the report. It is not the opinion of the Commission that the patent period needs to be amended.</p>
<p class="contents">On the second issue, "ever-greening", there are no provisions in the TRIPS Agreement that could be applied here. The substance and level of invention for the granting of a patent is evaluated by national patent authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to make a few remarks on the other paragraphs. Ninety-five percent of drugs listed as essential drugs by WHO are off patents and may be produced freely. The remaining 5% are drugs patented in most countries. It is the Commission's view that compulsory licenses should be issued in accordance with the rules laid down in Article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement. Tiered pricing, in the sense that pharmaceutical companies voluntarily offer their products at heavily discounted prices to developing poor markets, is something the Commission strongly supports. It was one of the sticking points in the discussion of the guidelines for the health fund.</p>
<p class="contents">We are working towards a global system of tiered pricing that will supply markets on a sustainable basis. Supplying poor markets at the lowest possible prices should be the rule. This should comprise all essential and key medicines. Of course, if large quantities of tiered price products are exported to developing countries, the risk of trade diversion becomes high. Therefore we are considering stronger measures to prevent the re-importation of tiered-price products into the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">In paragraph 38 the report calls for the establishment of a fund for infectious diseases. You will all be aware that this Global AIDS and Health Fund was launched by the UN Secretary-General at the special session on HIV/Aids in June. On behalf of the Commission President Prodi pledged EUR 120 million to the fund. Total contributions have now reached USD 1.8 billion. We are actively involved in working out the operational modalities for the fund, its governance, legal basis and its focus.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with what a few of the speakers said concerning the situation of women. The whole agenda concerning reproductive and sexual health and rights needs to be kept in mind whenever we discuss these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Sandbæk mentioned the issue of testing. I want to clarify that we are working on testing in Africa ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The President called for order to allow the speaker to be heard )</span></p>
<p class="contents">I feel confident that those Members who really want to hear what I have to say are definitely trying to do so. I thank them from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the activity of the Commission in the area of research, the reality is that we are proving quite successful in the attempt to organise a big Africa-focused network and to carry out testing as part of the whole research and development process. This is progressing quite well.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject of the Global AIDS and Health Fund was touched upon by many speakers. I want to give some additional information here.</p>
<p class="contents">We are involved in discussions on the modalities of the fund and there are still a few differences that need to be resolved. They concern the balance between prevention and care, especially in relation to HIV/AIDS. They concern the question to what extent the fund should supply anti-retrovirals, whether the fund should also cover research activities, the structure of tendering in the fund, and its focus in terms of geography.</p>
<p class="contents">Many issues are therefore, being discussed now. As a background to this discussion we also note that there is a section within the NGO community that sees the fund as a distraction from longer-term development processes, in particular support for strengthening the health systems. In my view, these words of warning have to be taken seriously. There are still many questions to resolve before it becomes clear what real added value the fund will create, especially in the most important area of improving delivery on the ground, which is still the biggest challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank the rapporteur, Mr Khanbai. We look forward to working – as we have done until now – hand-in-hand with Parliament and keeping up the pressure to move this agenda forward.</p>
