<p class="contents">Mr President, today is International Women’s Day, which coincides with the 20th anniversary of the existence and achievements of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities of our Parliament, which provides a very good opportunity to take stock of and evaluate our policy on gender equality. Without doubt, important progress has been made over the last twenty years in all sectors, thanks to the political initiatives taken at parliamentary and national level and the initiatives taken by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities of the European Parliament, and I should like to take this opportunity to thank President Cox for his support.</p>
<p class="contents">The participation of women in the European Parliament rose from 6% of the appointed Parliament to 16% in 1979, when the first elections were held, and to 31% in 1999. We are aiming for and hoping that this percentage will increase still further in the forthcoming elections in the enlarged Europe of the 25. Gender equality and the full realisation of the productive potential of women are now recognised by all as the <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>to achieving the Lisbon strategy and to strengthening our participative democracy. Without doubt over the last 20 years, the greatest progress has been made in the participation and performances of women at all levels of education, given that today they account for 55% of graduates in the European Union. Nonetheless, despite the undisputed achievements, significant differences and discrepancies continue to exist between the two sexes in all sectors, as stated in the Commission’s first annual report, which will be discussed at the spring European Council in a few days’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">Violence against women, trafficking in human beings, unemployment, incompatibility between professional and private life, inadequate care facilities for children and the elderly, inequalities in pay and promotion are burning issues which urgently need to be resolved, in that they relate directly both to the infringement of rights and to the sustainability and competitiveness of the economy. Unfortunately, it is with concern and sadness that we note that numerous Member States, despite having incorporated all the Community directives into their national legislation, do not show willing to promote flanking measures which would result in the abolition of inequalities. It is disappointing that numerous Member States hardly even follow the Council’s recommendations. Looking back over the last five years, the review of the directive on equal treatment in the workplace and the promotion of gender mainstreaming were an important milestone in promoting equal opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, because we cannot talk of equality of the sexes only in the workplace, we welcome the initiative by Mrs Diamantopoulou for a new directive based on Article 13 of the Treaty, which will ban any discrimination in access to goods and services. It is a fact that, with our joint efforts and within the framework of the future European constitution, we can slowly but surely bridge the gender gap in the Union and act as a shining example to the rest of the world, to areas of the planet in which women are still fighting for their fundamental human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">As we approach the tenth anniversary of the UN World Conference in Beijing in 1995, where 180 governments agreed on a joint action platform in order to promote women’s rights, we find that those commitments have not been honoured. Women still account for 70% of the poor in the world, girls in sub-Saharan Africa are six times more at risk than boys of infection with the HIV virus, four million women and children are victims of violence and sexual exploitation; at the same time, women only hold 15.2% of parliamentary seats. That is why, including within the framework of the new challenges being created by the development of technology and the globalisation of the economy, we need to renew and step up action on women’s rights in the aim of achieving democratic and participative global intergovernmentalism which will safeguard the fair distribution of the resources of the planet, sexual equality and sustainable development for everyone. We can discuss this at a new conference, which we shall call ‘Beijing +10’ and for which we await the relevant initiative by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I should like to ask you to reply to the topical questions which I shall put to you. First, what are the specific results of the work by the team of Commissioners for the promotion of equality? Secondly, does the Commission agree to the appointment of a Commissioner, the main item in whose portfolio will be gender equality? Also, although the Council representatives are not here, we have asked the Council to request that the Member States submit a list of three candidate Commissioners who represent both sexes, in order to achieve a balanced composition of the new Commission from the gender point of view. This proposal has already been submitted by the Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Karamanou has alluded to the many things we have achieved since Finland, a century ago, became the first country in Europe to give women the vote; the results have been many, they alone count, and not one of them just happened; women always had to fight hard for them.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking as the rapporteur on the Daphne programme, I would describe the situation facing us today as the tip of an iceberg; I refer to the trial of Marc Dutroux, a case that we can expect to disclose a veritable morass of violence against women and children. One might say that we can see the initiative that led to the Daphne programme ten years ago, at a time when Dutroux’ crimes came to light, now forming a direct link with the programme’s second stage, aimed at preventing and combating violence against children, young people and women. This second stage, running from 2004 to 2008, is accompanied by a substantial increase in resources, and I have to remind you that we now have EUR 10 million per annum as against EUR 5 million per annum in the first stage. Although this is still a mere drop in the ocean, doubling the annual budget in this way is urgently necessary, as Daphne I was able to fund only 13% of the good projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Much of the knowledge gained from the first stage of Daphne was incorporated into the new programme. We had a long battle with the Commission and the Council to get a helpdesk set up for NGO’s seeking help from the programme for the first time, especially those in the new Member States, where the structures of NGOs for women are still very weak. What is now Amendment No 5 is a form of words to which the Council can agree, and I hope that we will soon have an agreement on this.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft report also includes a proposal to declare 2006 the European Year Against Violence, to inaugurate a wide-ranging public debate aimed at developing further initiatives to halt the advance of the deadly virus of violence. I am able to mention only a few of them: there has been a dramatic increase in trafficking in women, and, according to the International Organisation for Migration, 500 000 women have been smuggled into the European Union in order to be sexually exploited and forced into prostitution. That figure has now risen to 800 000, and the well-organised criminal slave trading rings – for that is what I call them – do not shrink from trafficking in children as well.</p>
<p class="contents">One of our amendments deflected a Council proposal to the effect that the Daphne II programme should concentrate more on offenders. We did not see why resources that were in any case meagre should be taken away from the victims, and offenders identified as a target group. More to the point, the preventive measures under Daphne I already facilitate work with offenders and victims and bring the two together. Informal dialogue between the Council, the Commission and my committee made it possible for us to agree on proposals, which we put to the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities as amendments. If we were to find a broad majority to support these amendments tomorrow, it would send a clear message to women – and not only to women, but also to organisations in Europe, that we are joining battle against violence, and that we will not stand idly by while gangs of criminals make billions.</p>
<p class="contents">My thanks go to the Commission, above all to Commissioner Vitorino, and to the Irish and Italian presidencies of the Council for their cooperation; I hope that we can expect broad support for these five amendments tomorrow, and that the Common Position, as thus amended, can then enter into force without delay, for the programme for the necessary task of combating violence is urgently needed.</p>

It is therefore a privilege today to be able to present and discuss my own report on this issue. Today, 8 March, is most appropriate because it marks International Women’s Day and because this year, 2004, has been designated International Year of the Family.</p>
<p class="contents">We are well aware that professional life, family life and private life are all aspects of our lives but at the same time, they form three complementary lives. Promoting equality between men and women is a key Community task, which entails the need to compensate for the disadvantages faced by women as regards conditions of access to and participation in the labour market, and the disadvantages faced by men as regards conditions for participation in family life.</p>
<p class="contents">In the 1990s, this area received a substantial boost and a great deal of Community legislation was implemented in this field. Member States’ policies, however, lack coherence. Against this backdrop, two issues must be examined: firstly, the demographic challenge. On the one hand, the ageing of the population requires a greater influx of human resources into the labour market and access to this market must be equal for both men and women. On the other hand, there is a need for family policies that favour demographic growth. The second issue is the challenge of economic growth, which requires measures that provide incentives for women’s participation in the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">Making policies coherent above all requires a balance to be struck between these two issues. Without this balance, they will remain at odds with one another and reconciling professional, family and private lives will be seriously endangered. I believe the key point in this issue is that women must always be free to choose between working when they have children or staying at home. Measures must, therefore, be in place to enable women to make this choice without their careers or their family and private lives suffering as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">The diversity of situations must be emphasised and taken into account. I wish to highlight the fact that in the EU, one woman in six between the ages of 25 and 54 is not in paid employment, in other words, is neither employed nor unemployed, because of family responsibilities or because she is not able to reconcile professional and family life. Obstructing or hampering women’s entry into the labour market is a factor for lower productivity in Europe. The disparities between Member States from northern Europe and those from the south speak for themselves. We must focus on the good practices employed by our partners in Denmark, Sweden and Finland, who have the highest rates of female employment. In Sweden, women have a large choice of crèches. Denmark devotes 3.8% of its national wealth to family policies, more than any other European country and its birth rate stands at 1.73%, also one of the highest in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">All of the parties involved in this field, families, national, local and regional authorities and the social partners, must be involved. The Lisbon conclusions state that the balanced participation of men and women in professional and family lives, which is in the interest of men as well as of women, is a key factor for progress in society, with maternity, paternity and children’s rights being extremely important social values that must be protected by society, by the Member States and by the European Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Genuine equality between women and men in both the public and private domains must be accepted by society as a prerequisite for democracy, a requirement for citizenship and as a guarantee for individual autonomy and freedom, which should be reflected in all EU policies. The objectives of the Lisbon and Barcelona European Councils throw down major challenges to the European Union and call for innovative measures. I shall confine myself to suggesting a few: the current Member States and those about to join must monitor the impact of their policies on families. The innovative concept of ‘family mainstreaming’ must be viewed as distinct from the concept of gender mainstreaming. Businesses must be made aware of reconciling professional and family lives as a right pertaining to their employees, as a social obligation and as an essential tool for promoting higher productivity.</p>
<p class="contents">In conjunction with the social partners, a guide to good practice must be drawn up for companies, which also publicises success stories. The organisation of work, specifically promoting part-time work, reduced working hours and teleworking could be one solution. Setting up Internet sites containing databases of services useful to workers and publicising existing support structures, informing employers and providing incentives for them to establish or maintain social support structures that facilitate the reconciliation of family and professional lives, granting firms tax exemptions or reductions, providing assistance, for example in the form of cash benefits or vouchers (childcare vouchers, vouchers for the recruitment of home helps, etc, special support for single-parent families and for single mothers, specifically in terms of taxation, family support and family credits. These are all ambitious measures that are much needed, because we must make progress in this field. As rapporteur, therefore, I should like to ask the Commission to put in place the necessary mechanisms for drafting a framework directive on reconciling professional, family and private lives, so as to ensure that all Member States, current and future, have the appropriate tools and responses with which to meet the challenges of equal opportunities, economic growth and the demographic challenge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karamanou (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">deputising for the rapporteur.</span> <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, it is an honour for me to present the very important report on the situation of women from minority groups in the European Union on behalf of the rapporteur, Mrs Elena Valenciano, who is unable to be present at today’s sitting.</p>
<p class="contents">The report refers to three minority groups: disabled women, migrant women and Roma women, and focuses on the problem of the cloak of silence which hides their situation. These women remain in the shadows, in that they are hiding behind the men who belong to their groups. In order to make a more accurate analysis, the rapporteur proposes different actions for the minority groups referred to in the report, such as, for example, the development of statistics and the carrying out of a specific study, the involvement of these women in decision-making procedures, the promotion of information technology, training and education and protection of their sexual and reproductive health.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur thanks these organisations of the three minorities for their support to women and for the good cooperation which she had while drafting this report.</p>
<p class="contents">First, as far as disabled women are concerned, there are 44 600 000 people with disabilities in the European Union, which is 15.7% of European citizens, set to rise to 25% as the European Union enlarges. It is estimated that women account for 51% of the overall disabled population. However, there is a basis for thinking that this percentage could be higher: 53%, rising to 58% by 2015. Compared to the 55% of able-bodied women in employment, only 25% of disabled women work. It is usually a job of inferior status, low paid and with fewer advantages than are enjoyed by disabled men. The problem is that there is no career guidance designed to meet the specific needs of disabled women. Violence is not only a frequent occurrence in the lives of disabled women, but on many occasions the very cause of the disability. It is estimated that violence is the main cause of death and disability worldwide, ahead of cancer, road accidents or even war, for women aged between 16 and 45.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in relation to migrant women, according to UN overall figures from 1990 – unfortunately we do not have more recent data – there are 12 million migrant women in Europe. This number is, of course, continuing to rise, even though no precise data are available. Poverty and social instability are central factors in the lives of migrant women. Difficulty in gaining access to the labour market as a result of cultural and linguistic barriers, the lack of recognition of their professional qualifications, stereotypes and prejudice, racism and the disregard for their rights keep female immigrants confined to the lower ranks of the labour market or to the black economy, or dependent on men for their survival. Many of these women remain at home working as carers and cleaners, stuck in the traditional female role with the resulting social isolation and lack of access to basic social services, and marginalised in the process of upward social mobility, which creates a chain reaction of social exclusion. The closing of borders and restrictions on immigration increase the role of unofficial networks and the profits made by mafia-style networks that traffic in human beings. In the case of women who are victims of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation, the granting of temporary residence permits must be encouraged.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Roma women are concerned, there are approximately 8 to 10 million Roma in Europe, although the still traditionally nomadic nature of this people means current figures are unreliable. The figures in use should therefore be treated with caution. The population census puts the percentage of Roma women at 51%, which is comparable to the figure for women in general. There is a high birth rate among the Roma population as well as high rates of adult and infant mortality. The women usually marry very young and bear their first child earlier than in other ethnic groups. Life expectancy is 13 and 17 years shorter for Roma men and women respectively than for the rest of the population. A high birth rate combined with a high mortality rate makes for a mostly young Roma population. 80% are younger than 34, whilst 43% are under 14 years.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take advantage of today’s International Women’s Day to decide to turn our attention and thoughts to and take specific action in connection with these women from minority groups in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a day not only to celebrate but also to reflect.</p>
<p class="contents">What are we celebrating? Certainly the progress we have made towards gender equality in the European Union and also our solidarity with women around the world in all countries, remembering in particular those living in conflict and poverty whose rights are violated daily. We must also reflect on how far we have really progressed. That may make us wonder whether we really have so much to celebrate.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is on the eve of an historic enlargement and we are about to become a Union of 450 million people, more than half of whom are women and girls. Yet we still cannot say that women in general enjoy the same status as men in European societies. Nor are they properly represented at national and international decision-making levels. Violence and trafficking in women or, rather, sex slavery – which is the real word for it – remain scourges that we have not been able to tackle effectively enough.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it is true that we have made considerable progress in the last 50 years, with the European Parliament being a key player. We have to build on those achievements and ensure that the recently proposed equal-treatment legislation outside the labour market will become European law. We must do everything in our power to ensure a balanced representation of women in the next European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Gender equality goes hand in hand with democracy at all levels. Women's rights are human rights. Freedom from discrimination embodied in the Charter of Fundamental Rights is the cornerstone of democracy. But democracy requires more than an absence of discrimination: it needs governance. Good governance means sharing the power to make decisions in politics, economic and social life, public administration and in the home. We still have a long way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall start by answering Mrs Karamanou. The Commission discussed the results of its activities to promote gender equality at the meeting of the Group of Commissioners on Equal Opportunities last Wednesday. We were both there. This meeting is arranged every year, It is chaired by President Prodi and attended by Members of this Parliament, also the Council presidency, the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee, Commissioners responsible for the issues on the agenda, the chairpersons of the European Women's Lobby and the Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men.</p>
<p class="contents">I would stress that the Group of Commissioners has an important role to play in raising the visibility of gender-equality policies and it has been actively promoting gender equality in several areas. The Commission can claim several successes in this area. One recent example is the adoption in November 2003 of the proposal for a new directive on discrimination based on sex in the area of access to and supply of goods and services. Another example is the first report on equality between women and men, requested by Heads of State and Government for the Spring Council, which was adopted by the Commission on 19 February. This report sets out the challenges ahead, as well as policy orientations for the future, in particular in relation to a new enlarged Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it should be noted that in its latest spring report the Commission calls on Heads of State and Government to commit themselves to adopting the new anti-discrimination directive before March 2005 and this proves clearly that gender equality remains a top priority on the agendas of the Council and Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from the modernisation and extension of legislation, the Commission has pursued the promotion of gender equality in the framework of the European employment strategy and of the social policy agenda. Gender mainstreaming – incorporating gender equality in all policy fields and at all stages of policy-making – has started to be implemented, along with other measures, both in Member States and at EU level. This is reflected not only in specific objectives and guidelines in the open method of coordination in the areas of employment, social inclusion and social protection, but also in efforts to close gender gaps in education, training and research. This approach is included in the steering documents on the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also undertaken concrete initiatives to improve the implementation of gender mainstreaming in development and external relations policy. Furthermore, it applies a proactive staff policy within its own services. Apart from this, an intensive exchange of views between the European Parliament and the Commission concerning the implementation of gender budgeting has taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Mrs Karamanou's second question, the current Commission cannot make any commitment on how the new Commission will organise its work and what the main issues of the portfolios will be. However, the fundamental commitment to promote gender equality in European policies and measures will not change. Nevertheless, a high-level mechanism dealing horizontally with equality is fundamental, as it ensures high-level leadership. A top-down approach – which is also necessary – enhances visibility of equality issues and promotes networking. Specific arrangements regarding the functioning of such a group will have to be decided by the next college.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to warmly thank Mrs Gröner, the rapporteur on the Daphne II programme, for her cooperation and the quality of her work on this proposal which is equally important for Parliament and the Commission. The Commission attaches great importance to the renewal of the Daphne programme, which clearly meets a deeply felt need within the voluntary sector and the general public.</p>
<p class="contents">Our aim is to establish a second phase of the Daphne programme for the period 2004-2008, building on the four years' experience gained during the implementation of the current Daphne I programme. All areas of violence, such as domestic violence, violence in schools and institutions, in the workplace, commercial sexual exploitation, genital mutilation, health impact, gender violence, trafficking – it is sad that there is such a long list of violence against women – remain important and should be the subject of actions. Organisations responsible for assisting victims are still the best channels for reaching and helping the beneficiaries of these actions. In addition, training bodies, universities, voluntary associations, research centres and local authorities are also eligible under the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme will contribute to the general objective of providing citizens with a high level of protection from violence, including the protection of their physical and mental health within the framework of an area of freedom, security and justice. It is intended to prevent and combat all forms of violence against children, young people and women. By so doing, the programme will contribute to health and social wellbeing.</p>
<p class="contents">The text represents a well-balanced compromise that will enable the Community to resume the combat against violence for another five years with reasonable financial resources. I would also like to thank Parliament for that and for its swift treatment of this decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad to confirm that the five amendments modifying the Council's common position are welcomed by the Commission. The first four redefine some concepts and clarify the scope of the programme and the fifth amendment requests the establishment of a help-desk to assist organisations in submitting their projects and subsequently in implementing them. The Commission welcomes this suggestion and is pleased to implement it. This will certainly be a useful tool to help organisations and may, therefore, increase the quality of the proposals that we receive.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I turn to the Bastos report on reconciling professional, family and private lives. I would like to congratulate the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities and in particular Mrs Bastos for this comprehensive own-initiative report. I also take note of the valuable contribution of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and its draftsman, Mr Schmid.</p>

I will try to continue sitting down.</p>
<p class="contents">Reconciliation is a key concern at European level in employment and social affairs policies and the issues at stake are the promotion of more and better jobs and ensuring equal rights for men and women. The European Union tackles reconciliation from many different angles, using several instruments, such as legislation, the open method of coordination between Member States, and financing tools.</p>
<p class="contents">There are already a number of directives that facilitate the reconciliation of work and family life: the parental leave directive, the pregnant workers' directive and the directive on equal treatment as regards access to employment, vocational training and working conditions. Considering that we are on the eve of the biggest enlargement we have ever had, it is essential to concentrate on the effective implementation of the existing directives.</p>
<p class="contents">In December 2003 the Commission launched a re-examination of the working-time directive. The Commission invited comments on the current text of the directive and the need to introduce other initiatives in five areas, including measures to achieve a better reconciliation of work and family life. The Commission thinks that greater compatibility between the private and professional spheres and equality of opportunity between men and women would improve the overall equality of employment. Moreover, these measures would also improve productivity by increasing motivation and availability and by opening up greater opportunities for training. The Commission takes the view that a revision of the working-time directive could encourage the Member States to further improve reconciliation of working and family life.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to legislation, the open method of coordination at European level gives special attention to this issue, in the areas of employment and social inclusion. The European employment strategy strongly encourages Member States and social partners to develop better means for reconciliation. I agree with the opinion expressed in Mrs Bastos' report that better reconciliation not only helps women to access employment and remain at work, but also contributes to reducing the pay gap and gender segregation in the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">In the 2003 national action plans, reconciliation is seen by Member States as the prime factor in decreasing gender gaps. Six Member States set national targets to increase their childcare provisions. Since 2002, six Member States have changed their leave provisions or have committed themselves to improving them, particularly with a view to increasing fathers' take-up. In April the Commission will organise a peer review in Sweden, a country where opportunities to combine family and work underpin strong female participation in the labour market and a relatively high birth rate. Parental benefit is payable for 480 days with 60 days reserved for the father and mother respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Eight countries – five old Member States and two newcomers – will learn from each other about ways of implementing maternity, paternity and parental leave schemes, setting parental benefits and improving access to child care.</p>
<p class="contents">The social inclusion process also pays attention to promoting the reconciliation of work and family life in the light of particular problems faced by low-income families. More recently the Commission published a communication on making work pay, which highlights the importance of appropriate reconciliation not only for women but also for men. It analyses the limitations faced by women in accessing the labour market and remaining in employment and presents good practice developed in Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Structural Funds – in particular the Social Fund, which supports the implementation of the employment strategy in Member States, and the Regional Fund – finance measures aimed at reconciling work in family life. For instance, in Ireland EUR 436 million will be spent over the period 2000-2006 to improve childcare facilities. Reconciliation was also the priority theme of the gender equality programme in 2002. Eighteen transnational projects were selected which focus on awareness-raising actions and exchanges of good practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Solutions for better reconciliation of work and family life do not lie in one specific measure. They require the appropriate combination of several instruments and there is a role for everyone to play – the Commission, Member States, social partners, social services and men and women who want to improve the quality of their lives. I very much welcome Parliament's support in strengthening our activities in this field and making full and better use of the existing instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the last report, by Mrs Martínez-Orozco, on women from minority groups, which is of particular importance – as Mrs Karamanou has already mentioned. I would like to thank the rapporteur, other Members who have contributed to the report, and Mrs Karamanou for her statement.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has already done a lot to address the problem of multiple discrimination, which is faced by many women living in the European Union, by developing an integrated approach. This integrated approach is reflected in European anti-discrimination legislation and programmes. The racial equality and employment framework directives were adopted in 2000 and have now entered into force. They prohibit discrimination on a variety of grounds, including racial or ethnic origin and disability. They specifically refer to the problem of multiple discrimination and provide protection for women within minorities, as well as women generally.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the concerns expressed by the honourable Member in her report with regard to the delays in implementing these important directives in several Member States. The Commission has already begun to take action to ensure that all women and men living in the EU can benefit from effective protection against discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States are required by European legislation to establish bodies to tackle racial and sex discrimination and the Commission expects that the work of these bodies will help grassroots efforts to prevent discrimination against women from minority groups and to increase the opportunities open to them. As honourable Members are aware, the anti-discrimination directives are supplemented by a 100-million-euro Community action programme to combat discrimination. One of the important objectives of this programme is to tackle discrimination based on multiple factors.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of the Roma, I share many of the views expressed by the rapporteur. The Commission has also emphasised on several occasions that the elimination of discrimination against the Roma people must go hand in hand with respect for the fundamental rights of Roma women and girls, including respect from within their own community.</p>
<p class="contents">Gender equality is a principle of Community law and a fundamental aspect of the European social model. The full participation of women from all walks of life in society and the economy brings with it important economic and social benefits. The Commission reaffirms its commitment to mainstreaming gender equality and disability issues in its programmes and policies.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, there are the wage differences between men and women. As a result, families often choose, for purely financial reasons, to have the man work the maximum amount of time – that is to say eight hours and perhaps also overtime – and the woman work part-time. These wage differences, which are not chosen but are, rather, dictated by the wage conditions in the market, must be eliminated if families are to be able freely to choose the pattern of family life that suits them.</p>
<p class="contents">The second factor is working hours. It is becoming ever more usual for both men and women to work eight hours per day and, moreover, to have long commuting times to and from work. Thus, both parties may, in practice, have working times of nine to ten hours per day. This pattern entails an intolerable burden, especially for families with children. It leads to stress, burn-out, people going off sick and problems with family life. We must therefore – and I am almost the only person who dares say this nowadays – limit the amount of time spent working to, for example, twelve working hours per family per day. It is therefore crucial that we distribute working time equally between men and women, that is to say six hours for the man and six hours for the woman. Both where families and workplaces are concerned, that is much better than part-time for women and full-time for men.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee’s proposal includes the demand for equal wages but not, unfortunately, the demand for reduced and equally distributed daily working time. I therefore wish to repeat this important point: six plus six hours is much better than four plus eight hours. This is a crucial issue to which attention must be drawn on, in particular, International Women’s Day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Daphne programme is aimed at preventing and combating all forms of violence against children, young people and women within the framework of a multidisciplinary approach and has contributed to creating greater awareness in the European Union of this extremely serious problem which regrettably affects the whole of society.</p>
<p class="contents">The success has been noted of the previous programme, which has allowed us to introduce certain innovations into Daphne II, of which I would emphasise, firstly, the significant budgetary increase: we have risen from EUR 20 million to EUR 50 million, which, although it still seems insufficient, represents considerable progress; secondly, the exchange of good practices and experiences, particularly of preventive measures and help for victims, as well as studies and research; thirdly, the creation of educational instruments in schools, where we must begin to prevent violence and promote equality; finally, the introduction of training programmes for the professionals in question, such as lawyers, police, doctors etc., and also the development and implementation of rehabilitation programmes for aggressors, since sometimes aggressors leave prison and go back to attacking the victim, causing them further harm. This is an innovation which I believe to be very important for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also pay particular attention to prevention for the groups at greatest risk, such as disabled women or women in a special situation because they have been victims of violence previously. In other words, it is a programme which continues to insist on zero tolerance of violence against children, adolescents and women.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to refer very briefly to the report presented by Mrs Bastos on reconciling work and family life. I must congratulate her on her very interesting and very in-depth work, which must form the basis of other work by the Commission, in order to be able to do something which really has an effect on the legislations of the Member States in terms of the reconciliation of work and family life. We must create conditions which help women to develop their professional lives without creating problems for their families, by means of appropriate modifications in terms of new part-time working contracts, bearing in mind that this must not create problems with social security contributions which may prejudice future benefits, with the creation of nurseries and of day centres for dependent persons, who are also generally the responsibility of women, as well as tax assistance and assistance for families with larger numbers of children.</p>
<p class="contents">We must achieve better pay for women who, unfortunately, we know are still being paid less than men for the same work, and we must make progress on the Lisbon objectives so that a greater presence for women in the workplace becomes a reality. Equal conditions must not mean that women give up on family life, as often happens, or on motherhood and many other responsibilities. We must bring about a change which leads to greater reconciliation and shared responsibilities with men on an equal footing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We really cannot tolerate a situation in which we, in this House, work on bringing out new directives only for them to be ignored when transposed by the Member States, so that we end up wondering what we are actually doing all this work for. Where equality is concerned, it is vital that these directives be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all glad to be able to observe International Women’s Day today, and it is indeed a day of rejoicing. In this plenary, we have now spent two hours dealing with the topic of equality policy and that must be of use, but what will tomorrow be like? Tomorrow, Women’s Day will be yesterday, and we will go back to what we experience day by day.</p>
<p class="contents">Although Mrs Karamanou pointed out earlier that we are this year celebrating 20 years of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, it must also be stressed that here, in this House too, women labour under a double burden. We are actually represented on three committees because the Committee on Women’s Rights is not considered important in this House, and it is there that we endeavour to muster all our strength, because it is there that we have to work for recognition and grapple with many difficult issues that are not always welcome in public debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Bastos report on equality and the reconciliation of work and family life certainly presupposes, among other things, equal pay for equal work, which would make it easier to share out paternity and maternity leave, as one or other partner would have a free choice in choosing to spend some of his or her time with the children, while the other would remain at work. The present situation is that the decision is always taken on the basis of the financial situation, and this generally works out better for men. What this means is that one of the important principles for which we have been campaigning for a very long time, even though it has its defects, must now at last be put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to achieve the Lisbon objective, this is another area where we need to devise a rigorous policy for women and families, as a developing economy needs women at work and women who are mobile; above all, it needs women who are willing to have more children if the conditions are right.</p>
<p class="contents">What I very much want to re-emphasise is the concept of the family. What is a family? That, too, has to be defined. What counts is not only the traditional image of the family, with father, mother, and child; rather, the term ‘family’ must include different types of living arrangement, different ways of living together, different concepts of living, and gender mainstreaming should not be confused with family mainstreaming. There is justification for both of them. Both are working on different levels towards the same end, that being that society should be served by women and men, and we should all benefit from that in the same way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the twenty-first century, equality should, on the contrary, be a natural part of everyday life in a democracy. There is a need for more women in leading positions generally, especially in politics. Talk of genuine democracy is meaningless unless there is also genuine equality. Our goal in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is to achieve a balanced representation of men and women. We would therefore call upon our member parties to comply with that objective in connection with the elections to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement to include the ten East and Central European countries on 1 May is of historic importance. At the same time, it gives rise, however, to some concern. The observers from these countries have done a fine piece of work in Parliament, but I hope that the new elections in June will ensure a more equal distribution of the sexes. At present, approximately 30% of MEPs are women. That figure should, as a minimum, be retained at the forthcoming election in June. In that connection, I wish to send a powerful appeal to all women to use their right to vote on 13 June. Increased influence and equality for women will only come about if women themselves are also prepared to assume responsibility. Of the ten shadow commissioners, as they are called, who have been appointed from 1 May, three are women. They should be welcomed. At the same time, I hope that, in connection with the appointment of the forthcoming Commission, the Member States will comply with the proposal from the Convention to the effect that all the Member States must nominate three candidates for the Commission, with representatives from both sexes.</p>
<p class="contents">Women play a crucial role in modern, developed democracies. Gender equality and economic development go hand in hand. It is worth noting that those societies that have the highest degree of real equality are often also those societies that are most successful in social and economic terms. If we are to create a strong and competitive Europe, there is a need for women to participate as much as men in the labour market and, it should be noted, with equal wages and the same conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to express solidarity with all those women around the world who do not enjoy basic human rights and who are victims of persecution, violence, trafficking in human beings and all other forms of threat, discrimination and assault. We in the ELDR Group shall continue to work towards improving conditions for these women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are laws, but there are great deficiencies when it comes to applying them and establishing the priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier today, we had a press conference in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities. I then heard that the number of people brought into the EU Member States for the purposes of sexual exploitation has now increased from 500 000 to 800 000. I wish to express my pleasure at having a discussion of these matters in this House on 8 March with a Swedish Commissioner. In 1996, I had the same discussion with Mrs Gradin, who then mentioned the figure of 500 000. Since then, we have adopted Community legislation, and the Member States have maintained that they are giving priority to the issue. While we have been legislating and prioritising, the figure has, then, increased by 300 000. This no doubt shows that it is now the demand side that must be focused upon. Otherwise, we can increase the appropriations to the Daphne programme for ever and a day, and all to no lasting purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully support Mrs Gröner’s proposal for a European Year Against Violence Against Women in 2006. I believe it is necessary. I think that the joint 1999 campaign was a good starting point before the turn of the millennium. The issue then genuinely came up for discussion in all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">What is also very commendable is what has been termed a help desk at the Commission. Many different women’s organisations have contacted me through the years and said that there is almost no point in applying for funds from the Daphne programme. The application procedure demands so much work and so much expenditure that it is not even worth trying.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Bastos, I think very highly of your report. At the same time, I am rather upset about the fact that the organisation of working life is becoming ever more hostile to children. We say that too few children are being born in the EU and that the EU has an ageing population. There should be more children, but it is no doubt entirely understandable that young people are not having children now, given the prevailing conditions governing the ability to look after children and bring them up. We also see how wage differences are not decreasing but increasing, both within one and the same workplace and between the sexes. Clearly, companies today require unfailing loyalty from their employees. Obviously, there must be organised care of children and the elderly. It would be a waste if all the well-educated women were never able to make use of their knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to make a point of thanking Mrs Valenciano Martínez-Orozco. It was incredibly worthwhile bringing together three minority groups, as they are termed, in one and the same report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I found this a poignant start to International Women's Day, which is also the effect intended by this report.</p>
<p class="contents">One of our ministers, Laurette Onckelinckx, subsequently stated that in Belgium, 70 women are killed by their partners every year. This is hardly an example of equal opportunities …</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, to start with, the integrity of life should come first where equal opportunities are concerned. Equal opportunities also mean that women should have opportunities for education, but also that they should be able to apply their education in their professional lives. It is a structural failing in our society that women should have to sacrifice more to have children than men. When a man wants children, this does not have the same impact on his career. Accordingly, despite the fact that more women attend university, they always end up being disadvantaged in their jobs. We can see the glass ceiling which they hit at our universities, in industry and in politics alike. Women have to fight to get to the top, but they have to fight even harder to stay there, because there is such a thing as the woman on duty. No longer the token woman of yesteryear, but the young woman who does well in the media, but who expires very quickly. I think that we should offer women the solidarity of the kind that can be offered by a movement.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, feminism was a matter for women as a movement. More and more women who reach the top nowadays must give up that movement, which is not a good thing, for the media turn them into casualties too soon; they use them and spit them out. In order for women to be able to blossom, they need to be able to compete and succeed in the same way as men. We should accommodate the cultural differences by working in our own cultures on the removal of specific obstacles which this culture creates against women's emancipation in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Equality exists in law but there should be far more of it in practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Because we are now talking about the family, I would also like to congratulate Mrs Bastos warmly on her superb report, on the great quality and depth of her work which, I am sure, will inspire any future measures the Commission takes, as has already been said.</p>
<p class="contents">This report also provides a response to the various family associations that sent a petition to Parliament on 15 May last year, on International Day of the Family. In particular, I wish to emphasise some ideas that are of the greatest importance for the future: the concept of ‘family mainstreaming’, which means incorporating the family aspect into all policies, an idea that is rightly included in this report and which should not give rise to any confusion or clash with the other idea that has been vociferously advocated here in Parliament, and rightly so: that of<span class="italic"> ‘</span>gender mainstreaming’. Another concept to which this report contributes, and which I am glad has been accepted, is that of ‘family-friendly policies’, particularly in the fields of town planning, housing and employment policy. As Mrs Eriksson said, there is an ever-greater need to implement ‘family-friendly’ policies. Unless we do, we will be seriously limiting the personal choices of all our citizens, both men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">These are what I believe to be the salient points. </p>
<p class="contents">This is a superb report and the motion for a resolution is excellent. </p>
<p class="contents">My only disagreement is with Mrs Prets’ contribution, which I only mention, in fact, because a short while ago, she stated that she would have wanted the report to define ‘the family’. I do not think that such a task falls within the sphere of Parliament’s competence. I have doubts as to whether such a definition would have any legal value and I do not believe that we should confuse new types of unions and personal relations and their legal status with the concept of the family, a sociological concept that is both accepted in anthropological terms and also deeply rooted in our culture. This is what the exclusive focus of our concern as regards this report should be. Once again, I offer my congratulations to Mrs Bastos. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are those who say that women are meant to go out to work in order to fulfil themselves, whilst others believe that they have been allotted the traditional role of wife and mother. I see this as resorting to clichés. The fact is that poverty has a female face. Although there are many modern career women for whom emancipation has become the norm, and who are often described as freeloaders, it is also the case that the dual burden of family and career is mainly borne by women.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this ideological slant has not got us any further. The chief end of any individual’s life – the highest goal that he or she can have – is to determine the course of their life freely and in their own way. As I see it, free self-determination involves being able to decide for oneself and to choose between the options of job, job and family or homemaking. Such choices demand framework conditions, and it is the task of policy to provide the best ones it can.</p>
<p class="contents">A certain amount has been done, but it is far from enough. Childcare facilities with flexible opening times need to be set up; parental time out has to be capable of being shared. Right across Europe, there are interesting models, such as the use of vouchers in payment for services, which the French have pioneered and which also creates jobs, or, to take another example, the introduction of child allowances in my own country of Austria, the thinking behind which is to try to make freedom of choice a reality for women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is also a live issue in my own country, the Netherlands, where, at present, there is an important ongoing discussion about the integration of migrants. Some manage to integrate surprisingly quickly, while others, particularly women, often find it difficult, although they are a crucial factor in the integration. I am pleased that the topic is on our agenda, especially since today is International Women's Day.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group shares the rapporteur’s concerns. The problems are substantial, and more should be done to promote integration and participation in social and political life. There is simply more to be done. The report goes about this in the right way, certainly as regards the deprivation caused by discrimination, the discriminating effect of measures in the areas of education and training, employment, participation in social life and protection against violence and sexual abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group also agrees that the command of the language is extremely important, and it would be good if something were to be done about this in the country of origin. In our view, however, the report goes too far in some respects. Particularly in paragraph 16, where it considers that everyone who holds a residence permit should have the same rights as the indigenous people in every respect, so politically, administratively, judicially, economically and socially. That is taking matters too far in our view, although we are in favour of drafting a few minimal rights so as to fight the various forms of discrimination and promote social integration, for that is what matters. Incidentally, I have to say that the often endless list of problems in so many areas and in so many amendments diminishes the power of the message and, in fact, suggests that this list is limitative. In reality, new problems arise all the time. Paragraph 16 is crucial to our group. If it remains in place, our group will be unable to vote for the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In a few days and in a few minutes, however, we are going to vote on yet another report that argues in favour of perpetuating discrimination between the sexes.</p>
<p class="contents">Studies have shown that gender is not the determining factor in life expectancy; other factors – such as family life, socio-economic factors, professional status, where one lives, smoking habits and eating habits – were shown to be more significant. Lifestyle is, therefore, a multidimensional factor that has a far greater impact than gender on life expectancy.</p>
<p class="contents">According to studies that removed aspects such as lifestyle, social class and environmental factors from the equation, the difference of life expectancy between men and women is between nought and two years. The growing discrepancy in terms of life expectancy in the populations of certain countries cannot, therefore, be attributed to biological differences.</p>
<p class="contents">Having made this observation, however, we must also acknowledge that lobby pressure, even on women’s rights issues, remains a strong influence. In the coming weeks, insurers will, naturally, make every effort to convince us that the report, which concludes that men and women must be insured in a fair and equitable manner, is unworkable and unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the Commission determinedly supports this proposal, we are thus forced to accept further discrimination.

It is hard to imagine anyone better qualified within the present Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In Zambia, several women are murdered every week by their men. In the United States, a women is beaten by her husband every fifteenth second. In France, approximately 25 000 women are raped each year. Those are the facts that greeted me when my radio woke me this morning. They were a few extracts from Amnesty International’s report on the appalling situation of women throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not a moralist, but there is a point beyond which only disgust can be felt faced with the wave of pornography sweeping into our homes, onto the Internet, into newspapers and advertisements and into hotels. If you are a parent with two children, you will have difficulty defending yourself against it. Now, the time is approaching when enough is enough. There is a clear link between, on the one hand, prostitution and every cruder pornography and, on the other hand, the oppression of women and violence towards them. Within the EU, half a million women and children are sold every year. According to Mrs Gröner, the figure is perhaps one of 800 000 women and children. That is scandalous beyond belief.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon process is certainly needed to strengthen women’s situation in the labour market. There is no question about that. If, however, Europe is to become a decent continent, a halt must be called to this odious trade. My appeal to you, Commissioner, and to the President, Mr Cox, is to address this issue as the first item at the Spring Summit in Brussels. On 1 May, the bells of freedom must ring in Europe, not those of female slavery. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It strikes me that, in our respective countries, we are not sufficiently aware that Europe has been a pioneer in the field of women’s rights and gender equality. Europe may be a pioneer on paper – more on that later – but it is still a pioneer just the same.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask you a question. The legislature that has just finished has, among other things, made the framework decision against trafficking possible, promoted the Daphne programme and revised the 1976 Directive and Article 23 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights – all of which, as far as I am concerned, are welcome developments. What I would like to know is how is it that we are incapable – at least in France – of conveying to our fellow countrymen the amount of work that Europe does for women’s rights?</p>
<p class="contents">I say this not only in order that we should raise Europe’s profile, but simply because I hear people saying the opposite in my country. They say that Europe is unravelling women’s rights and that Europe does nothing to help women. I do not wish to spend my time reopening old wounds; what I would like to know is why people do not see, hear or know what goes on here, as I feel that, at a stroke, we could establish a better link between what we do and what goes on in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">A good example is my own country, where the government, of which I am not a supporter, makes proposals for professional equality, and I welcome these. Yet it does not make one single reference to Europe, nor to the renewal of the 1976 Directive, which took place two years ago. Why should this be, when these proposals are the result of transposing the Directive?</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like and what I ask both the Commission and Parliament is, therefore, to examine how we can speak differently and convey differently what goes on here. This is not to say that I see things through rose-coloured glasses. Let me remind you – as I know you are well aware – that there are issues that genuinely make us angry and to which we are vehemently opposed, such as part-time work, prostitution and abortion. These are three subjects that genuinely make us angry and that prove that not everything in Europe’s garden is coming up roses. We are here to move things forward and I feel that it is in our interests to improve relations with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This will not stop me from putting to the Commission the question of Article 13, which was raised just before. How is it that we have had a directive to combat racism since the year 2000, yet we do not have a directive to combat sexism? What is being proposed today is a pale shadow of what the Commissioner hoped for when she tabled the proposals last year. We have lost education, taxation, media and advertising. All we have left is insurance, as my fellow socialist has just reminded this House, and even this is in the hands of the lobbies, who are opposed.</p>
<p class="contents">A transversal group of Commissioners has been set up, but can this group be more proactive? We also drew up a report – Mrs Gröner is no longer here – to encourage greater parity and equality between men and women within parliamentary institutions. The Commission itself has made strenuous efforts with regard to what happens in our respective countries, and certainly in France. To my mind, the implementation of Article 13 is severely weakened, which causes me great concern. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such legislation has an enormous impact, in terms of ensuring that the fundamental rights of women are upheld and women are encouraged to achieve their full potential. This must apply not only to women but also to families, children and, consequently, to the future of our European societies.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is true, as Mrs Fraisse has just stated, that significant progress has been made in terms of reducing disparities, much remains to be done if we are to achieve the objectives set by the EU in this area. I should like to mention two significant commitments made in Lisbon: to reach a 60% employment rate among women in the EU by 2010; and to ensure that by 2010 at least 90% of children between three years old and mandatory school age are provided with proper child care. In this regard, I deplore the fact that we do not have a common social policy, the absence of which results in delays, which are sometimes substantial, in adopting certain directive proposals. I refer, inter alia, to those based on Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which could prohibit for the first time any act of discrimination based on gender outside the job market, such as access to goods and services or the supply of these.</p>
<p class="contents">We, consequently, have no hesitation in endorsing Mrs Bastos’s excellent report, which would enable us to take the measures needed to ensure reconciliation of professional and family life. It therefore appears that we could introduce a directive, as we did for parental leave, in the next few years. In actual fact, whereas the concept of reconciling family and professional life has been around at European level for some time, this has not always been the case in practice, especially among companies, who often disregard this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe, Mr President, that we must support Mrs Bastos’s report. I should like to add that today we are fulfilling a dream, since certain Members who have sat in this House for some time are aware that the words ‘family’ and ‘child’, along with the concept of reconciling working life and family life, were taboo in this House ten years ago. We must rejoice in this debate held today on this 8 March. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to congratulate the Commissioner warmly on the report on gender equality that was issued during the Spring Summit. At long last, it has to be said, that report pulls no punches.</p>
<p class="contents">Although progress has been made over the past few years, social inequalities between men and women remain extremely persistent. We know for a fact that women are disadvantaged in terms of labour participation and pay, that their economic independence is inadequate, that there is an unfair distribution of household and caring tasks and inadequate child care, while poverty in Europe is still predominantly a women's issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The theme of the Spring Summit will be the often-expressed aspiration towards becoming the world's most competitive knowledge economy. The Commission's message is quite clear: if we are not prepared to enable women to actually realise their right to equality, nothing will come of this noble ambition. The ageing of the population means that the economic basis is vulnerable. The ratio between the so-called active and non-active population should go up. Europe can simply no longer afford to leave the economic potential of women unutilised.</p>
<p class="contents">Socio-economic equality, however, cannot be realised unless the balance of power between men and women is also tackled in other areas. Violence against women and trafficking in women must be fought; more women should go into public administration; women must gain an equal share in research and science.</p>
<p class="contents">The social inequality between men and women revolves around the balance of power: power in cutting the cake, power in apportioning tasks, power in using the public space, power in determining the political agenda and definitions, power where identifying social problems are concerned and power in the fight for self-determination in respect of our bodies and lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Equality in those areas is a <span class="italic">conditio sine qua non</span>, but is also the price we are asking for using our economic potential. This requires tough negotiations around the kitchen table, but also around the tables of political power. At every summit, we always see a sea of men in grey suits, older men with grey hair, and a few women thrown in for good measure. They should be careful, because one day we will have the last laugh. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we want is equal treatment and equal opportunities in all areas of life, which, let us not forget, should be a fundamental right.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the representation of women in politics, for example, the under-representation of women in the political decision-making process constitutes a serious shortcoming, which, unfortunately, is mirrored across all of our European democracies. We must, therefore, persevere in our efforts to build a democratic Europe. This process should be characterised by balanced representation in Parliament, both for women and for men.</p>
<p class="contents">The governments of Member States and accession countries must evaluate, as soon as possible, the differential impact of electoral systems on the political representation of women in elected bodies and the possibility of adapting or reforming these systems. Appropriate measures must be taken in order to ensure balanced participation. Let us not forget that the aim is to being able at least to maintain a proportion of at least 30% of women among elected members at the forthcoming elections. There is a danger that under-representation in accession countries may reduce this percentage, which we have striven so hard to achieve since the 1979 elections. We must raise awareness among accession countries, so that their governments may take action to combat crimes against women. Yes, some progress has been made, but further resources must be put in place.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should also like to express, on a more general level, my solidarity with the struggles of all women around the world, whose rights are routinely trampled underfoot. I refer to all those women subjected to barbaric customs and traditions; women who are victims of war, of Aids, of ill-treatment, of trafficking, and, more broadly, of human stupidity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are a long way from complying with Community decisions, on equal access to work, salaries and promotions, and on promoting rights in the areas of sexual and reproductive health, establishing social support mechanisms for maternity and paternity, crèches and nurseries or structures to support the elderly.</p>
<p class="contents">Women still endure violence within the family, despite the programmes and legislation in force. Particularly serious is the discrimination faced by immigrant women and women with disabilities, despite the proposals that we have adopted here. Trafficking in human beings and prostitution continue to reach alarming levels in the European Union, and further socio-economic policies, high-quality public services and effective measures are required to solve the problems of poverty and social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">By putting people second, neo-liberalism prevents women’s rights from becoming a reality, makes unemployment worse, makes jobs less stable, devalues maternity and paternity and obstructs women’s participation in social and political life.</p>
<p class="contents">Some EU countries are lagging behind in both legal and practical terms. I must highlight, at this juncture, what is happening in Portugal. Despite all the calls to repeal the legislation punishing women who have to resort to the voluntary termination of a pregnancy, women’s dignity and privacy are still being attacked, not least in court proceedings, including the recent trial in Aveiro, of seven women accused of having had illegal abortions and their relatives and friends.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though they were all acquitted, they are still under threat from the Attorney General’s office because, demonstrating an attitude that persecutes women, the law that condemns women to up to three years in prison remains in force.</p>
<p class="contents">The attempt on 3 March in the Assembly of the Republic to amend the law was rejected by members who make up the current right-leaning government majority, upholding a situation that is an embarrassment to Portugal and which primarily penalises less well-off women who cannot make use of the safe health services of our neighbouring country.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, despite the fact that this Parliament has voted in favour of important resolutions aimed at promoting women’s rights, most decisions are ignored by the Member States due to the lack of political will to implement the measures that are adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The major challenge is, therefore, to continue to fight to ensure that equality becomes a reality and that women’s dignity is properly respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The family is the smallest unit in the state. In it, the foundations are laid for a functioning society, and it must take pride of place among society’s concerns. It is, however, an unfortunate fact that our families are in crisis. We are a long way from achieving our objective of reconciling work and family life. Earning a living must be organised around the family, rather than vice versa. Those who care for their own children or look after elderly family members need to have the framework conditions created for them so that the two can be interconnected.</p>
<p class="contents">One key to better reconciliation of family and work lies of course in the partnership between husband and wife, both as regards the bringing up of children and housework as a whole. Even though we know that it cannot be enforced as a matter of policy, we have to keep coming back to it as a topic of discussion. Women still bear most of the burden bringing up a family, to which, along with domestic work, a higher value must be attached. It must be acknowledged as work of value to society and there must no longer be discrimination against it. It is vitally important that the members of a family should have more of a choice as to whether to do the household chores and look after children themselves or to delegate them to others. Families should have the option of bringing someone in to do some domestic work.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we need to recognise that private households, too, can create skilled employment for the labour market. If women choose to be home-makers, they must not be put at a disadvantage in terms of social security, that is, when it comes to a pension in later life. In order to make re-entry into the world of work easier after spending time on family responsibilities, vocational training opportunities must also be offered during parental leave. Those are just a few things that need adjusting, but many small cogs need to move if there is to be a successful balance and harmony between work and family life for both men and women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For me, feminism is about seeing and acknowledging the fact that women often have a subordinate role in society and being prepared to do something about this.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe, what the EU does to make society more equal is very important. I remember very well what happened when, as Sweden’s new prime minister in 1994, Ingvar Carlsson appointed his government, and half of its members were women. After he had formed his government in that particular way, it was impossible for Sweden’s political parties to do anything other than ensure that more women were given substantial political responsibilities. For us Social Democrats, it became obvious that every other member of our political assemblies should be a woman.</p>
<p class="contents">The same thing must happen in the EU. Women and men must be equal. When a new Parliament is appointed, it must be characterised by gender equality. When a new Commission is appointed, it must also be characterised by gender equality. The same should apply in all parts of the European Union. There are two main reasons for this. Firstly, women and men must obviously be treated equally. We have the same rights and obligations. Secondly, it is incredibly important what signals the EU sends out. Equal opportunities for women and men are one such signal that must be sent out from ourselves to all actors in society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would have preferred us to adopt – much more frequently in the course of a year, rather than just on this day – reports on the Commission’s legislative initiatives, rather than own-initiative reports on topics such as the situation of women who belong to minorities or the reconciliation of professional, family and private life, which, interesting though they may be, do regrettably little to get us further forward in practical terms.</p>
<p class="contents">One can certainly, in these areas; keep making new demands – some of them, alas, exaggerated – but extreme and sometimes unrealistic demands do nothing to help the women we want to help. On the contrary, they can turn out to militate against the employment of women. My lady colleagues and I had ourselves submitted amendments to these own-initiative reports, only – as we are accustomed to doing – to see them fail in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, and that is why we have resubmitted some of them to be voted on.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like to say in this debate is that I am not very happy about the oral questions to the Commission and the Council. I am not in the least convinced that there is a need for one member of the Commission, and one Directorate-General, to have sole responsibility for the equal treatment of men and women. It would, I think, be much better for these problems to be dealt with by a Commissioner – of whichever gender – whose remit included such things as, for example, the internal market or employment policy, rather than setting them apart in a ghetto in which they would suffer the same fate as this House’s Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, that of not being taken seriously by many decision-makers.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the composition of the Commission, I do not think that the questions to the Council aimed at ensuring that there should be enough women Commissioners, are actually very much help at this present time. How is the Council – which, incidentally, I do not believe is actually represented at the moment – supposed to lay down, on 1 March, that at least one-third of the Commissioners should be women after November 2004? I hope there will be more of them than that. Even if a proposal of this sort is in the draft constitutional treaty, I think it is absurd that every Member State should be required to put forward a list of three candidates, be they male or female. This sort of selection procedure does nothing whatever to ensure that the next Commission will include the best male Commissioners and enough outstanding female ones. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Despite the solemnity of numerous legal texts, such as Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Articles 20 and 21 of the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights, and various texts in our respective constitutions, the truth is that discrimination against women continues to be a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate comes on International Women’s Day, but I believe that the success of this commemoration must not end with holding certain celebratory events or producing fortunate or appropriate slogans. The success must be operational and lasting. I believe that employment is the best means for integration, for overcoming differences and creating equality. Although the presence of women in the labour market has increased over recent years, the increase has been insufficient: there is still wage discrimination, redundancies as a result of maternity, a lack of specific prevention of risks for pregnant women, sexual harassment and psychological harassment – ‘mobbing’<span class="italic"> –</span> with a view to dismissal, thereby making a constant mockery of the rights of women such as the right to childcare leave, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, alongside these employment aspects we need to support the family – the low demographic rate demands this – we need to support home-working by means of the new technologies and their distribution, we need to make women’s working hours more flexible, to integrate immigrant women, to increase employment opportunities for women who have been victims of domestic violence and, at the same time, of course, to speed up separation and divorce procedures, increase crèches and nurseries, and all of this – as Mrs Hermange said earlier – within the context of fulfilling the Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, in society women must not have more problems than men, but the same problems. They must have the same opportunities and responsibilities as men and they must receive ‘equal pay for equal work’. This requires, Mr President, and I will end here, a change in culture, in mentality and habits. And this cultural change must be extended to all social groups, so that equal opportunities are real and not just symbolic, only existing on paper. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we discussed in this House was about both structures and standards. It was about very practical problems and challenges along the lines of equal wages for the same work, child care and care of the elderly and tasks that should be divided more equally between husbands and wives if society is to function, as well as about a number of other problems that, of course, affect both men and women, but above all women, in today’s society.</p>
<p class="contents">The list of things that so many women, young girls and children are forced to undergo was pitiable, as were the details of these things. It is called trafficking, but I believe we must be careful about using the correct designation. There is now a kind of trade in sexual slavery in Europe and the rest of the world. If I have the opportunity at the Spring Summit, I shall be the first to raise this issue and to place it at the very top of the agenda. Everything else we talk about becomes in some way hollow and loses its power and credibility if we continue to permit this direct exploitation of, and direct trade in, human beings, both across our European borders and internationally.</p>
<p class="contents">We must sometimes prioritise and be very careful to help each other in this fight. Above all, the debate has shown that we in the Commission must do whatever it is in our power to do to implement the existing legislation and attempt – and why not? – also to introduce new legislation. We need to use all the tools available to us: legislation, the open coordination method and the options we have for providing funding.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe in actual fact that it is only right to proceed step by step when it comes to legislation to combat sexism or discrimination against women, outside the workplace too. You have certainly noted how difficult matters have been with Article 13 of the directive. We nonetheless believe that it will be possible for us step by step to succeed this way too. We must extend a helping hand to each other across every border in order to achieve a situation in which men too can stand up and declare themselves feminists in the knowledge that this, in actual fact, means ensuring that both women and men have the same rights, obligations and opportunities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
