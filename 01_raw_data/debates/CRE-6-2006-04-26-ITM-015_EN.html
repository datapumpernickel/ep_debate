<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jan Mulder (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, around 3 p.m. this afternoon, I asked at roughly what time I would be given the floor, and I was told at around 5.45 p.m. It is now 7.45 p.m. I do not know who had the wisdom to compile this agenda, but I do not think it does Parliament any favours to hold a discharge debate about the European institutions at this time of day.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to the order of the day and cutting to the chase, I would advise the House to grant discharge to the Commission in respect of the financial year 2004. This may come as a surprise to you, because as everyone knows and as probably many people will say, the Court of Auditors has not issued a Statement of Assurance about the Commission’s conduct of policy for 11 years in a row. So what is the use of granting discharge? I have two arguments to put to you in favour. Firstly, this Commission was in office for roughly one month in 2004 and secondly, this Commission started very ambitiously with a view to achieving a positive Statement of Assurance. I will return to this in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is unfortunate that Mr Wynn is absent, I should like to start with last year’s resolution which he compiled and in which he introduced a number of fresh elements, the key one being that we felt that the highest political authority in every Member State should make a declaration at the beginning and end of each financial year to the effect that everything is in order in terms of political control. It is unfortunate that this demand by Parliament has met with much resistance in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been a number of developments since then. An Interinstitutional Agreement has been concluded in which we have reached a compromise with the Council to the effect that it does not matter whether the political level is the highest or not. We will also accept a declaration at any level that is suitable for this purpose in every Member State, provided that this declaration is made. I would like to find out from the Commission what it intends to do with the Interinstitutional Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Another development has been the fact that some countries are now saying that they object to this. I should like to find out what the Commission’s response to this position is, because I get the impression that more and more countries are sharing this view. I have to say in all of this is that it is never the Member States that are solely responsible; it is always the Commission that carries ultimate responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">We should welcome the Commission’s action plan with open arms. It is a good thing that common standards are introduced, that integrated control is in place, that there is better cooperation with national courts of auditors, and suchlike. We would also appreciate it, in a different connection, if the Commission were to identify risk areas in the budget, namely what the high-risk and low-risk areas are. It is therefore important that Member States should shoulder their political responsibility. This is something we also demand from the Commission itself. Not only the Director-General should sign for the annual accounts; we think that the Commissioner who is responsible for a specific policy area should also be required to add their signature.</p>
<p class="contents">I will have to speed through my speech because the clock is ticking. The President of the Court of Auditors once again published his annual report in November and made an interesting suggestion. He put forward the idea of a peer review, which means that ex-presidents of national courts of auditors should examine whether or not the methodology and working practices of their counterpart at European level are correct. We see this as important and applaud this suggestion; we are keen to play an active role in this with the European Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">There is yet more work to be done by the European Court of Auditors. In the discharge report, a specific request was made for two reports, in the first instance about the management of the funds granted by the European Union to the UN bodies. What is the added value for Europe if we give the money via the United Nations? Secondly, what is financial control like over there?</p>
<p class="contents">We also want the non-governmental organisation to be the subject of an investigation by the Court of Auditors for a change. What is the ‘non-governmental’ proportion in those non-governmental organisations? How much money do they have at their own disposal?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the next few years will prove crucial to the Commission. There must be a positive Statement of Assurance at some point.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful to the members of the Secretariat of COCOBU for their enormous efficiency and skill, and, needless to say, also to my personal staff. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Markus Ferber (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by saying that I was somewhat surprised that there seems to have been enough time for so many important things like one-minute speeches, while the question of whether European taxpayers' money is being spent properly is being dealt with around the evening suspension.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would have been happy if I could have reported today, like the rapporteur on the Commission's budget, that Parliament's authorities had done everything properly, and that we just had a few problems because many of the positions created in connection with the enlargement had not been filled, because we had the highest non-implementation rate, in other words transfers, ever seen in the history of Parliament's budget, and a few other issues.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last few days, however, a story has come to light that clearly needs to be brought up here because of its peculiarities. I do think it is wise that we are not going to discharge Parliament's budget at the present. However, I would also make it quite clear that I find it regrettable that the services of Parliament have not authorised a procedure that would have made it possible to explain why we are not discharging it. I think that what this Parliament's Legal Service delivered this afternoon in the Committee on Budgetary Control, against the interests of the Members – and, I might add, Mr Vice-President, against the interests of the Bureau – was unacceptable. It is an unacceptable situation, and that alone requires special consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">There is something else that is equally unacceptable. We need to look into whether the city of Strasbourg, in providing a property on which a Dutch pension fund has constructed a building, has concluded a rental agreement with us for a sum significantly different from the sum that it pays to the pension fund – and not to the detriment of Strasbourg, but to its benefit. To be absolutely clear, this is not about the issue of having the seat of Parliament in Strasbourg – that is laid down in the Treaties – but about whether it is really the purpose of such a sub-letting situation that, in the rent we are paying to the city of Strasbourg, we are giving a direct subsidy – for that is exactly what it would be – to the city's budget. Given that this agreement was not just signed yesterday but, if the information I currently have is correct, has been in place since 1980, we also need to look into the issue of who in this House already knew about the situation in the past and who failed to protect the interests of European tax-payers in this connection by concluding the rental agreement directly with the pension fund. If this had been done, we would have been able to rent the building more cheaply. If, therefore, anyone in this House knew about this and did not act in the interests of European tax-payers, that is worthy of particular scrutiny. That is exactly what we are going to do together.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I can really only request – it is just a request at the moment, though the Rules of Procedure provide other options for the later procedure – that the administration provide all the information it has at its disposal. I can also only request the city of Strasbourg to provide all the information it has and to cooperate very closely with Parliament on this matter. If it does not do so, and if the debate on this is used only as a pretext for arguing that the European Parliament is looking for a good opportunity to leave Strasbourg for good, then the city of Strasbourg itself will have contributed to an event that it did not want to occur.</p>
<p class="contents">That is really where my call is coming from – I read the city of Strasbourg's press release from this afternoon, and, from what I understood of it with my rudimentary French, this is not the kind of cooperation I have in mind. The city of Strasbourg is already profiting from the European Parliament without needing such payments. That is why I am asking them to cooperate with us to clear up the matter: it is the only way that we will be able to act in the interests of tax-payers, and we will then be able to draw the correct conclusions I therefore regret – although I should like to thank everyone who worked with me in preparing the report, the services, the Committee Secretariat and my fellow Members – that I have to recommend that you vote against the report tomorrow and do not give discharge in respect of the budget, so that we can look seriously into all the matters I have mentioned.</p>

This lack of confidence in the EU is, unfortunately, well deserved. The EU does not demonstrate a convincing resolve to clamp down on irregularities, fraud and the abuse of power in its institutions. In practice, there is little readiness to demand accountability. The instinct is to cover things up. Whistle-blowers lose their jobs instead of receiving praise. Cheating and scandals are not investigated, and no legal proceedings are brought in connection with those that are. Discharge is granted in spite of the fact that we do not know if everything has proceeded correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">A majority of this Chamber appears to want to conceal unpleasant truths about the European Union from people so that the EU does not become still more unpopular. That is a deeply undemocratic attitude. Our task is to elicit the truth and to demand accountability on our citizens’ behalf, not to conceal the truth from them.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur for the Committee on Budgetary Control, it was my job to work on the issue of granting discharge to ‘Other Institutions’, of which there are seven in total. I have found no reason for bringing the Ombudsman and the Data Protection Supervisor into question. Four of the remaining five institutions are open to criticism, but not of so serious a character that there is reason for questioning whether discharge should be granted. The Council, the European Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors and the European Economic and Social Committee are in this position. Where the Committee of the Regions is concerned, however, I find that further investigations are required before we can take a decision on the issue of granting discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of 2004, the European Economic and Social Committee had problems involving irregularities in relation to the reimbursement of members’ travelling expenses. We hope that this problem is now in the past. There have been problems with the Belliard I and II buildings, and I expect a full account of these in the Court of Auditors’ forthcoming report.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the Council is concerned, many of the risks are to be found, as usual, in administrative activities relating to the building projects in which the Council is involved. I want to take this opportunity to emphasise the advantages of renting buildings instead of engaging in such huge building projects ourselves. It would also be helpful if the Council were to come up with clearer definitions of, respectively, administrative and operational expenses.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Court of Justice’s internal audits were far from satisfactory during 2004. Its internal auditor also acted as the head of the ex-ante verification unit, which is quite simply unacceptable. Moreover, the internal auditor has not completed any of his investigations since he was appointed in 2003. Parliament expects to see energetic measures and strong improvements in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Court of Justice’s massive building projects at present under way cannot be anything other than a cause of disquiet. It is therefore essential that a complete and detailed progress report on this project be made to the Committee on Budgetary Control.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the Court does not at present require judges to declare their financial interests is unacceptable. Irrespective of whether or not there is at present any legal requirement for them to do so, the Court must prepare its own binding rules in this area. Regarding the use of official cars, Parliament again calls on the Court not to allow these to be used for private purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the Court of Auditors is concerned, the fact that a handful of large Luxembourg-based accounting firms are in a dominant position when it comes to scrutinising the Court’s accounts is worrying, although Parliament appreciates that it is difficult for the Court to avoid this situation. It is therefore extremely important for there to be an open, fair and comprehensible tendering procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors has problems with its organisational structure, which is in need of reform. This is something that needs to be got to grips with in the ongoing evaluation preparatory to overhauling the organisation of the Court, preferably in accordance with the proposal for reform devised by the British House of Lords.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, Parliament should call on the Court of Auditors not to permit the use of official cars for private purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to our black sheep, namely the Committee of the Regions which, of the ‘Other Institutions’ examined, has attracted the most criticism from the Court of Auditors. During 2004, the internal audit was in practice carried out by a single internal auditor, and a temporary one at that. An internal auditor dependent on a constantly renewable employment contract must find it very difficult to maintain his or her independence from the management of the organisation concerned. It is indefensible that the Committee of the Regions should not, then, have had a proper internal audit carried out during 2004, in spite of Parliament’s robust criticism of that institution in relation to 2003. We have still not received any explanation of the fact that the internal auditor employed up until May 2004 was in no position to produce any auditor’s reports.</p>
<p class="contents">There continues an OLAF investigation into the Committee of the Regions in connection with its reimbursement of members’ expenses, to which a correction coefficient was applied. Payments for which there was no underlying proof of entitlement had been granted. It seems obvious that this should have been discovered by the Committee of the Regions no later than in the course of 2004 and that these payments should then have been stopped. In spite of this, the Committee’s managers state that there is no question of there having been any cases of fraud. In connection with this matter, no clear information has been given, either, of measures having been taken to claim back incorrect payments. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that these payments were to people in key positions within the administration. In recent years, the Committee of the Regions has been partly characterised by irregularities of various kinds, showing that the promised culture change within the organisation has not taken place. It now looks as if OLAF will produce its final report in the middle of May. It would be irresponsible to grant discharge before we know the results of this investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">The reorganisation of the Committee of the Regions has in several cases meant that people involved in suspected irregularities have been promoted, which is also irregular.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors is continuing with its investigation in connection with the Belliard I and II buildings. The Montoyer project, too, should be examined. No explanation has been given to date as to why the person formerly responsible for infrastructure appears to have withdrawn his statement as authorising officer by subdelegation for the financial year 2004. It needs also to be explained to us why I as rapporteur was not informed of this, and it needs to be made clear to us how the date of theoretical acceptance was established. Should the damages claimed from the construction company have perhaps been higher? What is more, the Committee of the Regions’ internal auditor was refused access to the documents he had requested in this connection. There are strong reasons also for awaiting the outcome of the Court of Auditors’ ongoing investigation into the matter before we grant discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to take this opportunity to inform the Chamber of the odd way in which the Committee of the Regions has been treated by the Committee on Budgetary Control. I had received information from a variety of sources indicating that there was much more to be criticised in the Committee of the Regions’ area of financial responsibility than the Committee itself had provided information about. I therefore obtained the Committee on Budgetary Control’s agreement to our questioning OLAF’s investigators and the Committee of the Regions’ internal auditors for 2004 behind closed doors. The meeting was scheduled for the morning of Tuesday, 21 March 2006. The Committee on Budgetary Control met at 3 p.m. on the day before this and began by approving the agenda, whereupon a majority suddenly demanded that the questioning scheduled for the following morning should be cancelled.</p>
<p class="contents">A majority of members of the Committee on Budgetary Control refused, then, to study information that I, as rapporteur, considered to be of vital importance in adopting a position on the discharge issue. I did not find out why. I maintain that if the EU’s financial interests are to be protected, the committee needs to take on board all the relevant information on such issues. The majority of the Committee refused to study the information and then voted in favour of our proposing to Parliament that discharge be granted right now, in spite of the fact that I as rapporteur maintain that we should await the outcome of ongoing investigations by OLAF and the Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control have now had the opportunity to study documents indicating various irregularities. If Parliament still grants discharge, it will not then be possible subsequently to plead ignorance. Comparison might be made with what is now happening regarding the granting of discharge to the President in the light of the rents in Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">On this subject, Parliament is coming to the conclusion that new information has come to light that must be studied before a decision on discharge is taken. There is an exact parallel with the situation regarding the Committee of the Regions. The only difference is that the Strasbourg issue has found its way into the media. Do newspaper articles have to appear before there is a response from Members of the European Parliament? Should it not be obvious that Members will decide to vote against granting discharge to the Committee of the Regions until such time as all the uncertainties have been clarified?</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore appeal to all Members carefully to consider what they are voting on tomorrow. Because we have not had all the uncertainties clarified, I would call on you to vote against granting discharge for the Committee of the Regions’ implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2004. If there is a vote on the report, I would call on you to vote in favour of the amendments tabled by Mr Staes and myself with a view to obtaining the facts of the case. That is what we must do if we take seriously the demand for accountability, which is at the heart of the democratic process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgetary Control examines the implementation of these budgets of these funds and formulates its opinion on optimum administration with efficiency and transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth Funds for the financial year 2004 are concerned, taking account of the report by the Court of Auditors and our exchange of views with the Commission and the Commissioner himself, Mr Louis Michel, we propose discharge to the Commission. We also propose approval of the closing of the accounts of these funds for 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution proposed by our committee to plenary emphasises the importance of the European Development Funds to the European Union's contribution to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, with the primary objective of eradicating poverty. We express our concern at the fact that only EUR 12 million (0.4% of the budget) is earmarked for basic education and EUR 74 million (just 2.7%) for basic health, despite the recommendations made by the European Parliament in last year's resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important for us to promote the principles of democratisation, good governance and equal opportunities through the European Development Funds in order to achieve a double objective: firstly, the sustainable development of countries which benefit and, secondly, the more effective take-up of resources; this is incumbent upon the European Parliament as the House of elected representatives of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">These objectives concern both the European institutions and decentralised services in ACP countries which benefit from the funds and the national administration authorities and the parliaments of these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Another matter we refer to is that, as regards the funds managed by the European Investment Bank, which are not audited by the Court of Auditors or controlled by the European Parliament within the framework of the discharge procedure, we consider that it would enhance transparency and efficiency if information were provided and included in the reports of the European Investment Bank on the European Development Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">We also consider that the budgetisation of these funds would remove many of the complications and the management cost, and the implementation of successive funds will help to speed up disbursement and eliminate the relevant democratic deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also concerned about the sum which remains for clearance. It must be reduced by promoting flexible actions and with faster results.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we wish to enhance the visibility of the European Union's external action. European citizens are proud of this policy of solidarity and citizens of the developing world covet and need it. It is time for our political objectives and effective methods to be combined with better communication and visibility both as regards our actions as independent actions and within the framework of international organisations, at the UN, the World Bank and other bodies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Umberto Guidoni (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>–<span class="italic"> (IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has the important task of granting discharge for the financial year 2004 to 14 European agencies that are fully, partially or indirectly subsidised by the European Union. I shall not dwell here on the specific details or the problems that were found in each individual agency; I shall confine myself to mentioning those items that have emerged as the main points for a joint debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I take this opportunity to highlight what I have just said, which is that discharge is given to just 14 out of the 27 agencies that exist. Indeed, I wonder how many of you are actually up to date with how many such bodies there are and what their real functions are: not many of you, ladies and gentlemen, and I am sure that very few European citizens have any clear ideas on the subject. It might therefore be worth developing information campaigns for them about the agencies and their functions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no coincidence that, after the debate on my report in committee, a study was commissioned – it is still under way – to analyse and clarify the situations of the European agencies. The study is revealing what has already emerged from the report, namely a lack of harmonisation among the various agencies, and the likelihood of poor transparency associated with difficulties in Parliament’s control over them.</p>
<p class="contents">To that end, I have called on the Council in my report to start talks as soon as possible to conclude the draft interinstitutional agreement, which the Commission put forward at Parliament’s request. In the discharge report on the agencies for 2003, Parliament actually called for this institutional agreement to be set up in order to place all the agencies within a common regulatory framework.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Parliament’s powers to grant discharge, I have tried to underline the unfairness of the current situation and would recall that, under Article 185 of the Financial Regulation, Parliament gives discharge for the implementation of the budgets of the bodies set up by the Communities that have legal personality and actually receive grants charged to the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, it is important to note that not all of these bodies are fully or even partially funded via grants charged to the budget. The conclusion may therefore be drawn that the discharge decision covers both the budget and the non-budget funding of these bodies. The situation is clearly unacceptable, and it implies that some of the bodies set up by the Union are accountable for the way they spend income received from sources other than the budget, whilst others, which do not receive a subsidy from the budget, are not.</p>
<p class="contents">An amendment to the Financial Regulation that was proposed by me and adopted by the Committee on Budgetary Control has introduced this very principle. If the Regulation thus amended is adopted, Parliament will see its powers of control greatly expanded in the coming years, to the benefit of the principles of transparency and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The analyses carried out by the Court of Auditors were of great help in drawing up the reports. They revealed a few irregularities of very little significance, and I therefore endorse the decision of the Court of Auditors, which proposes granting discharge to the directors of all 14 agencies analysed. I am sorry to say, however, that the analysis that the Court was asked to provide is purely technical in nature, and there has been no control of the ways in which the allocated budget has been spent during the current year.</p>
<p class="contents">I have stressed this point in the working document accompanying the reports, where I propose that in subsequent years the Court of Auditors should supplement the current assessment with an evaluation of service quality, competences and activities: in other words how efficiently the individual agencies spend their budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the issues that have come up are recurrent, and we can therefore talk of a cross-cutting analysis of issues that have emerged across the various agencies. One such issue concerns the Financial Regulation, which was devised for the agencies, while the subsequent financial regulations specific to each agency were designed to adhere as closely as possible to the general Financial Regulation created by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this criterion is generally valid, it is sometimes not suited to the smallest agencies, for which appropriate reforms will be needed. That is one of the main objections made by the Court of Auditors. Personnel selection problems are also common to several agencies, since the agencies certainly require greater assistance than larger institutions. I therefore think it is important that the Commission should make the services of EPSO, the Commission’s Directorate-General for Personnel Selection, available to them, as well as supplying other cross-cutting services such as training and the legal service.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem concerns internal audits, which for some agencies are an excessive burden. I therefore believe the Commission should table a report on the current situation, describing both each agency’s current capacity for performing an internal audit and the internal audit services that the Commission can make available to the smallest agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I shall focus on an issue that has generated heated debate and has marked a divergence in thinking between Parliament and the Commission. The issue concerns the European Agency for Reconstruction, which was set up in 2000 to provide assistance for reconstruction, development and stability in the regions of Kosovo, Serbia, Montenegro and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia through the CARDS programme. Since the programme has come to an end, the Commission has decided to close the Agency by the end of 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the excellent work it has done in recent years, and in order to prevent the precious experience built up over many years of activity from being lost, I have in my report proposed extending its mandate so as to be able to use the agency to provide reconstruction assistance wherever required, for example in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, or even the countries recently affected by the tsunami. This would be in addition to the immediate humanitarian assistance provided by ECHO, the Commission’s department set up to help in the event of natural disasters or armed conflict in regions outside the EU. Well, then, I think that is more or less what there was to say about the report, which I hope will be adopted during the next sitting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today we are looking at a glass which is certainly only half full, but is gradually filling up.</p>
<p class="contents">This year, in addition to the positive endorsement of the European Union’s budget accounting, revenues, appropriations, administrative expenditures and the European Development Fund, the European Court of Auditors is quite satisfied with the supervision of agricultural expenditures and the aid granted to candidate states. The expenditures that the Court of Auditors approved of represent nearly one third of the European Union’s budget. I am pleased that this progress is also reflected in Parliament’s reports, and that it has been proposed that Parliament should approve the Commission’s implementation of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to express my sincere gratitude to rapporteurs Mr Jan Mulder, Mrs Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (who examined the European Development Fund) and Mr Szabolcs Fazakas, Chairman of Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control, who have skilfully guided the entire process. Parliament has drawn up an extensive list of recommendations for improvements. The Commission intends to observe most of these, and to report on this as required.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that the glass is not yet full, but Parliament supports the plan approved by the Commission in June 2005 to devise an integrated internal control framework, as well as the action plan approved by the Commission in January 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that we know what is missing, let me concentrate on the missing part. Firstly, I applaud Parliament for the text of the inter-institutional agreement, which arose as a result of negotiations held with the Council and for the first time mentions issues of budget control and endorsement.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that the implementation of this political agreement will require continued work, and the Commission certainly intends to do its utmost in the achievement of that objective.</p>
<p class="contents">We also seek to improve the expression of accountability vis-à-vis the European Parliament and the European taxpayer. We plan to devote a considerable amount of attention to three measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we will strengthen the procedure for the preparation of Annual Activity Reports and improve its consistency across General Directorates. We will also make amendments to the Synthesis Report, although not as elaborately as the European Parliament has recommended.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we will enhance transparency in the use of EU funds. Next week the Commission will adopt a Green Paper on the European Transparency Initiative. As part of the paper, the Commission will propose the introduction of an obligation on Member States to publish the list of beneficiaries of EU funds under shared management. To that end, the Commission will establish a centralised web portal.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we will continue to increase the participation of national auditing institutions. Last week, the Commission sent each of these national audit institutions detailed lists of all of the payments made to their respective Member States in 2005, also inviting them to share the results of their audits with the Commission and the Court of Auditors. This is an initial stage of the implementation of our Action Plan, and I know that several national auditing institutions are prepared to verify the sound use of EU funds in their countries. Thus the first steps have been taken in this direction, and I intend to raise this matter at the meeting of the coordinating committee of the European and national audit courts, to be held in Poland at the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, when I appeared before you last year I said that ‘mobilising and motivating the Member States will not be easy, and the Commission continues to need your support’. I have enjoyed that support in the past year, and I wish to confirm that we, for our part, will do our utmost. As a first step, we plan to follow the recommendations you will adopt today.</p>

The Committee on Development supports the opinion of the European Court of Auditors that objective, useful and clear indicators must be determined, which would enable the assessment of aid results, and it is hoped that such indicators will be prepared and implemented in the period 2007-2013. The Committee on Development views as positive the fact that a means of budgeting aid sectors has been found, which is a more effective alternative than general funding from the budget. However, based on the experience of the latest enlargement, the Committee on Development urges the Commission to ensure that development policy administrative management capacities in Bulgaria and Romania are reinforced before they join the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Upon assessment of the implementation of the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth European Development Funds for 2004, it must be stressed that there is also room for improvement here. The same as previously, the donor aid is being insufficiently coordinated, a results method still has to be prepared to evaluate Community members' cooperation, without which it is impossible to proceed to the desired ‘results based approach’, as we strive to implement the Millenium Development Goals.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point – the necessity for the Commission to have clearer proof of states' eligibility to receive aid, to strengthen cooperation with local representatives and to make use of indicators which encourage the effective use of public finance.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of development aid, there is a danger that up to 700 million euros will not be used by the end of 2007. At the same time, the Tenth European Development Fund is being increased and Member States are obliged to increase development aid. Therefore, just like in previous years, the Commission must put more effort into managing funds for the implementation of development policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, the Court of Auditors recommends that 'the Commission should also develop an explicit methodology for evaluating proposals submitted under TEN-T and publish it in a manual'. This is overdue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors also criticised the coordination, stating that 'the coordination of the various sources of Community funding for transport infrastructure projects by the various Directorates-General does not allow the Commission to detect all cases of over- or double funding'. In view of the tight budgetary situation, that is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to eliminate this problem, the Court of Auditors even makes some specific proposals: 'the Commission should establish appropriate legal bases, procedures and tools in order to improve the coordination of transport infrastructure funding and to identify potential cases of over- or double funding. This should be done, where necessary, in cooperation with the Member States'. To that I would add that responsible persons must be appointed at all levels, and consequences must be drawn.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also deficits with regard to road safety and passengers’ rights. In the case of road safety, only 60% of payment appropriations were used, and only 11% of the payment appropriations were spent on protecting passengers’ rights. That, too, must change in future.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by expressing my deep gratitude to the Court of Auditors. I call on the Commission to rectify these problems and accept the proposals, so that the annual tradition of criticism from the Court of Auditors can be broken next year. As EMSA states in the annexes, the maritime and aviation safety agencies should in future make better use of their available resources, although the agencies were still new and had certain teething problems in 2004. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gérard Deprez (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I should first like to express my appreciation for the work done by the different rapporteurs and, in particular, by Mr Mulder for the general budget and Mr Guidoni for the agencies. These are the two reports that directly address the issues that fall under the competence of our Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, as regards the general budget of the EU, I welcome the fact that Mr Mulder took on board in his report two crucial remarks in my opinion that were adopted by our Committee. The first of these remarks concerns the implementation rate of the budget in the ‘freedom, security and justice’ area, with particular regard to payments.</p>
<p class="contents">Although there was an improvement on 2003, when the rate was as low as 68%, the implementation rate of payments for 2004 remained inadequate at 83% and is clearly below the average rate of budget implementation. This led to a considerable increase in the amount outstanding (RAL) – from EUR 160 million to EUR 238 million. Obviously, the Directorate-General Justice, Freedom and Security must redouble its efforts to improve budget implementation. This will take on even greater importance in the context of the new financial perspective 2007-2013, assuming it is adopted soon by Parliament, as I hope it will be. Over the next seven years, the budgetary resources earmarked for the ‘freedom, security and justice’ area will be substantially increased, 163% being the biggest increase of any of the categories or sub-categories of the Union's general budget. The management of the Directorate-General Justice, Freedom and Security must be strengthened if it is to do justice to the political priority thus attached to the task of creating a genuine area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The second remark taken on board by the general rapporteur relates to the concerns expressed by the Court of Auditors about the way in which a number of Member States have made use of the European Fund for Refugees and, in particular, about the shortcomings of the national control systems in place. In this sector, as in many other shared management sectors, the Commission is obviously suffering more from the weakness of the Member States than from its own shortcomings. I welcome the fact that our general rapporteur opted to make this problem a key element of his report. The delegation from Parliament at the trialogue to renew the interinstitutional agreement was right to push for more specific commitments from the Council and the Member States as regards the monitoring of funds subject to shared management. Unfortunately, we are aware that the results have not matched our expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say a few words about the agencies, of which there are many in the ‘freedom, security and justice’ area. If one leaves out Europol – and I should like to take this opportunity, as I do every opportunity, to remind the Chamber of our call to transform this from a merely intergovernmental body, as it is at present, into a Community agency, at the earliest opportunity – if one leaves out Europol, there are no less than four agencies operating in the ‘freedom, security and justice’ area, and that does not include the European Police College (CEPOL). These four agencies are the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, the European Agency for the Management of the External Borders and Eurojust.</p>
<p class="contents">Our rapporteur for the discharge for the implementation of the budget of the agencies, Mr Guidoni, is certainly aware that the agencies – and he said this a moment ago – are not always well received by some Members and the general public. He wrote in his report, and I quote: ‘the Community’s agencies do not always have a good image or receive a good press’. He went on to say, and I support him in this regard, that some of them do not deserve this negative image and that it would be appropriate to make EU citizens aware of the fact by using the appropriate channels as often as is necessary to justify the existence of these agencies and to draw attention to their results.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur for the Committee on Civil Liberties, let me state very clearly that, in my view, and setting aside some justified criticisms of the Vienna agency, the agencies that fall within our sector are well managed. Their work is of high quality, and I do not see what other structures could do a better job of performing the specific tasks accorded to the existing agencies. This is true, for example, of the Frontex agency for the control of external borders and Eurojust for the improvement of judicial cooperation. I also wish to take this opportunity to announce – although I am jumping the gun, ahead of another debate – that I shall be tabling proposals to strengthen the agencies in question within the framework of the 2007 budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The recent echoes we have heard relating to the purchase of the two different office buildings in Strasbourg show that more information on the sub-letting of these buildings by the City of Strasbourg is definitely needed.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears that the European Parliament might have been considerably overcharged by the City of Strasbourg, which has rented the buildings from a property fund. Yearly, this overcharging might have yielded EUR 2.7 million. This might have been going on for 25 years. I think it is scandalous: not only the subject matter, but the fact that this information has been hidden from us in Parliament until now.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament should conduct a thorough inquiry to find out as soon as possible if the allegations of overcharging by the City of Strasbourg are true. If this turns out to be the case, the European Parliament should immediately consider taking appropriate legal action against the City of Strasbourg. Moreover, I have been surprised to hear that the Mayor of Strasbourg has refused to answer the questions of the Vice-President of this House on this matter. I wonder how the communication policy of the City of Strasbourg – usually so prompt, cautious and even pampering towards MEPs – changed so suddenly.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I would like to say that, in general, the budget discharge reports do not give enough relevant information as to how the budget has succeeded in promoting equal opportunities for women in the enlarged Union, nor do they provide the possibility of assessing the impact of the budget from a gender perspective, despite the request of this House on gender budgeting. In the future, relevant information on gender mainstreaming policies should be delivered by the Commission and this information should be included in the budget discharge reports. We have demanded it so many times; I think it is time for the Commission to do this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My first point is that the timing of this debate is a disgrace: it was supposed to start at 6 p.m. and it is now 9.30 p.m. It is going to go on all evening. It is one of the most important issues that we have. Are we trying to hide something from the public?</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that I am the shadow rapporteur on the Mulder report on discharge for the Commission. I should like to congratulate my colleague and friend, Mr Mulder, on an excellent report and I would like to point out that 80% of money misuse is still happening in the Member States. The Commission is doing an excellent job. It is not more control we need, but better control.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and final point concerns discharge for the European Parliament. I have four points on that. Firstly, it is very important that at this stage we stick to the facts. We should start researching to see what actually happened. It is very easy for all of us to wonder whether Strasbourg is the right seat or not. I do not think that is the issue right now. Let us look at what really happened. Secondly, there are two issues at stake here: we need to look at what the administration of the European Parliament has done in the past 25 years, and we need to look at what the city of Strasbourg has done. It certainly looks as if it has violated the spirit of the agreement we have with the city itself. Thirdly, we need more information. I agree with Mr Ferber, the rapporteur on this issue, who said recently that the press release from Strasbourg – to which Mrs Kauppi referred – is <span class="italic">absolutely pathetic</span>. They need to give a lot more information or they need to change their whole public relations department. It gives us no information about what actually happened.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we should vote against discharge for the European Parliament and begin the investigation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(DA) </span>– Mr President, I should also like to begin by endorsing what Mr Stubb said. It is scandalous that we should be debating such an important matter as the discharge procedure at such a late hour after having had one-minute speeches on subjects such as whether Mr Prodi was a KGB agent. I have to say – with a touch of black humour that nonetheless contains a grain of truth – that, on this particular occasion, it is perhaps just as well that people outside our building are not interested in what we are doing, as we should be a laughing stock, I believe, if anyone could actually see to what we were giving priority on the agenda in preference to this extremely important matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank Mr Mulder, who has done an outstanding job on his report. I think that the whole process has been helpful and constructive. Only in that way is it possible to achieve as impressive a result as he has achieved, and one that will obtain a large majority in Parliament. The discharge procedure is an extremely important one. I also wish to endorse his recommendation that we naturally grant the Commission discharge. Obviously, it must be accompanied by a number of observations because, this year too, the basic issue of our dissatisfaction arises. Unfortunately, not enough has been done. There are unfortunately too many areas in which we still cannot give satisfactory assurances that European taxpayers’ money is being properly administered.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, there are nonetheless grounds for optimism. There are a number of areas in which progress is being made. Take, for example, the Integrated Administrative Control System within the agricultural sphere, in which a procedure has been set in motion that has in actual fact proved to be effective and that, into the bargain, has for the first time caused the Court of Auditors to write directly in its report that there has been significant progress in this area. Praise is obviously in order.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also reason for pointing out in this connection that, under this procedure and specifically with regard to our demand for an annual statement of assurance from the individual Member States, an agreement along the lines we wanted has, in relation to the financial perspective, now been reached between the various institutions. That is something else about which we should, of course, be pleased.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to say a few words about what has been closest to my own heart in this process, namely compliance with our demand for more transparency and openness. What is at issue here are the Commission’s working parties and the many committees that come under the umbrella of the Commission. We are concerned too with the individual countries in relation to the money paid out. On this point, I am very pleased with the assurances I see the Commissioners as having given today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to remind you that last year, also in April, we voted on the approval of the European Parliament Budget for 2003, where I was the principal rapporteur. And I proposed that the European Parliament should abandon its work in Strasbourg. Today, I am the shadow rapporteur and I would like to remind you, that last year Members of the European Parliament decided to retain three work places and to continue sessions in Strasbourg. Each year, such work or its organisation costs the Community's citizens EUR 200 million. Mr President, do we have the right to be surprised then that Strasbourg city authority is trying to obtain an unrealistically high price for buildings? I do not think so because we encouraged it to take such actions ourselves. The retention of the European Parliament Headquarters in Strasbourg is condemned to continue losing money until we give it up. It is nothing new that there are economic subjects or persons, who commit fraud or even become corrupt. But often they are encouraged to behave in this way by a monopoly situation, illogical laws or political decisions. We ourselves, my fellow Members of Parliament, decided to use the buildings in Strasbourg knowing that they will cost an unjustifiably huge amount of money and will mean losses for the city and its people, as we only use those buildings for a few days a month. This is elementary economic logic. Many times it has been calculated and argued that if another institution were to move into the European Parliament buildings, working all year long, then this would be of more benefit to the city economically and financially. Therefore, we must accept that we all know this, but for some reason we do not want to change the situation. I believe that the people of Strasbourg, like all the other citizens of the Community, have become the hostages of incorrect decisions we have made ourselves. I support the proposal to postpone the approval of the European Parliament budget until we have examined how many more losses the people of Europe have experienced. It is very important to ascertain whether there has been corruption or violations of laws and agreements, but it is far more important, honourable Members of Parliament, to finally make the decision to give up this unjustifiable, shameful waste of European people's money. We have to work effectively in one place and we must use money where it is most needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I should like to draw your attention to the amendments I have tabled in connection with the Mulder and Guidoni reports on the agency for reconstruction in the former Yugoslavia. When we visited Kosovo with an <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> delegation in February, we saw for ourselves the outstanding work that the reconstruction agency had carried out, and we should not simply disregard its expertise. Hence the request, certainly at this crucial juncture when Kosovo is likely to gain independence this year, not to phase out this agency straight away, but to do it gradually and apply the expertise to other conflict areas in the world, including Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to Parliament’s discharge, I should like to make a point of underlining Mr Ferber’s excellent input. He has produced a sterling report. His draft report was even better than the report that was ultimately voted on by COCOBU, but it has to be said that there are new revelations which need investigating. This means that ultimately, we will need to vote against his report and against the granting of discharge. I would like to make it absolutely clear that this does not detract from Mr Ferber’s work or from COCOBU’s observations, but is a clearly precautionary measure in order to give ourselves six months to find out what exactly happened and hopefully, we, along with the city of Strasbourg, the French Government, the administration of this House, and with everyone involved, will be able to draw the conclusions in complete transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns the Committee of the Regions. I regret the fact that we did not, prior to the vote in committee, have a hearing with two auditors who would have attended at Mr Lundgren’s request and who would have put to us any irregularities and possible fraud. Instead, there is now in Parliament’s secret chamber a chunky, confidential document that suggests that something may be amiss. This too requires thorough investigation, and so I would ask not only my colleagues, but also this House as a whole, to vote against the Committee of the Regions’ discharge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament’s budget for 2004 was EUR 1 231 million. If Parliament had just one language and just one place of business, 60% of this expenditure would be saved. Holding Parliament’s plenary part-sessions in Strasbourg costs more than EUR 200 million. Of that, some EUR 10 million is spent on rent for the Salvador de Madariaga and Winston Churchill buildings. Parliament receives 20% of all EU administrative expenditure for its own use. That is such a lot of money that not all of it can be easily spent.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of last year, there was an EUR 85 million surplus of cash remaining in Parliament’s budget, a surplus for which a use had to be quickly thought up. The Bureau finally proposed the purchase of the Madariaga and Churchill buildings. These were owned by SCI-Erasme, a Dutch pension fund, or its subsidiary. Parliament, however, paid rent to the city of Strasbourg. During the purchase negotiations, it emerged that for a quarter of a century the city had been charging Parliament more than it paid to Erasme. The city of Strasbourg was therefore cashing in on the fact that Parliament had its premises in the city. The city has refused to say how much extra money was generated in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation is intolerable. Our group supports a full and thorough investigation into this. With that purpose in mind, we are prepared to reject Mr Ferber’s report and refer it back to the Committee for further deliberation. Because of the new areas of confusion that have emerged, we ought to do the same with regard to the report on discharge for the Committee of the Regions drafted by Mr Lundgren. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their efforts have been admirable and quite extraordinarily extensive. As has been said, the work has, moreover, been something of an uphill struggle.</p>
<p class="contents">Information has now come to light indicating that Strasbourg wrongly charged Parliament rent for a number of years. I wish to emphasise that, before discharge can be granted, Strasbourg must give Parliament access to all the documents concerning the relevant buildings. If it does not, Parliament must take the matter to OLAF. What is more, Parliament must not of course sign any contract of sale until this issue has been clarified.</p>
<p class="contents">If the EU institutions had had a clear willingness to investigate and to demand accountability and if the Committee on Budgetary Control had carried out its task properly and acted as the scrutinising body it is supposed to be, these things need not have happened. There must be a clear willingness thoroughly to investigate irregularities whenever they occur, and not just when the media has got wind of them.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to add that, in its treatment of Mr Ferber’s report, the Committee on Budgetary Control airbrushed out the report’s criticisms of MEPs’ voluntary pensions system. It is a system with no legal basis and no provisions regarding what should be done about deficits in the fund. It is unfair that European taxpayers should be made liable for covering deficits in the pension fund. The fact that Members’ contributions to the system are paid from Parliament’s system for refunding general expenses is also remarkable. What needs to happen is for members of the fund to pay their contributions out of their personal income. The system should be abolished. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Camre, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the UEN Group.</span> –<span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, I should firstly like to thank my fellow Member, Mr Mulder, for all the painstaking work he has done, as well as thank the other rapporteurs. It is, of course, regrettable that, this year again, we do not have a straightforward statement of assurance. As is well known, the EU should ideally be a model for the Member States, especially for the new countries with new and untried administrations. I doubt, however, whether we are being a particularly good model, given the major problem that exists of our not yet being able to present a straightforward statement of assurance. I agree with Mr Mulder’s observation that it is unsatisfactory that the Member States are not prepared to issue statements concerning the supervision of the resources they have received. We must ensure that this is done.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, of course, also the case that responsibility for the administration cannot lie with the Commission alone but that the Council and the Member States also bear some responsibility. There are a number of situations or cases in which I am unable to recommend granting discharge, simply because we would then be granting this in the dark. In some areas we are taking on tasks that, in reality, we cannot carry out. Proof of that is the situation concerning Parliament’s accounts, as described today by Mr Ferber. Yesterday we were certain that everything was in order and we were ready to grant discharge, but in the course of the night we knew better.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of course by pure chance that we are now in a situation in which we must ask for the discharge to be postponed because we simply do not know enough. It is of course quite odd that, for 25 years, both Parliament’s administration and our audit department have overlooked – at least they say they have done so – an extremely dubious payment to the city of Strasbourg. This is, of course, in reality a payment to a quite superfluous middleman, and if anyone in our administration would have us believe they did not know this, I have to say that I do not believe that the administration is so incompetent.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, it has to be asked whether it really is possible to enter into such financial agreements without carefully evaluating the various options and offers. No, of course it is not. Someone has helped someone else obtain an illicit dollop of taxpayers’ money, and, if I know the system, no one will be held liable because, of course, no one knew anything. As the Commission’s previous President, Mr Prodi, said about the Eurostat scandal: what one does not know about, one cannot be held liable for. Do not, then, read through the contracts. In that way you can always say that you did not know anything and so be free from liability.</p>
<p class="contents">As I say, we could have got away with granting discharge, but we are not going to grant it. I am able to recommend that the granting of discharge be postponed, as proposed by Mr Ferber. As for the other areas, our attitude is described in the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Almost 100 million people are currently watching live – not here, but inside in front of the television where the rest of the world is – watching Barcelona against Milan; the score is 0:0, by the way. And here? I can see three girls here and 11 boys – and one of them was specifically asked to stay. One wonders what is political about this debate: this is a matter of substance. This is about – if we take it seriously, which we are not doing to judge by the yawns of the Commission – the discharge, about billions of euros.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know, though – if we really look closely – that nobody here can in good conscience, if he has a conscience at all, agree to the discharge. We are all well aware of the 'you scratch my back, and I will scratch yours' attitude. We know that we have allowed this Europe, this Union, to be steamrollered by a Mafia-like system where everybody, quite logically, does just what everybody else is doing. What, then, is so terrible about the city of Strasbourg? They are just doing exactly what many of the Members of this Parliament have done too: they are cashing in a bit. What is happening here is dangerous, very dangerous.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixty-one years after the end of the war, we are drifting towards the end of democracy and prosperity for large sections of the population in Europe, because we just let things slide, because the Anti-Fraud Commissioner Mr Kallas cannot implement the European transparency initiative about which he has been speaking because his hands are always tied, precisely because there is no more leadership in politics. Tomorrow, please listen to the conscience that you at least used to have when you entered politics, and reject all the so-called discharge reports.</p>

<p class="contents">I feel it would be opportune to raise a number of points concerning the implementation of the agencies' budget. The first point I should like to make is that out of the 30 existing agencies only 14 are subject to our control. It is vital, in my view, that the remaining 16, whose budgets are also funded by European taxpayers, should be submitted for Parliament to discharge. Furthermore, the enlargement to 25 Member States has increased the burden on the agencies, yet they have not been given the necessary resources to be able to function effectively. We need to take an understanding approach to these agencies in light of the rather special circumstances surrounding this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, contentious issues that crop up repeatedly must be dealt with quickly. Examples of this include the Environment Agency and the EUR 906 000 in taxes wrongly collected by the city of Copenhagen between 2000 and 2004, and the Translation Centre for the bodies of the EU and the disputed EUR 7.5 million – that is to say, a quarter of its annual budget – in respect of the payment of employers’ taxes. These facts have been known for several years but nothing practical has been done about them. This is totally unacceptable. As for the future of the Agency for Reconstruction, namely the gradual winding up of its activities in 2008 as laid down by the Commission, I personally do not see any problem with this, in light of the fact that the agency had originally been declared provisional.</p>
<p class="contents">Like some of my fellow Members, I could not go without mentioning the issue on everyone’s lips – the city of Strasbourg. The legitimacy of Parliament’s seat is not in any way called into question today, and in any case this would not fall within the remit of Parliament or its Members. Let me state that the location of the seat is based on the Treaties; it is therefore absolutely not under discussion today.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, the stories circulating of late about the excessive rent that the city of Strasbourg has been charging Parliament for 25 years must be brought fully out into the open. A parliamentary inquiry committee should therefore be set up and the matter referred to OLAF. All of the parties involved – Parliament’s services, the city of Strasbourg, the French and European monitoring bodies – must provide us with as much additional information as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So firstly let me start by repeating the criticism that a number of Members of this House have made concerning the timing of this debate. It is a scandal that we are not having this debate at a time that would do justice to the importance of the reports that we are discussing.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to agree with Mr Staes in saying that Mr Ferber’s report was excellent. The PSE Group has absolutely no problems with the report as it is presented right now. It calls for an assistants’ statute and a dialogue with the Bureau about their political role: these are all things that we welcome. However, I think that we will see an overwhelming majority from all the political groups behind his proposal not to grant discharge tomorrow, and I welcome that. It is only right.</p>
<p class="contents">It is only right that we will not grant discharge to a report that would say that it is ok that we pay X amount of rent that we now all know is probably too high. In fact I do not agree with the Members that said that the press statement that Strasbourg sent out today is only adding to the lack of clarity. It is very clear what they are saying. It says here on the second page of the press statement that they need money for services rendered and that there is a risk of the building at one point being empty and that risk needs to be financed. I am sorry, but where was the invoice for this? We are the Budgetary Control Committee! We are supposed to check these things, so that is what we are going to be doing.</p>
<p class="contents">Another paragraph states that Julian Priestley’s decision to stop paying the rent is actually a breach of the contract. I would like to see the contract which states that what we have been paying is the right amount of money. If it is not the right amount of money, it is only right that we have this committee of inquiry.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore I welcome the decision to start this working party. I also agree with Mr Stubb that it is not a discussion about Strasbourg as our seat, but we all know that it will at some point become a discussion about our seat. We should all keep cool heads, but my opinion about that latter issue is clear to everybody in this room that wants to know. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It must be stressed that the endorsement of their financial accounts only reflects the agencies' financial situation, but in order to comprehensively assess the use of agency funds, an audit of the activities of these agencies must be carried out. After all, the agencies must spend the money appropriately.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, when reading the audit report, it is completely unclear why one agency was able to carry out several checks in places, and another just a few. Why in one agency there is one particular employee ratio involved in administrative and operational activities, and in another agency there is a different one.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this, in particular the auditors' certification that part of the budget is to be carried over to next year, indicates that the agencies are not managing funds effectively. Therefore, I would like to propose that the European Court of Auditors debate the possibility of broadening its special annual reports on the agencies and of including in these a ‘cost-benefit’ analysis of the agencies' activities.</p>
<p class="contents">I dare doubt whether institutions with activities like agencies, that is they are not accountable to anyone, are characteristic of an EU which promotes democratic values. Mr Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, often comes to my Committee – on Economy – to respond to questions posed by Members of the European Parliament. He is accountable via MEPs to the citizens of the European Union. However, the heads of the agencies are not accountable to anyone, and in its answers to the European Court of Auditors' comments on faults found, the Commission points out that it can only help agencies to solve these problems, but the agencies themselves have to decide whether or not they will implement the auditors' recommendations. I believe that they ought to be accountable to the appropriate committees in the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a huge scandal we have here, what with the rents and Strasbourg. I obviously share the view that discharge cannot be granted under these circumstances. It is not enough merely to postpone discharge. Rather, we must also resolve all the uncertainties before the issue can finally be settled.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not, however, the only reason for denying discharge to our own institution. The fact is that the report on discharge has had an airbrush applied to it, and a lot of the serious criticism of the pensions system has been removed. I think that this criticism alone is reason enough for denying the European Parliament discharge. It is not only that our pensions system has no legal basis and is not paid for out of our salaries. It is also badly regulated and has huge deficits paid for by the taxpayers. Moreover, no account has been taken of the Court of Auditors’ criticism. This issue too must be investigated further in the course of the work that lies ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have received a very extensive report from the European Court of Auditors. Over a dozen reports have also been presented in this Chamber concerning the implementation of the 2004 budget. Despite this wealth of material, however, we still know very little about how the budget was actually implemented and how the funds included in it were spent.</p>
<p class="contents">This is due firstly to the fact that the information in the report from the Court of Auditors has a rather general character, because the Court investigates mainly the compliance of accounting entries, or what is known as ‘accounting reality’, and that, as life shows, is often at odds with objective reality. Secondly, the post-audit findings of the Court often do not answer the most important questions in terms of evaluating the rational implementation of the budget. Such questions include what funds are spent on, whether the goals set have really been met by means of these funds, whether there have been any misappropriations of funds, and, finally, whether any funds have been wasted. Finding answers to these questions is essential in order to evaluate the implementation of the budget in a matter-of-fact manner.</p>
<p class="contents">The degree to which this information is needed is illustrated by the findings of the direct audit carried out by auditors of the European Court of Auditors regarding the implementation of the Tacis programme. Almost EUR 7 billion was spent on this programme between 1991 and 2005. The programme was supposed to provide financial support to European Union partner countries from Eastern Europe and Central Asia undergoing transformations. For example, in 2005 these countries included Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. With the programme’s help, 29 precisely defined goals were meant to be achieved. Auditors of the Court found that only five were achieved. If the majority of programmes funded under the European Union budget were audited in such a way, we would be able to determine how rationally and effectively EU funds are spent.</p>
<p class="contents">Even such a general audit allowed the European Court of Auditors, for the 11th time in a row I would like to stress, to state that the accounts presented are not free of faults. It would appear, therefore, that the European Union needs a comprehensive system of expenditure auditing, with extensive involvement of the national auditing institutions in the Member States. Only reports prepared under this kind of system would allow the aforementioned questions to be answered, and the conclusions of such audits could help to improve the effectiveness of budget spending in future years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a deception I have to say being perpetrated on both the regions of Europe and the EU by some national governments, not least the government of my country, the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">EU funds are required by Article 11 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 to be truly additional, and not deployed to replace domestic funds. Yet this is not how EU funds are being applied. I have in my hand a letter from the Finance Minister in my region which admits that EU funds acquired for Northern Ireland are diverted instead directly into the UK central Exchequer and are thereby used to reduce the level of UK-wide taxation and borrowing that is then necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">That defeats additionality and cheats a region like mine out of funds intended by Europe to provide true additional expenditure there. I would therefore call for the regulation governing the new financial perspective from 2007 to expressly require Member States to demonstrate that true additionality is delivered to the regions in whose name funding is claimed from Europe. Only then will the objective of obtaining genuine economic impact be secured for those regions. This cheating of the regions has gone on for years.

I appreciate the essentially positive and cooperative approach of the Committee of the Regions, manifested in the fact that it did not make any attempts to avoid or minimise its responsibility for the deficiencies uncovered in previous years and in the course of this year. It must be mentioned that some of the irregularities – namely the delay in appointing the internal auditor – were due to external factors, and in such cases, the Committee cannot be found responsible. As regards the property issue that causes the difficulty, the Committee of the Regions does not have an individual, independent responsibility, and our Parliament would not be consistent or constructive, either, if it criticised one institution for something that the other institution administering the same property, the Economic and Social Committee, is not being criticised for.</p>
<p class="contents">It is reassuring that due to work of the expert committee of our Parliament and to the partially excellent work of the rapporteur, the irregularities that have been found are already examined by the competent financial authorities. Under these circumstances, I do not see the necessity or benefit of adjourning the discharge. In the course of the work of the expert committee preceding this debate, we have already debated everything that can be debated within the competence of our institution, and the adjournment would not assist our own work, the work of OLAF or the operation of the Committee of the Regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The comprehensive report of the Court of Auditors regarding the draft on property management, under preparation, provides us with a definite guarantee. I believe that a constructive approach would be more expedient: let us value the positive steps taken by the Committee of the Regions in answer to our earlier proposals, appreciate their cooperative attitude and give them a vote of confidence, trusting them to continue their work in a similar spirit, as we are preparing to do just that in respect of all the other institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to add, in one final sentence, that my position regarding all the previously debated Strasbourg issues, too, is that our conclusions cannot not be based on feelings, but exclusively on facts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But it is very important that we reassure the citizens that money is properly spent. Why is this debate being held at night? Does somebody want to protect the City of Strasbourg? Do not give me the answer now; I would simply ask that, when we hold this debate again in six months time, if we do in fact delay the discharge of the budget, the debate should be at prime time, before the newspapers have gone to print, as they have on this occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate on such an important issue is being eclipsed by the problem we are facing in relation to the City of Strasbourg, which benefits greatly from having the European Parliament there twelve weeks per year. Paris protects it. That is why it has transferred the <span class="italic">École Nationale d’Administration</span> from Paris to Strasbourg. Why? It wants to revitalise Strasbourg; we understand its interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The City of Strasbourg, as Mr Stubb has said, has published a note. If the note is intended to explain the difference between the money paid by Parliament and what the owners of the building receive, we must ask them for 'our money back', to use Margaret Thatcher’s terms<span class="italic">.</span> Fortunately, we know who has the over-paid money and where it is, and fortunately they are in a position of solvency.</p>
<p class="contents">If the investigation that will have to look into this incomprehensible imbalance concludes that the City of Strasbourg must return the money, I am sure that it will do so and that the French authorities will do so.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate is very important. I remember when Mrs Cresson, former Socialist Prime Minister of France, here in this Parliament, refused to accept that she had spent some of the money for which she was responsible badly. In the end, the courts obliged Mrs Cresson to take responsibility, and at that point the whole of the Commission had to take collective responsibility. I hope that things do not go so far this time. I am sure that the City of Strasbourg will do what it must do to return the money, if its only arguments are really those expressed in this feeble press release that it has sent us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The wording within those paragraphs is very significant, especially in paragraph 26, which mentions encouraging national parliaments to be involved in monitoring European Union funds. I would hope that the Committee on Budgetary Control will pursue that and encourage our colleagues in national parliaments to have a real dialogue with us on this. I say that because of what the Council’s attitude has always been towards this.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also to congratulate our colleagues on the trialogue who got the agreement within the interinstitutional agreement on the declarations – although they do not use that particular word. However, I am informed – and perhaps Mr Kallas could confirm this – that five Member States have said that they will not comply with what has been agreed in the interinstitutional agreement. Among those Member States I am told that Spain, Belgium, Germany, France and perhaps Italy have said that whatever it says in the IIA about giving annual statements, they will not be doing it.

We should not commit the mistake of jumping to premature conclusions. This is the time to investigate, to ask the questions and to get the answers so that we can throw full light on what has happened.</p>
<p class="contents">Let there be no doubt that we shall be asking all the pertinent questions and we shall expect full and adequate replies. If it is found that Parliament was indeed overcharged, then we shall not hesitate to say as Mr Pomés Ruiz reminded us, that we want our money back. This is taxpayers’ money and we shall certainly ask for it to be paid back.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the rapporteur’s proposal to vote against the discharge and consequently postpone it because we have no other option. This could have been avoided had the Budgetary Control Committee been informed about these allegations before adopting its report on the discharge of Parliament’s budget a month ago. In the event, the Budgetary Control Committee adopted its report in blissful ignorance of what was going on.</p>
<p class="contents">So our immediate task is to investigate these matters urgently, thoroughly and transparently so as to ensure that the financial interests of the European Union, but also of European taxpayers, are adequately protected. This is what taxpayers expect from us today.</p>

<p class="contents">On the very eve of this debate we have been faced with some information that is appearing in the press ... I can tell you that things sometimes appear in the press in Spain that are not really 100% true or which have been manipulated; therefore, since the Committee on Budgetary Control, the Legal Service — and quite rightly at this point, I believe — has advised us not to vote, since it was not our report, but rather plenary’s – since once we have voted for Mr Ferber’s report it becomes plenary’s report – I would ask the Members and Mr Ferber in particular — though I cannot see him in the Chamber at the moment — not to make us vote to discharge, when it does not really mean a discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask Mr Ferber to avoid a vote which may be ambiguous, wrongly interpreted and manipulated once again by the press. Instead, I would ask you, before the vote, to consider the possibility of the referral of your report back to the Committee on Budgetary Control, which has not been able to deal with it today, precisely because it was plenary that could decide on it; but to ask plenary to return it to us before recording a negative vote, which means something different: voting no to something without having clarified why we are voting no.</p>
<p class="contents">I would prefer it, therefore, Mr President, if possible, if Parliament’s services and my fellow Members could guarantee that possibility; that before voting no in a manner that could be interpreted as a badly prepared ‘no’, since we only received this information yesterday, we could prevent that by returning this report to the Committee on Budgetary Control, which would do its work again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Eleven years running with no positive statement of assurance, no signing off of the accounts by the Court of Auditors and barely a mention of this in this debate, which is much too short and exactly at the wrong time of the day for any interest from other Members of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">But, alas, I have to talk about the hot topic of the day, which is, of course, the City of Strasbourg. It is bad enough that we have to migrate with this travelling circus 12 times a year to the City of Strasbourg – delightful though the place may be. But to be swindled for the pleasure of doing it is really adding insult to injury. Then again, who can blame the City of Strasbourg for trying it on with the European Parliament?</p>
<p class="contents">We have hardly shown more than a passing interest in the way that we or other EU institutions spend EU taxpayers’ money. Just look at the blasé attitude we take on how money is spent in the Committee of the Regions, where we have had two internal auditors report problems to us and our action was, and is, to do nothing. We have a track record of ignoring whistleblowers and financial problems alike and we are now faced with this.</p>
<p class="contents">For the last 27 years it seems we have failed to check whether we have been spending European taxpayers’ money properly. Supposedly we, the democratic check of the European Union, the pillar of the budgetary authority, have had the wool pulled over our eyes in what is essentially a simple rent scam.</p>
<p class="contents">For the past few years I have tabled amendments for various reasons to postpone or not sign off the Commission’s and Parliament’s accounts. I did this because my party at home simply did not believe that taxpayers’ money was being spent properly or accounted for properly. Alas, we have been proven to be correct.</p>
<p class="contents">So what now? I agree so far with the measures taken and I fully agree to the postponement of the report. However, each of us, especially those who have served for more than one term here, should think about our actions or inaction in the past to properly check where money has been spent. This inaction has contributed to this current problem where we have not questioned whether the rent we pay is too high – a simple question really – and one that many of our constituents ask each and every week. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, even the Commission cannot pride itself on a completely flawless financial record during the period in question. There are questions regarding the Commission's bookkeeping: they have unofficial commercial accounts that we know nothing about, that are not entered in the Commission's balance sheet and that give the impression of an incomplete discharge report. Tomorrow, Mr Mulder will, at my request, submit two oral amendments in which Parliament calls for a report on these accounts and for them to be audited and included in the balance sheet and the budget. I would ask you to support these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">We ask the Commission to inform us as soon as possible of what is going on with these accounts, and we are grateful to them for trying to settle this themselves. Commendably, they carried out a written survey among their financial staff in October 2005, with the aim of identifying accounts and their authorised signatories, and specifically those accounts that are directly or indirectly connected with the Commission's activities and that were previously unknown. In Germany we would call them 'black accounts'.</p>
<p class="contents">These accounts are very varied – some of them were already known about, but not by everybody, but some of them were previously completely unknown. The accounts that were already known include rental income from the former Commission supermarket 'Economat' in the Commission's premises on Rue de la Science, which has now been privatised. That brings in several million euros. The fact that access to these accounts is unclear is a cause for concern, and I therefore call for a rapid explanation – more rapid than the Commission has managed in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Many questions remain unanswered, such as why these accounts were, in the past, run without the knowledge or control of the Commission by people who were obviously not authorised to do so. It would also be nice to know how many of these accounts there actually are. We know – allegedly – how many of them were known about, but we do not know how many were completely unknown. It would be interesting to find out why these accounts were not identified in the budget. I do not need to emphasise how astounding I find it that these quite considerable sums were removed from the hands of the budgetary authority with democratic legitimacy in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has made a number of recommendations for improvements in the discharge procedure, starting with an amendment he has tabled that aims to enable the Commission to fine those countries that fail to pay up the agricultural premiums. I would like to hear what the Commission has to say about this. My delegation will, at any rate, be voting in favour of the amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">The second compelling point in his report is that he wants the finance ministers of the Member States to sign for any spending themselves. This is something that receives our unqualified support. That is the only way of ensuring that the discharge of the European budget will be dealt with adequately, and we have much appreciation for this report for that reason.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point is Parliament’s discharge and the discussion that has come about surrounding Strasbourg. It is common knowledge that the whole discussion surrounding the European budget in the Netherlands has been greatly influenced by the fact that we still have three locations where Parliament sits or has offices. We are shocked by what has happened in Strasbourg. Once again, this must be cleared up and I am convinced that our rapporteur, Mr Ferber, will succeed in this. This shows once again, though, that we are the only Parliament in the world that has offices, or meets, in three locations – the only one! – and we must whittle this down to one if we want the European public to taken us seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason alone, the CDA takes the view that we should not purchase any real estate until such time as the Council can be persuaded to accommodate everything under one roof. Whether this is to be in Strasbourg, Luxembourg or Brussels is something that we can discuss in due course. Neither should we blame some, and not others, but this is the time to make that choice, and that is also the reason why we, with regard to Mr Ferber’s part report, the Mulder report with regard to the purchase of real estate, take the view that even if the cost can be recovered in ten years’ time, this is not the right time, because we first want to force the Council into taking a decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That must not happen again, so let us be serious about making sure that it does not.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and even though there are plenty of people who – even before the audit – already know what has been going on, let those of us who are on the Committee on Budgetary Control resolve to deal with this Strasbourg business by checking first and then coming to conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, and simply because Mrs Gräßle has such a nice way of applauding, we should, in dealing with the statement of assurance, take to heart what Mr Wynn said earlier on. Are the Member States really willing to deal with the signing-off of accounts in the way we have indicated? Yes or no? On this point, I would also appreciate an answer from Commissioner Kallas, and I would ask Mr Wynn what we are to do if the Council refuses to play ball: do we then let the Inter-Institutional Agreement collapse? Yes or no? How important, then, at the end of the day, is it for us that we should get this signature?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this statement of assurance and the debate about it should not give the impression that we are putting the Court of Auditors under pressure. I am beginning to get the impression that there are, in Luxembourg, people who think that they are under pressure and that we absolutely must, in future, issue a positive statement of assurance.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, what we have to do is to make certain changes in the way our resources are managed, and then the Court of Auditors can come up with some different results; that is the order in which things have to be done, and, in a debate on the discharge for 2004, it is worth bearing that in mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The interinstitutional agreement is preliminarily agreed. We now of course will wait; this was agreed between all three institutions. The Council will discuss it in the middle of May and it will be obviously signed in the middle of May. That is the official position of the Member States’ representatives and the Presidency. It has been signed and I have no doubt that there have been very close consultations between Member States about this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there are different views in Member States, but I am very happy to now use the momentum which was mentioned by Mr Wynn. I have promoted this idea and discussed the discharge and the integrated control framework several times in the Council. I must say that the positive attitude is increasing. In the last Council meeting, the ideas were clearly supported by three Member States and some of them have also declared their readiness to carry out some kind of pilot project or to start to share the responsibility immediately. So there is definitely an increase in positive attitude. It is more complicated for federal states, but I think we have to work on it; this is a European Union where things do not happen suddenly – except bad things.</p>
<p class="contents">In answer to Mr Mulder’s question as to what we will do next: next will be the adoption of this interinstitutional agreement, then certain amendments to legislation, and then practical work to use this cooperation between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to assure Mr Bösch this is definitely not a miracle, and these are two separate things. Today we met the Court of Auditors and we definitely felt a certain nervousness – which was also mentioned by Mr Bösch – among some members of the Court of Auditors about this. I clearly assure you that there are two separate issues. One is the control, audit and surveillance architecture as a system; another is our mistakes – irregularities which will happen and against which we have to fight. This system of surveillance must be rational and just give answers – are the proper policy-making decisions implemented properly or not? Nobody wants to have any derogation as regards the evaluation of efficiency in accordance with the rules of fulfilling our programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year we started to introduce understandings that the Member States’ participation is extremely substantial and inevitable if we want to increase transparency and improve the handling of European money. We have achieved certain steps and we have move forward. We can be modestly optimistic about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the accounts mentioned by Mrs Gräßle, I do not believe – and I have been informed of this by our Chief Accounting Officer – that we have any secret accounts. All accounts are under control; accounts inside the EU and outside the EU have different regimes as regards checking them, but the new accounting system must secure the proper reflection of all the accounts. I cannot imagine that the European Union has some accounts which are not known by our surveillance system.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much for your comments. We will see each other soon in similar circumstances in autumn when we start the next discharge, for the 2005. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is indeed national governments who actually spend some 80% of the EU budget, and most criticisms of the Court of Auditors relate to them, rather than to the European institutions. Even if the shortcomings of Member States relate mainly to delays, incomplete paperwork and suchlike rather than to fraud, the general impression created is damaging, and damaging in practice to the EU rather than to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is so important to oblige Member States to take their responsibilities more seriously, and I welcome the progress made on this point, notably thanks to the Parliament using its muscle during the negotiations with the Council on the new Financial Perspectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
