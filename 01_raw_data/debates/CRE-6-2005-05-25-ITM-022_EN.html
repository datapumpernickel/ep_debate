<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mariann Fischer Boel,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Schierhuber for the quality of her report, as well as for the amendments tabled. This draft regulation is of great importance. It is included in the package of proposals made by the Commission in the scope of the financial perspectives and defines the rules for financing the common agricultural policy. The purpose of this regulation is to clarify and simplify these financing rules, to improve our management and control system and to adapt and reinforce our rules on budget discipline, taking into account the reform of the CAP decided in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">The bringing together of the rules relating to the two new funds in one single regulation must be considered as a major simplification concerning the rural development policy where we stop using different financial rules for the same measures depending on the region where they apply. The single management and control system chosen for both funds takes advantage of the good experience we have acquired in the field of the EAGGF Guarantee Section. However, this system needed some reinforcement in order to constitute a modern management and control system. A major new element in it is the declaration of assurance given by the head of the paying agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to draw your attention to the new system for the follow<span class="bold">–</span>up of irregularities and recoveries. This system should ensure that major amounts will not be outstanding indefinitely. Both these elements are in line with Parliament’s 2003 discharge recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">This regulation on the financing of the CAP would not be complete without the relevant rules on budget discipline. These rules are, however, also reinforced where needed and adapted to the new rules we decided upon in the reform adopted back in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">My position on the amendments is as follows. Although I can agree with the purpose of Amendment 1, I do not consider it legally necessary or even good legal practice to follow it. The exception of expenditure stated in Article 13 will apply. It is not necessary to state this again in Article 5. I can accept Amendment 2 and Amendment 7 with, however, some small drafting changes. Amendments 3, 4 and 5 are all reducing the 36<span class="bold">–</span>month period used in clearance of accounts to determine the expenses which can be the subject of a clearance decision. I have to inform you that this proposal was based on a recommendation from the Court of Auditors, as well as from Parliament. However, if you adopt these amendments, taking into account the fact that all Member States also ask for this time limit to be reduced to 24 months, I will accept them.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret I cannot accept Amendment 6. The proposal for a flat<span class="bold">–</span>rate approach on recoveries in the event of irregularities is a fundamental part of the Commission’s proposal. We cannot justify to the European taxpayers that more than EUR 2 billion is outstanding and for which we cannot put into place a manageable follow<span class="bold">–</span>up system. The past has proven that the existing system which needs a case<span class="bold">–</span>by<span class="bold">–</span>case, yearly examination of the more than 10 000 outstanding recovery files is impossible. The flat<span class="bold">–</span>rate approach shares out the financial responsibility equally between Member States and Commission, once the normal period for the recovery has elapsed.</p>
<p class="contents">For cases in which recovery action is taken in courts, we now propose to allow for a normal period of eight years. Your proposal would be to wait for the final judicial decision. This would take away all the benefits that are actually being sought. Furthermore, it makes the whole system superfluous as once a final judicial decision is taken, there is no reason to apply the provisional flat<span class="bold">–</span>rate solution of sharing the financial burden between Member States and the Community budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was this that made it possible for this really very constructive report to become a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you said just now that you cannot accept all of our amendments. You will be aware, however, that they were adopted unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture. I nevertheless hope that Parliament will vote in favour of this report tomorrow by a very large majority.</p>
<p class="contents">This report on the financing of the common agricultural policy is also – as you have already mentioned, Commissioner – closely connected to the report on rural development. I am delighted that we have managed to keep to the timetable that we set ourselves when I was appointed to draft this report, and that we are going to be able to vote on it in the plenary while we are still under the Luxembourg Presidency. This was the only way to make it possible for the rural development programmes to continue seamlessly in the new planning period.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been said, this is a very technical administrative dossier. On the positive side, it should be noted that this proposal genuinely simplifies the structure of the current legal bases for financing, in particular in respect of rural development policy in the period 2007 to 2013. The political objective is to simplify the system and make it easier to understand, and of course also to have better and more efficient controls, disbursement of funds and transparency, which all of us here can only welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">In the future, these two funds – the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development – will be able to work very well. I also welcome the fact that the Commission intends to introduce stricter monitoring, evaluation and reporting mechanisms, to ensure that the agreed ceilings are complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know how complicated accounting procedures for EU funds are in the farming sector, and so the proposed increase in efficiency and transparency is also to be welcomed. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is using the corresponding Commission proposal to create a common legal framework for financing these two components of the common agricultural policy. In the committee, the seven amendments were adopted that the Commission is now unfortunately not able to accept in full.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this report only lays down the technical arrangements for implementing the financing, one point has to be mentioned in this context: if the European Union is really to achieve its ambitious goals on rural development, then adequate financial resources must be allocated to the Rural Development Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Rural areas have a high status in the European Union, particularly in the ten new Member States. More than half of our EU citizens live in rural areas, which make up around 90% of EU territory. The issue is to ensure that these regions remain worthwhile places to live – attractive and active – thus creating a viable world in which people can live and work. The development and implementation of positive strategies and prospects for the future are a top priority.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2003 reform of the common agricultural policy brought permanent changes for the European agriculture and forestry sectors, and in the process of this reform rural areas have become even more important, so as to meet the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives. Rural development policy is a policy for people everywhere in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It cannot be said often enough that in the battle over the EU budget, our ambitious aim must be to ensure that appropriate resources are allocated to rural development, the second pillar. Commissioner, you have my support in this fight for a balanced budget for the future of rural development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on this score, and indeed the draft regulation itself is of a very high standard.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may, however, I should like to make a number of general comments.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it is crucial that the necessary checks be carried out on the billions of euro that the European Union spends on the common agricultural policy and on other Community policies. The EU should set an example to the rest of the world in the way it disburses funds, and, most importantly of all, it should meet all the standards for counteracting corruption. EU funds should be distributed according to objective criteria, with the use of transparent procedures and systematic checks.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the reality falls somewhat short of this ideal. All too often, the way in which EU funds are disbursed is anything but clear and transparent, and the necessary checks are lacking. The most stringent checks should not be carried out on the recipients of funds, or in other words on farmers or self<span class="bold">–</span>government bodies, but on the institutions responsible for distributing EU money.</p>
<p class="contents">The checks carried out by the European Commission do not ensure adequate scrutiny of EU spending. They are not entirely objective, as it is sometimes the case that irregularities in disbursing these funds are not only the result of mistakes made by the Member States, but also of those made by the Commission itself. One can hardly expect the Commission to point out its own mistakes.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an urgent need for more stringent checks by external bodies. These should be carried out by the European Court of Auditors, which should cooperate with control bodies in the Member States wherever possible. There is also an urgent need for an appropriate system of checks and balances, which is currently lacking. The role of the Court of Auditors must be strengthened, and it should not merely issue positive statements, but also point out actual irregularities. This is essential if Community funds are to be distributed fairly and honestly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that almost half the current EU budget is used for this purpose. Mrs Schierhuber has produced an extremely good report, and I would like to thank her sincerely for that.</p>
<p class="contents">The common agricultural policy has hitherto been financed via the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund. It has been difficult to administer the fund. It is divided into two different sections, where different rules apply. As part of a general reform of agricultural policy the intention is now to set up two separate funds: a European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, and an Agricultural Fund for Rural Development. As the intention is to establish just one administration and inspection system for both funds, administration will be simplified and made more efficient. We know, after all, that the present bureaucratic and ineffective system of administration tends to aggravate the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">To guarantee an impeccable system of budgetary control, the Commission is proposing extensions to the deadlines for embarking on the recovery of funds that were paid in error for the wrong reasons. The committee, however, made the deadlines shorter again. Personally, I would have liked longer deadlines. As, however, the regulation is huge in scope and contains many considerable improvements, including with regard to budgetary control, I am prepared to accept the overall proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her work. I suppose the technicalities of this debate will go right over the heads of many farmers. Their concerns are rather more basic.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to address the issue of the technicalities. It seems sensible to simplify how we operate the funds. I have some concerns about an over<span class="bold">–</span>bureaucratic system coming into place because, at the very least, there would be more documentation required of Member States. However, if it provides for more transparency and accountability for the wider citizens of the European Union, then it is a positive development. Yet I am always concerned that having more documents does not lead to transparency. In this case I hope it does.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to the issue for farmers, their concern, in particular with the new single farm payment regime, is to receive prompt payment of what they now call the ‘cheque in the post’, to have it delivered on time and within their production year, because it comprises such a huge proportion of their farm income. They also have concerns, which I would share, about the very severe penalties which Member States might impose on them for breaches of the regulations that are not deliberate. That has to be avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to address specifically the issue of rural development. I know the Commissioner believes very strongly in rural development and, indeed, believes that it is the future for agriculture policy, a view shared by the OECD. The difficulty for the European Union is that while we have grand plans for rural development, we do not have the budget to fund those plans. This is an area of great concern. It is for this reason that when we all discuss the financial perspectives for 2007 to 2013, we must remember the commitments we made to farmers in the past in relation to the single farm payment, and indeed to rural development, and we must put our money where our mouths are. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that it will be possible to reach a political compromise on this issue during the Luxembourg presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">On rural development, I would like to say to Mrs McGuinness that we share a common vision. It is the future of agriculture and, as I used to say, it is also the life insurance for agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning financing, if we look at the Commission proposal for the next financial period, approximately EUR 100 billion will be available for the next financial period, including the modulated money. I think this will be sufficient. However, I would be worried if the countries that support the 1% succeeded during the ongoing discussions on the financial framework, because then we would not have enough money to realise our vision of a common rural development policy. Therefore, I can only encourage those who are really in favour of this policy to put pressure on Member States to finance it to the level we regard as necessary, in order to give rural development policy a proper future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
