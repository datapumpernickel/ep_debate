Peaceful coexistence, mutually beneficial and balanced cooperation between countries and peoples, with no interference in their internal affairs, and smooth transnational relations have always been the mainstay of any cooperation between its countries. The Mediterranean countries which do not belong to the ΕU have to cope with particularly acute problems of economic development and regional inequalities are becoming more and more marked.</p>
<p class="contents">The ΕU and its Member States bear a great deal of the responsibility for this state of affairs. What we are witnessing is over-exploitation of natural and human resources by the developed countries, mainly the EU, and the companies established in them, in order to maintain and increase their foreign debt.</p>
<p class="contents">The attempt to export the EU economic and social model to the countries of the Mediterranean which do not belong to the EU and to integrate them into the new world order and so-called globalisation is the expression of colonial mentality. It cannot provide a stable basis for cooperation because it seeks to impose the ways of the strong on the weak and to serve the interests of huge monopolies rather than the interests of the people and workers of the countries in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The attitude of the Member States of the EU towards immigrants from these and other countries, making many of them feel insecure and at risk of deportation, failing to grant them equal rights with other workers, and maintaining ghettos of second-class citizens and victims of a modern slave trade is a typical example of this conduct.</p>
<p class="contents">The various embargos against, and even military intervention in, countries which refuse to toe the EU line and bow to the new world order are another typical example of Community policy. As is the fact that some countries are excluded from Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, others receive privileged treatment and money is distributed not on the basis of real need but of the interests of multinational capitalists.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we should not forget that we are talking about a region in which the EU and ΝΑΤΟ bombarded Yugoslavia and in which the ΕU, with ΝΑΤΟ's blessing, has conferred candidate status on Turkey, which is currently occupying 40% of Cyprus and contesting Greece's sovereign rights. Nor should we forget our responsibilities towards the Palestinian people living in wretched conditions under a regime of Israeli state terrorism who continue to fight heroically for a homeland.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the proposal for a resolution has failed to address these issues and has abided by the philosophy applied by the EU hitherto. Its aim is to help European monopolies penetrate the area, obviously so that they can continue to plunder the wealth of the Mediterranean countries outside the ΕU. That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece have voted against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The delays in implementing the agreements can only be partly justified. The responsibility is dual, lying with both the governments of the countries of the Union and the governments of the Mediterranean partners as well. The Process is suffering from a lack of political will, which raises occasional doubts as to whether this major Mediterranean undertaking will be successful. It is in consideration of this dual responsibility that I tabled amendments referring to the governments of the Euromed States.</p>
<p class="contents">If they do not assume their responsibility and make good their undertaking, there can be no project creating a multilateral sub-regional free trade area in the Mediterranean countries, as proposed at the Malta Conference in the context of south-south relations.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of financing also requires a will to succeed which has thus far not been displayed. The proportion of the funds dedicated to all the different geographical areas, in respect for democracy, transparency and efficiency, needs to be re-established, and there needs to be lasting revitalisation of decentralised cooperation once a critical, in-depth analysis of the weaknesses and shortcomings noted in the implementation of the old programmes has been carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to respect for the dignity of legal immigrants, in the spirit of a harmonised European migration policy, in addition to legal instruments guaranteeing the fair treatment of immigrants, financial aid instruments need to be established for all those young people who wish to return to their native countries to start work when they have finished secondary education or a university course in a European country. Coordination of Member States' initiatives in this matter is becoming essential and could be carried out by the European Commission. Moreover, the Commission needs to present similar proposals regarding financial aid for young immigrants within the framework of the policy for cooperation with the ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Another type of coordination concerns potential contributors – States and financial institutions – of international and regional aid, particularly in the Gulf countries. A concerted programme of investment in the Mediterranean is becoming necessary. Without joint action there can be no dynamism, and without dynamism there will not be sufficient drive for development.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by stressing that by far the most effective means of achieving coordination would be a global Union strategy for the Mediterranean region. Such a strategy will be able to establish the goals of an excellent partnership; such a strategy will provide the necessary justification for every initiative and each and every intervention; such a strategy will allow the partnership to become a vital means not only of ensuring the economic and social development of the Mediterranean region but also of enabling Europe to assume a stabilising role throughout the area. This is why we will vote for the motion for a resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to highlight one point which frankly I see as a determining factor in this question: the lack of equality in the employment sphere. There will never be equality if women do not have personal financial autonomy, if they have to depend on men for their support and to ensure their future. What can most make women truly free and equal is to have the same opportunities of finding a job as men and not at a lower rate of pay. I am convinced that the day when women achieve real financial independence through their work, then they will be truly free and all other inequalities will have disappeared. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its objective is to integrate women into the anti-labour policies of the ΕU.</p>
<p class="contents">The so-called equal opportunities policy has not reversed women's disproportionate share of unemployment, part-time employment and poverty, nor has it broken the glass ceilings of the centres of power. Equal opportunities in the workplace, in society and elsewhere cannot be understood within the context of a set of reactionary policies which offend human dignity, a society in which there is unemployment, underemployment and no state welfare or a society which puts a price on and commercialises human values.</p>
<p class="contents">We are radically opposed to the way in which the terms "equal opportunities" and "equality" are used, because these two terms can only mean one thing in the context of capitalism: equal social misery for the majority of workers, which gets worse day by day, an equal share of poverty, the general rise in unemployment and part-time employment, cutbacks in public and free social services provided by the state and a heavier overall burden on the family.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the anti-labour policies of the ΕU, the specific objective and any positive measures promoted to achieve it will have just one purpose: to integrate women fully into EU policies, which have become even more reactionary to grass-roots interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the text is to implement the more general policies of the ΕU and it clearly states that the policy of equality must promote the full integration of women into the "new economy". In other words, their full integration on equal terms into part-time employment, into the reversal of full, stable employment and into the reduction of the non-wage costs of labour.</p>
<p class="contents">A genuine equal opportunities policy presupposes a different economic and social policy focusing on equal opportunities for men and women to share in prosperity, not an impoverished life, such as a reduction in the retirement age for both sexes to 60 for men and 55 for women, strengthening and upgrading the public and welfare sectors, abolishing the private health sector and abolishing part-time employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But all the declarations concerning ‘equal opportunities for men and women’ are cast in a rather garish light by the European directive authorising night work for women.</p>
<p class="contents">The ban on night work for women was one of those rare areas in which, by protecting women, the social legislation of certain countries was further advanced for female than for male workers.</p>
<p class="contents">On account of the fact that European institutions are incapable of combating the social segregation suffered by women in the areas of employment, salary and professional promotion and are therefore incapable of ‘equalising opportunities’ upwards, they ‘equalise’ downwards. We are against the social regression represented by the authorisation of night work for women.</p>
<p class="contents">Night work in industry and, more generally, in the retail sector, which is just as detrimental to women’s as it is to men’s health, has no social or human justification. The only reason why it is becoming widespread is the desire of companies to make ever greater profits.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to abolish social segregation, night work should be banned for men and women alike, with the sole exception of public services, notably hospitals and transport, where such work is socially useful. In this case, the inconveniences of working at night should be compensated for by a massive reduction in working hours, with protection for pregnant women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Special measures to help women should not be secondary; they should be integrated into policy. In practice, initiatives are to be taken in five areas, including equality in economic life, equal participation and representation, and equal access to social rights.</p>
<p class="contents">EUR 53.5 million is provided for under budget item B3-4012. This is a considerable but also necessary sum, which the Committee on Budgets has agreed to as a matter of political priority. We would have liked to have scrutinised the fourth action programme just as we are now considering the fifth programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much hope that in future, by producing an annual review in good time, the Commission will enable this House to carry out a more in-depth analysis and hold a more thorough debate. One more point about timing: this report contains many examples of ambiguous and infelicitous wording, because we have had to hold our debates and votes under extreme time pressure and the amendments were not available in all languages.</p>
<p class="contents">I have some reservations as far as the content is concerned. For example, as so often happens in this House, studies are called for on the significance of a general reduction in working hours.<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>We have adopted opinions by clear majorities recognising that the Member States can cope far better with flexible working hours than with unrealistic collectively bargained solutions. Furthermore, I think that a "media code of conduct" is impractical. Whenever woman are presented in a discriminatory way, the only thing that helps is forceful protests against each specific incident – protests by active readers of both sexes and by alert national and European Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I voted for the report because, on the one hand, various proposed improvements submitted by my group were taken on board, and also because the report calls for studies into the position of women in national labour markets and the inadequate access they have to social security systems, an area in which we need statistically relevant gender-specific data. And it is quite right to call for consistency of the fifth framework programme with the Structural Funds, which are probably the most sustainable instruments the Community has, with the Community's EQUAL initiative and with the DAPHNE, STOP, PHARE and MEDA programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is mainly the words ‘form obstacles to’ and ‘the need for childcare and care of elderly family members’ which cause me deep concern.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, is ‘activity in professional, political or social spheres’, to quote the justification, the highest good and only thing of value for individual human beings?

As I left, I said to her, "Don't worry: we are going to debate the González Álvarez report which deals precisely with product safety".

It is important that our products are safe, but we should not go over the top with extreme actions.</p>
<p class="contents">People across Europe are extremely concerned about the safety of consumer products, and rightly so. This report welcomes an improvement in current European law on product safety, but in my view the directive should not be applied to charity shops, a key feature in the British high street. It is absurd to think that the average charity shop can provide the authorities with information about product risks and product origin for second-hand goods acquired from the general public.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that it was my Labour colleague, Mr Whitehead, who introduced the amendments exempting charity shops, and we should congratulate him on his achievements. The threat to charity shops occurred because it simply was not understood on mainland Europe. It is now, and the Labour amendments offer a guarantee that charity shops will be left untouched and will be exempt from the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The overall aim of the directive is extremely important in ensuring that there is a consistent and high level of consumer protection, as well as the efficient functioning of the single market. I wholeheartedly support the drive for clearly-worded, understandable warnings about possible risks to be put on products where they are on sale. Clear labelling is the best way of reassuring worried consumers that the goods they buy are safe.</p>
<p class="contents">Public confidence in the safety of products we all buy has taken a real knock in recent years following a number of scares, especially in children's toys. Only by taking a safety first attitude – and being seen to take a safety first attitude – can public confidence and the safety of our children be restored. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We fully support this approach and the two proposals for Council regulations which would implement it. But we cannot support the amendments tabled by the European Parliament which aim to profoundly upset the balance of the system in favour of the Commission. Today, the European Agency for Reconstruction is administered by a Governing Board on which the representatives of the Member States and the Commission each have one vote and on which decisions are adopted by a two-thirds majority. The Commission is not at all happy about a situation in which it is under constant supervision and complains that the weight of the Member States hinders its freedom of action and therefore, in its view, impedes the effectiveness of its assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has rallied to the call of its old friend and has just voted for amendments in its favour. Amendment No 5 proposes returning the running of the Agency to the Commission, which would be responsible to the European Parliament. Amendment No 14 weakens the Governing Board vis-à-vis the Commission, by stipulating that its decisions are adopted by simple majority. Amendment No 10 extends the tasks of the Agency, which is now effectively controlled by the Commission. Finally, Amendment No 15 gives the Commission free rein in determining the rules governing the languages used by the Agency, about which we are very concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">We are witnessing the repetition of a classic scenario in which the Commission believes it will manage external aid better if it has more powers and more autonomy, and if it is less supervised by the Member States. That is a mistake which, as we well know, could unfortunately take us down a very dangerous path. We are therefore asking that the Member States retain the upper hand regarding the management of aid and the Agency. In this way, they will exercise better control and they will maintain a vital link between European aid and national policies in this sensitive region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So we must give President Rugova and President Kostunica a chance to negotiate democratically with each other.

<p class="contents">We are opposed to the market economy, which is just as stupid and disastrous in regulating the economy as a whole as it is in regulating the production of pigmeat. However, we will not share the rapporteur’s cynicism, as he mourns the passing of the good old times when ‘the cessation of activity by small production units was enough to restore prices’. Even less do we share his view when he talks of the elimination of small producers which he, above all, uses to ask the European institutions for supplementary financing for large livestock producers.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to prevent producers falling victim to the cyclical variation of the market. But the only true producers are those who work and run the pig farms, small farmers and agricultural workers, which definitely does not include those who are the primary focus of this report and who confine themselves to investing in this industry in order to make a profit with the aid of European Union grants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the Commission's proposal to create a voluntary regulatory fund financed solely by producers not only runs counter to the CAP principle of financial solidarity, it will also not solve any of the industry’s fundamental problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The Garot report is an attempt to improve on some aspects of the Commission’s proposal, by seeking to reach a compromise with the Council, specifically with regard to a financial contribution to the fund. The problem is that, even if the French Presidency has shown a degree of openness, we know that the Commission has rejected these proposals and there does not appear to be a majority within the Council in favour of approving them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore still crucial that we continue to fight for the mandatory establishment of the fund, financed completely by the CAP, and that payments from the fund should be adjusted to cover more producers, paying particular attention to small- and medium-sized farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the overriding issue of the Community’s contribution to the fund, I also wish to point out that the proposals in the Garot report are an improvement as compared with the Commission’s position, but we still disagree with the idea of linking this contribution to the principle of CAP cofinancing which was, in fact, rejected in Agenda 2000. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We do not have a market organisation for pigmeat comparable with those for other agricultural products. And we do not fundamentally want to change that situation. However, when there have been such major structural changes in a sector as there have been in the pigmeat sector, and when there has been a more sustained fall in prices, of up to 30%, than has been the case up to now, in that case some action is needed. It cannot be in anyone's interest for smaller pig farming units in particular to have to give up because they cannot cope with this kind of on-going disaster scenario.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that there is a justification for modifying the present Community schemes in this area.</p>

The last crisis was exceptionally long and severe. It caused the disappearance of smaller holdings and difficulties for a large number of young farmers. The lack of a regulatory system accentuated this movement in favour of large, often integrated, production units. It is not possible to ask producers alone to make an extra effort: many already belong to equalisation funds. We believe we should support them by creating efficient tools not only to resolve the crises but also to better control the markets, improve quality and promote their products.</p>
<p class="contents">Pig farming is still essentially a family activity, based on responsibility. It supports the economic activity of the rural community, often in regions where there are few alternatives. We have chosen to fight in defence of a living and diverse rural world: maintaining small- and medium-sized enterprises, be they agricultural, industrial, or small-scale cottage industries, is the cornerstone of this. The creation of a regulatory fund for pigmeat production, as amended, does not place the free market in the balance but will protect small family holdings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A slight variation in the supply is enough to spark a crisis situation. However, the crises have been more drawn out in recent years and have had a terrible impact on young and small-scale pig farmers in particular. The Commission is right to try and find ways in which to secure the income of pig farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Commission’s present proposal will not yield structural solutions, and rapporteur Garot feels that the time has now come to dig out the old socialist instrument of robust state intervention again. There is no point in setting up funds to ameliorate the effects of recurring crises. There is a risk that these funds, by virtue of the cushioning effect they have, only make the crises more protracted. In addition, such funds give Member States the opportunity, in the form of co-financing, to grant capped state aid to a greater or lesser extent. Member States who have always been generous on the aid front can take advantage of this to distort competition. This leads to situations worthy of a quote from George Orwell in the eleven official languages of the Union: <span class="italic">"All pigs are equal but some pigs are more equal than others"</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">But even if the co-financing aspect was to be dropped from the proposal, the proposed fund would still not be in a position to address the frequency and depth of the crises in the sector. When prices fall, production must be curtailed. That is a natural reaction in the pig farming sector. Therefore, a fund does not solve anything unless it is binding, and unless all participants endeavour to limit production. These are the reasons we voted against the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Reducing production is the key to dealing with crises in the pig farming sector. I therefore hope that the Council will study this report with a critical eye and take the view of Dutch pig farmers on board. These farmers, who oppose an income fund in the first instance, feel that if the Council endorses a fund of this kind, it should do so with the proviso that each Member State limits its production. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is what we are hoping for once again today when we call upon the Morillon report to make reference to genocide. Acknowledging genocide must be a call for dialogue to be established between the new Armenian and Turkish generations.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole of the Armenian community and the Armenian children who fled into exile at the beginning of the century to the countries of Europe are today waiting for justice to be done. They want to offer a memorial to their ancestors, the victims of genocide. At a time when the last witnesses of exile, the last survivors of the carnage, are quietly passing away, the work and the duty of remembrance are even more necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">But beyond the duty of remembrance which we must demand from all democracies, and the people of Europe know just how difficult and painful a task this is, so difficult in fact that some European countries have not yet completed it, it is incumbent on us to ensure that such acts of barbarism, which destroyed lives for ethnic, religious and cultural reasons and which offend the conscience of the world, never recur. Europe must spread this message. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> that these criteria are met before the accession negotiations can start, and we must never forget this.</p>
<p class="contents">The progress reports established by the European Commission are therefore extremely important. Today we are discussing the 1999 progress report. Following the example of the rapporteur, we are bound to admit that Turkey has progressed on certain levels and that there are positive signs.</p>
<p class="contents">I am primarily thinking of the resumption of the political dialogue in the Association Council, which met on 11 April 2000 after being suspended for three years, and the establishment of eight subcommittees entrusted with the task of setting priorities for incorporation of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> <span class="italic">communautaire</span>, the signature by Turkey on 15 August and 8 September 2000 of four important UN conventions, on political, civil, social and cultural rights respectively, which must be ratified as soon as possible so that human rights and democratic pluralism may be guaranteed in that country, the Turkish Council of Ministers’ adoption of the report presented by the Turkish Supreme Coordination Council for Human Rights, as a ‘reference working document’, even if practical measures to protect the rights of minorities need to be added, and the adoption of the law on adjourning trials and deferring sentences for press and radio broadcasting offences.</p>
<p class="contents">But there are still many areas where progress is unsatisfactory, or indeed non-existent. I am thinking in this case of the absence of a law abolishing the death penalty, the Cyprus question and the occupation by the Turkish army of one third of the island of Cyprus, and the problem of the rights of minorities, such as the Kurdish and Armenian minorities. In this connection, I supported an amendment aimed at inserting into the body of the report a reference to the genocide in Armenia, because it is important to acknowledge this historical reality. I invite the Turkish authorities to do the same: this would mark a great step forward in the country’s progress towards democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">If Turkey wants to enter into accession negotiations, it still needs to make a great deal of effort. If it wants to accede to the European Union, it will have to integrate all the values which make Europe what it is. This once again raises the question of whether Turkey really wants to be a Member of the European Union, or whether it would prefer to organise an integrated ‘whole’ with other Middle East countries, which would have very close links with the European Union at the commercial and economic level, at the security and stability level and also at the human rights and democratic rules level.</p>
<p class="contents">This is, of course, a different debate to the one we are having today. But, given the importance I attach to Turkey, I wanted to restate my case today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obviously Turkey will then have to be given the same opportunity. But that day is in the distant future. Present-day Turkey is an authoritarian state with superior military power, political prisoners, censorship, party bans, border conflicts and an electoral system that excludes minorities. Lessons still have not been learnt from the mass murder, eighty years ago, of the insurgent Armenians. That partly explains why people do not think it untoward that a different national minority is still being deprived of its rights to this day. The Kurds are displaced, bombarded and suppressed. Their language is banned from use in administration, education and the media. Turkey must first learn from the histories of Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, Albania, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. These countries came under Turkey’s dominion in the past, and uprisings that took place there were repeatedly suppressed using violent means. Since the people are no longer prevented from exercising their right to self-determination, this has enabled peace to take hold. I do not believe that Turkey’s style of government will change by us presenting this country with the prospect of EU membership, subject to flexible conditions.

I remember the exact text of the conclusions of the Presidency in Paragraph 12: “Turkey is a candidate country destined to join the Union on the basis of the same criteria as applied to candidate countries”.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that, in reality, this decision was tainted with hypocrisy. Nonetheless, the system that has been put in place will do its work and will impose its logic on us until the time comes when this awkward position will become so untenable that our relations with Turkey will be in serious and deep crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">But, some might say, we can make the pleasure last, we can multiply the conditions and infinitely draw out the Copenhagen criteria in order to delay the moment when we have to take up the subject of the free movement of workers with Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Such ulterior motives are unworthy of Europe and unworthy of Turkey. In our relations with the Turkish nation and the great Turkish people, we must use the language of frankness and respect, not a double talk which opens the door to the worst kind of disappointment and unacceptable humiliation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is absolutely not a question of pushing Turkey away from Europe, as Cohn-Bendit claims. It is simply a question of recognising that geography and history have made present-day Turkey a country that is not European.

<p class="contents">The ambiguity of the pre-accession procedure prevents real cooperation between Turkey and Europe from developing along healthy and clear lines, even if there is a powerful common interest for Turkey – with its influence and weight and the privileged relations it now has with the Turkish-speaking countries of central Asia – to be a powerful stabilising factor in a region which is in great need of stability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For a number of years, as a member of the delegation for relations with Canada, I have been able to observe the operation of one of the regional organisations, NAFO (Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation), whose members are the countries of that region, including Canada, as well as all the countries that use traditional fishing zones in the region, including France, Spain and some other European countries. Every member country has a vote in the decision procedure. Now, from the moment the European nations concerned decided to communitise this issue and to be represented solely by the Commission they have just had a single vote. So the first effect of the uniting of our forces was to reduce the number of our votes from six to one. The countries of Europe, as a whole, have the same number of votes as Cuba, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation does not worry the federalists for whom, when the Commission speaks with a single voice, we gain in strength. Unfortunately, it is ‘with a single voice’ in all senses of the phrase. What is more, our position is often weakened by our internal mechanisms, notably prior alignment to the lowest common denominator. On the whole, our interests are undermined, they are not defended with the necessary force, and the role of the Commission is primarily that of a police officer vis-à-vis Member States to get them to apply the binding decisions that have been adopted, sometimes in spite of themselves, in the regional organisation in question.</p>
<p class="contents">The Jové Peres report would not only like to regularise this situation for existing regional organisations and those that are in the process of being established, it would also like to reinforce it by putting paid to the Commission’s habit of calling on the support of technical experts from different Member States. According to the report, the Commission would need to recruit staff as a result and would be given the corresponding funds.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept any of these approaches. We believe that the current system of representation by the Commission weakens instead of strengthens us, and we want every European nation to be fully represented within the regional fisheries organisations, even though it is clearly desirable that the Member States coordinate their positions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For instance, one sees such statements as: "... the development of a genuine fisheries policy requires that the powers of monitoring fishing activity must be assigned to the Commission"; "...the establishment of a proper Community system of monitoring fisheries is bound to entail a degree of sovereignty being transferred to the Union institutions"; and "... the European Union is not a confederation of states but a '<span class="italic">sui generis</span>' entity in international law, in which ... there is a desire for economic, social and political integration...".</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the observation that: "the lack of adequate human and material resources means that the Community's powers are delegated to Member States...", with the view that this situation cannot be extended indefinitely.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur's answer is for the Community to be given the resources, effectively, to take direct control over fisheries monitoring. This reveals the European Union's true ambition – the continued acquisition of powers until it becomes an all-powerful superstate. It will only be content when its own gunboat fleet, flying "ring of stars" flags, is enforcing its fisheries policies.</p>

There is also a clear need for greater protection of the marine environment and rational management of exploitable fisheries resources. In this context, it appears necessary to increase international cooperation and ensure that the Community consolidates its undertaking to define a law on fish stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle tool for achieving closer cooperation is the Regional Fisheries Organisations (RFOs), which play a key role on the international scene but which lack the human resources for the Community to be adequately represented.</p>
<p class="contents">The RFOs are particularly suitable for achieving the objectives established because of their<span class="bold"> </span>regional nature, but, above all, they contribute to the rational management of resources by reflecting the specific characteristics of the fishing areas. In this context, considering the importance of RFOs for the future of the common fisheries policy and the different levels of organisation, competences and development of each organisation, the Community needs to adapt its participation according to their respective characteristics and to harmonise its role within the 30 existing RFOs, in order to speed up transposal of the recommendations adopted by the RFOs into Community law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My comments naturally apply to the issue before us today, the representation of the European Community within regional fisheries organisations, but they apply equally to talks conducted for example within the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission has the power to represent the Community and to negotiate in an international context, it is because it has received a mandate from the Council. It is therefore important that this mandate is defined clearly in terms of time and content and that it is strictly monitored by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In a good many cases, such as fishing in certain regions of the world, the interests of Member States are not uniform. Some Member States are not at all involved in certain fishing regions. It is therefore vital that the Member States that are directly involved can defend their own interests by sitting at the negotiating table with the Commission at their side playing a useful technical support role. Otherwise, the influence and the weight of Europe in such negotiations would be weakened if the interests of Europe were represented in a manner intended exclusively to benefit the Commission. Europe would, in fact, have just one seat and the position that would be defended would be nothing more than the lowest common denominator established on the basis of the positions of a group of Member States who are involved to varying degrees.</p>
<p class="contents">What is important therefore is not to satisfy the Commission’s desire for domination by weakening the position of Europe, which would be in direct conflict with the correct application of the principle of subsidiarity. On the contrary, in all international negotiations in which the European Union is involved, it is important to begin by strictly defining the Commission’s role, which should by no means be to replace Member States, but to support and coordinate alongside the Member States concerned. I am not a hundred percent certain that this is the path the Nice Summit is preparing to take … but there is still time for Member States to regroup. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
