They are targeted at the most innocent civilians, at the innocent people in societies, especially children, the most vulnerable. The sanctions on Iraq have become a weapon of mass destruction against the helpless people there. Over 200 children die there every single day. This is not acceptable. We cannot allow this to go on. Denis Halliday, who resigned his position as Director of the UN Humanitarian Mission in Iraq in protest at the sanctions, confirmed the UNICEF statistics that 5 000 to 6 000 children die every month as a direct result of sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mary Robinson, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, has been speaking out against sanctions for a long time. She said you cannot expect her to condemn human rights abuses in other parts of the world and let the United Nations itself be responsible for what is happening in Iraq following the sanctions. In February Mr Hans von Sponek, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, followed in the steps of Mr Halliday when he also resigned in protest at the on-going sanctions and the bombing of the Iraqi people. Within hours of his resignation, the head of the World Food Programme in Iraq since January 1999 also resigned in protest at the sanctions. These resignations must cause the world community to reconsider the justification for the continuing sanctions policy and also the bombings.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that 70 Congressmen sent a letter to Bill Clinton in the United States asking him to lift the embargo, asking him to de-link economic sanctions from the military sanctions that are currently in place in Iraq. It is not just here in Europe that people are concerned, but right across the world. If anyone looked at the very good documentary by the world-famous journalist, John Pilger, they would see what is happening there. Can we allow this to go on without saying something about it? It is a blatant violation of international human rights laws.</p>
<p class="contents">The sanctions are targeting the most vulnerable in society and making them suffer yet, at the same time, the elite in that society and the people who are part of the Saddam Hussein regime do not suffer from the sanctions. It is the ordinary people who suffer. We cannot allow this to go on. It is not right and the US Congressmen who sent the letter to Bill Clinton are quite right: we have to de-link economic sanctions from the military sanctions that are currently in place.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to address the bombings that are taking place without any UN mandate. That is absolutely unacceptable. A whole family was wiped out by these bombings, as shown in Mr Pilger's documentary. This is something we cannot ignore and we must push for an end to this inhumane policy.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">No Member of this House can remain unmoved by the harrowing situation in which so many Iraqi people find themselves. The facts have been presented by respected international bodies such as UNICEF. We have no reason whatsoever to doubt their veracity. There are shortages of essential foodstuffs and agricultural infrastructure resulting in severe nutritional deficiencies. Iraq, once one of the most economically advanced countries of the region, is being reduced to underdevelopment. But let there be no illusion as to the role of the Iraqi regime in the suffering of its people. The consistent refusal by the regime to fully implement United Nations resolutions has led to a situation where the sanctions remain firmly in place almost ten years after the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. Furthermore, the refusal of the regime for five years to accept the oil-for-food programme has certainly contributed to the humanitarian situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We, in Parliament, are well-intentioned towards the people of Iraq and are serious in our desire for a peaceful and lasting solution. We must concentrate our efforts on convincing Iraq to implement the United Nations resolutions. We must make it very clear in this forum that United Nations resolutions are legally binding on all members of the United Nations. The European Parliament must not be seen to undermine the legitimacy of such resolutions in any way. Any such action would be grist to the propaganda mill of the Iraqi regime.</p>
<p class="contents">It is within the power of the regime to have the sanctions imposed by the United Nations lifted. To date, the regime most regrettably has preferred to allow its people to be threatened by disease and starvation than to respect international law.</p>
<p class="contents">Full implementation of Resolution 1284 obliges Iraq, among other things, to cooperate with the Red Cross in overseeing the repatriation of detainees. Let us recall that last January this House voted unanimously a resolution calling on Iraq, as a minimum, to provide answers to the Red Cross as to the whereabouts of the missing Kuwaitis for which there is documented evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">I too have met some of these people. I have shared their suffering with them. Let us clearly understand that is a tragedy in itself.</p>
<p class="contents">We are caught between a rock and a hard place. It is heartbreaking to see innocent children being sacrificed by their own leaders for purely personal, political motives.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Civilians, men, women and children are dying because of the sanctions. I will not repeat the figures, for we are all aware of them and they have been quoted many times in this Chamber. But what a contradiction. What a tragedy. In the name of the protection of human rights, the rich, powerful countries of the West are killing communities and starving them to death. During the war in Yugoslavia, American aircraft continuously bombarded towns, killing civilians. It is better to tell the truth and admit that the interests of the United States take precedence over those of communities. </p>
<p class="contents">Today, we are going to vote on a motion, a very important motion for a resolution calling for an end to the sanctions, an end to the embargo. I feel that we must then act in order to give practical effect to our resolution. There is no doubt about the fact that it is important for Iraq to change its policy and that the existing arms must be monitored and decommissioned, but, in this regard, there is abundant documented evidence that the nuclear and chemical weapons have already been decommissioned. And that is essential. However, I also feel that a clear policy must be developed for the decommissioning of nuclear weapons where they exist in the Middle East. For example, Israel is full of nuclear weapons and no one is asking Israel to decommission. Unfortunately, even the resolution called for by Egypt was not supported by the European Parliament in Cairo. We must do everything possible to free this world from the nuclear threat. </p>
<p class="contents">Today, I would also like to pay tribute to Dennis Halliday – mentioned by Ms McKenna as well – who was responsible for the oil-for-food deal. In a world of hypocrites and careerists, Dennis Halliday had the courage to speak out over the implications of the sanctions on the Iraqi people and to condemn the lies of the United States departments. Saddam Hussein is certainly responsible and guilty, but we are also incurring a great deal of responsibility and guilt in continuing with a policy which maintains the population of a country in extreme poverty, a population such as the Iraqi people, with a rich history and culture, a population made up of people, women, children, who want to live. I hope that when the embargo imposed on Iraq is lifted, this will be the end of all embargoes everywhere throughout the world. This is important for all of us.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not one of Parliament’s noble spirits is here, and yet the sanctions against Iraq are already ten years old, ten years!</p>
<p class="contents">People think the war, the missiles and the gassings are over, but the filthy effects of this war, which was never clean, go on. There is still bombing in the North and in the South. Cornfields are being burned in a country which invented agriculture; date palms are being burned daily. In the Strasbourg newspaper yesterday, there was an interview with a priest who risked his life just to go to the Babylon area, in Ur. For people who go there, taking ambulances and medicines, like me and the National Front, Iraq is a vast concentration camp. 18 million women, children, old people, men, a whole Arab people, are being held captive in their own country by the West, with millions of deaths every day, hundreds of children dying, a systematic, scientific, meticulous, planned, cynical, perverse genocide.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not just their bodies which are under attack by being deprived of food, milk, meat and fruit. Their minds are under attack as well. There are no books. Even pencils are banned, on the pretext that their graphite could be used as coolant in the nuclear power stations. There are schools but there is no paper. There are doctors, but there is no medicine. There are hospitals, but there is nothing inside them. It is perverse. They were promised food in exchange for oil. But they are asked to practically give their oil away and then buy food.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen – especially Members who are not here – by what right is this happening? Do not keep silent! Do not be accomplices! UN officials are resigning. We should not have to go there in thirty years time, like the Belgians in Rwanda, and say sorry, or like the Holy Father, who is prostrating himself all over the place.</p>
<p class="contents">The honour of Europe depends on our speaking out for these young Arabs, for this great people being consigned to the night. It is all very well being afraid of imaginary dangers in Vienna, but it is in Baghdad that the violation of human rights is taking place. Let Washington’s Nebuchadnezzar let these people go, these slaves in their own country. They must be released from this poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal to your consciences! Europe is denying itself!

It is also because we think there is a real possibility of preventing a new risk of military force being unleashed there, given the experience of our colleague, Mr Buttiglione, who has been to Iraq and has alerted us to the fact that there is currently a significant risk of renewed bombing.</p>
<p class="contents">He had the opportunity of meeting representatives of the Iraqi government, from whom he was able to obtain a commitment to respect the United Nations resolutions. So he undertook to ensure that Parliament would send a strong signal to the Iraqi people, given that its government agrees to implement the United Nations resolutions. We have committed ourselves to ask for the immediate lifting of sanctions. That is the purpose of this joint resolution and all the groups have agreed that, to show Parliament’s unanimity on this distressing issue, there should definitely be no amendments.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We certainly cannot continue to accept this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">But we can feel gratified that we are voting in Parliament today on a resolution on the situation in Iraq which has, for the first time – and I hope we will take advantage of this to change our style a bit – won the approval of almost all the political groups. That unanimity is reassuring, because all the signatories to this resolution are in agreement on the essential point. That has happened because we all now know that the essential point is a certain concept of humanity, relations between peoples, values – in short, civilisation, the heart of Europe’s identity.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this resolution clearly calls for respect for the UN resolutions, especially Resolutions 687, 688 and 1293, and also Resolution 1284 on which we are seeking clarification. I would mention, too, that only two members of the Security Council voted for it, against the advice of the three other members who abstained. Mr President, this does not mean we are releasing the Iraqi regime from its responsibilities and obligations. It means that, for the first time, the international community is being asked to show consistency with its own principles, because the various UN committees agree that these resolutions have been virtually all applied by the Iraqi regime, except for some minor points of interpretation or detail. And here I differ slightly from Mr Collins. The fact is the discrepancies between Iraq and the international community do not justify maintaining the embargo. Remember, the Iraqi people are innocent. But it is they and not their rulers, who were never democratically elected, who are now paying the price of these sanctions in human lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hans von Sponek, the former head of the UN Oil for Food Programme, mentioned by Ms McKenna just now, said that, as a human being, with a heart and a soul, he could no longer tolerate what he was seeing in Iraq. He decided to resign. The disproportion between the constantly reiterated demands of certain members of the Security Council for the sanctions to be ruthlessly maintained and their consequences for the Iraqi people is – I am weighing my words – truly terrifying! UNICEF estimates that half a million children have died as a result of nine years of sanctions, to the utter indifference of the civilised world.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be remembered that the rules of war involve respect for civilians. The right of coercion over populations – it must also be remembered – should not lead to the right to starve them. That is also one of the great principles of Western civilisation!</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, our resolution is very consistent. It calls for respect for all the UN resolutions first and foremost, clarification of Resolution 1284 and, consequently, the lifting of sanctions and constant vigilance against the Iraqi regime, respect by all for the rules of the UN Charter, including the members of the Security Council who are carrying out military action contrary to international law and, finally, the search for a global political solution. Mr President, that is the only way dictatorships can really be weakened and concord between all the peoples of the region promoted. For once, Europe must speak with a European voice! </p>

For my part, I would refer to the procedure which seems to me in this case to be important. This is a debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance, which has been devalued insofar as we are not getting a declaration from the Council, as Parliament had requested, on including this point as a Council declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that, without presenting any valid argument, this attitude on the part of the Council seems to me to show a lack of respect towards Parliament, especially when Parliament offers the Council the opportunity to make any declaration on any subject, as laid down in Rule 37. It is truly contradictory that this Parliament cannot obtain a Council declaration on an issue as sensitive as this.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, I would like to say that my Group intends to ask the Committee on External Affairs, at its next meeting, to present, pursuant to Rule 42, an oral question to the Council so that the Council will reply. If this initiative is not successful, my political group will present, pursuant to the same article, an oral question to the Council so that the Council really takes seriously the worries and concerns of this Parliament and really does what is laid down in the Treaties, that is to say, to inform and cooperate with Parliament in all those areas which affect and concern the citizens of the European Union.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I had the opportunity to visit Iraq last month. I met the families of the Kuwaiti prisoners. I can tell you that fathers do not forget their sons, brothers do not forget their brothers, children do not forget their fathers; nor should this House.

It regrets Iraq’s decision not to accept United Nations Security Council Resolution 1284. As Mr Collins and Mr Morillon in particular have pointed out, this decision delays the application of the new instrument of control and hence the relaxation of sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">We think the Oil for Food Programme is still the best short-term solution to ease the suffering of the Iraqi population, and the Iraqi government should reverse its policy of non-cooperation and comply with all the United Nations Security Council resolutions, as has been said.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Gulf War, the Community has been the principal source of humanitarian aid to Iraq, with at least EUR 240 million provided to reduce the considerable sufferings of the Iraqi people. And we could have done even more if the Iraqi government had not imposed restrictions on the activities of non-governmental organisations, hindering the delivery of humanitarian aid in Iraq. Given the situation we cannot pretend that humanitarian aid can do any more than alleviate some of the effects of this awful economic and human situation in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic situation in Iraq can only improve as economic activity develops after sanctions are lifted. This involves engaging the Iraqi government, perhaps more than we are doing today, in a dialogue on the implementation of the Security Council resolutions. In this regard, we agree with the draft resolution.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
