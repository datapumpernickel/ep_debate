<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Turchi (UEN), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, the trans-European networks are one of the driving forces for the achievement of growth, competitiveness and employment within the European Union. The December 1994 European Council in Essen in gave a decisive political incentive to the TENs by adopting a list of fourteen priority projects. A number of financial instruments were set up by the Community and the European Investment Bank in order to achieve these objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The main purpose of Community assistance for TENs is to help to surmount the financial obstacles which may arise when a project gets under way. In principle, Community assistance is currently restricted to 10% of overall costs, with the exception of Galileo, which can receive up to 20% of its funding from the Community. The rest of the expenditure is due to be co-financed through either local, regional or national budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Regrettably, however, work is not advancing as rapidly as expected. Of the 14 ‘specific’ projects approved at the Essen summit, only three have been completed. Six others should be finished by 2005. As to the remaining five projects, no clear indication has been given on their timetable. Where, then, do the problems lie? In the first place, the pace of investment has been too slow. The Commission estimates that if the rate of funding does not increase between now and 2010, there is a very strong likelihood that the network will not be fully completed, in particular the railway components. The longest delays are generally on cross-border projects since the Member States have given priority funding to the national sections of the trans-European network in their investment decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">These delays can mainly be attributed to the lack of an integrated approach to the planning, assessment and funding of cross-border infrastructures. Moreover, the Community’s budgetary resources and legal instruments do not enable it to do anything on its own to speed up these cross-border projects since, under the Treaty, the national authorities are responsible for the implementation of a project on the territory of a Member State. The areas most seriously affected by the persistence of bottlenecks are the international corridors in which North-South trans-European traffic is highly concentrated, natural barriers such as the Alps and the Pyrenees, the outskirts of major conurbations and trading centres in which long-distance, regional and local traffic meet and are concentrated and a number of European Union borders, in particular those with the accession countries. The Commission therefore proposes to focus Community activities and projects on the reduction of bottlenecks.</p>
<p class="contents">During the past few years, the Commission has been able to maintain a relatively high level of implementation and, since early 2002, the backlog has started to decrease. The Commission has now presented a proposal to modify the general rules for granting Community financial aid in the field of TENs. As a result, Community support would be increased from 10% to 20% in order to have a leverage effect and to attract private investors in particular. This modification would be aimed at three categories of projects: cross-border rail projects crossing natural barriers such as the Alps and the Pyrenees, projects aimed at eliminating clearly identified bottlenecks at borders with the candidate countries, and the 12 priority energy projects. The first two categories fall within the scope of the trans-European transport network as established by Decision No 1692/96/EC. An additional amount of EUR 100 million in the period 2003-2006 would be assigned to the transport TENs budget line (B5-700) to complement support provided through ISPA. The TENs financial envelope set for the current financial perspective (2000-2006) would therefore have to be revised. Finally, the Commission proposes to reallocate EUR 50 million in favour of the cross-border projects within the current transport TENs envelope.</p>
<p class="contents">As to GALILEO, it will continue to receive 20% of its funding from the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">My comments? Amendments Nos 1, 3, 5 and 6 establish the general framework, restoring the balance of the Commission’s proposal, which tended to emphasise the importance solely of projects involving the candidate countries. Amendment No 2 calls upon the Commission to prepare an evaluation on the Member States’ responsibilities. Amendment No 4 introduces the possibility for Member States who wish to do so to have recourse to private capital and stresses that the economic and social added value of projects and their compatibility with the objective of sustainable mobility should also be assessed when selection takes place. Amendment No 7 states that the increase in the financial framework should be compatible with the financial perspective and not cause any restriction to be placed on other programmes. I therefore call upon the Commission to consult the budgetary authority again prior to the reallocation of funds within transport TENs. Amendment No 8 lays down the terms for the implementation of the proposal as regards the trans-European transport network, as established by Decision 1692/96 adopted on 23 July 1996. Amendment No 9 authorises the Commission to demand reimbursement of the sums awarded for projects not completed within the space of 10 years. Amendment No 10 deals with comitology and, lastly, Amendment No 11 concerns what is known as the ‘sunset’ clause.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, although this presentation has been brief due to time constraints, it has covered all the salient points, and I hope that we will succeed in completing the development of the TENs both for our own sakes and, above all, for the future of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my opinion, drawn up on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I sought to give these regulations the necessary flexibility to make them viable in three areas: in terms of enlargement, effective competition, and accountability. With 2004 very much in mind, it is vital that we address the issues of slow response and delays to the implementation of the existing TENs projects. Until Member States understand and react to strategic transport needs as covered by the TENs programme and make the necessary financial commitment, we shall find ourselves in a constant round of review and argument as to the financial requirements in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">On a personal note, I feel that the Commission proposal does not represent a level playing field approach since, by extending the increase of a possible 20% of project cost merely to certain modes, we are missing out on the chance for economic growth which is vital to the cohesion of an enlarged Union. I believe it is necessary to allow this increased amount of funding to be used to deal with the problems, wherever bottlenecks occur on the ground, regardless of transport mode, not according to the Commission theory of certain modes being better than others. However, most importantly, this funding must be effectively spent and transparently accountable and in this respect I warmly welcome the rapporteur's proposal for increased financial probity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly like to commend to the House the rapporteur's emphasis on the N+2 principle and the management committee of representatives of Member States. If projects cannot be completed within a reasonable time-scale, then the Commission should have the right to demand repayment of any assistance given. Otherwise money will continue to be wasted or stagnate whilst Europe's transport networks suffer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What lies behind this is the proposal to amend the guidelines on the trans-European energy networks, on which Mr Beysen is the rapporteur in the Industry Committee. The Commission is proposing an increase in the maximum rate from 10% to 20%. Investments are to ensure a high degree of security in energy supply, which is to be accomplished by an increase in investment, which is meant to resolve the many and varied problems occurring in the planning and realisation of infrastructure development.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim is to create a real internal market in energy, including those regions that are not at present included and covering strategies that have not yet been implemented. These include the candidate countries. The Committee agrees to the Regulation with, inter alia, a number of additions, which I will enumerate as follows. The investments envisaged should be made in projects that are necessary for the EU's economy and that are commercially profitable. Competition must not be distorted. The possibility of any increase in the Community funding allocated to energy networks in the Financial Perspective for 2002 to 2006 must be excluded, and the Commission is to produce a regular report for Parliament, detailing those projects whose completion can be expected to be speedy by reason of the increase from 10% to 20%.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur most warmly for his ability to take on board the Industry Committee's proposals with only slight variations. I would like especially to thank Mr Beysen, Mr Mombaur and Mr Turmes, who put a great deal of dedication into completing the report, sometimes by their amendments and suggestions. I would also like to thank the bureau and, most especially, the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The innovations already mentioned by Mr Turchi such as the increase of cofinancing to 20% and the fixing of a deadline of 10 years within which projects must be completed should been seen in this light. I also feel it is significant that the Galileo project and the telecommunications and energy network projects have been included in the new regulation, and I welcome the emphasis placed on rail transport as the priority sector, not least with a view to sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">However, despite the good work that has been carried out, the need remains for a more thorough revision of both the underlying objectives and the operating mechanisms of the entire complex ‘networks’ operation. Indeed, the trans-European networks are very closely linked to the revision of the cohesion policy and enlargement. We socialists call for a major debate on these three challenges, involving everybody and discussing the real purpose behind the networks, which is to reduce the imbalances within the Union and prevent further enlargement of the Union turning Europe into a huge engine – northern Europe – towing a heavy carriage – southern Europe – along behind it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In connection with some of the amendments adopted in committee, we welcome the granting of candidate countries the right to observe proceedings which concern them and their country. We also welcome the acceptance of the compromise solution of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy regarding energy products. Amendments were also accepted on including waterway projects and linking the allocation of funds to the reduction of traffic growth and air pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">We did, however, vote against the report in committee because of a number of outstanding concerns, which we will try to address tomorrow in a series of amendments and requests for split votes. These include the demand that in a new post-2006 financial framework more money should be allocated to TENs. We are not convinced that should be the case. We also have concerns about the inclusion of telecoms projects.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with penalties or claw-back, our view is that the report should follow the text of the Bradbourn report on TENs and demand that if projects are not substantially complete after 15 years, they should be taken off the list.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have a strong concern that the reference to the use of private capital could be claimed to be, or inferred to be, an obligation to use private capital. We will be asking for a split vote in order to isolate these words, to prevent such an inference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Neither the investors nor the executive bodies can always be convinced of the importance of the TEN links. We should therefore find a solution to the problems related to funding and implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">In Essen, 14 priority (transport) projects were identified, only 3 of which have now been completed. It would be logical if the resources available were to be concentrated in the remaining 11 projects, giving them a shot in the arm and ensuring that they can be implemented with the necessary drive. Neither the present initiative, nor the review of Decision No 1692/96, contribute to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Additionally, a major review of the entire TEN dossier is scheduled to take place in 2004. That will be the appropriate time to make any changes to the list of projects or the funding conditions. Interim changes will only create chaos in the process and projects, which would not serve the investors, the implementing agents, or the users. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel that the goal of speeding up the implementation of the trans-European networks is essential, especially when we consider the European system’s competitors, which, particularly in Asia, are much faster at implementing projects and infrastructure for countless reasons and are thus able to make the financial systems more competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, the Turchi report makes major improvements to the Commission’s text. I would like to mention two of them. Firstly, it emphasises that recourse to private capital is appropriate, if not necessary. I feel that the attempt to increase the Community contribution to 20% is like gambling on the effectiveness of these investments, and that laying down the undertaking to seek private capital means helping to encourage selection of projects which will yield financial benefits, which might not otherwise have been the case. Moreover, I feel that setting the deadline for implementation at 10 years is a sign of commitment to the objectives to be achieved through creating these networks and, above all, to the European taxpayers, who are ultimately footing the bill. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, as the rapporteur pointed out, the White Paper on European transport policy highlighted the considerable delays encountered in developing the trans-European transport networks, particularly for some of the more ambitious projects of the decade and more specifically with regard to the Alpine rail links, for example, the Brenner link or the Lyon-Turin route.</p>
<p class="contents">These projects, which fully meet the priorities of sustainable development, are some of the most complex, both from a technical point of view and in terms of their financing. Furthermore, as you have said, considerable delays were also experienced in improving or building infrastructures between the Union and candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of energy, the recent communication on energy infrastructures identified many missing links in electrical interconnections between Member States and the Barcelona European Council set a very ambitious target for cross-border interconnection capacity of at least 10% of the Union’s production capacity to be achieved by 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">To support all these projects, which everyone agrees are necessary, the existing financial regulation for trans-European network enables us to co-finance competitive studies up to 50% and competitive work up to 10%. Under no circumstances can we exceed the latter ceiling. If we assess how the regulation has been applied, it is clear that the level of 50% for studies provide a real incentive whereas the limit of 10% is not sufficient to launch projects and attract private investors where this is possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of this, and in line with the White Paper on transport policy problems, and in response to requests made by the Gothenburg European Council with regard to increased financial support for rail projects, the proposal to revise the financial regulation that is before you today seeks to raise the maximum ceiling of Community financial support for trans-European networks to 20% for cross-border rail projects that cross natural barriers or for projects to eliminate bottlenecks in the rail network, as has already been possible with the current regulation for satellite radio-navigation projects such as Galileo.</p>
<p class="contents">This support of up to 20% will be applied to both cross-border infrastructures with the candidate countries in order to cope with the predicted increase of traffic between these countries and those of the Union. An additional EUR 100 million will also be granted to these projects, which include all types of transport, aiming, first and foremost, to improve the safety on the main transport routes and also to eliminate bottlenecks on these routes.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of energy, the increased level of support will apply to 12 priority projects that the Commission identified in its recent communication on the energy infrastructures and whose financial profitability is not yet guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">Our aim is very clear therefore: to allow Community financial support to fulfil its role as a catalyst, including in the project development phase, and to make investments in cross-border transport and energy infrastructures more attractive to private funding.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the amendments and the report itself, the Commission would first of all like to thank Mr Turchi, as the report on which he worked upholds, even strengthen the scope of several aspects of our proposal. Of the amendments which were proposed, in other words, 15 amendments, the Commission must however reject Amendment No 2, as it affects our right of initiative; Amendment No 12, as this arises from a misinterpretation, and I will come back to this; Amendment No 14 which establishes restrictions that fall outside the scope of the regulation, and Amendment No 15, which considerably alters the nature of the Commission’s proposal since it removes the chapter on energy.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other amendments that the Commission is able to accept in part, but in part only. These include Amendment No 3, the wording of which is confusing as the development phase of energy projects can already, under the current regime, benefit from funding of up to 50%; Amendment No 7, the second and third paragraphs of which we cannot accept, as they are being confused with the Structural Fund. This Fund is made up of multi-annual programmes, which is not the case for the budget of the trans-European networks, decisions on which are taken on an annual basis, thus the same comments also apply to Amendment No 12 which I mentioned earlier. Mr Turchi, you must not confuse trans-European networks with the regional development fund.</p>
<p class="contents">I have three comments to make regarding Amendment No 8. First of all, the Commission agrees to include projects to promote safety in the criteria eligible for the 20% rate in Article 5(3). However, the Commission does not agree to the reference to road and waterway intermodality. This definition is much too vague and it risks opening up possibilities of providing increased financial support, particularly for road projects, which are not Community priorities, contrary to the desire expressed in this debate also by Mr Bradbourn.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would draw your attention to the fact that the Commission proposal only relates to two sectors, transport and energy. As far as telecommunications is concerned, given the fundamental differences between the two sectors that I have just mentioned, the Commission is unable to accept the proposal to extend this increased level of funding to telecommunications at the current time.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now turn to Amendment No 10. The Commission wholeheartedly supports the proposal to transform the trans-European financial committee into a consultative committee. However, we do not wish to keep the amendment which seeks to propose the presence, without voting rights, of a European Investment Bank representative and of representatives from the candidate countries as observers, as this would run counter to the process of decision-making by comitology to which we must all adhere.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Amendment No 13 is concerned, as with Amendment No 8, the Commission is able to accept the part which seeks to promote safety, but not the rest of the amendment. Lastly, out of the 15 amendments, all those that I have not mentioned, namely Amendments Nos 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 11, the Commission is able to accept all these, with, where necessary, some changes to their wording, since they seek to strengthen the scope of our proposal and, in particular, I would like to stress that we share Parliament’s concern with regard to the need, within the framework of the next financial perspectives, to obtain a budget that will fulfil the very high ambitions that we have all set for trans-European transport and energy networks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
