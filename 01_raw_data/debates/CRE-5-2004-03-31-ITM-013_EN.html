<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Scarbonchi (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, since 1959, the intergovernmental fund intended to finance cooperation between the European Union and the ACP countries, known as the EDF, which covers a period of five years as part of the Cotonou agreements, has operated on the basis of contributions from the states involving cost sharing. France and Germany today provide almost 42% of the total financing. The fund is managed by the Commission, with delegation to the beneficiary countries.</p>
<p class="contents">For the period 2003-2007, over EUR 15 billion are available for new commitments, more than 10 billion for payments. It should be noted, which is scandalous, that a balance of 11 billion euros are available because they have not been used under the terms of the sixth, seventh and eighth EDF. After numerous vain attempts on its part, the Commission felt that, as the ninth EDF was due to expire in 2007, when the enlargement of the EU would already have taken place and as the debate on the financial framework after 2006 had started, it was time for another debate on the inclusion of the EDF in the budget. The Commission is therefore in line with the constant concern expressed for years by Parliament, mindful of budgetary discipline, about the rapid and effective application of resources and the role of codecision which would be devolved to it by inclusion in the budget, whereas today its role in this area is non-existent and it can quite simply not perform its budgetary control task.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the current malfunctions, what are the advantages of inclusion in the budget? Firstly, providing democratic legitimacy thanks to parliamentary control over the financing of the EDF. Secondly, ending the clumsiness of the procedures, rationalising them, simplifying them, coming closer to the beneficiaries, accelerating the rate of cash withdrawal, improving the effectiveness of the aid. Thirdly, introducing transparency. The complexity of the current system makes it totally opaque as regards the use of the funds. Fourthly, as regards the balance to be liquidated, the EUR 11 billion I mentioned earlier, sensible improvements could be brought in by inclusion in the budget. Fifthly, ensuring that all states contribute. As you know, if the EDF stays outside the budget, the total value of the tenth EDF risks being limited by the low contributions made by the ten new members of the European Union. On the other hand, if the EDF is included in the budget, the contributions of Member States will be set by budgetary rules. Sixthly, preventing delays in the entry into force of the EDF owing to the obligation of Member States and the ACP countries to ratify the Cotonou financial protocol. If the EDF is included in the budget, ratification disappears, hence a gain in time in the use of the EDF funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there are risks and the ACP countries, like some Member States of the Union, are particularly sensitive to these risks. The risks are: ensuring a fixed level of financing, fearing that the funds reserved for the ACP countries are devoted to other uses or transferred to other applications, as was seen for Iraq or Afghanistan, as could be seen for the reconstruction of a state. This worry is real and it will be noted that the budget has technical means of safeguarding the credits allocated to the EDF. The financial projections set ceilings for the heads for several years and it would therefore be sufficient to create a sub-head, as there are today for headings 1 and 7, in order to prevent and limit this risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, there is the whole problem of multiannual planning. The EDF covers five years. Over five years, these funds may be used or carried forward. The fear of the ACP countries is that, under the terms of inclusion in the budget, after one year, unused funds would be lost. This is why we are asking, with the agreement of the Commission, for a regulation to be drawn up establishing the multiannual nature of the EDF and allowing the funds to be used according to technical criteria to be put in place and which are practically already in existence today. This is important, because it would make it possible to reassure the ACP countries which are afraid not only that the total amount of the EDF will drop, but also that they will lose a large part of the funds previously allocated to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, and this is important psychologically, in human terms, politically and technically, the ACP countries must be involved in the management of these European Development Funds. How? We propose in Article 11: quite simply by giving the ACP Parliamentary Assembly and the ACP countries the ability to question, the ability to verify and the ability to protest with regard to the use of these funds, which would be done under the control of the European Parliament and in codecision with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">This involves elements that I should like briefly to present to you. Everyone knows this dossier well. If it is approved tomorrow and above all if it is accepted by Member States in the future, which is going to be a difficult task, as will getting it accepted by the ACP countries, it would be a true revolution, since it would finally mean the third EU policy not included in the budget being incorporated into its framework, something that we consider to be of benefit to us, to the ACP countries and above all to development policy, which certainly needs it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to say that the budgetisation of the EDF can promote the efficiency and flexibility of our development aid as a contribution to the eradication of poverty. It will put an end to the peculiar situation of administrating the aid to these countries by means of two different systems and we will thereby be able to increase the efficiency of the funds. Furthermore, it will allow us to establish political and budgetary normality, and simplify and harmonise the procedures, also allowing us to strengthen democratic responsibility, by making it possible for the European Parliament to play its full role as budgetary authority in this important area.</p>
<p class="contents">Budgetisation does not jeopardise the qualitative achievements of the Cotonou Agreement. Nevertheless, we understand the concern of the ACP countries about the risks relating to it, in particular with regard to the future level of aid.</p>
<p class="contents">We entirely agree with Parliament that there should be no reduction in the funds intended for cooperation with the ACP countries, and the Commission's communication clearly stipulates that the aid to these countries must be maintained, as a minimum, at its current level, and furthermore evolve in accordance with the whole of the heading and, at least, the European Union's gross domestic product.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree with Parliament that we should provide the ACP countries with a degree of protection in order to prevent the funds made available to them from being used for other purposes. We believe that the best solution to this problem is legislation decided jointly between Parliament and the Council with a reference sum for a period of one year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s Communication on budgetisation has given rise to an intense debate, within various bodies, with the ACP countries, with the Member States of the Union, in Parliament and in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, and has brought cooperation with these countries to the forefront of political debate at a time when the financial perspectives for the period are being debated.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has not yet adopted a definitive position on the issue and the choice between budgetisation or EDF remains open. But it is necessary to reach a Community position on budgetisation during this year, since the negotiations on the revision of the Cotonou Agreement are expected to be held between May 2004 and February 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like once again to thank the rapporteur for his work and guarantee that the Commission believes that the level of aid for ACP countries must be maintained and that if there is new support for other countries or if the Commission's efforts are increased in other geographical areas, other than the ACP countries, it must not be at the expense of the ACP countries, but quite simply the global volume of the funds intended for these extremely important European Union policies will be increased. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Development Fund came from the desire on the part of the Member States to help regions in Asia, the Caribbean and the Pacific develop. At present all EU Member States participate in the funding, although the way they do differs slightly from how they contribute proportionately to the European Union budget. The management of the European Development Fund is confusing. The agreement on the fund has to be ratified by all EU countries and two thirds of the recipient countries. This generally takes years. As a result there have been delays in its implementation and fluctuations in the degree of financing. The funds are managed by the Commission, but the authorities in the ACP countries implement the projects. One problem is the weak administrative capacities of the recipient countries. There is poor parliamentary control. The European Parliament grants discharge, but it is difficult to clarify administrative procedures and clear accounts. A consequence of this confused system of management is inefficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">Because each development fund is meant to be used in its entirety, the result is that what is left over from previous funds is transferred to subsequent funds. At the same time there has been an increase in outstanding commitments, which now stand at EUR 11 billion. At the same time the same countries are being granted development aid out of EU budget funds, to the tune of approximately EUR 700 million in 2002, for example. These funds are managed in accordance with the EU’s Financial Regulation. They are made available during the budget procedure, the Commission is responsible for how they are used, and the financial statements come under scrutiny during the discharge procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for EU development cooperation and in the interests of the ACP countries that the management of the European Development Fund can be simplified and made to work more efficiently. That is why the Commission’s initiative to integrate the EDF into the EU budget is right. That way administration would be simplified and made to work more efficiently, the funding procedure would be stabilised, and future financing via the EU would be harmonised as one whole process. For that reason, the Committee on Budgets supports the Commission proposal on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an item that has been put on the agenda with clockwork regularity over the past 25 years. But given the point at which we now find ourselves, Europe must not and cannot let this go. It will not be up to us here in Parliament. If the Council adopts the advice of Parliament, the European Union will be another step closer to a really democratic and transparent policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is out of date for the EDF not to fall within the power of the Budgetary Authority. It is also out of date for Parliament not to have any say in the level of the funding, the programming or the allocations for each country, region or sector. We are after all talking about half of the total EU development aid budget! Currently the EDF escapes our parliamentary control almost entirely and this lack of control is by no means redressed by the only power that the Parliament does have in respect of the EDF, that of granting discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from this democratic deficit, there is a second drawback to keeping the EDF outside the budget, which is the duplications that occur in the annual budgets of the Union and the EDF. The funding of food aid, humanitarian aid and thematic operations in ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific) countries often comes out of the Community budget. This duplication means that one monetary flow of aid passes from the same donor to the same beneficiary under two different procedures. That really should convince the Council. It is also inconsistent with the reforms that began some years ago in the external relations sector of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Budgetisation of the EDF requires a change in the administrative procedures and a change of mentality. I expressly seek the guarantee from the European Commission and the Commissioner that this will be carried out with care and that the Cotonou Agreement will remain the framework for the budgetised EDF, so that we do not lose the benefits of the present system, such as reciprocal involvement of the ACP countries and Europe and the multi-annual programming of the budget. However, in view of the benefits of integration of the EDF in the budget, this must not be an impediment to seizing this opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards content, integration of the EDF in the Community budget means that as a Parliament we can really work on achieving the millennium goals. I repeat, half of our entire budget is in the EDF. It must be stipulated in the budgets of the ACP countries that a minimum of 35% of the funds are to go to social welfare, 20% of which to education and healthcare. We must ensure, though, that specific allocations for countries and regions remain the basis and that movement of investments only takes place in consultation with the ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would point out that on integration of the EDF in the budget the coherence principle must be strictly maintained, so that aid and hands are put to work combating poverty. Mr President, Commissioner, this Commission proposal is eminently suitable for making the overall effort of Europe for the poorest countries, the ACP countries, very much more effective, more serious and more democratically controlled. I hope that you, with our support, will be successful in the Council. I would expect all countries to see the benefits that I have enumerated here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For several years, we, the Greens, have been fighting for parliamentary control and transparency, the guarantees of democracy. It is normal that the allocation and use of credits should be controlled by a body that is representative and democratic – characteristics that the EDF has not, it is true to say, manifested up to now.</p>
<p class="contents">Inclusion in the budget is one of the ways in which control of this programme may be guaranteed. It gives rise, however, to new problems. How to prevent the risk of transferring one budget heading to another, if there is no provision for some sort of ring-fencing? How to combine the Parliament’s annual budgetary compartmentalisation with the EDF’s five-year budget? The report does not provide enough solutions; it is a pity, since the flaws will affect the quality of control.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, mention cannot be made of the EDF without referring to other risks of misinterpretation. How do we prevent this programme, controlled exclusively by European institutions, from favouring, for example, European enterprises in the ACP countries? How do we prevent the development of large projects favouring powerful states being preferred to the initiatives of less influential states or micro-projects closer to the needs of the population? Worse still, how are we to ensure that it will not be used as a roundabout means of financing armies on the pretext of keeping the peace? All this would divert the EDF from its purpose, which is development.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite to the contrary, it would make more sense to use the EDF for actions aimed at improving public health or environmental protection policies, for example. To work for development, in fact, it would be more logical to delegate control to the joint ACP/EU Parliamentary Assembly. This would give us a real advance, guaranteeing real democratic control. In fact, who is better placed to rule on the allocation and use of credits than the joint Parliamentary Assembly, in terms of both political legitimacy and capability? It still needs to be given the means and the responsibilities. All those Members who have spoken have said how dear democratic principles are to them. It is for the sake of their defence and their effectiveness that we cannot content ourselves with simple control by Parliament. We shall, however, support this report as the symbol of a first step, one that is decisive, but doubtless insufficient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It sends the wrong signal to take the decision to budgetise without a full exchange of views with our partners, specifically because it is not clear how this partnership will be maintained once the EDF is budgetised. It is crucial that these concerns are addressed in an open constructive dialogue with our ACP partners and that all options are fully explored before reaching a decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Scarbonchi and the Commission have already mentioned the evident benefits of budgetisation for the EU. I am not quite as confident as the Commission about the gains for the ACP countries, for instance concerning the level of funding, the predictability and multiannuality of the funds. What is the future of the ACP-EU partnership under budgetisation?</p>
<p class="contents">Several ways of ring-fencing the Development Fund in the EU budgets have been proposed. They all imply special budgetary procedures, revision of EU financial regulations and of budgetary principles. How can we ensure that the necessary modifications for the adequate protection of funds will be adopted? Why does the Commission communication make no explicit analysis of the possible impact of budgetisation on future levels of commitments or disbursements?</p>
<p class="contents">Transfers and reallocation of resources between heading and subheading are possible under Article 274 of the EC Treaty. Will the budgetary authority protect the EDF once it is included in the budget, or will it address new emerging EU concerns, such as the new objectives stated in the recent declaration on combating terrorism?</p>
<p class="contents">These are some of the questions I would like to have answered before I can make up my mind on this important issue. As I have said, I would like to have this debate knowing the position of the ACP countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, no-one here this evening should claim that budgetisation is a silver bullet for the ACP for the delivery of the EDF. However, at the outset we should say that budgetisation would mean that we would no longer stash away hundreds of millions of euro, as has happened under the EDF – money meant for countries which for various reasons were not efficient spenders. It is the case that we should not underestimate, as Mrs Sandbæk has said, the ACP's concerns, but it is wrong for Mrs Sandbæk to say that there is no dialogue on budgetisation. It is happening, the ACP are preparing documents and there is clear discussion going on.</p>
<p class="contents">For some of the issues that have been raised, guarantees must be offered that resource levels for the ACP will be maintained and increased, and that means a five-year financial framework has to be jointly agreed with the ACP. We can fairly assume now that there is agreement between Parliament, the Commission and the ACP that there has to be ring-fencing over a five-year financial framework. The suggestion I made some time ago that we should have a sub-heading has not found favour. We might still choose to push that with the Commission, but certainly ring-fencing is something that is agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that as things stand the ACP can now hold its own in the budgets on the basis that it is by no means the worst-performing region that we deal with under external relations. It is quite condescending to presume or to suggest that the ACP could not manage that relationship under the budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerns are raised about multiannual funding of projects. Currently under the budget the so-called sunset clause applies and there will undoubtedly be pressure on the ACP to complete over a three-year timescale. But I personally have no difficulty with a three-year timescale. Very often I have been more worried than I like to say about projects which have ceased to be effective, which needed to be terminated and closed down, so a three-year period is something that we can work with quite easily.</p>
<p class="contents">The ACP is concerned about how co-management will be effective and about the role of the NAOs. It seems to me that the main priority for the ACP is not just about how they maintain administration of ACP aid, but how they maintain ownership of their own priorities and their own development strategies. There should be no fundamental problem with the Commission delegation signing contracts – why should that be a problem, because that would certainly speed up the process? I have seen far too many NAOs drowning under tenders and contracts. Far better for them to have the wherewithal to deal with development priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the principles of partnership are at the heart of the Cotonou Agreement. We want the ACP to be the centre of the dialogue and, as others have said, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly has an important role to play and assists us in focusing the Commission's mind on the views of the ACP and of ACP parliamentarians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only because of the lack of transparency, both in the decision-making and in the execution. We have to concede that the procedures were particularly cumbersome and we have found that hopeless delays have therefore occurred, to such an extent in fact that a backlog of EUR 11 billion in allocated funds has arisen for which the payments have yet to be made. It is especially shocking for public opinion to discover that poverty in the developing countries is increasing all the time and that there is no efficient way of channelling the money and of supporting the necessary projects directly and efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider this budgetisation highly desirable, although we are aware that it is not a magic wand. So far it has been a matter of voluntary contributions and we wonder whether we will secure the guarantees that the funds will be kept up. The Commissioner has certainly promised us that this will be the case, but provision still has to be made for the relevant mechanisms. Securing the level of the funds is one thing, but the guarantee that we will now really have a say in the assessment that the millennium goals will be taken seriously is another.</p>
<p class="contents">For me it is not at all a question of reducing the autonomy of the ACP countries in this respect. Any intervention would after all have to take place on the basis of a jointly agreed Country Strategy Paper and a Community action plan in which we must take the participation of the ACP countries seriously. I understand the disquiet of our ACP partners in part, but it would nonetheless be a disappointment if budgetisation were to be to the benefit of transparency but there were to be no efficiency in the spending of the funds. I therefore hope that we shall succeed both in maintaining the level and increasing the efficiency and the transparency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an untenable situation that a fund with an overall budget of this level is not subject to any democratic parliamentary control. I believe it is essential to establish this control. Mr Scarbonchi's report identifies an adequate range of options to safeguard this control without inflicting any damage on the ACP countries, because special consideration must undoubtedly be given to ensuring that no ACP country is put at a disadvantage.</p>
<p class="contents">Until now, the Council has been engaged in a kind of poker game over this issue, which is why the entry into force of the 9th EDF was delayed until 2003. It is absolutely essential that Parliament, in partnership and cooperation with the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, should be able to exert its influence. Implementing the objectives defined in the Cotonou Agreement must naturally be given priority, but the European Parliament can exercise accountability towards the public as well, which has not happened before.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me sum up some of the demands set out in the report and which are indispensable: firstly, to safeguard the principles of partnership with the ACP countries, which I think is a given; secondly, to establish legal certainty and predictability, especially for the poorest of the poor, by which is meant the least developed countries, who – with some justification – are concerned that they may go away empty-handed.</p>
<p class="contents">The task is to facilitate medium-term financial planning and not cling to the principle of annuality, which would make longer-term development cooperation impossible. Above all, of course, as various speakers have said, levels of development funding for ACP countries must be guaranteed. Even more important, however, is to prevent these funds being siphoned off to meet needs elsewhere. Instead, the resources must genuinely be committed to, and available to, the ACP countries and their use must be agreed with them on the basis of partnership. Provided that these criteria are met, I believe we will also clear up any preconceptions and reservations. To this end, we are hoping for support not only from the Commission but also, and above all, from the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
