<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rothley (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, the Legal Affairs Committee and – once this House has given its assent – Parliament as a whole, will be submitting to the Commission a complete proposal for a directive, a legislative initiative on the fixing of book prices in the European Union. Why do we need this initiative? Early in 2000, the Commission decided that the fixing of book prices across the German and Austrian border was incompatible with Community law. We accepted this ruling. Austria responded by enacting a law, Germany initially with a national contractual agreement, but even before this summer, a law on the fixing of book prices is to be enacted in the Federal Republic of Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">What are we working towards? If Member States do not want to fix book prices, then we do not want to impose it on them. Each Member State is to be able to decide whether to accept this system or not. That is most important, but the national system of book price fixing, which the Commission accepts, are in fact jeopardised by the importing of books, by the practice of exporting and reimporting them and by Internet trading. As one can think of many ways of circumventing the law via these routes, Community law has to contain competition provisions to guarantee that the permissible national systems of book price fixing are not undermined.</p>
<p class="contents">National rules are also jeopardised by commercial enterprises that also deal in books and unceasingly cause these national systems to be attacked by national and European courts of law in the hope that they will one day actually collapse. That is why there is a need for a directive to create a stable economic and legal framework for present and future national systems of book price fixing, without any associated obligation on those Member States that do not want such systems. Commissioner Monti, by the way, when I was having discussions with him about this, recommended precisely this approach. He was at that time responsible for these matters and said: ‘If we, the Commission, have decided, then we should think up a directive that, so to speak, gives this decision long-term durability in the future.’</p>
<p class="contents">What is at issue is respect for the Member States that have decided in favour of these systems. They do so for the sake of cultural diversity. Let me give just one example of this. In any one year, more titles are published in the Federal Republic of Germany than in the United States, so let nobody try to tell us that this cultural diversity could be maintained if the national systems of price fixing were to be abolished. That is the actual reason why the Commission has to ensure that we create this economic and legal framework to enable the Member States with these systems to retain them. That is what this proposal for a directive is about. It is not about making the fixing of book prices normative throughout the European Union. That is not at all what it is about; it is about safeguarding the existing directives.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, I have set out detailed reasons why the existence of these systems alongside each other can lead to distortions of competition and why this necessitates a legal basis for the European Union to take action.</p>

I am one of the latter. I would like to explain why.</p>
<p class="contents">The rationale behind the proposal that Member State governments will be able to allow publishers, artificially, to keep up the cost of "literature" as opposed to – as I understand it – airport novels, seems to me to be both silly and wrong. In my own country the abolition of re-sale price-fixing for books has coincided with an increase in numbers of books sold and published. No doubt this is partly the result of developments in technology, but to maintain that making literature more expensive than it need be is in some way in the public interest frankly stretches my incredulity beyond breaking point. I should like to give an example.</p>
<p class="contents">As the House may know, the Commissioner has written a number of books. There was one particular one that caught my fancy, which I thought I might like to buy. The cover price was not that expensive but it struck me as being a bit on the high side, so I sucked my teeth a bit and did not get it. But then I saw in a bookshop a discounted copy. Before you could say "knife" I had opened my wallet, put my money on the table and had a copy of the book. I was the beneficiary of the Commissioner's wisdom and he had a small advantage of my money which otherwise would not have occurred.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said all that I am a believer in subsidiarity. It seems to me that if Member States wish to introduce some kind of book pricing regime into their own country, it is not for me to stand in their way. I say that subject to one proviso, and an important one: against that background the rules of the single market should apply in their entirety. Books published elsewhere in the Community, in whatever language, should be able to be imported and sold according to the rules in force and the place of publication. Those are exactly the same principles as apply in the case of satellite broadcasting, which is essentially similar. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When we started discussing this in 1999 – the business between Austria and Germany is sufficiently well known – I had just been elected to Parliament, and today, three hours before my birthday, we are going a bit further. So I am very grateful that this debate is being held today of all days. I also thank Lord Inglewood, who, in one sentence, conceded that we are right. He said that he respects the decisions of other Member States and I thank him for that.</p>
<p class="contents">England and continental Europe differ in many respects, and it is these very differences that matter in our united Europe. This debate also made evident and re-emphasised our respect for each other. For that I especially thank Lord Inglewood.</p>
<p class="contents">My most especial thanks are due, of course, to Mr Rothley, and to all those who worked with him on this report. The Commission, which has repeatedly argued that this EU of ours is above all an economic and monetary union, has changed a very great deal in the last twenty years. A very great deal of interest in cultural aspects has been noticeable in the individual debates, albeit not enough in my view, but we have travelled a long way anyway. Together with Parliament, the Commission made a wise decision in early 2000, and if, by that wise decision, the Commission said ‘A’, then it is for the Commission to take the next step and say ‘B’. Now, in a world that has gone digital, we have different demands from twenty years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not only on behalf of my group, but also of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport that I can express overall support for Mr Rothley's proposal. Our current solutions to the fixing of book prices are not meant to represent an attempt at harmonising the European Union, but to give written expression to our mutual respect, and we have to get to grips with the digital requirements with which a new world presents us. Many thanks for listening.</p>

I have to say that I have just had my birthday. I began speaking this morning at 9 a.m., just after my birthday, and I am delighted – six debates later on – to be almost welcoming the honourable Member's birthday. Anyway, it is a pleasure to have begun the proceedings today and to be bringing the curtain down in this exciting debate, a debate whose excitement has been greatly enhanced by discovering that the honourable Member has found a remaindered copy of one of my books. I hope it was not a signed copy, as well as remaindered! But I can assure him that he could have got many cheap copies among those that were pirated in Asia over the last three or four years.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to this very serious subject, which I know has raised great passions and has produced a great deal of intellectual energy over the years: the question of the systems of fixed book prices in the Member States, which, as honourable Members have said, has been around for some time.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the Court of Justice’s opinion that truly national book price-fixing systems are not contestable as long as they respect the principles defined by the Court and do not have a restrictive effect on trade between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission maintains its position, based on the case-law of the Court, that it is not necessary to harmonise these systems. This is consistent with internal market principles and the objectives of cultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, as the House will probably know, the Commission has recently presented a proposal for a regulation on sales promotion which explicitly allows national fixed book prices. At the same time, it provides that Member States should not impose a limitation on the value of sales promotion, except in the case of discounts. This may address in particular some of the concerns expressed by the honourable Member in relation to matters related to culture.</p>
<p class="contents">I notice that the honourable Member's resolution aims to provide a Community definition of "circumvention" of the national price-fixing system and that this can be extended to booksellers in other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This definition reflects too broad an understanding of the notion of circumvention. It could undermine the free intra-Community trade of books, in particular via the Internet. I also note that the honourable Member’s proposal gives no guarantee against any adverse effect it could have on trade between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There may also be a question of the legal basis. The cultural provisions of Article 151 of the Treaty state that the Community can encourage cooperation in this area but not legislate. The subsidiarity aspects of any such proposal would therefore have to be studied extremely carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">A further consideration is the Commission’s commitment to better regulation. Any proposal to change a legal situation which has been dealt with by the Court must demonstrate clear benefits. There is currently no evidence to indicate that the Court’s case-law has to be further clarified.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will examine Parliament’s proposed directive in the light of the case-law of the Court and will assess, in consultation with the Member States, whether or not an initiative is necessary and what form it should take. At this stage however, there is little or no convincing evidence that legislative action is needed or is, indeed, appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to observe the markets and examine their effects on potential circumvention of national price-fixing systems, taking into account the cultural diversity of the book market and the existence of clear case-law of the Court of Justice.</p>
