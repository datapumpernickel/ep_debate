The European Parliament has, for the first time, been invited to participate actively in devising the EU’s development policy. When the current policy was decided on, Parliament was not involved in any way. In our view, the ongoing process, aimed at producing a tripartite agreement between the Commission, the Council and Parliament, is a great step forward. The present report constitutes Parliament’s response to the original proposal for a policy statement and our contribution to the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the original development policy was adopted in 2000, our world has undergone a number of changes. There are therefore powerful reasons to amend our policy and to design a new one. The agenda has changed, and issues of coherence, coordination and so forth have been given ever greater prominence. This is a quite splendid state of affairs, I think. Our report refers to the commitments to increased aid that have been made by a number of Member States and that will mean that the volume of EU aid over the next few years will be significantly increased. That is, of course, excellent. It is, however, just as important to debate quality as quantity. That is something we are trying to do in a constructive way in our report.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, the EU is the world’s leading aid donor. However, the effectiveness and quality of our aid have not, to date, been commensurate with its volume. Commissioner Michel himself did of course indicate a large number of major shortcomings, especially in the way in which aid has been coordinated in the past. There is poor coordination between one EU Member State and another, as well as between the Member States, on the one hand, and both the Commission and other donors, on the other. This means high transaction costs and a great deal of duplication, together with difficulties for our partner countries. The new development policy we are now debating establishes favourable preconditions for progress in this field. Issues of harmonisation are being given prominence.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to donor coordination and coherence, our report highlights a number of substantial issues to which we want to give added weight. These include democracy and human rights, measures to combat corruption, the important roles to be played by civil society and also by the national parliaments, the importance of strengthening the role of women in development work and the importance of paying more attention to the significance of natural resources, that is to say of forests, farmland and water and marine resources, especially in relation to the world’s very poorest countries. In addition, we discuss the importance of health and education issues, which we have been pushing for many years in Parliament, as well as increased efforts to combat the HIV epidemic. Finally, we refer, in particular, to the considerable problems encountered by many countries in tropical areas due to the more unstable climate.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank my colleagues for their very constructive cooperation. In my view, we have produced a kind of consensus document. There is one aspect with which we are especially pleased, namely the fact that, together with the Commission and the Council, we have, in this process, succeeded in conducting a constructive debate in which we have tried, as far as possible, to define the specific role of the Commission in the context of development. The Commission must not act as a 26th Member State in terms of aid donations, but must, naturally, make use of its special authority, its special capacity, its neutrality and its multilateral character in order to give some impetus to these issues and make certain things better than other institutions are able to. In this process, we have identified a number of areas in which the Commission, if I may put it like this, can make a difference and add value.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to thank you for your constructive cooperation. I hope that, during the next few weeks, we shall be able to arrive at a final document and that, in time, we shall be able to return to this question here in Parliament and have a broader debate in which the Council too can participate so that we might together also discuss how, subsequently, we might best begin to implement the new development policy and this policy statement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Louis Michel, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. (FR)</span> Mr President, Mr Wijkman, ladies and gentlemen, I think Europe has demonstrated its aspirations this year. It has proved that it is capable of carrying some weight in the world. It has done better than others in assuming its responsibility towards the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, in May the European Union gave some strong commitments to make its aid more effective and its development policies more coherent. In June, the European Union decided to double development aid between 2004 and 2010 so as to reach the target of 0.7% of gross national income by 2015. I would nevertheless point out that this commitment means an increase of EUR 20 billion a year by 2010 and EUR 46 billion a year in 2015. In September, the European Union’s intensive preparatory work made the UN World Summit a milestone, a key point in the quest for a more balanced multilateralism and a more just world order. I think we can say without any conceit that without the European Union that summit might well have ended in hopeless failure. There, too, the European Union made all the difference.</p>
<p class="contents">There is obviously still plenty of room for improvement, however. If Europe wants to carry more weight, it must do more and make a qualitative leap in the way we work together. That is why in July we put forward the proposal for a European consensus on development, a proposal I have presented and discussed in this House on several occasions. The interinstitutional debate that followed this document’s adoption by the Commission shows the diversity and wealth of opinion on the European Union’s role in the world. It is also an enlightening debate and one about which I feel strongly. I cannot deny, however, that some of the arguments being put forward by major players trouble me. Some give the impression that we have to decide between a Community development policy and the policies of the Member States, between those who would like to centralise development policy at European level and those who believe solely in bilateral cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">That, ladies and gentlemen, is not the issue. Europe as a whole today has more than 20 000 diplomats, three times more than the United States; is it acceptable for it to frequently take second place in political planning? When Europe is responsible for virtually 60% of development aid, is it today acceptable for it always to dispense that aid through 26 different programming documents and implement it using 26 different procedures?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the answer is no, it is not acceptable. Europe’s influence and effectiveness must be on a par with its resources, and that is precisely why I have suggested to the Member States and the European Parliament a common platform for the European Union as a whole, a platform that will bring together its values, its aims, its principles and its field of action and will apply to the European Union as a whole. This platform, the European consensus, would be an essential step towards more coordinated, more complementary and more resolute action by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">What is it all about? We, Parliament, the Council and the Commission, share the same values, the founding values of the European Union. We share one paramount objective: the eradication of poverty wherever it is found. We share an international agenda: the Millennium Development Goals and the Millennium Declaration. We share principles of partnership: shared responsibility between industrialised and developing countries, the appropriation of poverty-reduction strategies by the partner countries, the involvement of civil society and non-state players. We share the principles of aid effectiveness: concentration rather than fragmentation of efforts, coherence of policy, coordination and division of labour between donors, the harmonisation of our procedures, alignment with the partner countries’ strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution presented by Mr Wijkman today is remarkable. It highlights the key positive elements of the Commission’s communication and makes a constructive contribution to improving the consensus; it was a great help to us in our tripartite discussions and I thank him for it. I congratulate him and your Parliament, too, on the exceptional quality of this contribution. I would like to give you a brief summary of the points of the resolution, which I support unreservedly, the points that form the basis of our consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, a clear reference to the statement on development policy in the regulation that will govern the financial instrument for development cooperation. I have no doubt that this response will strengthen the very status of the statement.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the analysis of poverty as a multidimensional phenomenon requiring a range of responses and a balance between the socio-economic and environmental pillars of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the importance of equality between men and women. In this connection, I would like to inform you that the Commission has proposed including Parliament’s text among the guiding principles of the statement.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, it takes a rights-based approach. I believe the Commission’s proposal of including human rights and governance as complementary objectives to poverty reduction meets Parliament’s request perfectly.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, all the priorities mentioned in the resolution are covered by the Community’s fields of action: the prevention and treatment of Aids and other diseases, reproductive health, gender equality, adjustment to climate change, trade for development, conflict prevention, good governance, preventing corruption and promoting decent work, which includes preventing child labour.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are very pleased that Parliament is open to a move towards budgetary support, because that will enable us to be effective and to develop countries’ capacities. In this way, we can help to improve the management of public finance and support institutions, including national parliaments. Those institutions must play their part fully and act as budget guardians. At the same time, I am convinced that this is a powerful way of initiating and fostering political dialogue with our partners. I therefore thank Parliament, which with this resolution is making a significant contribution to more effective action for development and laying the foundations for close collaboration between us in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This aim of this tripartite statement, which sets out a common vision for the European Union’s development cooperation, is to help achieve greater cohesion, coordination, complementarity, quality and effectiveness. One might well say that it will be impossible for our vision of development cooperation to become reality unless these goals are achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the 40 years that development aid has been provided to Africa, the situation on this continent has got worse rather than better. We must do something to reverse this trend, and this report and the motion for a resolution are an attempt to bring about such a change.</p>
<p class="contents">Our resolution covers many key issues, and I should merely like to draw the House’s attention to a few of them. One example is the weight attached to the role of national parliaments in implementing development cooperation. This applies not only to aid recipient countries, but also to certain EU Member States. On a related note, the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly will adopt its report on the role of parliaments in implementing the Cotonou Agreement next week.</p>
<p class="contents">I would be absolutely delighted if the parliament of my own country, the Polish Sejm, were to devote more attention to development issues. This is all the more necessary because it will be hard for us to earmark 0.7% of GNI for development aid in future unless national parliaments show commitment and understanding.</p>
<p class="contents">Another crucial feature of this resolution is that it highlights the key importance of education. It is a simple fact that development will be impossible without access to education, and without gender equality in the field of education, though of course not only in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also deserves our praise because it stresses the need to improve the quality and the level of coordination between the Commission and the Member States. I should like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What we are discussing now is what the European Union’s policy in the field of development should be over the coming years. This is a field that directly affects millions of Europeans, many of them committed and public-spirited young people; the kind of citizens whom we should try to win over to the project of European integration. Nevertheless, the way we are treating these issues today, as if they were something entirely marginal and insignificant, will increase their indifference, their scepticism and their rejection of what the European Union means.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, we support what the Commissioner has said and, in particular, the excellent report by Mr Wijkman, and we would like to acknowledge his good work and his efforts aimed at synthesis and compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialists voted in favour of the resolution and it was approved practically unanimously by the Committee on Development. We believe it to be correct and we hope that it is not changed for the worse by certain amendments, which would oblige us to vote against the final text.</p>
<p class="contents">Something quite different, however, is the document resulting from the negotiation between the Council and the Commission, quite rightly with the participation of Mr Wijkman, on behalf of Parliament’s Committee on Development, a participation which has certainly contributed, as Commissioner Michel has acknowledged, to the incorporation of many of our principal concerns and demands in this field into the ‘European development consensus’ statement.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I would like to make it clear that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament believes that approving the resolution proposed to us in the Wijkman report does not presuppose that the text agreed by the Council and the Commission will be approved and that, in order to be endorsed by Parliament and hence be a tripartite agreement, it must have the express support of the plenary of our Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I very much regret the lack of will on the part of the European Parliament to promote a genuine development and cooperation policy. Instead of resolutions that tend to be forgotten rather quickly, it would be better if Parliament played an active part in drawing up a definite coherent strategy for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we must congratulate and thank Mr Michel, the Commissioner, for his initiative in seeking to define, in a tripartite statement of the Council, the Commission and Parliament, the common principles to which the EU and the 25 Member States will refer in implementing their development and cooperation policies. It will give the European Union a document setting out the European consensus on this question.</p>
<p class="contents">We see this as a major advance for at least two reasons. First of all, it is the first time that Parliament has been involved to this extent in the process of mapping out this policy. Through their representatives, the peoples of Europe are therefore having their say on the major directions of development and cooperation policy. Secondly, and this is a real step forward, the hour has finally come to look for synergy between Member States and the Commission when action is taken. How can we respond to this initiative if we vote at the end of the part-session and almost in secret, when everyone’s mind has today been focussing on one of the main issues of the legislative period?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, there is no point in going into the substance of the debate that took place in committee; that would not bring anything more at this present time. Today I want in particular to congratulate our rapporteur on his commitment to this matter and the successes he has already achieved following his conversations with the Council and the Commission. By taking account of the suggestions made by the members of the Committee on Development and managing to incorporate them into his text, the rapporteur has united a very large majority in support of his approach, affirming, for example, the desire that the joint statement should stress questions of education and health. Having said that, I would like to make one thing extremely clear: my group’s support for today’s report in no way prejudices our position on the final draft of the joint statement. That requires a solemn vote by Parliament. If we want this Commission initiative to be fully effective and the joint statement really to reflect the European consensus, it is and will be essential that the European Parliament gives its verdict on the final text in plenary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What has emerged from the trialogue is a good initiative, and it is, procedurally speaking – as has already been noted – somewhat uncharted political territory, so we are again particularly grateful to Mr Wijkman for having done such efficient work in the trialogue for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and for this House and for having produced this fine report.</p>
<p class="contents">This report and this consensus can be a significant step closer to more coherence in European development policy. There is, after all, a great deal of consensus in this House as to what its objectives are, and on the pre-eminent importance of combating poverty, which is not just about pushing poverty back, but also about uprooting it, establishing social justice, creating equal opportunities for development and achieving the Millennium Development Goals. So much for the theory: we have to be clear in our own minds that the practice falls a long way short of that. The new ‘Human Development Report 2005’ tells us that the number of people living in absolute poverty is continuing to increase dramatically.</p>
<p class="contents">It is right, then, that we should concentrate our efforts on investment in food safety, education, health and social security. The developing countries need to be helped to go their own way; they need to keep control over their own development strategy, and so it is right that the principles of ownership and partnership should be centre stage. The European Union must scrutinise all policy areas in terms of their impact on development, especially the policies relating to trade, agriculture and fisheries. That is the theory; now, in practical terms the policies of twenty-five countries need to be more closely coordinated. We would like to see more coordination on the part of the Commission and the Council and more co-decision for Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU’s efforts at development cooperation must have the overall objective of reducing poverty, and eventually abolishing it, through sustainable development. That is what makes it simply vital that the document we have before us today again clarifies the need for countries’ debts to be set aside and for it also to be ensured that they never again fall into the debt trap, for example by increasing the funds supplied to them as grants.</p>
<p class="contents">This summer, both the UN and ‘Global Health Watch’ repeatedly pointed out that the last ten years have seen an extraordinary increase in the inequalities between and within countries, between rich and poor, and that we in the EU need to do more to face up to the situation of the poorest in the world. Above all, it is they who are hardest hit by the consequences of privatisation and the increasing exclusion from such resources as land, water and woodland. More and more, too, they are denied access to food, health, culture and education, and so we need a development policy that addresses these tasks; the aim of producing a document expressing the consensus of the three institutions of the European Union is one that I can only welcome. Mr Wijkman, who is representing the Committee on Development in the negotiations, has our full support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have all seen evidence of the fact that the former are rapidly leaving poverty behind them, whereas the latter are incapable of extricating themselves from extreme poverty and health problems, in particular HIV-related problems. The reason for this can be found in people’s mindsets and a lack of education. We should take this opportunity to place particular emphasis on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I believe that Mr Wijkman has drafted an excellent report, I must unfortunately voice my objections once again to the House. My question is why this report contains a reference to reproductive health and rights, which after all is just another name for abortion. It is no secret that the House is divided on this issue, and yesterday we witnessed incidents in connection with the exhibition held on Parliament’s premises. I fail to see the point of this ideological approach, which means that we are confronted time and time again with an issue that divides the House. We should hold a separate debate on the issue, instead of bringing it up at every given opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore ask the House to vote in favour of Amendments 3 and 4, which have been tabled by Mr Szymański. They seek both to delete the reference to reproductive rights and to highlight the fundamental goals, which include adequate food, clean water, better sanitary conditions and education.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard Commissioner Michel complain in this House about the fact that there is no such thing as an EU common foreign policy in this area. One can only wonder how such a common policy could exist, given that we witness attempts to undermine it at every step. Russia engages in policy-making with France and Germany without any regard for Poland, or at least this has been the case with governments to date. I hope that the new German government will adopt a different approach, and I also hope that things will change when President Chirac leaves office.</p>
<p class="contents">The solidarity we show to our immediate neighbours in matters of common interest will be a measure of the European Union’s success, both at EU and at global level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have clearly played a vital part in the work that can be presented today. I hope that Parliament’s contributions will enable the final document to meet with everyone’s satisfaction, an outcome that would constitute an extremely important step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kaczmarek has spoken to us about the role of the national parliaments and I am inclined to agree with him. If you recall, moreover, I travelled to a large number of national parliaments in order to defend the increase in public development aid in the various countries, and I would like to take advantage of being given the floor to confirm that I am always willing to go and answer questions or to participate in sittings within the national parliaments. I believe, in fact, that in a number of countries it is helpful for the national parliaments to be mobilised, informed and motivated with regard to the issue of development. I am therefore fully prepared to dedicate myself to this task.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Martinez, you say that the current statement is disappointing. I readily admit that it is not perfect – that goes without saying – and I hope, moreover, that we will further improve it. That said, this statement does, despite everything, already constitute an important step forward, as this would be the first time that the European Union had access to a framework in this area. This would also be the first time that a policy was endorsed simultaneously by the Commission, by Parliament and by the Council, and that Parliament, like the Commission, would find itself providing, in my opinion, a more powerful lever for making development policy more effective and better coordinated. Therefore, I too of course would like this statement to be far more ambitious. Admittedly, it has been toned down at certain times but, believe me, we have not finished with our endeavours, and I am obviously relying both on Mr Wijkman and on certain Member States at Council level to help us to preserve the best and most progressive aspects of the statement.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Mrs Zimmer and the debt issue, we obviously agree on the fact that the debt burden must be reduced. On the other hand – but this would undoubtedly be another debate – I am not wildly in favour of simply cancelling the debt without any conditions and in all circumstances. However, I am resolutely and fervently in favour of reducing the debt or of cancelling it in very special cases and under very special conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Mr Libicki, I believe that this is a point on which we will not be able to agree. Your approach in terms of reproductive health differs from mine. You look on reproductive health as an ideological issue and I do not, because I, for my part, have a humanist outlook on the issue. I do not look on it as an ideological issue. Secondly – and I in no way intend to cause controversy here – I believe that you are confining the issue of reproductive health to abortion. I can see many other aspects to reproductive health; I can see above all the health and the rights of women and children. I am therefore not ideological.</p>
<p class="contents">I simply call on you to understand the reality in certain countries and in certain societies – I, in fact, encounter this reality on a very frequent basis – and I should truly like to be able to convince you that much still remains to be done on that score. Certain kinds of old-fashioned, conservative opinions – and I say this fully respecting the philosophical thoughts of others – do not seem to me to be overly generous in their responses to certain human tragedies with which I have come face to face. I therefore cannot accept this criticism. I am not prejudiced and I can respect everyone’s thoughts, philosophies, religious and other beliefs. I do believe, though, that at some point we should nonetheless go beyond those beliefs in order to see what really constitutes the general interest, in order to see what generosity really is and in order to learn how action should really be conceived for the best. This is what nevertheless seems to me to be a goal to achieve over and above any religious, ideological and philosophical divisions.</p>
<p class="contents">During recent months, Mr President, your Parliament has worked tirelessly to respond to the Commission’s offer and to contribute to obtaining a European development consensus representative of the will of the three European institutions: Parliament, the Commission and the Council. This joint effort is testament to the importance we all attach to development and shows that the institutions are working together to make our action more effective. We are right to do so. I have said many times over that development policy has the potential to be an important tool in making Europe a presence and a positive force in the world. Development policy could also play a crucial role in the Union’s foreign policy on account of its exemplary nature, not necessarily through its interventionism, but through the positive example it sets.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a role based on a long-term view rather than on short-term interests. This is a role that is focused on the well being of the people of developing countries, as well as on our own well-being. I believe that we are faced with a political decision: either we exploit this capacity in order to combat the negative effects of globalisation and in order to exploit the latter’s full potential fairly, or we stick rigidly to a charitable idea of development and wait for this idea to get completely out of hand, resulting in terrorism, massive and unmanageable migratory flows, pandemics, financial instability, poverty and destitution. Globalisation unites the North and the South and, in my opinion, development policy must act so that this union might be a source of justice and shared growth, and not one of dependency and poverty. The discussions with the Council are still taking place. The new development policy statement has not yet been finalised. What is more, I believe that, if everyone makes more of an effort, we are now really very close to a European development consensus. It simply remains for me to call on you to make one final effort together to follow up our joint work, in the spirit of the partnership that has united us over recent months with the aim of achieving our common objective.</p>
<p class="contents">As Commissioner, I should, at any rate, like firstly to thank you for your active contribution to the debates concerning my remit and my department, both for your pertinent questions and also, Mr Martinez, for your impertinent questions. I believe that it is crucial for the Commission permanently to be under pressure from Parliament because this is how progress is made. I believe that progress has never stemmed from consensus <span class="italic">a priori</span>. Progress always stems from tensions and from a clash of ideas, and I therefore thank you for having participated in this work. I believe that, without Parliament, I would have been very much worse off than I am today, and this without even mentioning the statement we have come up with today, which would have been far drearier than it is. I believe that we have here the grounds for drafting a fine text, which will represent a substantial step forward. In concluding this debate, Mr President, I wanted, for my part, to thank you once again for this contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">No, you are not going to trap me. I believe that I have been in politics longer than you, so rest assured that you will not trap me by dragging me into a heretical debate, because this is indeed a heretical debate. All the Members, all the humanists in this Chamber, whether they are Catholic, Protestant, Muslim or non-believers, are well aware of what we are discussing. I will not fall into that trap.</p>
