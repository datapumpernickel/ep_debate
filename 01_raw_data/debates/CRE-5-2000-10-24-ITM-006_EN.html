I certainly absorbed the messages of Biarritz and I was encouraged by the things that occurred there. I would just ask Minister Moscovici two further questions. Firstly, would he agree that it would be more sensible to restrict the use of closer cooperation solely to those issues where unanimity applies within the Council? As he appreciates, this is a growing feeling within Parliament. And the second question concerns the reaction of the candidate countries to the debate inside the EU Union concerning closer cooperation. Do you find that they welcome the prospect or are they perhaps frightened of it? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Matters are, therefore, perfectly clear. We wish to adhere to the<span class="italic"> acquis communautaire</span>, but at the same time we should not have regulations that are too inflexible. It is true that qualified majority voting is the main thing, but we must have some flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall have to take note of the reactions of the candidate countries. Firstly, I think it important that procedures should work properly with 15 Members, which is already a complicated matter. It would be a far more complex matter if there were 27 Members, but, as you know, the French Presidency is going to convene the European Conference on two occasions. There will be a ministerial meeting, firstly, in Sochaux, on 23 November, and there specifically we shall have a debate on institutional reform in the context of an enlarged Europe, and on the second occasion, on the morning of the 7 December at the European Council in Nice. The French Presidency is probably rather keener than others to get these countries involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, to make matters clear, reinforced cooperation does not mean a two-speed Europe. We have specifically stressed that an open and inclusive approach was needed, and no one should be afraid of reinforced cooperation. The ‘small countries’, for example, to use a quite inappropriate term, should not feel themselves excluded from reinforced cooperation or that reinforced cooperation means some sort of exclusive vanguard, centre of gravity or pioneer group. All it means is that there is a certain flexibility to enable specific policies to go ahead, even if some countries cannot, or do not wish to, participate, and what is true for the European Union’s Member States is also true for the candidate countries. No one must feel as if they are in a carriage being towed along by a kind of runaway train. This is not some sort of Directory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given that there is an embassy representing each of the 14 Member States in Vienna, why was it necessary to have the Three Wise Men look into something that the embassies could have monitored themselves on a daily basis? Did the embassies fail in some way? Did they fail to retrieve the reports? Did the relevant governments fail to read the reports? We really cannot avoid this question. Perhaps it would have sufficed to read one or other newspaper, but I would be most grateful if you could provide me with a brief analysis of the role of the embassies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, ambassadors are quite simply there to represent the government of their country.

<p class="contents">I therefore think it was quite appropriate, in this context, to ask an external authority, that was not morally implicated, to undertake this task. I think Austria has no call for complaint regarding what has been done, quite the contrary.

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 4 by John Joseph McCartin (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2000-0715_EN.html">H-0715/00</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Colombia</span></p>
<p class="contents">Is the Council aware of the most recent massacre, which resulted in eight deaths; on 8 July 2000 in Colombia in a place called La Union, and has it investigated the possibility that the atrocity was committed with the full support of the Colombian Government? Has the Council held discussions on this event? If so, does it propose to make any formal protest?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 5 by Laura González Álvarez (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2000-0776_EN.html">H-0776/00</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Violation of human rights and dismantling of paramilitary groups in Colombia</span></p>
<p class="contents">Paramilitary groups have stepped up the murders of farmers, journalists, trade unionists, political leaders and human rights activists over the past few months. Ramiro Zapata was the latest of 25 human rights activists to be murdered and, recently, the Colombian press condemned the paramilitary groups’ “Plan 100” to kill one hundred human rights activists. The government has recognised the “accidental” killing of six children in Puerto Rico on 15 August. Furthermore, Colombia has not assembled the units that the European Union asked it to create to fight the paramilitaries.</p>
<p class="contents">What measures is the Council taking or prepared to take to make aid to Colombia conditional on the Colombian government showing significant progress in respect for human rights and in firm action towards dismantling the paramilitary groups? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The matter to which Mr McCartin refers, however, has not been specifically referred to the Council, and the Council has not mentioned the matter as such in its discussions. While supporting the efforts made by the Colombian Government to make progress in the peace process, the European Union has stressed, and continues to stress, that government’s necessary commitment to respect for human rights in Colombia.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has also appealed for the commitment of all parties to seeking a negotiated solution to the conflict, without which it would be impossible to establish any lasting peace.</p>
<p class="contents">It is up to the Colombian authorities to define the practical means by which the Colombian Government might undertake to dismantle the paramilitary groups. Recommendations from regional organisations and the experience of neighbouring countries will doubtless be able to assist in defining these means.</p>
<p class="contents">On several occasions, the European Union has affirmed its willingness to support, to the extent that it can and with the most appropriate means, all efforts to secure a peace agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the international meeting on the Colombian peace process, held in Madrid on 6 and 7 July 2000, attended by Mr Solana, the representative of the 15 Member States and the Commission, the European Union is currently looking into practical opportunities for cooperation with Colombia. In this respect, a Joint Declaration should be read by France’s representative, on behalf of the Presidency, on the meetings in support of the peace process scheduled to be held in Bogotá on 24 October 2000, which should, in particular, stress the need to support the rule of law and the fight against the causes of violence, to boost aid for the victims of violence, to defend human rights, protect biodiversity and the environment, and step up consultation and regional cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">You may rest assured, finally, that respect for human rights, and the promotion of human rights, are, in any case, a key component of the European Union’s cooperation with third countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is something I am aware of, even if this plan is occasionally criticised, for instance, by NGOs. At the same time, from my own experience, I think you are somewhat mistaken in making such a generalisation. As far as Africa, the Middle East or the Mediterranean are concerned, the European Union is in fact the largest donor. But in that case we are in a rather peculiar situation given the historical links between the United Sates and the continent of South America.

Many of us believe that the problems in Colombia, as in other Latin American countries, stem from the issue of whether or not peasant-farmers own land.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1984, 0.2% of landowners in Colombia owned 32% of the land. In 1997, this figure stood at 45%, and today will be even higher. This is the problem, in addition, in many cases, to the actions of the paramilitaries, who force the peasant-farmers to move by means of indiscriminate killings. Here we have three cases in different parts of the country: In the village of Carmen, 500 people were forced to move by the murder of 14 peasant-farmers. In the port of Buenaventura, 20 peasant-farmers were murdered. Far away, in another area called Ciénaga, there have been over 200 murders since the paramilitaries moved in a year ago.</p>
<p class="contents">The question, Mr President, and I shall end here, is whether there is a solution that would exert greater pressure than that proposed by the President in his statement and whether the aid we are going to give will be entirely different from that of the United States, in other words, not intended for crop-spraying, but for crop replacement and also for social, rather than military, purposes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This matter raises questions of the objectives to be pursued, and questions of philosophy, of convictions and of analysis. Indeed everyone applies their own convictions and their own analysis in expressing their views on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to say, once again, speaking on behalf of the Council, that the Council is perfectly aware of topical events and the importance of these issues. The creation of a Tobin tax is an attractive option, one championed by many Members on both the left and right wing, by a variety of political and non-political organisations, non-governmental organisations, university groups. I shall therefore beware of giving a definitive answer to this difficult question.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to stress some of the practical problems which may give rise to debate, since this is the Council’s position. Firstly, I think everyone recognises that this tax, known as Tobin tax could operate properly only if applied at world level. It must be noted, however, that while it may be possible to seek a consensus within the European Union, no such consensus exists within G7, especially within the OECD, regarding levying a tax on exchange transactions. We are even aware, and this is an economic line of reasoning, that if there were a broad consensus, then a limited number of financial places would have a real interest in adopting an uncooperative attitude and refusing to apply the tax on transactions within their territory.</p>
<p class="contents">The question that I must ask those who advocate the Tobin tax, therefore, is exactly how we can offset that risk that would exist that speculative activities would shift location to tax havens, since this is a phenomenon which must be avoided if such a tax were to be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to have answers to the question of what influence it would have on the volatility of the exchange markets, particularly what would be the effect of a tax of 0.1 per thousand on speculators expecting devaluation in the order of 20 to 50%. There would, besides, be a risk of this tax being bypassed due to the high level of innovative performance in the modern financial world. The real question I have, then, does not concern the objectives of the Tobin tax, i.e. regulation of the exchange markets, making these markets more ethical by using them to fund development, but rather on our ability to ensure that these mechanisms are effective. Once again, this does not indicate my opposition in principle to the idea, as I am not opposed to it, certainly on a personal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">At the recent meetings in Prague, and at the meetings of the G7 and the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC), in its capacity as Presidency of the European Union, France proposed focuses for reform intended to provide a response to the concerns behind the, now old, proposal of establishing a Tobin-type tax. The communiqués of the G7, the IMFC and the statements of the IMF Director-General, Mr Köhler, moreover reflect the sympathies that exist in relation to the policy guidelines promoted by France, particularly as regards ordered financial liberalisation and combating money laundering. This fight, which is one of the priorities of the French Presidency, was expressed at both the Justice and Home Affairs Council and the Ecofin Council, and recently in a combined meeting of these two Councils.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that I am unable to respond fully right now to the question asked. I suppose you expect the Council to simply say yes. I think the question is a little bit too complex to give a simple yes or no answer, because while we may approve of the principles, there is still the outstanding matter of the practical arrangements, not to mention the existence of a consensus between the 15 Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Do you not think, by analogy with what the European Union is proposing to do concerning the tax havens adjacent to it or within it and on which the Commission and also the Council have the means to exert pressure, particularly in order to put an end to money laundering, do you not think that the European Union should, within international fora, be at the forefront of a movement for a code of conduct seeking to eliminate or at least restrict the operations of tax havens at the international level?

This is therefore a key policy guideline which, without constituting an alternative to the project for the Tobin tax, is perhaps more realistic in the short term and is one which the current Presidency values extremely highly.

As James Tobin said himself, the greater the product of this tax, the more it will have missed its target, as this will indicate that short-term speculative amounts have not been eliminated. Mr Tobin is himself opposed to the principle of using this tax to fund development other than as a secondary objective, as a tax intended to restrict and even prohibit certain types of transaction cannot at the same time seek to provide ongoing funding of development schemes. This is the principle, with which economists are familiar, of focussing an instrument on a single objective. We do have to consider a number of questions calling for specific answers, particularly on the subject of funding development, and clearly efforts must focus on the improvement and the quality of state aid for development, the development of trade, strengthening international financial institutions, and the issue of debt must be considered in depth once again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the first place I take exception to the argument that any tax tends naturally to reduce the consumption of the factor on which it is levied. It is true for all taxes and today there is no tax where the taxable activity has completely ceased. People have not stopped working just because there is income tax. They have not stopped polluting just because there are taxes on pollution, and they are not about to stop transferring money from one country to another just because there is a Tobin tax. So, clearly, the revenue from this levy will not be zero. It will all depend on its level, but there are a number of possible strategies and I agree completely with you that the objective of funding is secondary to the objective of combating speculation. The thing that astounds me is your claim that a minor amount cannot have a deterrent effect on speculation. The minor amount you mention is precisely in the same order as the daily variations in the euro/dollar exchange rate, and this is something we are attempting to combat by other, infinitely more costly methods. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Who is going to win the day, Bercy – as we refer to the Minister of the Economy in France – or the determination you expressed back then? Surely the time has come to stop passing the buck?</p>
<p class="contents">At national level, we are told to refer to Europe. Now, at European level, we are told to refer to the G7 or the OECD. Surely the time has come, specifically, to submit a proposal to the Council and the Commission so that we can issue a coordinated position from the various countries of Europe which will support the position of the other G7 members, such as Canada, for instance, which is ready to implement a Tobin tax as long as we ourselves are moving in this direction? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Further to the comment which Danielle Auroi made just now on the subject of the countries of the South, I would add that there are some expert estimates which provide some interesting figures, for instance, a range between USD 50 and 250 billion, which could be recovered by a Tobin-type tax, whereas, at the same time, the UNDP [United Nations Development Programme] amounts to USD 40 billion per annum, which would be sufficient to guarantee minimum living conditions for the hundreds of millions of deprived people in the countries of the third world.</p>
<p class="contents">So, at a time when people feel that politics does not have the ability to intervene in the economic sphere, and also more generally in the role of European construction in order to alter its conduct of international relations, do you not think that a measure of this kind could contribute to restoring confidence in the political world’s power to act and, hence, could it not serve as a message sent out to the countries and the peoples of the South? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I myself pointed out the reservations which Tobin himself expressed, in the final analysis, regarding his own instrument, particularly in terms of revenue. Indeed I think it crucial to organise, at some venue or other, debates where the arguments for both sides can be presented. I know that there are many people on both sides, both in favour of and against the Tobin tax.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we should perhaps attempt to get outside the too narrow area of preferences in order to also ask economic questions.

The Council is more than ever anxious to take every step possible in order to eradicate this disease. I should like to specify briefly that the recent increase in the number of cases identified does not mean that the epidemic is spreading wildly. It is, rather, the case that things are coming to light as a result of the increasingly widespread performance of tests on cattle carcasses which proves that the epidemic has, nonetheless, not ceased.</p>
<p class="contents">On 7 January 1999, the Commission put forward a proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation seeking to consolidate the texts previously adopted by the Commission as precautionary measures in order to establish rules for the prevention and supervision of certain forms of BSE. This proposal is based on the recommendation of the International Office of Epizootics on Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy and the various scientific opinions available. This was designed to offer consumers a guarantee of a very high level of protection. The European Parliament delivered its opinion on the Commission proposal at first reading, during the sittings of 15 and 19 May 2000. It adopted 48 amendments, 40 of which were accepted by the Commission. The Council is actively involved in examining the Commission proposal and these amendments with a view to managing in the near future to issue a position on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, in anticipation of adopting this directive on the prevention of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, a decision on the prohibition of the use of material presenting risks as regards these diseases was taken in June 2000, in order to stop any further spreading of the epidemic and in order to guarantee the highest possible health protection standards for the consumer. The decision therefore applies to the production and commercialisation of products derived from animals that are made from or contain materials from animals of bovine, ovine or caprine species. The specified risk materials for compulsory removal and destruction from now on are the following: “the skull including the brains and eyes, the tonsils, the spinal cord and the ileum of bovine animals aged over 12 months”; “the skull including the brains and eyes, the tonsils and the spinal cord of ovine and caprine animals aged over 12 months … and the spleen of ovine and caprine animals of all ages.” There are additional restrictions which apply to the United Kingdom and Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council, of course, is careful to monitor development in scientific findings and in the implementation of rapid diagnostic tests. These can then be taken into account in the text of directives on the prevention of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies which the Council is to submit to the European Parliament. The Council has not received any Commission proposal on compensation for farmers. For the time being, as you know, applications are to be made to national budgets in procedures for the compensation of livestock farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Ban on oil tankers in the Strait of Bonifacio</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Strait of Bonifacio is an extremely dangerous passage for shipping. And yet more than 4 000 vessels sail through it each year. The Corsican and Sardinian coastlines on either side are of exceptional ecological and historical value, as acknowledged by the 1993 Franco-Italian agreement, which prohibits French and Italian merchant ships carrying hazardous products from travelling through the strait. Far too much use is made of this passage by international shipping, in the hope of gaining no more than four hours, with all the risks it entails for vessels, many of which are in poor condition. How many potential Erikas sail through it each year? When can we expect the next disaster?</p>

These vessels are therefore bound to provide the Member State authorities with information on their itinerary and their cargo. Furthermore, the directive on inspection by the port state requires Member Sates to inspect foreign vessels entering their ports in order to check that they are compliant with Community and international legislation on maritime safety, protection of the marine environment and working and living conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding international traffic in transit, international law stipulates, subject to certain reservations, that the vessels of all states have the ‘right of innocent passage’ in territorial waters. The coastal states, however, while respecting this ‘right of innocent passage’, are authorised to set a number of requirements in order to ensure the safety of shipping and protection of the environment. In this context, the Commission has announced that it would present a proposal for improvement of the supervision of maritime navigation off European coasts. Already, following proposals by France and Italy, the International Maritime Organisation, IMO, has adopted two resolutions, which have been in force since 1 December 1998, on establishing rules for shipping traffic in the Strait of Bonifacio and making it compulsory for vessels entering the strait to identify themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be pointed out that, following the wreck of the Erika oil tanker, the European Union has taken the initiative of encouraging, within the IMO, studies about replacing single hulled oil tankers with double hulled oil tankers. The Council also recently issued favourable guidelines on the draft directives amending the 1995 directive on the inspection of vessels by the state port, and the draft on vessel inspection bodies. These two drafts, which are currently being examined by Parliament under the codecision procedure, are further aspects contributing to reducing the risk of pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, moreover, like to point out, as Commissioner Barnier did this morning, that these maritime safety issues, on the basis of a Commission communication, were dealt with in a totally positive fashion at the informal European Council in Biarritz, after the French Prime Minister simply asked the Commission to bring forward, if at all possible, the cut-off date for authorisation of single hulled vessels from 2015 to 2010, which seems quite a reasonable request, in any case, and a perfectly realistic ambition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These resolutions were adopted and came into force on 1 December 1998. I should moreover like to point out, however, that there are other constraints upon us.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding international traffic in transit, international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, stipulates, subject to certain reservations, that the vessels of all states have the ‘right of innocent passage’ in territorial waters. However, the coastal state may – in accordance with the terms of the Convention and other rules of international law – adopt legislation and regulations on innocent passage in territorial waters that may have a bearing on the following aspects: shipping safety, regulation of shipping traffic, conservation of the coastal state environment, the prevention, reduction and control of pollution. This is what we wanted to do in this context. However, and this is a complete response to your question, any ban on all ships passing through the Strait of Bonifacio would have to be agreed at the international level and be subject to an international convention. Any action by the two governments concerned is therefore limited by this international law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
