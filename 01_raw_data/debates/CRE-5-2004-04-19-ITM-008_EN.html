<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ghilardotti (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner Bolkestein, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission presented the communication on modernising company law and enhancing corporate governance in the European Union to the<span class="bold"> </span>Council and the European Parliament. This communication responds to the report of 4 November 2002 of the High Level Group of Company Law Experts, which Commissioner Bolkestein appointed for the purpose of, precisely, recommending a modern regulatory framework for company law in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication sets out the major political objectives that should guide all our future initiatives. It includes an action plan which lays down a timescale for a series of instruments, regulatory or otherwise, intended to be set up in the short, medium and long term, together with a grid indicating the priority of the measures themselves. In this proposal, the Commission has taken into account the need to respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, basing its own regulatory approach on gradual application, without however, losing sight of regulatory developments at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two fundamental objectives sought by the Commission by reforming company law in Europe: strengthening shareholders’ rights and third parties’ protection; fostering efficiency and competitiveness of businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The main grounds underlying this initiative can be distinguished as the establishment of a more homogenous reference framework for company law in order to facilitate cross-border establishment and restructuring; the creation of conditions to prevent a repetition of recent corporate scandals – among which the <span class="italic">Parmalat</span> scandal in my country stands out owing to its size – the consequences of which have severely affected millions of people’s livelihoods, pensions, jobs, savings and investments; making the most of the advantages offered by the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to realise the first objective proposed by the action plan, it is essential to provide an effective, up-to-date system to protect shareholders and their rights. We must also take into due consideration the position of certain third parties, who are particularly qualified in terms of their interests: creditors and workers. From this point of view, the Commission’s approach to the issue of governance seems simplistic and inadequate. Corporate governance is presented as a problem confined solely to relations between shareholders and management, as if a business were a body solely concerned with shareholders’ interests. In this way it is describing a virtual company, without giving due importance to workers and without more general responsibilities towards other categories of parties with an interest in the life of the company itself such as, for example, creditors and other stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the second objective, competitiveness of businesses may be fostered by various elements, including the inevitable existence of an appropriate regulatory framework for company law, firmly balanced between national and Community measures. I believe that the challenge that we must meet today is to aim to bring out the distinctive, characteristic features of European capitalism in the age of globalisation. In other words, we need to ascertain whether there is a true European model, which differs significantly from the North American model, not because it corresponds with and emerges from a framework of challenges and issues other than those which concern everyone in a context of economic globalisation, but because it considers social consequences and implications, making it more balanced and more human: a model, therefore, which seeks to conceive of the essential core of the corporate model, represented by a company’s interests, not just as the common interest of members and shareholders but as the interest of the company itself, a company which, as an independent economic operator, is also responsible for the specific interests of all parties outside and within the company itself. These include employees, customers, suppliers, creditors, the public administration, in its capacity as distributor of welfare and tax revenue, and the entire civil society, which is structurally connected, by means of the general and common interest, to the company’s prosperity and continuity.</p>
<p class="contents">One final comment of a general nature: we need to obtain the correct balance between self-regulation and legislative regulation when the European governance framework is formulated. Today there is a widespread tendency to fill regulatory gaps with self-regulation codes. This is positive but it does not go far enough. We need to maintain a system of legally binding rules, equipped with effective sanctions, applied by public bodies entrusted with the tasks of guidance and monitoring. The aim must be precisely to globalise governance rules and to place the public supervisory authorities into a network.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, we have focused our attention on certain key points, which I will just mention: transparency and shareholders’ rights, role of institutional investors, promotion of the role of independent directors, the specific issue of corporate pyramids, rights of workers as particularly qualified creditors of the company and the centrality of a system of public oversight of audits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   C<span class="italic">ommission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the Commission very much welcomes this debate on company law and corporate governance and the action plan connected therewith – an action plan adopted by the Commission almost one year ago. We broadly support the content of the resolution which has been submitted to Parliament. We very much thank Mrs Ghilardotti for the quality of her report.</p>
<p class="contents">This action plan is based on the firm belief that a self-regulatory market approach, based solely on non-binding recommendations, is clearly not always sufficient to guarantee the adoption of sound corporate governance practices. Only if there a number of tailored rules will markets play their disciplining role and ensure diligent business conduct. This is why, in view of the growing integration of European capital markets, a common approach should be adopted at EU level, laying down a few essential rules and adequate coordination of corporate governance codes.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent scandals have therefore strengthened the Commission's determination to implement its action plan. My services are actively working in five areas to have proposals ready, where possible, later this year. The five areas are as follows: first, the role of non-executive directors; second, the remuneration of directors; third, the responsibility of directors for company accounts; fourth, the full disclosure of intra-group relations and transactions with related parties, including transparency in the company accounts of offshore special purpose vehicles; and fifth, the disclosure of corporate governance practices.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim is therefore not to re-examine or reconsider the action plan in the light of recent developments, as requested in the motion for resolution; rather, it is to learn from those developments and to take due account of them when preparing the various initiatives that it contains.</p>
<p class="contents">When implementing the action plan, the Commission will also take due account of the interests of the various stakeholders – to which Mrs Ghilardotti made reference – and, where appropriate, distinguish between listed and non-listed companies and large and small shareholders, as is also requested in the motion for resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of the utmost importance that we restore trust and confidence in the audit function. I am therefore pleased to see that the rapporteur agrees with the main elements of the reform which I have set out in the proposal for an eighth directive on statutory audit. That should allow us to proceed quickly and, I hope, reach an agreement between the Council and Parliament in a single reading.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that the issue of non-audit services delivered to the audited entity is particularly delicate. The Commission has published a recommendation on auditor independence which sets out the conditions under which such services are still allowed. We need to see how this recommendation is applied in practice. Many Member States are in the process of transposing this recommendation into their national law.</p>
<p class="contents">It would therefore not be appropriate, at this stage, to fundamentally change our approach in that area. However, in our communication of May 2003, we announced our intention to carry out a study that will examine whether further changes in that area are needed. The results of the study will be available next year. At that time, we shall decide whether new initiatives are necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe, investors need to be better organised and more vocal advocates of corporate change. However, a sound corporate governance framework will not be achieved by the markets simply acting on their own, nor by the introduction of an overly prescriptive legal infrastructure. The challenge we are all facing here is to find the right balance between regulatory and market-based incentives and penalties. We therefore support the broad thrust of this resolution and we are working resolutely along those lines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I admit that we are only at the communication stage at present. This is a start, but the hard part will come later. Perhaps people’s positions will harden then. However, this is a good starting position, and gives us the green light for our negotiations on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with you, Commissioner, when you say that self-regulation has demonstrated its limitations. Self-regulation is not enough to define the new balance that is necessary in order to organise countervailing power within the undertaking, because it cannot be the shareholders themselves who organise that countervailing power. In order to organise real countervailing power, you need to take all the partners into account. That is the thinking behind the position which our rapporteur is proposing to Parliament and which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will support with great determination.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that the only difficulty here is first of all ensuring that there is a willingness to organise countervailing power by achieving a balance between the various partners, but there also has to be a willingness to preserve what could be a corporate model which corresponds to the balance that has been achieved as a result of our European experience, without necessarily copying other models.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are moving forward here, on legislation which will be very complicated to implement, at a time when these same issues are under discussion in every Member State. That, I believe, is the real difficulty on which you or your successor will have to take a decision. How can we make our rates of progress coincide, so that what is decided in Brussels is not immediately rendered obsolete by what the Member States themselves have implemented in the context of their national legislation? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The subsidiarity principle should be followed in order to leave scope for distinctive national features and traditions in the area, and we must avoid central corporate governance as far as possible. We must not strive for harmonisation of different codes of corporate governance. The share of voting power for different types of share is another example of what should not be decided at EU level, as this would cause problems for small- and medium-sized enterprises, or future companies, in some EU countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, what European industry needs is even greater openness and transparency in governance and accounting. This will improve the future flow of capital and market position. I note that some of the rapporteur’s views conflict with the committee’s opinion, but I wish to point out that there was a broad consensus on the adoption of the opinion and that it accords well with the Commission communication. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For the Europe of the 25 members, this imposes the need for us to impart an overall identity to business through which its international influence will be exerted. This identity for Europe cannot be divorced from practices which are sensitive to social and environmental issues. That is why I particularly regret that my fellow members in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats rejected my proposed amendment to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, in which I submitted that all directives on company law should include an obligation to inform and consult with the workers' representatives whenever important decisions are to be taken which affect the continuing existence of companies and jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a pity that, whenever we try to join forces with the productive system and employment interests, there is a rallying against such proposals, as if they represented a mortal danger.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, as far as protecting shareholders is concerned, I think that, without doubt, the protection of their rights should be strengthened. However, and I am pleased that the Commissioner admitted this, we must in all cases accept the distinction between large and small shareholders, especially with regard to the use of modern technology in the exercise of shareholders' voting rights, given that small shareholders are more exposed to risk. I am delighted that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market accepted the amendment in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, for the same reasons, special care must be taken to address methods which result in shareholders' being cheated out of their votes, as happens with arrangements which allow for the informal organisation of systems for the representation of shareholders by large anonymous groups.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I should like to thank the rapporteur, whose basic positions I agree with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, I would like to thank Mr Winter’s committee and the European Commission for this most excellent action plan. It is a very moderate and purposeful document, which quite deliberately does not try to do too much. I do not think we need any European corporate governance codes, it is quite sufficient if activities are sensibly coordinated and harmonised in the Member States. It is obvious that our systems of company law differ greatly and that harmonisation has not progressed very far as yet. A number of very important directives, like the fifth, have been filed away by the Council and never seen the light of day again.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, it is of course right not to want to go ahead with a European corporate governance code, because it will not work without a common, harmonised system of company law. That is why I believe, and the Ghilardotti report confirms it, that the Commission has presented a very good paper here and a good action plan over all. There were of course some differences of opinion between the political groups in the internal debate in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. I want to make clear, however, that these were not differences of principle, but differences over how things are formulated and the amount of detail gone into.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, Mrs Ghilardotti made a number of proposals, in particular for including trade union staff and social rights in the report. My group took the view that we should not do so in detail, because this is a paper about the company law action plan and not a social report or a social paper. That is why, in our group, we quite deliberately confined ourselves to a general statement on the social reasons for restricting property rights, and we believe that is sufficient and that there is no need for other social aspects to be mentioned in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">In all other respects, we believe this is a good report. With one amendment, we as a group will be voting for this report as it emerged from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I will start by briefly stating what I think corporate governance will not do. It will not necessarily make companies perform better or more profitably, and it will not necessarily cut out criminal or unethical behaviour, but it will set down a series of criteria for corporate behaviour that are likely to enhance transparency, accountability and systems of business conduct, which in turn give the wider world, shareholders, stakeholders and others an idea of what is going on. That is politically essential for 20th century European capitalism, set in a social market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is interesting how company law in the various Member States has created companies that differ qualitatively from one other. European company law can either legislate to harmonise this, or do nothing and let the inevitable process of convergence be driven by the market, providing no particular model is discriminated against. I would add that I am conscious of some of the waspish remarks made about what happens in my country. Against this background, the principle of 'comply or explain' is the right point to start from.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must not forget that in the global marketplace currently being created by the World Trade Organization, uncompetitiveness is a certain precursor of economic failure. If we fail to grasp this essential point we shall destroy ourselves, disinherit our children and betray Europe and our own countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission's action plan is part of an overall strategy to foster the efficiency and competitiveness of businesses and to strengthen shareholders' rights and the protection of third parties. However, there are also related initiatives which are part of that overall strategy. They include the Commission's activities on corporate social responsibility and in particular the work of the European Multi-stakeholder Forum, set up at the initiative of my former colleague, Mrs Diamantopoulou. It would therefore have been inappropriate to introduce under this action plan another policy framework concerning corporate social responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">What matters more is to do what Mrs Berès has asked the Commission to do, which is to take due and full account of the interests of all stakeholders in the measures the Commission will adopt. The action plan clearly recognises this need and the Commission is therefore committed to acting accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
