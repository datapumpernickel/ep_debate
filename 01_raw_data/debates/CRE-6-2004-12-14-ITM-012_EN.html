<p class="contents">The annual budgetary procedure is a perfect example of how interinstitutional cooperation should be. I have been a member of the Committee on Budgets for ten years and I have never believed that interinstitutional confrontation is the right way to resolve budgetary priorities. I believe that time has proven those of us who prefer agreement to be right.</p>
<p class="contents">The best conclusion for this 2005 draft budget would be for the three institutions to be moderately satisfied with the final result. It would be ridiculous to present this agreement as a victory for one institution over another, because I believe that Europe is made up of the three institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been a very complicated year from a budgetary point of view. We began with a reduction in the ceilings for categories 3, 4 and 5, which has made it very difficult to comply with this Parliament’s priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States have applied budgetary rigour, as a consequence of the Stability Pact, and that must continue in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had European elections: new MEPs, a new Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, who has worked very well and I congratulate him on that; a new Commission and a new Commissioner, who has also worked very well and I congratulate her on that as well, and I also congratulate former Commissioner Schreyer.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, since September of this year, I have been advocating the following budgetary strategy: to defend the European Parliament’s priorities with regard to the Lisbon objectives, information policy and the areas of security and justice. We defend these priorities because we are a political Parliament and we have promised our citizens a Europe with economic growth, job creation, better information on the present and the future of the Union, better control of migratory flows and greater security against crime and terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Our contribution to the creation of a genuine Community response to terrorism is this Parliament’s best possible tribute to the almost 200 Europeans murdered in Madrid on 11 March. I would like to thank all of you for your support.</p>
<p class="contents">It was fundamental to our strategy that the European agencies should not be funded unilaterally, at the expense of Parliament’s other priorities. If we want more agencies, we must provide new resources. That was our position and I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that this Parliament has achieved almost 100% of the strategy we established.</p>
<p class="contents">We have managed to mobilise the flexibility instrument in the sum of EUR 185 million and this is a new resource, which is greater than the ceiling of the financial perspectives. And with these new resources we have funded EUR 40 million of the decentralised agencies, which means that, for the first time, the Council recognises the need to provide new resources to comply with the new commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also used EUR 100 million from the flexibility instrument to fund the reconstruction of Iraq, thereby leaving sufficient budgetary margin to fund Latin America, Asia, the Mediterranean policy, the fight against disease and poverty and the democracy and human rights initiative, amongst other things.</p>
<p class="contents">We are still concerned about the issue of payments, despite the fact that we have a statement by the three institutions on the commitment to present an amending budget in 2005 if necessary. The rigour and austerity we all apply – the three institutions – is one thing, but the indiscriminate saving of payment appropriations, which could jeopardise budgetary execution in 2005, is quite another. This Parliament will be particularly vigilant next year. Budgetary savings should never be at the expense of the Union’s needs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has cut payments in agriculture by EUR 1 billion, which, from a budgetary point of view, is unusual, and we await further explanations from the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, ladies and gentlemen, we thank the Dutch Presidency for its pragmatism in the negotiation, which we expected, and its great willingness to reach consensus with Parliament, which has been a surprise. In any event, thank you, Minister, for the role you have played; thank you, Commissioner, for your mediation. I hope to cooperate closely with you during 2005. Thank you to the coordinators, the MEPs, the members of the Budgets secretariat and my own personal assistant.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been a pleasure to work with all of you on the drawing up of this 2005 draft budget, which I hope can be voted for on Thursday without too many problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jensen (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, administrative expenditure has not of course been the most difficult aspect of this year’s budget negotiations, especially since employees’ salary increases were clearly to remain below 1% this year instead of 2.6%, as originally foreseen. With the figures from Parliament’s first reading, there is thus a suitable margin below the ceiling for administrative expenditure. To this, we can add that certain institutions have been able to expedite their payments this year and have thus brought about the possibility of savings on the 2005 budget. All in all, it has therefore been successfully ensured that the other institutions – that is to say, apart from Parliament and the Council, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the European Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor – are able to make the planned staff appointments resulting from enlargement, staffing reforms and the reform of financial administration.</p>
<p class="contents">In practice, the savings due to the lower salary increases will now be implemented with the help of an amending budget in the course of 2005. It was that agreement into which we entered with the Council. We are not therefore voting on these savings at Parliament’s second reading but, by making savings by means of a second amending budget, we are also making savings on the Council’s and Parliament’s budgets, which have of course been drawn up in the light of the conciliation entered into with the Council at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, so good. It is important for all the institutions continually to ensure that the administration is as efficient and inexpensive as possible. It is especially important, moreover, that we obtain financial gains through cooperation between the institutions. That is also why I think it important that, early next year – and before 1 April – we obtain an updated report from the secretaries-general on how the appointments are going. We have seen the delays there have been in recruiting staff following enlargement, and I think it important that we closely follow up how these matters are proceeding so that we might see if there are likely to be problems.</p>
<p class="contents">In other areas, too, there is a real need for the institutions to cooperate in their deliberations. I should like at this point to restrict the focus somewhat and also issue a challenge to Parliament’s leadership. One practical example is the Committee of the Regions’ desire to be able to use Parliament’s meeting rooms in Brussels for its meetings. It makes good sense for us to make facilities available as long as, by doing so, we are not interfering with Parliament’s working arrangements. That is a decision that Parliament’s leadership must make. It must be a decision that fits in with our work, but also one that is remunerative.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s budget stands at 20% of administrative expenditure and appears reasonable in relation to needs. I would, however, emphasise – as I have done in the past – that in recent years we have been able to deploy major expenditure on paying for buildings under this 20% budget, and we shall thus save on rent in the budgets for the next few years. This will also happen in the current year when more than EUR 130 million will be paid out on the two new buildings – D4 and D5 – in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">When all is said and done, there will be some room for manoeuvre in Parliament’s budget for 2005, and I would therefore call upon Parliament’s leaders to look at the quality of the assistance we are given as MEPs, for example regarding translation and legal assistance. We often have to make compromises, including ones that are perhaps not always satisfactory, for example on the linguistic front. With enlargement and increasing legislative activity, we need access to advice, as well as to studies, consultations and analyses. It is now Parliament that is people’s window onto joint legislation, and we must therefore demand conditions that ensure we can do legislative work of the proper quality. The 2005 budget appropriates EUR 17.5 million to an increase in MEPs’ remuneration for the purpose of appointing staff. MEPs are experiencing an increasing burden of work as a result not only of the increasing legislative work but also of enlargement. The legislation on which we work is very often technically complicated environmental and commercial legislation, and we therefore require support in our work. That is why it is also only fair that MEPs be given higher remuneration so that we can appoint staff and, equally to the point, do so under reasonable working conditions. The amount concerned has been placed in reserve while we awaited a decision. The decision has now been made; clear rules in a number of areas have been adopted; and the Committee on Budgets will thus be able next year to adopt a position on removing the reserve in the light of a request by Parliament’s President.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say thank you for your constructive cooperation on this budget procedure. I would particularly thank Mrs Grybauskaite, our Commissioner, who was very active in bringing about a compromise on the budget. I would also thank the Council’s negotiator, Mr Nicolaï, and the rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, who I think have made fantastic contributions to the budget procedure. Last but not least, I would thank my colleagues, the coordinators, for their constructive cooperation on the budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Böge (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, this year’s mobilisation of the flexibility instrument is closely connected with the success of the Budget consultations and the agreement that we concluded – as we indeed needed to – between the institutions. Let me say, Mr President-in-Office, in retrospect, how good it is that at that time, in 1999, Parliament secured this flexibility instrument following laborious negotiations, for it has been very much to the benefit of the Council’s priorities when implementing past years’ Budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me once again remind you that the flexibility instrument, the annual upper limit of which the May 1999 agreement set at EUR 200 million, is intended to deal with unforeseen eventualities, and also that heading 24 of the Interinstitutional Agreement states that, as a rule, this flexibility instrument should not be applied for one and the same purpose in two successive financial years. Before this flexibility instrument is made use of, there does of course have to be a motion to that effect, and there has to be examination of whether new unforeseen measures are to be funded within a heading or, where this is impossible, by shifts between one heading and another, which is to be followed by discussion of whether the flexibility instrument is to be applied.</p>
<p class="contents">We go through this procedure almost every year, and what we have actually learned from the experience is that the interpretation put on this flexibility has sometimes placed it under some considerable strain. I would draw attention to this year’s result, which is that we have EUR 185 million at our disposal, EUR 45 million for the Peace II programme, EUR 40 million for the agencies – which are obviously among the Council’s really important priorities and are always threatening to displace important programmes in heading III, which yield added value for Europe – and EUR 100 million for the reconstruction of Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with specific reference to this that I want to point out that, in the current 2004 Budget, out of a total of EUR 90 million for Iraq, EUR 74 million have – as I recall – already been funded in 2004 with the aid of the flexibility instrument. That manifestly borders on the indefensible. As a rule, that should not be done. For that reason, I believe we would be very well advised, in the debate on the new Financial Perspective and the flexibility it calls for, to draw on the experience we have had of the use of the flexibility instrument over the past years. Let me take this opportunity to say that we are talking here, overall, in terms of payments from the 2005 Budget of EUR 106.3 billion and EUR 200 million allowed for flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">What is interesting about this year is that, for the first time, not only does heading IV – foreign policy – benefit from the use of the flexibility instrument, but also headings II and III necessarily benefit from what we have negotiated. The ultimate result of this, and what might be called an additional result, is that the Agreement has also made it possible – in a sort of legal/budgetary emergency operation – to incorporate EUR 120 million worth of funding for Northern Cyprus under heading VII and to add EUR 10 million to the funding for the common foreign and security policy, bringing it up to EUR 62.5 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, please allow me to make a final comment: our experience and the virtually annual debate on the use of the flexibility instrument must surely make it clear to both the Council and to Parliament, as they debate the new Financial Perspective, that the longer we set the Financial Perspectives for – be it 2007 to 2013 or whatever – and the longer the period for which the amounts are laid down, the more likely it is that we will need more flexibility to deal with the unexpected in coming years and will have to demand this of the Council in the negotiations on the Financial Perspectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following your deliberations today, allow me to make a few remarks in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Council had not initially foreseen the use of the flexibility instrument. In our global compromise the Council had to accept its use for a substantial amount – EUR 185 million – and this was not greeted with enthusiasm by all Member States. Because of budgetary discipline, the Council is of the opinion that choices have to be made, just as, at national level, one cannot simply add up all priorities and expect the bill to be paid.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, in preparation for the conciliation meeting, the Council listened carefully to Parliament's arguments. Parliament made it clear from the start that it would not be able to finance its traditional priorities and its new priorities in Headings 3 and 4, Internal and External Policies, under the existing ceilings. With the agreements on the use of the flexibility instrument in Heading 3, Parliament is in the position to restore the funding for the agencies. At the same time Parliament has secured sufficient funding for its priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the use of the flexibility instrument in Heading 4, I can agree with the draftsman of the opinion of Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs that the outcome can be seen as quite positive for Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to mention the peace process in Northern Ireland. I am pleased that we were able to agree on the financing of the Peace II programme for 2005-06. We are making a valuable contribution to a long-term solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Parliament's delegation made it possible to reach agreement by moderating the demands on payment appropriations. We have a balanced result, which the Commission says is workable. I look forward to the signing ceremony on Thursday. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Grybauskaitė,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I am very pleased to speak to you today, the first encounter for the new Commission in this very important exercise, starting on 22 November, which directly concerns the negotiations on the 2005 budget: a very important issue for Parliament and for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">After fairly tough negotiations on 25 November, when both branches of the budgetary authority showed skill and flexibility, we reached a final agreement on a tight budget for 2005. Parliament's solidarity and determination allowed it to achieve all the important goals it had set itself. The Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Lewandowski; the budget rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo; Mrs Jensen, the rapporteur on the flexibility instrument; Mr Böge, and other members of the Committee on Budgets who participated very closely in all-day and all-night negotiations deserve thanks from all of us for the hard-won results. The President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Nicolaï, also deserves our praise for having encouraged Member States to accept the agreement: not an easy task.</p>
<p class="contents">In the final agreement there will, of course, be some risk that not all compulsory expenditure is covered in what was decided in the package. According to updated estimates from the Committee on Agriculture, for example, some expenditure was ignored by the Council: extra calls for payments for the structural funds or actions during the year could be necessary. But I am satisfied that we agreed a joint declaration on payment appropriations for structural actions that can allow a rapid single-reading decision on a possible amending budget for extra payments if the Commission identifies the need in mid-2005.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on both budgetary authorities to react quickly if there appears to be a need to propose this. The same will also apply to compulsory expenditure on agriculture. We also want to emphasise that, as mentioned before, for the first time the flexibility instrument is being used above the ceilings in three headings and we agreed to use the total amount of EUR 185 million for this instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not going to emphasise the details of the overall package, which has been very well described, or the main agreements we reached. I would like to draw attention to what is important for us and is always important for Parliament, namely improving delivery.</p>
<p class="contents">Each year Parliament seeks to use the budget process to support the Commission's efforts to improve delivery, which we are happy to accept. The Commission's letter on implementability has the same intent. We have fulfilled the request made at first reading and you consequently released many of the reserves. I thank you for that.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is concerned about the way non-state actors and international organisations are using European Union funds. The Commission will produce a report by April 2005 examining these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">You have maintained a reserve for the financing of 50 new posts from the several hundred requested. I hope to introduce a transfer request in January to lift the reserve on these posts, since I believe the conditions have been fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">You ask for the rules to be changed on the financial regulation. I undertake that the Commission will bring forward proposals to modify the financial regulation by spring 2005, and the Commission has already introduced proposals to modify the implementing rules. The Council is ready to give its opinion. We await Parliament's views.</p>
<p class="contents">I will look again at your request for support for events and pilot actions. Not all of them are feasible, but the new political situation may provide new openings and I will communicate my thoughts on that to you in January.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission thanks you once again for your fair and firm negotiations and for your willingness to seek a compromise. I congratulate you all on the great success that you have achieved. I take this opportunity to wish you the compliments of the season and look forward to the final vote on Thursday. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is why I wish first of all to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Budgets, and in particular our general rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, for supporting and putting to the vote in this House most of the amendments submitted by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. Of these, several are aimed specifically at strengthening the European Union’s capacity to combat terrorism. This involves, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, an increase in Eurojust’s operating appropriations and the inclusion of a pilot project in the budget intended to enhance coordination, throughout the EU, of the resources and activities for preventing and combating terrorist threats. We have also proposed measures to strengthen the ways in which all Europeans show solidarity with the victims of terrorist acts.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the other priorities, I should like once again to highlight two of them, which are in our view of particular significance. We propose, Commissioner, to hold in reserve the bulk of the appropriations requested on passengers’ rights. We are aware of the disagreement between Parliament and the Commission as regards the level of protection for the personal data that the airlines have to provide to the American customs authorities. If we vote for the proposed amendment, the appropriations will remain frozen for as long as the Commission fails to propose an active rather than passive system for the transmission of data, as it has undertaken to do several times and as Parliament has asked it to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and I particularly address these remarks to the President-in-Office of the Council, we propose to hold in reserve all of the appropriations earmarked for the External Borders Agency. In order to be operational and effective, Mr President, this Agency needs headquarters – permanent headquarters. We ask the Council to establish such headquarters urgently and preferably before the end of this year. Mr President, you have already settled many problems and I think you are capable of settling this one before leaving office. Thank you in advance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our negotiations, Mr President-in-Office, have of course left an aftertaste, and about that I would like to speak in very plain terms. It goes without saying that the European Union needs to save money. We have to draw up a tight budget, and we have to be responsible in our handling of the money that the public have paid in tax, but the question forming itself in my mind is whether it is one of the tasks of the annual Budget procedure to put forward ever more recondite proposals for a Budget when you know already that there will be a supplementary Budget next year? Such is not a credible approach. In none of the 25 Member States – let me make this abundantly clear – would the national parliament tolerate such a way of going about things.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I ask you to try to rein in your fellow ministers in the foreign affairs departments and in all the other specialisms. I am anticipating the negotiations to which Mr Böge has referred when I say that there is no pleasure in laying down upper limits by way of the Financial Perspective when it is apparent to everyone involved that the figures are notional and will never – it is to be hoped – be reached. There I would ask you to be more honest. Almost EUR 5 billion separates us from the upper limit of Agenda 2000 – in the wrong direction! So please let us, when considering agricultural policy, talk about how much money we really need, rather than – as the Commissioner has just said that she will need a supplementary and amending Budget – laying down the amounts via the Budget procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not promise ourselves anything where the ten new countries are concerned, and then, if we want the 1.0% Budget that we obsess about, we will be able to save. That is not only what I ask for, but also the lesson that I have learned from these negotiations. Although we have achieved much together, all these negotiations now need to be addressed with a bit more seriousness.</p>

<p class="contents">Once again, I wish to express how baffled I am at the method used for producing the budget and especially, for this second reading, at the manner in which our dialogue was held with the Council during November.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that we have reached an agreement and achieved results, but did it really need twelve hours to arrive at what should have been achievable by means of real methods of dialogue rather than a set of people who did real damage to the content of the budget? We have now reached payment appropriations of 1.05% of GDP, which is above the milestone of 1%. In return, however, we have obtained an unhoped-for result for the flexibility instrument that will allow us to finance our priorities in the short term thanks to an agreement on Heading 2. We actually feel that obtaining this result was extremely important, albeit highly unsatisfactory in the long run.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when we are negotiating the next financial perspectives, we think that this method will not allow us a real budget for real European policies and the Council’s reticence during these negotiations leads me to believe that, if we speak of a ceiling in the negotiations, Parliament should also provide for the concept of a floor beneath which a European budget makes no sense.</p>
<p class="contents">Setting payment appropriations in stone while moving away from commitment appropriations is a usual strategy of the Council, but this is a strange course of action at a time when everyone – whether in the private sector or the public sector – is being asked to ensure transparency, reliability and truth when reading the budget figures. This cannot continue and the Union must be as strict with itself as it is with others. This situation enabled us to release the investments that we wanted in the very short term and my colleagues will speak to you about this.</p>
<p class="contents">We also hope – and I am addressing the Commission at this point – that we shall see very good budget implementation this year, especially in the field of information and communication with the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Like you, Commissioner, I hope that this year we shall make progress on the problem of setting up and implementing pilot projects, so that we are better able to meet our society’s expectations. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am going to take a few minutes to say that one budget heading perplexed us. I turn this time towards my colleagues to say that, when we agreed to vote for the package on special events, we were entirely in agreement that the concept of European secularism should be fully implemented. You gave us your word that World Youth Day in Cologne is to be characterised by respect for other cultures and philosophies and that European money is to be used in an entirely secular way; you know, as I do, that we shall be watching carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of the other institutions’ budgets, which took place without any problems, leads me simply to say that we must review our expenditure here because, by imposing severe restrictions on our expenditure, we have ended up imposing limitations on ourselves and denied ourselves resources for working and exercising our power and our privileges with respect to the other institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like simply to say that this budget will certainly be implemented without any great problem in 2005, but that it is a transitional budget, which does not provide any real means of ensuring continuity and this is what is worrying us greatly. Nonetheless, I think that Mr Pittella will be able to take up the gauntlet even though this method cannot last and might hinder us in the future from achieving budgets to match our political projects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to thank the rapporteurs, Salvador Garriga Polledo and Anne Jensen, for their excellent work. I wish, likewise, to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Lewandowski, for his sterling leadership of the committee and Commissioner Grybauskaitė and Mr Nicolaï, representing the Council, for their constructive cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU budget for 2005 may well meet next year’s needs, but there are question marks over it. There was much wrangling over payment appropriations, which looked as if they were going to be too small. Outstanding commitments at present are about to reach the EUR 100 billion mark, of which approximately EUR 70 billion represents the Structural Funds. The poor levels of implementation of the budget in recent years have now created a backlog. Right to the end, the Council wanted to limit payment appropriations. It took much effort to bring payments up to the level of EUR 106.3 billion, which is still EUR 7.9 billion below the financial perspective. That, however, is EUR 500 billion, or more than 1% of the EU’s GDP. This budget ceiling proposed by six Member States thus haunted the conciliation meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">Even the Council, however, doubted the adequacy of the financing by adopting the joint resolution which proposed that any supplementary budget relating to the Structural Funds should, if possible, be adopted at one reading. The statement runs contrary to good budgetary policy as the budget has to include all known expenditure for the financial year. It should be mentioned that at the same conciliation meeting it was agreed to increase the payment appropriations in the Structural Funds this year by EUR 3.7 billion, because funds have run out. Of this, EUR 2 billion was new money.</p>
<p class="contents">In the budget debate, the issue of the rapid rise in the number of Agencies in the European Union was raised. Next year there will be 23 of them, of which five will be new. EUR 40 million from the flexibility instrument had to be spent to meet their administrative costs, or else there would have been no financing available. In recent times, a lot of Agencies have been set up as a result of trade between Member States. In 2000 there were still only seven Agencies. We should therefore take prompt action to discover whether the Agencies are the most effective way to develop the EU’s administration. It might be that this way we are establishing units that are hard to monitor and which are partially responsible for creating nothing more than a double layer of bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Another question is presented by the various associations and organisations that are granted appropriations directly out of the budget. These earmarked sums are actually against the financial regulation. We believe the system to be based on favouritism, which muddies the grounds for financial support, making them unclear. Parliament should remain a legislative body and leave implementation tasks to the Commission, which would be the best way of monitoring impartiality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Trüpel (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the Group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner Grybauskaitė, Mr Nicolaï, ladies and gentlemen, we may, today, be discussing the agreement with the Council about the 2005 Budget, but we are, of course, already looking to see how things will progress with the 2006 Budget and what is to be expected in the coming years in relation to the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013.</p>
<p class="contents">So I will tell you in plain language that my political evaluation of the result we have achieved for 2005 makes me both laugh and cry. What I see as positive is the flexibility instrument. I would like to say here and now that I agree with Mr Böge, who made it very clear that we have succeeded in making these funds available now – not only for internal policy and the agencies, but also for foreign policy, above all for supporting the elections in Iraq. That is a success, and it was one that we in this House saw as urgently necessary if we were to be equal to all the tasks set us.</p>
<p class="contents">I see it as indispensable that we were able to uphold as part of the Lisbon strategy our priority of upgrading information policy, enabling us better to reach the citizens and voters in Europe. We Greens also see it as important progress that the LIFE programme and the programme for the protection of the environment have been prevented from falling by the wayside.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to say with equal clarity that what I see in a negative light is the shape taken by the payments for 2005. We do, admittedly, conclude that this round of negotiations did not offer more room for manoeuvre; that is why we will vote in favour of this Budget. I am right behind Mr Ferber in his criticisms of the Council and in his statement describing the 1% criterion as misguided fetishism on the part of the Council. I want to make that very plain to you, as I was very pleased to hear him say this and it does not often happen that Mr Ferber and I are of one mind.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that I do believe – and here I am addressing you, Mr Nicolaï – that you stated, not only in the course of our negotiations during the conciliation procedure, but also in this House today, that this House, in exactly the same way as the national governments, must be willing to decide on priorities. That is indeed so. My fellow MEPs have also already said that we all have a great interest in budgetary discipline and a serious approach to the Budget. In the same way, though, you cannot evade our question, for if we have to set priorities, the same must also be said of the national governments. Your belief that you have to make unilateral cuts in which European policy loses out I regard as the wrong approach. Politics risks being renationalised, and, for an enlarged Europe – for, for the first time, we are dealing with a Budget for 25 Member States – with new tasks and new challenges, that would be a mistake. If you want to fashion a truly European policy, you have to have the political courage to make the Budget reflect that. I do not at present see that in the position of the net contributing countries and in the obsession with 1%. That I regard as a mistake in political terms. If we want to join together in further developing our wonderful continent, if we want to do more for economic renewal, for spending on education, youth and new talents, then jointly, and together with you, the Council and the net contributor countries – and this is where I am critical of the red/green government in Germany – we must get moving in order to achieve more for Europe’s benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me express, by way of conclusion, my gratitude to all the staff and members of the Committee on Budgets. I hope that we will continue to work together with such powerful effect over the years to come in order to achieve much for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wurtz (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the Group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, my group has submitted a motion to reject the 2005 budget and I should like to explain the reasons for this initiative. My group has never argued in favour of a rash increase in the Union’s budget. We are committed to the rigorous management of public funds and, above all, we do not consider the budget to be the only instrument available to the Union to realise its ambitions. In this respect, we wish to highlight, for example, the need for a fundamental reorientation of the missions and operation of the European Central Bank. It remains true, however, that the Union’s budget reflects a political will. The stated objectives must be matched by sufficient financial resources, otherwise the EU’s very credibility is at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the increasing pressure being exerted to reduce public expenditure at all cost in accordance with the spirit of the Stability and Growth Pact, we have already had, in 2004, the lowest budget relative to gross national revenue since 1987. Year after year, Parliament has criticised this restrictive tendency, along with the laborious budgetary gymnastics that accompany it; such as the increasing numbers of transfers and amending budgets; the reduction in essential appropriations, such as those intended for developing countries, to be able to finance new demands, for example the contribution to financing for the reconstruction of countries severely affected by war, such as the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq; and the misuse of the flexibility instrument . Every year, Parliament criticises this trend and we have again just heard Mr Ferber, Mrs Guy-Quint and Mrs Trüpel echo this dissatisfaction. I propose quite simply that this should be reflected, this year, not only in words, but also in clear and visible action.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, for the 2005 budget, the compromise reached by the consultations held on 25 November, namely EUR 106.3 billion – in other words, not 1.05%, Mrs Guy-Quint, but 1.005% of gross national revenue – is less than the Commission’s preliminary draft, 109 billion, which was itself less than the Parliament’s request in first reading, 111 billion, a request in turn less than the commitments made by the Council, the Commission and Parliament as part of the financial perspectives jointly set in 2000, which set the budget at 114 billion. To indicate that we finally wish to put an end to this systematically restrictive and short-sighted policy on the part of the Council is the first reason for submitting our motion to reject the 2005 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason for our decision is that next year will be the first full year of the Union of 25. The success of this enlargement assumes, in our view, that we provide a budget sufficient to take on the unavoidable costs of interdependence associated with this great project, whilst ensuring that this does not involve abandoning regions or populations in difficulty in the old Member States. I should add that the new efforts, the need for which is accepted by everyone, to support employment, education, training, research and the environment require commensurate funding, unless it is considered that such new efforts are to be limited to just a few profitable niches and a privileged elite. Successful enlargement without bringing the populations of the new and old Member States into competition with one another – that is the second reason why we tabled our motion to reject a poor draft budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, 2005 will be the decisive year in the attempt to reach agreement between the 25 on the financial perspectives for 2007-2013. As has already been stated several times, a heavy millstone is currently weighing these negotiations down: the need of the six countries which are net contributors to the Union’s budget to have this limited in the future to 1% or 0.9% of gross national revenue. The Commission has drawn attention, quite rightly, to the fact that this would actually mean a swingeing cut of more than EUR 9 billion in the 2007 budget in relation to the preceding financial year. Where would such drastic reductions fall? On the great works announced with grand pomp and ceremony? On the Structural Funds? A little bit everywhere? Are we going to be ready for action when faced with such irresponsible perspectives?</p>
<p class="contents">If we were to accept without a fight a 2005 budget set at 1% of gross national revenue, would we not be, in some ways, falling in line with the mindset of the Letter of the Six? The third reason why we tabled our motion to reject the 2005 budget was to adopt a combative stance in Parliament before it is too late, on the eve of the decisive negotiations on the financial perspectives for the years to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Britain, we are told that this is a small price to pay for the privilege of trading with our neighbours and for the prosperity the EU has brought us. However, we are beginning to recognise, as kindly confirmed by ex-Commissioner Kinnock, that we do not need to be in the EU to trade and cooperate with EU countries and that our prosperity might well be higher if we were not in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">They also tell us that the EU budget is small in comparison with national budgets. However, national budgets pay for some useful things, such as defence, education, health care and pensions. The EU budget pays for subsidies to agriculture – subsidies that agriculture would function better without. It pays for regional projects that would otherwise not have been considered worthwhile. It pays for poorly targeted overseas development aid. It pays for auditors to find out that 93% of reported spending was unsafe or riddled with errors. It pays for this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us stop arguing about how much should be spent on this or that project or initiative in vain pursuit of the Lisbon Agenda. Let us look at the broader picture. As the last speaker has just said, several countries with their own budget problems want a limit of one per cent of GNI. The Commission rightly points out that it must be much larger if the expectations of the new accession countries are to be fulfilled. How much larger – two per cent, four per cent? If the EU were genuinely concentrating on the ideals it keeps proclaiming – peace, prosperity, strong economies – it would be acting very differently. It would not be looking at these various projects: it would be opening its markets properly, internally and externally; it would cease killing off our businesses with thousands of ill-judged prescriptive rules, and its budget could be a small fraction of one per cent of GDP. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission proposed a budget amounting to EUR 109 billion, the Council proposed a figure of EUR 105 billion and Parliament proposed EUR 111 billion. The final figure is EUR 106 billion. The rapporteurs must of course be thanked for their work, but the question arises as to whether this amounts to success and an appropriate compromise. In fact that is not the most crucial issue at stake. What is much more important is that the outcome is below expectations. I can see other Members of this House share my view. The policy of cuts won the day, despite enlargement of the Union to take in ten new Member States. Wishful thinking prevailed, namely that it is possible to have a larger Union for less money. The agreed level of expenditure may impact on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013, and this is even more worrying. The Union for Europe of the Nations Group’s attitude to the 2005 budget is that it is something that cannot currently be opposed, but we see no reason for rejoicing.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also an opportunity for broader reflection. George Kennan observed in the past that Soviet expansion came about because of an inability to solve internal problems. I trust the same will not be true of the European Union. Unfortunately, there are some worrying similarities regarding two issues, the first of which is economic policy. To date, the Union has pursued a policy of cohesion and economic solidarity, helping the less-developed countries so as to promote the development of the Member States as a whole. At present, the concept of cohesion and economic solidarity is being written out of Union agreements. Weakening cohesion policy or doing away with it altogether may lead to differences becoming even more entrenched in the future. This is especially likely if the Lisbon strategy comes to mean giving up on economic policy, that is, achieving the highest possible quality at the lowest possible cost, to the benefit of social policy in the more developed countries. I refer to protecting jobs in those countries burdened with excessively high social costs. The second question I would like to refer to is that Europe is unable to define its own identity. Events concerning Mr Buttiglione and the failure to integrate Islamic communities in Western Europe, as referred to recently in <span class="italic">Der Spiegel</span>, are both relevant examples<span class="italic">,</span><span class="bold"> </span>as is the question of the text of the preamble<span class="bold"> </span>to the Constitution. At the same time, we are continuing to debate enlargement to include Turkey, without taking any account of the fundamental issues dividing the Union from Turkey. The former include social, economic, political and cultural problems. The response to the conflict between the theory of universal standards and particular ones has been to do away with standards of all kinds. Those determined to go to any lengths to achieve a federal Europe without borders, lacking ideological identity and cohesion policy, are acting to the detriment of the Union. They are working slowly but more surely against it than those who currently wish to harm the Union with extremist language. There can only be one conclusion, namely that in future, the Union must come up with a broader ideological identity and make more resources available, so as to implement cohesion and solidarity policy effectively.</p>

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to pick up on my colleague Mr Roszkowski’s words and present a few facts and figures. For the year 2005 the Commission has come up with a draft level of payments of EUR 109 billion, in its first reading the Council has come up with EUR 105 billion, and Parliament has calculated payments at EUR 111 billion. This creates an impression of competent activity. In the second round the Council has come to us with a draft level of payments again at EUR 105.3 billion while Parliament proposes EUR 106.3 billion, which is about 5 billion less than in the first round. It is totally obvious who is taking the lead in this game of budgetary ping-pong, but it is also clear that the budgetary procedures are still not precisely defined.</p>
<p class="contents">If the proposed level of payments is passed by Parliament it will represent an increase of 6.5% compared to 2004. In comparison with the projected level of inflation in the Eurozone, this is a modest rise, but when set alongside the need to finance the political goals and priorities of the European Union there seem to be fewer reasons for optimism. As long as the quality criterion for the budgetary process of the European Union is the bringing together of the levels of contributions and payments, it is rather a reason for pessimism. A couple of days ago, the European Parliament approved the annual report of the Court of Auditors for the financial year 2003. In the parliamentary discussion about this report there was agreement about one of the key conclusions, namely that the draw-down level of credit payments or the implementation of the payments was rather low and for a long period has hovered between 80 and 90%. In this respect the draft budget for the year 2005 does not bring any turnaround as it suggests an implementation level for payments of 90%. As far as the structural funds are concerned, the levers for implementing budgetary resources in the form of the payments are in the hands of the governments of the EU Member States. It is therefore an important role of Parliament to use its political instruments and to gain the support of the media in exerting appropriate pressure on the governments and the Council in order to make fuller and more effective use of the disposable resources to finance the common policies of the European Union. If this does not happen, the parliamentary budgetary procedure will continue to be more a test of the loyality of Members of the European Parliament to the governments of their home countries rather than a test of the effectiveness and competitiveness of the budgetary process and the use of European Union resources. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have been able to find a satisfactory solution, but in any event, we believe that the solution proposed by the Commission would have been better because that would have saved us cuts in heading 4 in the sum of EUR 15 million.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Mr Böge’s comments are absolutely right, that is to say, we cannot take on new commitments every year at the expense of the European Union’s traditional external action priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We must rationalise the use of the flexibility instrument, which is governed by certain rules which must be respected for the sake of the credibility of our European Union project; in terms of the review of the coming financial perspectives, surely we will be able to reach an agreement on the solution to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would also like to thank the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development, Mr Wijkman, for his excellent cooperation and his willingness at all times to find solutions which are compatible with the priorities of his committee and the Committee on Foreign Affairs. I would like to take this opportunity to wish the Commissioner luck in her duties and ask her to facilitate our work by not taking on commitments which have no budgetary support, because I believe that, by taking that approach, we will be able to cooperate more effectively in relation to the objective that inspires us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this we should thank the rapporteurs, Mr Garriga Polledo and Mrs Jensen, all the political groups and the new Commissioner, who has given us valuable help and whose good wishes I gladly reciprocate.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement can be seen as satisfactory to Parliament because it brings with it many positive outcomes. It has been a difficult passage, but we have got through it, and have obtained funding for reconstruction in Iraq, the maintenance of traditional geographical policies, funds for SMEs, information and research as well as resources for the agencies. Also entered in the budget are resources for the structural funds and pilot projects, some of which are very interesting, such as Erasmus for apprentices and the pilot projects on conflict prevention and on small arms reduction.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot, however, pronounce ourselves satisfied with the way in which the chapter on payment appropriations was concluded. I am well aware that this is not the fault of either Parliament or the Commission, which in fact helped us and pressed as hard as it could. However, the stone-cold inflexibility with which the Council stuck by the 1% is worthy of a better cause and does not augur well either for negotiations on the Financial Perspective or for the next budget, for which I hope that it will be possible to achieve more ambitious and gratifying goals, as Mrs Guy-Quint also said.</p>
<p class="contents">We have gone a little beyond the 1% mark. It was right to give this signal, as Parliament will not accept a Financial Perspective which forces the Union to forsake its own tasks and duties, which are enshrined in the treaties. Peculiar ideas are circulating and sometimes a kind of psychological bullying is also used towards the new Member States to make them maintain the so-called rigorous line.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, rigour consists in transparent, effective and efficient administration, but it does not mean refusing to act with the leadership expected by European citizens. Article 158 of the Treaty affirms that economic and social cohesion policy is one of Europe’s main tasks. Anyone thinking of pared-down budgets, of reducing and concentrating the structural funds on certain areas only, of renationalising the cohesion policy and depriving the Lisbon strategy of the requisite resources should be aware right now that they will be met with the firm opposition of this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sure that both rapporteurs have done their very best, but, despite that, my group is proposing the budget be rejected for the reasons of policy that our Chairman, Francis Wurtz, mentioned at the start of the sitting.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem from Parliament’s point of view is budgetary discipline, which does not recognise flexibility to any adequate extent. Stringent budgetary discipline is supplemented by an interinstitutional agreement, which was smuggled through the European Parliament in May, 1999. The previous Parliament was unable, as is the current one, to have an influence on the ceilings for appropriations determined in the interinstitutional agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The only way to create more flexibility would have been to terminate the interinstitutional agreement that came about in such strange circumstances, but Parliament has not been prepared to do that, in spite of the fact that the inflexibility of the budget has been common knowledge. This lack of flexibility is in the Council’s interests, but not Parliament’s. I would, however, like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and the rapporteurs and coordinators, for their excellent levels of cooperation, even though my group has decided to propose that the budget be rejected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A couple of decades ago there were already predictions that the twenty-first century would be a time of increased risks and threats. Against this background the European Union’s wish to promote stability not only in Europe, but also to achieve greater influence more generally in world security processes is very important. This is confirmed by the European Union’s declared wish and growing ability to be able to participate in conflict prevention and crisis management activities – and of course the challenges are not decreasing.</p>
<p class="contents">It is anticipated that in the near future the number of civil crisis management operations will double. Specialists are discussing possible operations in Iraq, Sudan and the Congo. Maintaining a stable situation in the European Union’s neighbouring countries is no less important. It is worth mentioning Georgia and the operations in the countries of the Balkan region. Let us not forget that threats of terrorism inside the European Union are a real possibility. Measures to combat the spread of weapons of mass destruction are still important. Europe’s institutional capacities in the sphere of crisis management need to be developed.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it is very clear that the trend of the activities of the European Union’s common foreign and security policy is inevitably upwards. Seeing the amount of resources allocated for these measures in the budget for 2005, however, gives cause for concern about the discrepancy between Europe’s political ambitions and the financial resources available to fulfil these ambitions. The insufficiency of resources needed to successfully achieve Europe’s security strategy is often discussed amongst specialists in the institution within the relevant fields. Certainly, one should welcome the fact that at second reading the European Parliament has allotted 10 million more for <span class="italic">CFSP </span>needs than at first reading. However, even then it is not possible to understand the tactical reasons which led Parliament’s Budgetary Control Committee to allocate EUR 10 million less at first reading for the needs of coordinating these important goals. Unfortunately, in order to prevent this erroneous approach by the European Parliament, it was necessary to put the conciliation procedure into effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I, too, am in favour of ‘more’, but of more efficiency and transparency, whether we are talking about the Lisbon strategy or security policy. After all, we would have the money if we were, once and for all, to tackle the huge sacred cows that lurk in the Parliamentary budget and, of course, particularly in this enormous Budget, which runs to hundreds of billions of euros.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just make two points about it. Transparency would also mean making it plain how the political parties are now to be funded, a question to which first reading provided no unambiguous answer. Transparency would also mean another vote on the secretarial allowance, which is now again to be surreptitiously increased. Unfortunately, though, there is not going to be one. So you cannot be surprised at the perception that the Budget is about haggling, and that you, Commissioner, are described as someone who had conceded a billion euros an hour. No proper budget can be drawn up in this fashion; what is needed is explanation and change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should therefore like to thank Mr Garriga Polledo, the rapporteur, and also Mrs Jensen. It is worth remembering that the coordinators and Vice-Chairmen are responsible for the climate of cooperation characterising work on the budget in the European Parliament. This contrasts with similar work in national parliaments. Thanks are therefore due to Mr Ferber, Mrs Guy-Quint, Mrs Trüpel, Mr Seppänen, Mr Roszkowski and to Mr Walter, Mr Böge and Mr Mulder, the Vice-Chairmen. I trust the same climate of cooperation will prevail on Thursday, when we dot the i’s on the 2005 Budget. The final version of this budget resulted from very difficult negotiations with the Council. We appreciate the wish to cooperate and reach a compromise displayed by the Dutch Presidency, and in particular by Mr Nicolaï, and also by Commissioner Grybauskaitė, who acted as moderator during the tense hours of the meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly true that Parliament defended its priorities. It resorted to the flexibility instrument, especially in the areas of internal policy and foreign policy that are very important to us. Nonetheless, those who spoke in the House today emphasised that the situation will get worse. If we project ourselves into the future, into the next multi-annual Financial Perspective, things look bleaker. I am sure that slimming down the Structural Funds, together with a tripartite declaration to anticipate an amendment to the budget, cannot be described as sound financial programming.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the budget procedure, 2005 was a year of new beginnings. Consequently, the quality of administration was particularly important. I should therefore like to conclude by thanking Mrs Fialho, Mr De Feo and the whole team. They are genuine civil servants of the kind still sorely lacking in post-Communist Europe. They augur well for the success of future work on the budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have low interest rates, there are no inflationary pressures, and we have sufficient reserves. If we compare the economy of the European Union with the economy of the United States, however, we have to say that investors achieve a greater profit and a quicker return on their investment in the United States with the same level of investment. The European Union must therefore orientate itself towards structural reforms at all levels and in all its institutions. It is not appropriate to measure the effectiveness of the financial resources invested in particular areas and industries only on the basis of their scale. In the absence of feedback enabling us to evaluate quantitative indicators, we must integrate and advance the measurement of quality and the measurement of added value. This also goes for science and research, as Herr Wurtz has said today. The Member States must be engaged in this process. Each one of them should draft their own Lisbon Strategy, their own financial perspectives and base their revenues and costs on them. We all know that the main battleground for the Lisbon targets is the implementation of reforms at a national level. I mention all of this because when we talk about the annual budgets, financial perspectives and the Lisbon Strategy, we always talk about collective pots. We have finally reached a compromise in our discussions on the budget for 2005. I believe that we can approve the budget collectively. I would like to thank all the members of the Budgetary Committee for their constructive approach. We all know that the 2005 budget is a transitional budget. The drafting of new financial perspectives lies ahead of us. With the help of these we will have a chance of making a better start on the Lisbon Strategy, which would then take on a different quality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Last year, Mr President of the Council, Commissioner, the budget passed through the symbolic barrier of EUR 100 billion. This year, there is a feeling that the novelty has worn off. We have reached the end of two great budgetary cycles and the end, perhaps, of two political worlds.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, clearly, we have reached the end of the Prodi cycle, of the planning for 2000-2006 and already, with a temporary Commission, we have been and are still working on the 2007-2013 cycle. At the same time, however, we have also reached the end of the cycle of European budgetary modesty. The European budget, in fact, even at EUR 106 billion, is less than Spain’s (EUR 117 billion for Spain).</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone realises that, with the arrival of Turkey, it is not just EUR 277 million which will have to be added, at pre-accession stage, but EUR 33 billion every year. Ten years from now, consequently, the European budget will have doubled and the question of European taxation will have to be addressed. We shall no longer be talking about 1% or 1.24% of gross national revenue.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall then have reached the end of two political worlds. First of all, the world of Parliament-Council relations, since, in 2009, the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure will have disappeared and the anti-farming majority in this Parliament will rule against the agricultural world and the rural world. This will at the same time be the end of a second world, which is already happening now, since, in the 2005 budget, the agricultural appropriations have been cut by a billion euro and, subsequently, these appropriations are to be plundered in order to finance other things on the pretext of rural development. However, the disappearance from villages of post offices, railway stations, public revenue offices and public services clearly shows where we are heading.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I would have liked us, with the assistance of our rapporteur and the assistance of our colleagues, to be able, in the 2006 budget, to create a European public holiday in honour of rural mayors in order to pay homage to the work of the 90 000 rural mayors of the villages of Europe. Otherwise, our 2005 budget already belongs to the cosy little world of a Europe with worldwide ambitions and a provincial budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The PPE-DE Group expresses regret that the majority of the European Parliament has rejected our group’s proposal concerning the reduction of the European Parliament’s expenditure below the traditional 20% of total administrative expenditure. It has to be acknowledged that this year we channelled approximately EUR 150 million of unspent funds towards advance payments for next year’s expenditure. This clearly shows how well-founded the PPE-DE Group’s proposal was.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to other institutions, even before the first reading the European Parliament had evaluated the additional budget requests of the EU institutions and it supported at first reading those requests, which were acknowledged to be justified. One should recall that the majority of requests for additional budget allocations by the EU institutions are related to the enlargement of the EU, as well as with the new EU financial and staff regulations. Therefore, at second reading we principly renewed the requests for additional budget allocations by the EU institutions that the European Parliament had endorsed, but which the European Council of Ministers had rejected. In order to ensure greater EU budget transparency and appropriate use of budget resources, the European Parliament has come up with two new initiatives. Firstly, we invite the Commission, when it submits its annual draft EU budget proposal, to submit information at the same time, on official posts that are vacant or have been reorganised during the year. This will allow the European Parliament to better assess the justification for requesting new official posts. Secondly, in order to ensure more appropriate use of EU budget resources as regards the need for extra rooms, chiefly in connection with the enlargement of the EU, we invite all the EU institutions to work together and to allow their rooms to be used for the requirements of other institutions. This will make it possible to guarantee the rooms necessary for various meetings and other events without unnecessary additional expenditure on building or renting rooms.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a few words on regional policy. The European Parliament welcomes the improvements in 2004 for the acquisition of structural funds and does not understand <span class="italic">Ecofin’s</span> stance in reducing expenditure appropriations for 2005. The European Parliament considers it necessary to pay the commitments set out in the Financial Perspective in due time, and not to defer payments to the last year of the Financial Perspective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When, though, it comes to allocating the necessary funding, this does not – astonishingly enough – always apply. For that reason, where these agencies are concerned, the question arises in our minds as to whether personnel costs really belong there, because they eat into the operational appropriations, or whether the personnel appropriations ought to go somewhere else. I do not propose to go more closely into the technical details right now.</p>
<p class="contents">The other point I would make deals with very important areas. Of course we are glad that, in the area of measures to combat marine pollution, which was envisaged and proposed by the Council to be a zero entry, a token entry, there are now some funds available after all, so that we can at least explain to the outside world that we now have not only the political will, but also the means, to intervene in that area. It will be for the future to show whether the EUR 17 million will be enough, after we proposed far in excess of EUR 20 million. The same applies in the case of rail and air transport. There is evidence from these agencies that they cannot do the job properly with the funds allocated to them, and so the warning from the Committee on Transport and Tourism is that we cannot wait for the next disaster before adjusting the resources in line with the facts of the situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is the references to agencies and to bioterrorism, and I link those two because part of the bioterrorism work is done through the new Centre for Disease Control which has now been established in Sweden. One of the complaints of this paper is that these have not been adequately funded, so that there is uncertainty about how they are to operate.</p>
<p class="contents">Our citizens believe that Europe is very often engaged in spending money on activities that are less than necessary. There are some activities which they believe are fundamentally necessary. Their safety is at the heart of that and it is in our interests and our responsibility to ensure that they are properly funded. Therefore, I hope that in future the Commission and my colleagues in this House will ensure that agencies dealing with issues such as food safety, medicines control and evaluation and disease control and prevention are properly dealt with.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect relates to the work which lies ahead on vaccines and support for developing countries. We know how important they are – I myself have produced a report on the health threats to the countries of the developing world. We know that vaccination campaigns have been effective, but much more that can be done. In the last four years some 35 million children have been vaccinated – for example against hepatitis B – but millions of children are at risk and dying because adequate funds are not available. I very much welcome what is being done to put money into the vaccine funds, and I hope we can continue in that direction, because that, again, makes a difference of which we can be proud. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even though I am only moderately pleased with the end result, I do think he has done what he can in order to put the position of Parliament, but even more so the position of the European countryside, in perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel the same way about the Dutch Presidency, and this brings me directly to my major disappointment about this Budget. With this agreement, we are ultimately nearly one billion under the correct estimate and the Commission proposal about what is needed. I know that the Dutch Presidency has played a positive role in itself in order to prevent this in part, but I am disappointed greatly with the rest of the Council, where the last Commission proposal was eventually not followed.</p>
<p class="contents">Which surprises me if I consider the position of Europe’s countryside, if I consider the major agricultural reform that has now started and which will result in sometimes drastic drops in income, but it also surprises me if I consider the enormous programme for rural development that we need to introduce as yet in the ten new Member States. Given these circumstances, economising to that extent is unacceptable, certainly if we realise that agricultural spending will be around 0.4% of the GNP next year. That is exceptionally little if we see that European agriculture and horticulture meet the world’s strictest standards in terms of the environment, animal welfare, landscape protection, food security and food safety. Anyone who wants a cheap ride could get a nasty surprise.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot go on like this. I hope that this will not lead to further cuts in the agricultural budget, but that we will continue to fight for competitive agriculture, even in Europe. In that respect, I should like to say two things to the UK Independence Party Members and Non-attached Members in response to their expressions of blame directed towards European agricultural policy. I can tell them that the United Kingdom receives a disproportionately large share from the agricultural budget. My own country represents 7% of production and only receives 2% of the money. In the United Kingdom, the exact reverse is true. Without this Parliament, the foot and mouth crisis in the United Kingdom would not have reached a satisfactory conclusion. If these gentlemen can do nothing but make disparaging remarks, they have failed to get the message, including in the British countryside, and they are leaving the British countryside firmly out in the cold. In any event, Parliament, and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are keeping an eye on the British countryside.</p>

I believe that this budget compromise allows us to confidently look them in the eye, as it provides us with the means to reach our goals. But will the resources described in budget 2005 be sufficient for the long term? We understand that a state budget deficit makes governments try to minimise expenditure. However, if expenditure falls below a certain level, it becomes pointless: if goals remain dreams, then every euro spent will just be thrown down the drain. The current budget is not like this yet, but we should put a lot more effort into certain areas in order for our enterprises to be competitive on a worldwide scale and in order to help cohesion countries to catch up with other states sooner.</p>
<p class="contents">We must pay attention to the fact that this compromise, which I support, expends a lot less money than what was planned at the 1990 budgetary cycle. The question arises now at the time of planning a new cycle: what is the point in setting goals for the distant future, or giving numbers for several years ahead, if we do not fulfil them? We, who lived under Soviet domination, lived and experienced what it meant to construct five-year plans from gratuitous numbers. I would like to see the Union avoiding these pitfalls, I have faith it will, and I support next year’s budget.</p>

I pay tribute to the new Commissioner, and particularly the minister, who was in charge.</p>
<p class="contents">I heard reports that the Council of Ministers was at one in its stance on what the level of spending should be. As someone from the United Kingdom – although not of the same political party as the government – I very much welcome its statement, together with that of five other countries, that there should be no level of spending above one per cent of GNI or GDP. I am delighted that the outcome of this conciliation was exactly that.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the agencies, more thought needs to be given to the question of their income in the future. I welcome the move away from in-house activity, away from the Commission and into arms-length agencies; but these have mushroomed, which is a sign of their success. We now need to look at how much more income they can achieve from outside sources instead of just being given grant-in-aid or subsidies from this Parliament. I speak here as someone who was chief executive of the National Building Agency in the United Kingdom. We had to turn around very quickly from being 85 per cent supported by grants or subsidies to being wholly self-supporting. It can be done. However, I am not saying the change needs to be that vicious.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to structural funding, the very sensible agreement that was reached, namely, to reduce the spend in 2005 but to have an arrangement in readiness agreed by all parties that a supplementary and amending budget could be brought in at any time, means both that we have control over what is happening in 2005 and that reasons have to be shown why we need real spend in 2006. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is a cut of no more and no less than EUR 1 billion, compared to the European Commission’s preliminary draft budget, an unprecedented decision, taken, furthermore, within the key context of the debate on the European Union’s future financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I condemn the flippancy with which the Council of Ministers has adopted this decision because it jeopardises the funding of agricultural subsidies for next year, which are the consequence of a formal commitment by the Member States to the European Union's farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council's decision leaves the management of common agricultural policy subsidies in a precarious situation, and this will oblige the Commission to apply spending discipline which could lead it to commit more than one injustice.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been mention of the possibility of later on introducing the amending budget to patch up the holes in the 2005 agriculture budget, although so far we do not know where those necessary resources are going to come from. It is clear that the countries in favour of reducing the contributions to the Community budget have won the first battle, because the Council of Ministers has unanimously supported this cut.</p>
<p class="contents">This unanimity also included my country. Nobody has dared to question this decision, which, furthermore, takes no account of the opinion of this House. At first reading the European Parliament re-established the European Commission's preliminary draft budget, an initiative which has been completely ignored by the Council of Ministers, the only body with decision-making powers with regard to obligatory spending.</p>
<p class="contents">The cut in agricultural spending for 2005 is simply a forerunner of what could happen from 2007, when the European Commission will have to present a report to assess whether or not it is necessary to introduce cuts in the unit sums of the direct aid received by European farmers. Unfortunately, the European Parliament’s voice has not been taken into account on this occasion. I would, therefore, like to call on this House to try to prevent this situation from recurring next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am speaking in this House as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development on the Budget and should in fairness have been allowed to speak at the beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to congratulate Mr Garriga Polledo on his very skilful work, for his considerable sensitivity to views from the various committees and, in general, for his efficient handling of our deliberations. As current representative of the Committee on Development, I am delighted with the result. By making full use of the flexibility mechanism, we have been able to avoid significantly cutting back on long-term development programmes in order to make room for Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">I genuinely agree with Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra that we must find a long-term solution to the problem that, in general, arises every year in connection with major disasters and crises. We must protect our long-term development programmes if we are to have a chance of making a constructive contribution to the work on achieving the millennium objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the specific focus in heading 4, I am very pleased to have gained a hearing for the demand that the budget be more clearly oriented towards poverty alleviation. This is happening through the increase of EUR 30 million in the appropriation to efforts within Asia, where the vast majority of the world’s poor live. It is also happening through the increase in efforts in the area of health. More resources are being earmarked for the work on reducing the spread of HIV, malaria and TB. As Mr Bowis emphasised just now, a new programme to the tune of EUR 10 million is also being set up to combat other poverty-related diseases, with a special emphasis on vaccinations for young children.</p>
<p class="contents">Far greater resources are needed in the area of health, especially in Africa. The contributions we are now deciding upon mean that we are continuing single-mindedly to work with a view to increasing support for the health sector within the sphere of aid, and that is an entirely proper road to go down. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My first remark is in response to what Mrs Trüpel and Mr Wurtz said. It is absolutely clear that I am speaking here not on behalf of the net contributors, the 'one per cent group', or the government of the Netherlands, but on behalf of the Council. The Council was unanimously in favour of budgetary discipline. It was also unanimously in favour of only a slight increase in payment appropriations, taking into account the needs of an enlarged Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to concerns expressed by Mr Ferber, Mr Wurtz and Mr Maat about the level of payment appropriations not being enough for all the needs in 2005. The Council's second reading is based on the principle of budgetary discipline. The Council was united in believing that the level of payment appropriations was of prime importance. This is why the Council showed an example by reducing compulsory expenditure in the field of agriculture. In our global agreement, the payment appropriations are EUR 1 billion higher than the Council's estimate of what is necessary to fulfil the obligations in 2005. According to the Commission, which has to implement the budget, the agreed maximum amount is sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally important is the fact that the Council will take up its responsibility if it turns out that payment appropriations are insufficient. The Council has proved that this is not a hollow phrase: it provided additional payments for structural measures this year, as you know. We have committed ourselves to doing this in just one reading for any additional funding needed, as Commissioner Grybauskaitė mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">It was interesting to hear Mr Ferber's question on the results in conciliation with regard to the additional funds for 2005. He forgot to mention the EUR 10 billion that we got back unspent in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I agree with Commissioner Grybauskaitė that they were tough negotiations. I would like to thank her, the rapporteurs and the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets for their constructive role in the negotiations. The result is what counts, and it is a good compromise. I very much agree with Mr Garriga Polledo, who said it is not a win-lose situation, it is a win-win situation: there is room for both budgetary discipline and political priorities. At the end of the day it is a win-win situation for European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
