<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Palacio Vallelersundi (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, I would like to begin by telling you that I am satisfied with this report, which is the result of a lengthy process in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, a committee that I have had the honour to chair over much of this negotiation, in addition to being rapporteur in this particular instance.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are presenting the European Parliament report on the Community patent. I have to tell you, first of all, that in this case the European Parliament only has the competence to present a report. This is the first – I do not really want to call it an anomaly – but, in short, the first issue that, from Parliament’s point of view, I would like to draw your attention to.</p>
<p class="contents">We are dealing with a proposal from the European Commission that dates from August 2000 – in other words, some time ago – that was accepted by the Lisbon European Council, which stressed the importance of achieving a Community patent before the end of 2001; this importance has once again been highlighted at the Barcelona European Council, and the Council was urged to adopt a political position at the Internal Market Council on 21 May.</p>
<p class="contents">This characterises a debate that has not been easy, because the adoption of the Community patent is not a trivial issue. This is our second attempt, and I hope and trust that this time we will have a Community patent. We need a Community patent that covers the whole EU, which will complement the European patent and national patents and will be competitive worldwide. These are the three axes that the European Commission took as a reference point and which subsequently the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market took as their starting point.</p>
<p class="contents">However, for us, Mr President, and above all for the reason that we only have one single report, it was crucial for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to reach a consensus. I believe we have achieved this. I hope that tomorrow the vote in Plenary will basically support the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market’s position, which is a position we reached after debating and discussing for many hours the following three fundamental issues that are the key elements of this Community patent:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the role of the national patent authorities. Without a doubt, when we have the Community patent, the role of the national patent authorities will be greatly reduced, except that we trust that they will carry out complementary work. The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market’s report includes the possibility for national patent authorities to participate in the first phase of the negotiation of the Community patent – the research phase – provided that they can guarantee a sufficient level of quality. This is the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market’s first point on which consensus was reached.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the legal question. The Commission proposal is ambitious and has no current legal basis in the Treaty, and it would be based on a provision of the Treaty of Nice that has still not entered into force, consisting of the creation of a centralised Community Court of First Instance. Therefore, Mr President, after much debate, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has adopted exactly the same approach as the European Commission, without going so far: for there still to be a national Court of First Instance, albeit with many elements that are already communitarised, and I feel that this is a possibility that the Council should follow if we are to have the patent we need.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, with regard to the procedural languages: the intention of the Commission proposal was to uphold the European patent system, that is to say, to have three procedural languages – English, French and German. As rapporteur, and with reality in mind, given that English is much more than the language of one State of the European Union, that it is the <span class="italic">lingua franca</span> of research, I proposed the use of English alone. Finally, given that Parliament adovocates cultural and linguistic diversity, we reached a consensus, advocating the Alicante system, that is, to have five procedural languages. I think that in this regard also Parliament is sending an important political signal that should be considered in the Council in order that consensus can be reached. I am saying this in full knowledge of the latest news I have on the Council’s working group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Because this is a complicated and important topic it inevitably took some time to prepare, but we managed to find a workable compromise acceptable to the majority of this House. Not everyone will be happy, but that is in the nature of compromises. Nevertheless, it is a good result.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the limited time I have, I wish to address just one very important aspect of our deliberations, and that is the issue of jurisdiction. The Commission originally proposed that in parallel, as it were, to the existing national structures, there should also be a system of purely European jurisdiction. I have always said, and I would like to stress this once again now, that I regard this approach as totally wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not make the mistake that the United States has already made with its court system, so that on top of state courts there are also federal courts, with the guiding principle being that federal courts rule on federal law and state courts on state law. That is nonsensical, it cannot be explained to taxpayers, it costs a lot of money and leads to a divide in the administration of justice.</p>
<p class="contents">We very much believe that European courts are also national courts, and that national courts obviously have to apply not only national law but also European law. The approach adopted in this report by Anna Palacio Vallelersundi therefore represents a great step forward. That approach is that powers at national level can continue to be exercised with regard to European law in future, and that the court of first instance will be the existing national courts. In order to provide uniform administration of justice and avoid a lack of uniformity in Europe, the court of second instance will be a higher, European court. I regard that as a good proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, please excuse me for having to leave this sitting very shortly, but I have another commitment and have to take part in another meeting. Please excuse me and thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Medina Ortega (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, like Mr Lehne, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi on the work she has carried out to produce a balanced report on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi pointed out, the European Parliament’s role in this particular case is of a purely consultative nature, for the issue is really in the hands of the Commission and the Council. However, I believe that the European Parliament is currently giving some very good advice. Firstly, as Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi pointed out, a Community such as ours is important in relation to the role of the National Patent Offices.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as Mr Lehne stated, the field of jurisdiction. The other day several lawyers from large North American companies told me that the advantage of the North American federal system is that state jurisdictions are, generally speaking, more favourable to local businesses and consumers, whilst large companies prefer to go to federal jurisdiction, which is more favourable to them. We will probably have to consider whether the conferring of powers to a special Community jurisdiction could possibly create imbalance, or give rise to what the Americans call ‘forum shopping’, which consists of each lawyer or expert in legal matters bringing the matter to the jurisdiction most favourable to them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to refer to another matter, which is that we have arrived at this new European patent indirectly through adhesion to an existing international convention. This causes problems, for example, of a linguistic nature, a matter of some importance to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Community is not a federal union, but more like some kind of confederation, in which different cultures and national traditions are very important. In specific terms, for a country like Spain and for the 500 million people who speak Spanish worldwide, submission to a language which is not their own is going to cause very serious problems when carrying out research, not only in Spain, but in all of those countries who have called on the Spanish Patents and Trade Marks Office to patent their inventions.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament can only give a recommendation, using recital 2, with regard to Article No 5. This recommends recourse to the Alicante system, as Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi pointed out, which has functioned well in the past and is currently functioning well in five languages, thus permitting inexpensive and large-scale Community-wide participation. We notice that this system is particularly well suited to the European Union’s requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Parliament’s proposals and the agreement we have reached in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market are reasonable. Therefore, our group will support all the amendments approved by this committee, although we do not think that it would be appropriate at this time to vote for any of the other amendments, since this would upset the balance we have managed to achieve in this committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first issue is that of languages, and we have tabled an amendment on this, Amendment No 31, because it is indeed of major importance for the European patent to be established on behalf of industry in Europe, which forms one big market, and we therefore regret the fact that this was postponed during the Laeken Summit to 21 May. The discussion surrounding the language issue bears more witness to a political sentiment than to a sense of reality, as I have already stated. We agreed in Lisbon to turn the European economy into the world’s most competitive knowledge economy, and I am of the view that, when it really comes down to it, we will not act on this intention, which is evident from the many amendments on this topic.</p>
<p class="contents">The linguistic costs will push up the price of the patent disproportionately high, which will adversely affect the competitiveness of businesses within this European market compared to businesses in other major markets, such as the United States and Japan. European industry has itself indicated that it will not be using the European patent if it turns out to be too costly.</p>
<p class="contents">Then I should like to mention the jurisdiction. We take the view, unlike Mr Lehne, that a European patchwork quilt, where each court provides a different interpretation of the European Community patent, would not be beneficial. We are of the opinion that one central court of law should be set up which passes judgments in first instance, and that the European Court of Justice should subsequently handle appeal cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to touch upon the constitutional question. As Liberals we would welcome one European patent in Europe, independently of the Convention, in other words without joining the Convention, thus ensuring that the European Parliament retains a democratic hold on the European patent and that European legislation can be adapted to the European patent. Mr President, I thank you for this opportunity, and I thank you all for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I agree very much with the three points she wanted us to focus on, although on one I take a different view. We are all agreed about the importance of preserving a role for national offices. On the second point about jurisdiction, it seems to many of us to have been a part of the genius of the development of the European Community that justice was largely decentralised and that the role of the Community courts in matters particularly of private law and commercial law was an advisory or secondary role, with the main jurisdictions being localised. That is a vitally important principle to keep – if it can be done without destroying the patent regime. As Mr Lehne said, there are wrong roads that we could go down that would end up with a dispersal of Community jurisdictions and parallel jurisdictions between the national systems and the Community system. That would be a great pity. So I hope that the jurisdictional proposals will be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the language regime, a question on which I differ, with great respect for Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, and so does my group. We believe that sustaining the existing system inside the European Patent Office is important. On the other hand, we also believe that people should be able to put forward a patent claim in their own language. We then believe that it should be translated into all the other languages – not the whole process but just, as it says in Amendment No 20(c), "issued in the language of submission and in the official language in which the procedure has been carried out, accompanied by translation of the patent claims and of a short abstract in the other official languages of the Community", and then paragraph (d), "translations shall be performed by the Translation Centre for the bodies of the European Union and costs borne by the European Union".</p>
<p class="contents">Preserving the principle of linguistic equality is an important public good of the European Union. The Union should pay for that. It should not become a cost to patent holders. Therefore the objections about over-pricing the European patent would not apply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I see it, what is far more important is the purpose of this draft and exactly what a patent system of this kind is intended to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">This report and other planned changes to the EU patent system are intended to make patent applications more attractive by making the protection offered by the patent directly applicable in the EU and thus extending it.</p>
<p class="contents">A patent suggests that the patent holder has invented everything that he or she wishes to patent. However, as a rule the invention draws on all kinds of knowledge that people have developed beforehand, and which can only be used at no cost if this knowledge is not itself covered by a patent. This absurdity is particularly apparent when you consider the present attempts to make more and more software patentable. Even algorithms in computer programs would no longer be freely available. This would deprive all developers of the building blocks they need for any new computer program.</p>
<p class="contents">Supporters of the patent system often put forward the argument that patents would benefit invention ‘freaks’ who do not work for companies but who come up with their inventions either privately or at least with limited financial resources. A patent would protect these people from having companies use their inventions without paying any fee to the inventors and thus not paying them for their work.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem with this picture is quite simply that it does not match the reality of the patent world. In Germany at least, most patents are held by companies that are constantly extending their patents. Private individuals often cannot access the system because of the high patent fees involved. As the term ‘intellectual property’ implies, patenting simply means exploiting intangible things such as ideas, inventions and even discoveries. I am not interested here in the fact that the proponents of capitalism are shooting themselves in the foot if they really believe in their credo of innovation and competitiveness. I say that because my aim is free access to and exchange of information and knowledge and its further development.</p>
<p class="contents">That is precisely what is needed for a self-determined lifestyle and an emancipatory political approach. However, in contrast to all this, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi's report is aimed at treating an ever growing proportion of worldwide knowledge as goods that can generate profits for industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, following on from the Council’s position, the rapporteur suggests applying the procedure, the working method, of the Trademarks Bureau to the Community patent.</p>
<p class="contents">Let there be no doubt about this: this is unacceptable to us in Flanders. All EU working languages should be treated equally, certainly including Dutch, my language, which is spoken by more than 21 million Europeans. And I am quite aware that this will, of course, entail a considerable additional cost. We should accept this as the price we have to pay if we want to retain this diversity which makes up the richness of our continent. I have in fact noticed quite specifically that the Member States of these so-called ‘major’ languages would also be prepared to get the European Union to carry this considerable cost if their language were likely to be pushed aside.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the OVV, the Flemish Associations Consultation Centre, a large representative umbrella organisation for a large number of Flemish cultural-political associations in my country, is making similar demands, and has decided in this case that if the European Union fails to come up with the goods, Europe is at risk of becoming an increasingly alienated occupying force instead of a co-operative based on equality, with respect for the national identity of all Members, as is, in fact, enshrined in the basic treaties. This serves as a serious warning issued by a large and important cultural-political association. This voice should also be heard in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Inglewood (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I, like other colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, would like to congratulate our ex-chairman Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, on all her work on this dossier. It has been a real labour of Hercules but, despite that, I fear she has not, in the view of the British Conservatives, been able satisfactorily to resolve the issues that have been so vigorously debated in the Legal Affairs Committee. However, I should emphasise that I do not think that is any reflection on her. Rather it seems to me that, as has already been mentioned by a number of other speakers, there has been a series of real conundrums – serious issues – at the heart of this proposal. In particular, it indicates the more or less complete impossibility of reconciling our language policy with the needs of those who use and work with patents. I suspect that in microcosm this may be one of a much larger series of problems that we shall be experiencing in the Union in the not-too-distant future.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, there is no point in having a Community patent, which could be a very useful development in intellectual property law, if those who use and work with patents find it no help. I am told by industry that the Commission's proposals could be helpful but what Parliament is proposing will not be.</p>
<p class="contents">Since this is not a codecision matter, the best thing Parliament can do is to give an opinion as required and then leave matters to the Council to see if it can succeed where we have failed.</p>
<p class="contents">I am the first to confess that I do not think this is a very glorious suggestion but it is a pragmatic one. I believe it is the correct course of action in the circumstance in which we now find ourselves.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McCarthy (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I too would like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, for her excellent report and, more importantly, her consistent and energetic efforts to achieve a consensus on the Community patent in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal market. It is those kinds of skills that we sorely miss now that she is ex-chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Her efforts, I have to say, have sadly not been helped by the failure of the Council to achieve an outcome in this area and, indeed, an unanimous agreement. It is clear that we need a Community patent and that it is a key element in underpinning the Lisbon agenda of encouraging EU innovation and competitiveness. But the system, as Lord Inglewood has said, has to be attractive to industry and business otherwise it will simply be an irrelevance.</p>
<p class="contents">Industry has given the Member States, the Commission and Parliament a very clear message: it wants consistent judgments under Community jurisdiction and a common jurisprudence, in particular regarding enforcement. In particular they want a cheap and user-friendly regime. If SMEs and especially inventors are to derive any benefit from this Community patent, what they do not want is a convoluted system which will tie them up in paperwork and red tape. I illustrate this problem with the experience of one of my constituents, John Hamson, an engineer and inventor who cannot afford to employ expensive patent agents. He has a UK patent. He cites to me in letters his problems in dealing with the European Patent Office and the litany of hurdles he has to go through to obtain a European patent. I do not want to repeat them, and it is not meant as a criticism of the European Patent Office. But the fact is that he has spent a lot of money and he still has no European patent. His comments are summed up in his last letter to me some weeks ago: "the process is clearly designed to discourage small inventors and favours large business equipped with legal and patent expertise to navigate its treacherous bureaucracy."</p>
<p class="contents">We owe it to industry, to small and medium-sized enterprises and individual inventors to provide a simple, affordable Community patent which in turn will help EU innovation and competitiveness. We must be able to offer industry and SMEs a better deal to ensure that the protection of intellectual property is genuinely an opportunity to create and encourage innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Lord Inglewood, I do not believe that the Council has the answers to these problems. It will fall to Commissioner Bolkestein to try to find the solution. However, we have had a rapporteur who has made a Herculean effort to try to achieve this. It is no fault of hers that we have not got the right consensus, but I have to say that there is no compromise to be achieved on languages. Therefore I leave it to Commissioner Bolkestein to try to find a solution that will satisfy some of my constituents back in the north-west of England. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would take the liberty of proposing Amendment No 32, containing a simple system through which proposals can be submitted in English or another of the Community languages. Summaries of the applications would be translated into all the Community languages.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to emphasise that this amendment would mean citizens’ being given a glimpse of the monopolies that restrict their opportunities. I should also like to point out that there are other factors just as important as the Community patent when it comes to increasing the number of innovations within the Community. I believe, for example, that the inventions of universities and the latter’s opportunity to exploit these are pivotal. In Europe, we at present have rules which are difficult to interpret and which mean that the universities cannot make the most of their opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge the Commission to review this aspect which affects a relatively large number of countries, as well as the right of universities and researchers to their inventions. We are now in the process of creating a vigorously competitive system, and it is not necessarily only European inventors who may benefit from this. It is competing systems that are crucial when it comes to the Community patent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is one of our priorities. Needless to say, we endorse a Community patent. It is a service to the community of European citizens, and in my view, all European citizens should be able to address the Union’s bodies in their own language, including in patent applications, and they should also be able to receive a reply in their own language. Discrimination on linguistic grounds would contravene Community law and the Charter of the Fundamental Rights. Consequently, we cannot sanction the selection of five languages as an honourable compromise.

<p class="contents">Applying the existing Munich arrangements for the European patent<span class="italic"> </span>to the Community patent is unacceptable, since the Munich system only uses three languages and this would conflict with the principle that all the official languages are equal and create unacceptable discrimination from the procedural point of view as well as problems of legal security<span class="italic">.</span> However, the linguistic arrangements proposed in this report, the so-called ‘Alicante arrangements’ are totally unacceptable for the commercial framework since they only provide for the use of the five languages of the largest countries, which contravenes the principle of non-discrimination between undertakings, creates a directory of main languages, sets precedents for the future and threatens all the official languages.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, we tabled our amendment suggesting that, at the forthcoming Diplomatic Conference on the Revision of the Convention on the Granting of European Patents, all the official languages of the European Union be used on an equal footing so as to ensure that everyone can use his or her own language throughout the process and in order to guarantee the legal security of the patent.</p>

Everyone is calling for it, but no one has managed to finalise it. There are two dates which stand out from all this to-ing and fro-ing: 1975 and 1989 and in the meantime, there have been many unsuccessful attempts to finalise this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Heads of State and Government made the Community patent a priority at Lisbon and it was due to come into being before the end of 2001. The Feira, Stockholm and Gothenburg European Councils reiterated that there is an urgent need for it. So what is the current situation? The Council did not reach an agreement and Parliament, through its Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which was essentially responsible for this matter, proposed a political compromise which I welcome, Mrs de Palacio, but which I feel does not truly meet the expectations of future users, as it does not improve the existing system to any great extent.</p>
<p class="contents">Manufacturers and inventors are calling for the cost of the patent to be reduced, so that the patent can be competitive. They also want the respect of legal certainty to be guaranteed with the greatest fairness possible. The European Commission’s proposal is a pragmatic response to these aspirations, focusing on reducing costs. This can be achieved, firstly, by using the language regime of three working languages of the European Patent Office, which, since it guarantees the threshold of international competitiveness, meets our specific linguistic needs. Secondly, by recognising the important role played by the national patent offices in providing specific information and technical assistance to inventors and SMEs. And, lastly, by using a legal system that guarantees single jurisdiction by establishing a Community court for intellectual property.</p>
<p class="contents">These three fundamental points have attracted the support of those working in the profession. They are the ones waiting for the patent. We must not risk creating a Community patent that they would not use because it is too distant from their concerns. This is the message that we must send to the Council with our vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My congratulations.</p>
<p class="contents">A Europe of free competition, especially in today's age of knowledge and innovation, needs a Community patent if it is to thrive. Even though we all recognise this, the way in which opposing views have been expressed in the past reveals something which we would do well to take onboard: the huge problem of reconciling straightforward national interests with straightforward Community interests which, in the final analysis, are supposed to serve the individual national interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The first attempt to grant a European patent was under the Munich Convention. However, once it had been granted, it became national law subject to national provisions. Today we are trying to communitise the European patent following the failure of the endeavour made in the Luxembourg Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to raise three issues. Τhe first is language. Everything has been said and a compromise has, I think, been reached. However, it would be helpful if at least all the claims in a European patent were translated into every language. This would reduce the cost of granting a patent considerably, compared with the cost of a European patent applicable in 15 countries. As far as the main offices are concerned, the idea of giving the European Patent Office a central role, with some of its work delegated to the national offices, is a good idea. This would combine the advantages of a strong European patent organisation with the de facto strengths of the national agencies by reason of their geographical proximity, knowledge of local conditions, knowledge of the local language and facility to mediate between the public and private sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Close contacts with national patent authorities are of crucial importance for the purpose of information, public support and the dissemination of the information technology contained in patents. They will also make it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to access centralised information. I think that, if we can agree on this basic position, we can also agree on the type of work which could be delegated to the national offices.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, jurisdiction. The proposed solution, that is, that the patent courts in the Member States should have jurisdiction at first instance, without discrimination, with the Community intellectual property court ruling at appeal, is a happy compromise between centripetal and centrifugal tendencies and will guarantee easy access to the courts, swift justice and affordable appeals, making innovation easier for small and medium-sized enterprises and hence fitting in with European employment policy in general. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Industrial intellectual property rights are a useful instrument for the economy and for society in general, and I believe it is only natural to want to tailor them to Community requirements in an internal market. I therefore welcome the Commission’s proposal to create a Community patent. I should also like to extend my thanks to the rapporteur for all the work she has done. However, I do not see eye to eye with her on one particular item, namely that of the language regime.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, a Community-based approach also presupposes respect for the Community principle, including the use of language. And the fact that the discussions on the use of languages have never been absent from the agenda in the debates says a great deal, in my view. I have also listened very carefully to my fellow French, Italian, German and Spanish MEPs and have ascertained that everyone is calling for a scheme in which their own language is still used to the fullest extent.</p>
<p class="contents">Since as long ago as 1958, the citizens of the Member States have had the right to use their own official language in their communication with the European institutions, and also when they communicate before legal bodies of the Community. In fact, we even enshrined this in a treaty in Amsterdam. However, while the citizen is given the impression that progress is being made in their linguistic rights, these are increasingly being undermined, and that is certainly the case in the sector of intellectual property rights. First there was the Trademarks Bureau; this was followed by the drawings and models, and now there is also the patent regulation. Since then, we have also witnessed a – fortunately frustrated – attempt to no longer translate even generally binding standards which enhance our book-keeping into all official languages.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would therefore urge you to vote consciously tomorrow, to send out a signal to the Council and the Commission to very carefully reconsider the articles concerning the language regime. We must really prevent a new clause from being added to the list of incidents of unjustifiable discrimination against languages when the regulation on the Community patent enters into force. I therefore call on you to study these language amendments very carefully and to support them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite repeated invitations from the Heads of States and Government and successive European Councils, most recently the Barcelona Council, the situation has not improved.</p>
<p class="contents">We encountered the same problems in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market over the language issue. After lengthy debate, the committee opted for the language regime already used in the context of the Community trademark, under which applications can be filed in any of the official languages of the Community. However, the applicant has to specify a second language as well, known as the language of proceedings, which can be one of five languages – English, French, German, Italian or Spanish – the use of which he accepts as a possible language of proceedings, particularly opposition, revocation or invalidity proceedings. If the application is filed in a language which is not one of these five languages, the Office will arrange to have the application translated into the language indicated by the applicant.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, this is not an ideal solution. For reasons of economy, it would have been preferable to use just one language, English. Moreover, European industry has called for this. However, that has not proved possible and so we look forward to the introduction of the Alicante model, which, although perhaps not the best solution, is the only solution possible.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the legal arrangements, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market proposes that first instance jurisdiction should be at national level, such that appeals can be made to national courts with experience in patent cases as first instance courts for Community patent litigation, while second instance decisions would be the responsibility of the European Chamber for intellectual property. This is a compromise solution. We would have preferred one single, centralised first and second instance jurisdiction, which would have ensured greater uniformity of interpretation. However, the opposition was extremely strong on this matter too.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, assurance is given that the national patent offices will be able to continue to play an important role in the procedures for granting the Community patent.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, in our opinion, the solution adopted is not completely satisfactory, but it does mean that this complex issue is closed. I believe that, in her heart of hearts, even the rapporteur, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi – whom I do, of course, congratulate on her work – shares these concerns. However, Parliament has merely a consultative role in this procedure, it is not colegislator. We therefore give the report the thumbs-up, in the hope that the Council of Ministers will be able to come to a swift agreement without hiding behind any excuses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<tr><td width="70" align="center" valign="top"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="photoframe_blue"><tr><td><img alt="MPphoto" src="/doceo/data/img/photo_generic.gif" align="right" width="50" height="63" /></td></tr></table> </td><td width="5"> </td><td align="left" valign="top">
<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – The Commission welcomes the report prepared by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi. At a moment when the Council is still struggling with the Community patent, it is important that Parliament should deliver its opinion on this difficult and complex issue. The report of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi addresses all the key issues that are relevant to the Community patent.</p>
<p class="contents">Several of the proposed amendments enshrine principles that the Commission is ready to consider favourably. Firstly, there is the principle enshrined in Amendment No 8 to allow testing for the sole purpose of receiving market authorisation after the expiry of the patent – the so-called Bowler exception. The Commission has already proposed a similar line in its revision and whilst not committing myself to the exact wording, I can inform Parliament that the Commission will carefully consider the issue, taking into account the need for the Community patent and Member States' national patents to produce identical rights. But Amendment No 18 on the same issue goes too far and cannot be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">A second example regards Amendments Nos 1, 6, 7, 21, 27 and 39. These amendments refer to the national patent offices. The Commission recognises the important role of those national patent offices. The Commission can also agree in principle that they should participate in the processing of Community patent applications provided that four conditions are met: first, to ensure the quality and uniformity of Community patents, national patent offices and their participation should be set in a properly defined framework. Partnership agreements with the European Patent Office, with quality criteria and mechanisms for quality control would constitute a proper framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, national patent offices' participation could go as far as doing the prior search – a suggestion made earlier this evening by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi. Thirdly, the applicant should always be free to ask that his application should be processed exclusively by the European Patent Office.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, national patent offices and their participation should be restricted by clear quantitative limits. But even with this clarification, I should like to stress that the participation of national patent offices is a matter on which the Community alone cannot decide. It is thus not an issue for the regulation but should be negotiated in the framework of the European Patent Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">A third example is Amendment No 9 on the distribution of income from renewal fees. While the Commission can agree to the principle of distribution of part of the fee income to Member States or their patent offices to be used for innovation promotion purposes, it nevertheless considers that this issue should be dealt with in the context of the European Patent Organisation. It remains to be discussed whether the importance of the patent office is the right distribution key.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the proposed amendments are not in line with the objectives of the Community patent and cannot therefore be accepted. Today the driving force for a Community patent is the competitiveness of European industry at a global level. There is no point in creating an instrument unless it is affordable enough and offers a sufficient level of legal certainty for it to be used by our inventors and our industry. The Commission continues to believe in affordable language and translation regimes. Here two different issues are involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The first one is the language for the processing of patent applications and for the granting of the patent, including translations of applications. The European Patent Office functions well with a three-language regime. It is not necessary to modify it, whether by reducing the number of languages, as has been suggested by some, or by adding more languages. In particular, adding two or more working languages to the European Patent Office would considerably complicate its work. It would put a heavy burden on its cost-effectiveness. The European Patent Convention allows, in principle, EU citizens to submit the initial application in their own language and compensation is provided for those applicants who must translate their applications into one of the working languages of the European Patent Office. I should also like to add that the language regime of the European Patent Office cannot be decided by the Community alone. That is the first issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue concerns translations of the patent once it has been granted. If the amendments imply that the patent would have to be translated in its entirety into all official Community languages which soon will be either 19 or 20, depending on whether Maltese becomes an official language, this would make the patent so expensive that the Community patent system would simply not be used. I remind Parliament that we have been here before. There has been a Luxembourg Convention which required translations of the whole patent into all the official languages. That convention has remained a dead letter – it has never been used. Surely we do not want to repeat the same mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give some examples of the costs that would be involved: there would be EUR 17 000 for translations just in the Community of 15 Member States. Last but not least, costs must be evaluated, taking account of enlargement. Translations into 19 Community languages, excluding Maltese, would cost around EUR 31 500 per patent.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons the Commission cannot accept the following amendments: Amendments Nos 2, 22, 31, 32(2), 32(3), nor Amendment No 36. The Commission would like to accept Amendment No 34.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not mean that the Commission would systematically oppose any translation requirements of a part of the patent or patent application or of other information. After all, there is the patent in its entirety, a summary and the claims. So we may be talking about different requirements for translation. The Commission could accept such translations of parts of the patent provided that they were truly useful and that the overall Community patent system remains affordable, simple, cost-effective and legally certain.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect Amendment No 25, part of Amendment No 19(1), 30 and parts of 32(1) and 32(4) merit closer evaluation. But parts of Amendments Nos 19(1), 19(2), 19(3) and 19(4), part of Amendments Nos 20, 28 and part of Amendment No 31(4) are unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is no reason to require a translation of the patent into the language in which the initial application has been submitted. That already exists.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Community budget should simply not be used to finance translations, nor should applicants be obliged to use the translation services of the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the patent should be published by the European Patent Office in the Community Patents Bulletin and not in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, Article 44(3), as proposed by the Commission, offers sufficient guarantees to protect third parties in good faith. There is no reason to require further formalities from a patent holder who wishes to enforce his patents. On the other hand, Article 11(3) cannot be deleted because it corresponds to Article 44(3); it just applies in the pre-grant phase.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the procedural languages of the courts will have to be determined in a separate context and not here.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also has difficulties with Amendments Nos 23, 24 and 38 on the relationship with the European Patent Organisation. The Commission continues to believe in a user-friendly system where applicants can obtain a European patent and a Community patent in one go from the European Patent Office. The accession to the European Patents Convention will enable this. It will also enable sufficient legal and political control over the European Patent Office, taking into account that the European Patent Office is not a Community body.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the judicial system, about which a number of Members have spoken, is concerned, the Commission is prepared to consider Amendments Nos 26 and 29 in principle, but in the light of the new EC Treaty provisions – namely Articles 225a and 229a – adopted by the Nice Treaty. The Treaty introduced the possibility to set up Community judicial panels to handle cases in first instance with the possibility of appeal to the Court of First Instance of the European Communities. The setting up of such a system would naturally be possible only once the Nice Treaty has entered into force and it requires a separate Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission has major difficulties with Amendments Nos 3, 4, 5 and 10 to 17. There should be a high level of expertise and unitary case-law right from the start. That pleads for a centralised Community jurisdiction. The system proposed in the amendments would not provide this, because some national courts would have so few cases to handle that they could not build up or maintain the necessary expertise. That could result in divergent case-law and quasi-systematic appeals to a higher court. This would imply higher litigation costs and also that parties would have to wait longer for the final decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to recall that it is highly doubtful whether the articles of the EC Treaty, to which the amendments refer, would allow a system as proposed in those amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards reporting on the application of the regulation, the Commission is ready to prepare the first report at the latest within five years of the entry into force of the regulation. Should the Commission believe that earlier reporting is required, it will do so. Moreover, the formulation in the Commission proposals, which focuses on the costs for obtaining and renewing the patents, should already cover all relevant cost factors. It also goes without saying that the Commission will propose amendments whenever this is appropriate. Therefore the Commission cannot, regrettably, endorse Amendment No 33.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission considers that Amendment Nos 35 and 37 are unacceptable. The Commission has presented a proposal for a directive on the patentability of software-related inventions, which is now before Parliament and the Council. Therefore a debate on this question should be carried out in that context and not in this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Members for their support and collaboration on this important regulation. I hope that Europe will soon be able to improve its performance at the global level by offering its industry a competitive, unitary, affordable and legally secure Community patent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
