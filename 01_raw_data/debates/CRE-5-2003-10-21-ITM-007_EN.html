May I begin by thanking Mr<span class="bold"> </span>Rothley, the rapporteur on this important file, most heartily for his excellent work. Let me furthermore stress that the area of motor insurance is a very good example of efficient co-operation between Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">As honourable Members know, the European Parliament resolution of October 1995 – that is precisely eight years ago – gave rise to the Fourth Motor Insurance Directive. Another resolution, this time of July 2001, recommended the adoption of a Fifth Motor Insurance Directive very much along the lines of the current Commission proposal. I should like to thank the Parliament, and particularly Mr Rothley, for their approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a Fifth Motor Insurance Directive aims at introducing legislation which would affect millions of European citizens: drivers and potential victims of accidents and, of course, insurers. It will make it easier for drivers to get insurance and improve the protection of victims.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know the aim of this proposal is not only to update and modernise the existing rules but also to reinforce the single insurance market in the area of motor insurance. Some aspects of the directives adopted in the 1970s and the 1980s need to be updated, in particular concerning the minimum amount of insurance cover. There is also a need to fill gaps and provide solutions to real problems experienced by our citizens. Furthermore, the procedure set up in the Fourth Motor Insurance Directive for an efficient and quick settlement of accidents taking place outside the victim's Member State of residence should be extended to any motor accident.</p>
<p class="contents">I am now looking forward to comments from honourable Members. Then, if you allow, I shall respond to Parliament's amendments in some detail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rothley (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner Bolkestein, thank you for your kind words, which I can only acknowledge. In this area of insurance law and protection for victims of accidents there is in fact excellent cooperation between the Commission and Parliament and I thank you for that.</p>
<p class="contents">With the Fifth Directive we are consistently continuing to protect victims of accidents following on from the Fourth Directive. It would perhaps be sensible, Mr Bolkestein, if you did not go into individual amendments in the debate, as we will still, in any case, have to discuss them with the Council. I would like to make a few points to clarify the content. I will begin first of all with the issue of jurisdiction. On this issue the Fifth Directive rounds off the Fourth very well indeed. With the Fourth Directive we made it possible for accidents in another country to be settled in the country of residence. After the Fourth Directive was passed there was, on 22 December 2000, the regulation on<span class="bold"> </span>jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Provision is made there so that with civil liability insurance the domicile of the injured party can be considered a place of jurisdiction when there is a direct claim. This was made possible for accidents in another country in the Fourth Directive and with the fifth this applies to all accidents. This means that it will not only be possible to settle out of court in one’s own country a claim arising in another, but it will also be possible to begin a legal battle in one’s own. We cannot do more than that for the victims of accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">What else does this Fifth Directive contain? The costs of judicial proceedings that are deemed to be necessary and appropriate will be reimbursed. When the cost of legal proceedings – for example consultation with a lawyer – are deemed necessary and appropriate, then that is a claim that must be compensated. We must increase the minimum sum. There is a somewhat piecemeal system in the European Union in this area and everybody agrees that, after twenty years, a new provision is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, it is a question of the amount and there are, of course, problems with this. It is not exactly easy – and I know this only too well – to raise the minimum sum because that obviously also causes an increase in premiums. The compromise that we came to – EUR 5 million for personal injuries and EUR 2 million for damage to property – is a compromise, with which I think the insurance markets can cope. Incidentally, there is one aspect regarding the minimum sum that must not be overlooked, that is to say, adequately protecting those victims of accidents that are the most affected. Everything in me rebels against the idea that a 20-year-old, paralysed after an accident, is left dependent on social security after 20 years, and in the meantime the injuring party, who is infinitely liable, is also financially ruined. This compromise does, therefore, actually make sense.</p>
<p class="contents">We are creating a provision for trailers on motor vehicles. There is a mention of this in an earlier directive, but there are completely different provisions across the European Union. Often the trailer’s registration number is known but not that of the motor vehicle, and then it is very difficult to settle a claim.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention two further points Commissioner Bolkestein, which we did not accept in your proposal: Firstly, the person responsible for the settlement of claims taking charge of the provisions of the Green Card Bureaux. We should not carry out this amalgamation, which is superfluous; it damages a system that works, which is what the Green Card Bureaux is. We also dispensed with the provision on the protection of vulnerable travellers; that means making provision for civil liability. That is a very specific problem, and we should work together – the Commission and Parliament – in order to tackle this issue of liability in another directive.</p>
<p class="contents">On the whole – and I am coming back to where I began – the cooperation between Parliament and the Commission has been so excellent because we held a European dialogue at European level on all of these issues, between insurers, automobile associations, Parliament, and associations of accident victims – I am referring here to the European Transport Law Seminars in Trier.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely because we worked extremely hard in this area and discussed a great deal that we can also find solutions together that will help the victims of accidents. I am confident that in further discussions with the Council we will quickly achieve a result. On the whole, it all helps to take us forward and above all: it encourages us to have a European dialogue because when we do have such a dialogue then solutions are easier. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This proposal for a directive has been developed with great tenacity and intelligence by Mr Rothley, and I want to give him credit for it here. We are particularly grateful to him because this directive has come about as a result of Article 192, for which I have a particular fondness, as it is an indirect legislative initiative which gives Parliament a leading role and which also confirms the right of initiative of Parliament and its Members.</p>
<p class="contents">In such a sensitive industry, this leads to more effective European citizenship because, as Mr Rothley has said, it makes it easier to take out a short-term policy for a temporary stay in another Member State and to get short-term insurance for a vehicle purchased outside the owner’s Member State of residence. As a result, it will be simpler to purchase a car in any country in the Union where the best terms are available. I think this will be of interest to a great many European citizens, because of that single insurance market that Mr Bolkestein was talking about and which is thus established, and it will be a valuable and useful development for the European Community as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The most sensitive part of the report – it has already been underlined, but I should like to reiterate it – concerns the higher levels of cover laid down by the Member States. The Commission had set a sum of EUR 1 million per victim in cases of personal injury and EUR 500 000 per accident for damage to property. We believe EUR 5 million per accident for personal injury and EUR 2 million for property damage would be more appropriate and flexible and could be a compromise position. I must formally give Mr Rothley the credit for this compromise, because he has taken into account the various situations that exist in the insurance market, once again with a view to achieving a single insurance market. He has also addressed the issue of legal costs. It was not appropriate at this stage, however, to extend insurance cover to injuries sustained by pedestrians and cyclists as a result of accidents in which they were involved, because this is an even more sensitive area and I think it may need to be regulated by a specific measure.</p>
<p class="contents">If, as Mr Bolkestein has recognised, Parliament and the Commission have worked well and usefully together, I hope that the Council and the Commission will take our amendments to heart and that such an important directive as this will be able to help to bring the citizens of Europe closer together in common citizenship. I very much hope this will happen, because the compromise that has been reached is an excellent balance, which I hope the Commission will take into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know it is a slow, but steady process. Even if it takes twenty years before the fourth directive is followed by a fifth one, we will get there in the end. I have confidence in this. You, Commissioner, are well on your way to achieving it, and I hope that eventually, we will reach this optimal position.</p>
<p class="contents">Insurance law is also complex in this case. I myself am a personal injury lawyer and have myself sustained personal injury in the past. This has probably given me the opportunity of working here. It is of extreme importance for this legislation to be transportable to your country of residence, because as the injured party, you often face a great many problems with the various legal systems. So, as far as that is concerned, I am very pleased with the proposal as it is now before us. I think that the insurance companies are also delighted with a further harmonisation, which affords them, too, more clarity. We set up a green card system some time ago, and this takes it further within the EU. The minimum amounts proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market struck me as being very high, because these rarely come into play in practice, if at all. I am therefore actually more pleased with Mr Rothley’s compromise proposals, for they are more geared towards the market as it is in reality. The amounts should not be too high either, because, I believe, enforceability would then become an issue. Nobody benefits from legislation that is not enforceable. I would like to state once again, therefore, that this proposal is closer to reality than the extremely high amounts initially formulated. Then again, the Commission’s proposals are a little on the low side, and I think that what Mr Rothley has proposed is ideal.</p>
<p class="contents">We Liberals can give our warm support to this proposal. On a different note, in an amendment, I had requested more harmonisation in the discussion of personal injury, in terms of the level of invalidity or the level of the value of the injury. I gather from Mr Rothley that a follow-up report on this is already in the making. I think that we are making another contribution to the internal market’s completion, for which I am grateful. It will receive my unqualified support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The occurrences of personal injury and damage to property are all too frequent, despite the best efforts of our various national safety councils to reduce such tragedies.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend the rapporteur for his work on this technical subject and agree fully that an appropriate level of insurance cover should also meet the cost of legal proceedings. These are essential, and it is appropriate that they be treated as damages to be covered by the compulsory civil liability. The conflict of interest that arises if the party's own insurers or their opponent's carry out the settlement is self-evident.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the Commission's proposal that the amount of the minimum sum insured in the case of the personal injuries arising from an accident should be unlimited. Accident victims with very severe injuries such as paraplegia would not receive sufficient cover with a maximum sum of EUR 1 million. I agree that it makes sense not only to provide cover for the severest cases at EUR 10 million but to limit cover to that amount for each accident. It ought to be extremely rare for two or more cases of severe injuries to occur in a single accident.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rothley is to be complimented once again on his wisdom and competence. The fact that accidents in different countries can now be dealt with in the country of the injured person is a huge plus, and I congratulate the rapporteur once again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why is it important? Firstly, because it will lead to the judicial protection of victims being updated and improved; secondly, it creates a better functioning internal market for motor vehicle liability insurance; thirdly, the minimum insurance sums for personal injuries and damage to property are increased; fourthly, because it will mean that it is easier to comply with insurance liability for imported motor vehicles until they reach their destination, and fifthly because it clarifies the responsibility of the guarantee fund in the country where the accident occurred for all accidents involving motor vehicles without registration plates or with false registration plates.</p>
<p class="contents">During the debate I had three main requests. My first request was the minimum cover sum for personal injuries and damage to property and this was taken into account in the amendment and at the same time this amounted to a transition period of five years, which is exactly what I had in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">My second request was for the removal of the insertion in Article 4(2) of the Commission proposal, because I, like many in this House, believe that a directive on insurance law should not deal with any issues that are the responsibility of national civil law.</p>
<p class="contents">My third main request was directed against the unnecessary bureaucracy and unnecessary additional costs, which means that we advocated that, when a contractual relationship ends, the policyholder can ask for a statement relating to any claims to be forwarded, so that this is not sent automatically. This change was implemented by Mr Harbour’s amendment. I can, therefore, only welcome this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think he deserves a lot of credit for that, and it reflects well on Parliament too.</p>
<p class="contents">Since I joined the Parliament in 1999, I have had the pleasure of working with Mr Rothley on this subject in which I have taken a particular interest. I contributed to the 2001 report and am delighted to say that a number of the ideas that flowed from that are now incorporated in this very welcome Fifth proposal from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rothley and others have talked particularly about issues of improving the ability of motorists to claim damages for accidents outside their own country. I want to focus on a few other detailed points. Many of us have dealt with constituency cases concerning the difficulties of people temporarily moving to other countries – particularly students or people taking up work or even citizens wishing to make long-term stays. They have difficulty in getting their insurance extended for that temporary stay and having insurance extended for up to 12 months. I think this is a very important benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are concerned in our committee about the internal market and simplifying the regime which allows citizens to go and buy a car from another country and have their existing insurance extended for 30 days while they bring that car home and have it re-registered.</p>
<p class="contents">This is just an important simplification. It underlines the fact that in the internal market, citizens expect to be able to have these rights delivered across borders without inconvenience – that is really what this proposal is all about.</p>
<p class="contents">In a similar vein, making insurance purchase easier and more competitive, by enabling citizens to get their insurance claim records delivered to them wherever they have had insurance previously, so that they can use their past clean record to gain important price and coverage benefits for their insurance is an important benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr Karas has talked about some of the improvements we have made, and I agree with him about some of the areas into which I think we have intruded too far into Member States' prerogatives. One area which has been drawn to my attention in the last few days is the right for claims to lapse after four years. In my own country, the United Kingdom, that cuts across national provisions. There are strong arguments for having a look at this again and this is something I will talk to the rapporteur about. We need to discuss whether we should support that provision in the final report or ask the Commission and Council to look at this before it finally comes back.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall this is an excellent piece of work. It has our full support, and I would like to thank both the Commission and the rapporteur for the work they have done in moving this important benefit forward for all of Europe's citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is no coincidence that the European Parliament has called on the Commission to submit a proposal to bring motor insurance rules up to date so that the right of European Union citizens to live, travel and work in any Member State of the Union without any problem may become a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft fifth directive on civil liability motor insurance will certainly have the effect of modernising and improving European rules in this sector. Above all, it will be easier to take out a short-term policy covering a temporary stay in another Member State and getting short-term insurance for a vehicle purchased outside the owner’s Member State of residence. Consumers will thus find it easier to purchase a car in any country in the Union where the best terms are available, and that will help to stimulate cross-border competition. In addition, the directive seeks to update the limits on the minimum cover that should be enjoyed by motorists. This will allow motorists to change their insurance more quickly. Another objective is to improve protection for pedestrians involved in accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the directive allows citizens to obtain a statement from their current insurers regarding the accidents in which they have been involved so that they can negotiate a new contract with another insurer.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential to avoid setting the minimum cover at levels that are too high and beyond any reasonable need. If this were to happen, the cost would inevitably be passed on to the consumer through considerable rises in insurance premiums. The effects would be felt especially badly in certain countries, including Italy, where increased premiums are already giving rise to a particularly heated debate. Not to mention the new countries joining the Union, where the citizens and the insurance companies would be called on to meet costs out of all proportion to their economic levels.</p>
<p class="contents">My assessment of the proposal is therefore positive; we must be careful, however, not to go too far and produce results that are counterproductive for those same citizens whom we wish to protect and help. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an issue which is to the direct benefit of the citizens of Europe and it goes to show that the distances are not as great as is sometimes stated.</p>
<p class="contents">That is another reason why the Commission is extremely happy with this report. The various speakers have also thanked the Commission. If the Commission has contributed to the report, it did so out of the conviction that this is the way to go. And so, my thanks to all.</p>
