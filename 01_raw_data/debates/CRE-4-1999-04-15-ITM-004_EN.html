<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schmidbauer </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, last September the Commission presented us with a White Paper with the rather unwieldy title ‘Fair payment for infrastructure use: a phased approach to a common transport infrastructure charging framework in the EU'. Behind that cumbersome title, however, is a proposed new European transport system in which mileage travelled would be charged with the aid of electronic data transfer, a system that would guarantee sustainable mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject is not new. Back in 1997, we voted on the report relating to the Commission Green Paper on this same matter; I was the rapporteur on that occasion too. And now it is time to develop specific legal mechanisms. One reason why the European transport system is threatened with collapse is that we have the fundamental problem of distortions of competition in the transport markets. The cost of a journey is not met by the party who causes the journey to be made, but by the general public. Distortions of competition between modes of transport and between individual EU Member States are the result. At the present time there are nine different charging systems in Europe for the use of the rail infrastructure, with subsidisation ranging between zero and 100 %. Road tax and road‐pricing systems vary enormously. There are differences of up to EUR 3 000 a year between national rates of road tax, for example. Moreover, charges are seldom levied as and when they are incurred. They generally bear no relation to the environmental costs or to other external costs.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, therefore, users have no incentive to alter their transport habits in any way. In the White Paper, the Commission proposes that the user should pay all the internal and external costs that he or she incurs. Charges are to be levied on the same basis in every Member State, namely on the basis of so‐called marginal social cost. The marginal social cost comprises the average variable infrastructure costs plus the external costs.</p>
<p class="contents">My report endorses the Commission approach. We must move in the proposed direction if we want to achieve a better distribution of the volume of traffic among the various modes of transport. The target date of 2004 and the establishment of committees containing government experts makes the implementation of this approach appear realistic, especially since it does not involve grafting a ready‐made system onto any national structure but rather the joint development of solutions with the 15 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In my report, I also suggest the possibility of reinforcing the charging system based on marginal social cost with measures in the realm of transport‐related taxes, by which I mean coordinating these taxes on a European scale, lowering them where necessary. That would give us an acceptable graduated pricing system. In its White Paper, the Commission only took account of commercial transport and did not include private cars in the charging system. I believe, however, that the ‘user pays' principle can only be effectively applied to transport if all those who contribute to the problems are expected to contribute to their solution. Traffic jams, accidents and environmental pollution, of course, are caused just as much by private cars as by commercial vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context I should like the Commission to examine, as a matter of urgency, whether private cars could not perhaps be included in the charging framework. At the same time, it is important to conduct information campaigns to make it clear to the public that this is all about introducing an environmentally friendly and sustainable transport system and is not another scheme designed to fleece motorists.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling) </span></p>
<p class="contents">No, that is not the case. That is why it is quite unhelpful when the public are deliberately misled, even by Members of this Parliament. At the beginning of this week, Mr Ferber issued a press statement with the heading ‘Pure highway robbery!' I consider that sort of thing to be irresponsible, because either that statement was a deliberate distortion of the truth or Mr Ferber has read neither the White Paper nor the report on which we voted in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me close by saying that we cannot accept the amendments tabled by the PPE Group through Mr Jarzembowski, because they are virtually tantamount to total rejection of the White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">The other groups cooperated very constructively in the preparation of this report, and I should like to thank them for that. Our cooperation with Commissioner Kinnock and Directorate‐General VII was also very fruitful. I am grateful for that, and at the same time I would ask the Commission to make a determined effort to implement the White Paper, so that this approach, which my group and I support, can be put into practice, for I am firmly convinced that this White Paper will pave the way for sustainable mobility in Europe.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Simpson </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Madam President, firstly I should like to congratulate our rapporteur Mrs Schmidbauer on her important report. I know she has worked very hard over many months on this difficult subject. Whilst this report is not legislative, it is, in transport policy terms, the culmination of much work covering many aspects and will without doubt give the green light to a legislative proposal in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Schmidbauer's report is to be welcomed because it deals with developing a phased approach towards a common transport infrastructure charging framework within the European Union, as well as a gradual harmonisation of charging principles in all major transport modes. My group also welcomes the principles outlined by Mrs Schmidbauer that users of infrastructure should pay the cost, including environmental, and the cost of other external impacts imposed at the point of use.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a complex issue, especially where the subject of road pricing is concerned. But Members would do well to remember that many Member States already have road pricing schemes in place and others are looking to introduce them. Therefore, there is a need to try to bring some structure and harmonisation to the whole system. The rapporteur has not only worked hard on this report but she has also recognised the complexity of the issue, the sensitivities that exist around this subject, and has produced a very carefully worded report that deserves the support of the whole of the House.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Jarzembowski </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, I shall follow the lead of my honourable colleague Brian Simpson and thank Mrs Schmidbauer for her cooperative approach to the preparation of this report. Regrettably she has arrived at the wrong conclusions, as I must now explain on behalf of my group. We in the Group of the European People's Party must reject the Commission's strategy of introducing a uniform system of charging for all modes of transport on the basis of so‐called marginal social cost. The fact is that the system of marginal social cost proposed by Neil Kinnock, the Socialist Commissioner for Transport, clearly emerged as an objectively unsuitable method of infrastructure charging when the Committee on Transport and Tourism consulted with scientists and transport specialists on 17 February 1999. On the one hand it takes insufficient account of the construction, capital and maintenance costs for the transport infrastructure, while on the other hand it indiscriminately imposes a blanket charge to cover so‐called external costs such as the cost of environmental pollution, traffic jams and accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">We are prepared to discuss external costs. That is why we in Parliament called on the Commission back in January 1997 to provide us with scientifically demonstrable assessments of external costs and how they can best be recouped; these assessments were to be presented for each individual mode of transport. The Commission, however, chose to shirk that responsibility. It has not substantiated the external costs or outlined any procedures to us, but has come up with a new magic formula and now wants to do everything on the basis of marginal social cost. But this magic formula, as the hearing with the scientists and experts showed, is unsuitable. In other words, this whole approach is built on sand.</p>
<p class="contents">A second reason why the Commission approach should be rejected is that it is designed to be quite systematically devised and implemented in three steps, thereby deliberately preserving the distortions of competition between modes of transport and between companies in the various Member States. This means that existing distortions will not be eliminated, even though they actually ought to have disappeared by 1 January 1993, the date when the single market was supposed to take effect. In practice, however, we still have completely different oil duties, road taxes and so forth. That distorts competition, and the aim of the Commission's approach is to preserve this disparity for several years to come. We reject that.</p>
<p class="contents">The recommendation of the Red and Green majority in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Mrs Schmidbauer, is nothing short of reckless, going further than even the Commission has ever gone by calling for the inclusion of private cars in this new special system on the basis of Community law and not, as is customary in such cases, on the basis of national legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Schmidbauer, my colleague Mr Ferber was absolutely right. This system, if you think it through to its logical conclusion, means purely and simply that private cars would also be liable for road tolls in Germany. I do not believe the Austrian system is worth copying. In my opinion, on the basis of all the studies that have been conducted in this field, it is crystal clear that private motorists, through the excise duty on their petrol and through road tax, are already paying the tolls with which it is intended to burden them. By broadening this system, Mrs Schmidbauer, we should quite simply be giving Member States the opportunity to impose even higher charges on private motorists.</p>
<p class="contents">It also says in your report that, besides private cars being incorporated into the new charging system, an even heavier financial burden should be placed on motorists in sensitive areas – these include mountainous regions, but they also include all the major cities, such as Paris, Hamburg and Frankfurt. Your approach cannot work; if it were implemented, it would only induce many Member States, as Mr Ferber said, simply to fleece the motorist once again. We reject that.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Wijsenbeek </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, I am hearing a lot of electioneering here from both sides, both from Mrs Schmidbauer and from Mr Jarzembowski. It is quite clear that this White Paper is vitally important for the creation of an internal market and a system in which costs are switched from fixed costs to variable costs. This is something we are all in favour of.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Schmidbauer rightly said that we must be careful that this does not lead to another separate cost increase. I put this down in an amendment, so I can only agree with her. She is absolutely right when she says that we need to involve private cars in some way. Of course we must. Traffic congestion is reaching critical levels, so it is extremely important that we should treat the little room left on the roads as a market commodity. That is the best way to go about it. There can be no objection to this from a Liberal point of view, although all sorts of people are taking a stand on the issue in my country. If there is no alternative, so they would have us believe, you must not charge extra for using the roads. But that is not true. You should make a charge. On the other hand, we should not make a charge if it is not necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is extremely important that we should make this a European system, which is currently by no means the case. Each Member State is busy reinventing the wheel. I would point out in passing that the example of Norway, which many people have mentioned because of the excellent way in which it has organised access to Oslo, Trondheim and Bergen, is not really all that good. There is a lot of abuse and fraud and the situation is extremely chaotic, so it is exactly the sort of bad example we should not follow. We must not sit back and wait for the compatibility that I described in a working document for the Transport Committee to be achieved, because it would take us at least ten years and this could be used as an excuse to charge what it actually costs to use the roads.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much welcome Mrs Schmidbauer"s report. We in the Liberal Group would like to make just one further improvement, which is really no more than dotting the I"s and confirming what the rapporteur has already said. We agree with her that if the PPE Group"s amendments are approved they would destroy the whole purpose of the report. However, this is not to say that there are not some extremely good elements in those amendments, which we will be happy to accept.</p>
