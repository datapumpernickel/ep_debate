In May 2000 the Turkish authorities informed the Spanish Ministry of the Environment that they had received 2 200 tonnes of ash that had been exported without authorisation. The Turkish authorities classified the waste as hazardous due to its chromium content. The Secretariat of the Basel Convention was also informed.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Spanish authorities, they immediately began to investigate the case. The information from the port of Avilés showed that the documents that the ship was carrying were forged, hiding the fact that the waste was originally destined for Algeria but had been rejected there because it was wet and therefore unusable. The company exporting the cargo stated that it had not intended to send the waste to Turkey, but to Algeria, and that the captain of the ship had acted without its consent.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish authorities took action against the company and required it to take the waste back to Spain for treatment. The company appealed against the decision and administrative proceedings went on until the end of 2002. In 2003 and 2004 discussions continued as to how to return the ash to Spain. In July 2004 the Turkish authorities informed the Spanish authorities that they could proceed with a plan drawn up by the company to transfer the ash to another vessel and return it to Spain. However, before this could be done, the vessel sank on 6 September.</p>
<p class="contents">We have strict rules in place that regulate the movement of waste within and outside the European Union. Exports of waste for disposal are prohibited. Exports of hazardous waste for recovery to OECD countries, including Turkey, have to be notified to the competent authority in the country of export and need the consent of the authorities concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">If an EU Member State discovers that a shipment has taken place without notification, it has to ensure either that the waste is taken back within 30 days or that it is taken care of in an environmentally sound manner. According to the information available, Spain was willing to take back the waste and fulfil its legal obligations. Unfortunately, legal and administrative problems delayed a solution until it was too late. This problem should have been prevented at source. Therefore it is one of our priorities to work further towards improving implementation of Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">We are holding regular meetings with national authorities to discuss problems of implementation and possible solutions. A key issue in this respect is increased cooperation between port authorities in order to tackle, among other things, the problem of port hopping.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, may I remind you that the role of non-EU countries in cases such as this is defined in the Basel Convention on Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Waste and their Disposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are dealing with another accident at sea, this time in the Mediterranean, which demonstrates the current fragility of the common network we are creating with a view to guaranteeing the greatest possible level of safety at sea.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">Erika </span>and <span class="italic">Prestige</span> accidents in Community waters taught us a hard lesson about the European Union’s urgent needs in terms of legislation and maritime traffic control, and the result of this painful process has been a range of very advanced legislative measures whose transposition, entry into force and rigorous application are helping us to make progress towards increasing maritime safety and preventing marine pollution within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The case of the '<span class="italic">MV Ulla'</span> accident, in the port of <span class="italic">Iskenderun</span>, Alexandretta, in Turkey, demonstrates needs of other kinds. On the one hand, the need for coordination between the authorities of a Member State of the Union, which at all times has complied with international and Community legislation, and the authorities of an associated State which aspires to membership of the Union and should therefore be making every effort, as it already does in other areas, to comply with what we call the Community acquis in the field of environmental protection. On the other, we need to deal with the contradiction between the two factors which come into play in this type of accident: urgent practical decisions and measures for dealing with the environmental emergency which has taken place and the much more time-consuming issue of the legal requirements relating to disputes, together with the problems of identifying the people ultimately responsible, resulting from the tangle of interests in the field of maritime traffic, something which this House has repeatedly condemned.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case, we can affirm that from the outset the Spanish authorities have fulfilled the requirements of the Basel Convention, opening proceedings against the company and obliging it to return the ash and also ensuring all the necessary coordination with the Turkish authorities and providing all the help and technical assistance necessary for the ash to be returned to Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the time periods, particularly those stemming from the embargo imposed on the ship by the Turkish authorities, have meant that, recently, since 7 July, the Turkish authorities have finally had free access to the ship. On that date, the embargo was finally lifted and therefore the company, owing to pressure from the Spanish authorities, acknowledged the need and their obligation to return the ashes. It is too short a time period and the ship, which was already in a pretty horrendous condition, as demonstrated by the number of occasions it has been detained in the past, has finally sunk in circumstances which have yet to be clarified.</p>
<p class="contents">I must point out that, from the outset, the Spanish authorities have considered that assistance to be necessary, that there is now a technical assistance mission heading for Turkey and that, in relation to this case, we will once again have to consider whether the players operating in this tangle of legislation and maritime traffic have or have not met their obligations: the company, the authorities, the captain, etc. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For four years, a ghost ship with forged documents has been breaking every rule, every directive, every international convention, and there is no way of applying legislation and the law. It is driven out of Algeria and goes to Turkey. Turkey does not want it, but no one can impose what, for the rest, we all want to vote through. We face a huge ecological disaster and a huge failure on the part of the European Commission to practise what it quite rightly preaches. It is therefore time to stop merely talking and to start acting. I call, on behalf of my political group and as a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety<span class="bold">,</span><span class="bold"> </span>for the Commission to apply the 'polluter pays' principle at long last, not only to those who owned the vessel but also to those who owned the product, the cargo, and to everyone else involved in this saga. The basic political conclusion, if we are honest, is that rich industry in the north must stop using poorer countries in the south as one big illegal dumping ground for toxic waste. We are talking about 2 200 tonnes of waste, containing carcinogenic chromium, contaminating the waters of the Mediterranean and we know full well that contamination has cross-border repercussions. Commissioner, it is time for action, not just the right words.</p>

It is also clear that this disaster could have been avoided. Now, more than 300 million litres of water have been polluted, and the clearing operation will require huge investments. It is much more important, however, to look for ways to avoid situations like this in future. This particularly applies to the implementation and enforcement of the Basel Convention and the European Regulation for the movement of waste, on the review of which I have, as rapporteur, been working hard for more than a year now. The current Regulation clearly stipulates that Member States need to take back their cargo if it is refused for good reason. In November last year, the European Parliament proposed to extend the grounds for refusal. I would take this opportunity of calling on the Commission to adopt these proposals by this House. The <span class="italic">Ulla</span> carried hazardous waste, and, as it is extremely unusual for a ship to set sail without authorisation from the receiving country, it appears that Spain acted in contravention of the rules. I would therefore like to ask the Commission to take additional enforcement measures, and, if need be, legal action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the environmental disaster that we potentially face has to do with toxic waste from thermal power stations, so maybe the time has come to stop pointing to nuclear energy as the only scapegoat. In my country, for example, the government has committed itself to phasing out nuclear energy completely within the foreseeable future. It is very questionable whether the environment will eventually derive benefits from this, since there are no real alternatives at present and this is once again an illustration of the fact that the very real and serious problem of toxic waste is not only the result of nuclear energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I am a Euro-sceptic. I am very critical of European interference and of excessive intervention at European level in the politics and culture of our Member States, with the exception of environmental protection, which requires the closest possible cooperation. Indeed, this is one of the few areas – and one in which progress has been minimal – in which this very close cooperation is an absolute necessity and can also be democratically legitimised by public approval.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we are once again establishing that we must strive towards the best possible relations with our neighbouring country, Turkey. I fear for the future if a blind Europeanism in this neighbouring country were to create the impression that it could, in time, really become a member of our European Union. Neither geographically, culturally, nor historically is Turkey a European country, and we must now have the courage to say so, and only on the basis of this candid stance can we, both now and in the future, maintain the best and closest friendly relations with our Turkish neighbour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The effect of the <span class="italic">Prestige, </span>over recent years, has been some small progress in lawmaking, and if the Member States were to be more prompt in processing the Commission’s proposals, we might well make some progress as regards pollution of the environment and criminal law. It is not the Commission that is dragging its feet, but the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though we are seeing a changeover to a new Commission and will not be able to sort this out this evening, let me ask, Commissioner, that the Commission should respond to this calamity by producing a proper report with good analysis of both the environmental and transport aspects; then it might put forward some proposals for legislation, perhaps as part of the <span class="italic">Erika III </span>package. Then we will be able to use European law to close the loopholes whose presence this calamity has made so obvious, or, where there is negligence or a lack of vigilance, we will know who is responsible. It will enable the imposition of sanctions for sloppy work. I think it would be possible to do this over the next few months, so that we not merely learn from this catastrophe, but also make our seas rather safer in future than they have been in the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Who, after this accident, which has been waiting to happen for years, given that the ship was moored in the port of Iskenderun for four years, would now dare to claim, as crowing reports and expert opinions have claimed from time to time, that 80% of accidents are due to human error? We have always denounced such claims as mistaken, unscientific and suspicious, because they endeavour to conceal the fact that toxic and nuclear waste are transported unchecked from large, monopoly-owned factories with the backing of governments, state authorities and shipping companies, while at the same time revealing the adverse consequences of an old fleet and poor surveys. The sole purpose of initiatives to date, including those of the European Union, has been to prevent a public outcry by concealing who is responsible and promoting the interests of big business. I think that the baton for action needs to be passed to the grass-roots movement, so that it can overturn this policy, introduce strict measures governing the transportation of toxic and nuclear waste and, on a more general note, protect human life, the sea, public health and the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would, of course, never contradict the Commission's statement – probably supported by all institutions – that we should learn from accidents of this kind. We should also do everything to prevent this continuing to be only the tip of the iceberg. We also know that there is a lot of money involved in wasted shipments; but I do not accept that the Commission should take the blame for everything that has happened in this particular case. It is not the responsibility of the Commission alone. We have a responsibility, we will accept that to the full; but in this case, I repeat, the problem should have been prevented at source. It is not entirely a legal problem or to do with something missing in the legislation, but it is a combination of illegal actions and legal and administrative problems, which delayed a solution until it was too late. We have to concentrate on implementing environmental legislation to the full, thus avoiding problems of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we will see if there is anything to be learned from this. Can we act in a better way, can we prevent this happening in the future? It is also very clear from the existing legislation where the responsibility lies. It is not that this case opens up enormous gaps in the existing legislation, but rather how the legislation is being interpreted, implemented and enforced in different Member States. The issue was raised about the ‘polluter pays’ principle, which is one of the fundamental principles in EU legislation and in EU environmental policy. But in this case the pollution has taken place outside the EU where, of course, the Commission has no competence to apply EU law. We have to get the facts right.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope this discussion will prove fruitful for the future, because it is in our common interest to make sure that this does not happen again and that we learn lessons and can keep our seas safe. It is very important that enforcement is also carried out, to make sure that the signal goes out to all actors in cases like this.</p>
