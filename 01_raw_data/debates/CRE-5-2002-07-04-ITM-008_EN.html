However, after the slaughter of thousands in Matabeleland the ZANU-PF Government has brought the country to the verge of economic collapse and starvation. The March presidential elections were a travesty of democracy, with repression of a free press and the MDC opposition leader now on trial for treason.</p>
<p class="contents">Mugabe has rewarded his cronies – or so-called ‘veterans’ – with confiscated white farmers' land. The Land Acquisition Act is even now preventing the harvesting of the crops to feed the hungry.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU sanctions have been poorly applied, with the Minster of Police recently attending an Interpol function in Spain and Mugabe attending a hunger conference in Rome, which is a clear affront to world opinion. Children of the regime's leaders are allegedly attending expensive British boarding schools. the New Partnership for African Development and the EU Troika have been supine in galvanising regional – particularly South African and Nigerian – opinion against the president.</p>
<p class="contents">Although Zimbabwe faces expulsion from the Commonwealth on 25 July, the government seems more concerned with prosecuting a disastrous war in the Democratic Republic of Congo in order to safeguard Mugabe's cronies' diamond mining interests.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly urge the General Affairs Council, on 22 July, to beef up the sanctions and to allow no excuses from Member States that their multilateral treaty obligations override the sanction restrictions. I also call on the Commonwealth to suspend Zimbabwe from the forthcoming Commonwealth Games on 25 July in Manchester.</p>
<p class="contents">Ordinary people can rest assured that the EU will continue to provide emergency humanitarian aid in order to prevent undue suffering and a total breakdown in civil society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although I endorse the resolution we have submitted, I do have concerns, which are based on our manifest powerlessness. So far, none of our punitive resolutions have achieved anything. Mr Mugabe is a figure who has survived the loss of two elections , the moral victor being the opposition. He is a sad figure who tries to have complete control over the law. </p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I am actually proposing we start selecting the means that befit the tone of voice we adopt. If we do not want war, if we do not have the means to wage war, then we should not sound a warlike note. This is what I should like to ask of our British MEPs. I should like to start by putting Mr Mugabe out of action in the Congo, where he is stealing raw materials and deploying his army. He must leave the Congo in accordance with the international agreements in Lusaka. We are aware that his support for the young Kabila's regime is of great importance. If we want peace restored in the Congo, he must leave that country. No longer having any resources, he will have to take his troops home with him; these troops have to get paid and he does not have the resources to do this. I would recommend actions of this type, and I should also like to stop making all these fine appeals to the neighbouring countries, because they get nothing done. In my view, we ought to start telling these neighbouring countries that it is no longer acceptable to support Mr Mugabe's policies, or that they, on the one hand, pay lip service to such things as good governance, and yet continue to display their loyalty to Mr Mugabe. We should put pressure on them too. </p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commission to completely overhaul its way of behaving vis-à-vis Zimbabwe, because we were unable to apply even the few sanctions that there are. Mr Mugabe is leaving for a trip abroad with his entourage, and you are well aware of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is unfortunate that Zimbabwe is once again on the agenda. The situation is deteriorating by the day, and we, the European Parliament, the European Union, are, in actual fact, watching helplessly. There is just one thing we can do and that is to grant humanitarian aid immediately in view of the present famine. Something has to be done about this, and the European Union is in a position to do it.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing has changed since last month’s part-session, when we last discussed Zimbabwe . The G8 Conference was held in Canada, where the well-known NEPAD initiative was discussed, with reference to which it was stated that it was more or less up to the Africans themselves to guarantee such things as democracy and human rights, and that they need to exert pressure on the governments in Africa that fail to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say that Zimbabwe’s neighbouring countries now have a golden opportunity to show what last week’s pledge in Canada is worth. They can bring pressure to bear on Mr Mugabe, and we can help them do this. These countries do receive aid on a large scale, and we could do something with this, but they would, in turn, have to exert pressure on Mr Mugabe so that the situation there changes.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in complete agreement with Mrs Maes regarding the situation in the Congo. Mr Mugabe has no business there and should leave that country at the earliest opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want now to quote a figure supplied today by the aid agencies, one that is especially appalling, even though it is only a snapshot. Of Zimbabwe's adult population, 33% are infected with the HIV virus. From day to day, between 2 000 and 5 000 people die of this scourge; there are already 900 000 orphans in Zimbabwe, and that too is a consequence of the unspeakable policies of Mugabe and the ZANU-PF. No longer is there either prevention or treatment. Poverty makes these people's misery even worse. In this country, which once possessed a system of medical provision that was an example to Africa, there are scarcely any medical facilities left, and what provision exists is far from covering the whole country. The reason for this is that the country's doctors and nurses have fled, the hospital system has collapsed and there are no more medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">These things are all consequences of a policy under which those with any hope for the future leave the country, and only the poor are left. The hunger there – the hunger that is spreading throughout southern Africa – is only partly a result of the drought and natural calamities that afflict such regions from time to time, but is man-made and used as a weapon.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need here for Europe to exert really massive pressure in the hope that sanity will yet prevail. Any such pressure, though, in fact needs also to be applied to those who now openly declare to NEPAD that they are committed to promoting good governance, the defence of human rights and democratic values. If they seriously mean that, then they can demonstrate their credibility by speaking frankly to their neighbour Mugabe, withdrawing political support from him and making it clear to him that he is isolated on a continent that is finding its way out of wretched poverty while respecting human dignity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This neatly, and tragicomically, sums up the criminal madness of President Mugabe’s land appropriations policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Criminal madness indeed, for how else can a government policy be described when it simply comes down to pure theft on a massive scale, with probably a huge famine around the corner? Mugabe’s regime prohibits thousands of white farmers from continuing to work. In this way, it also leaves hundreds of thousands of black land workers and their families with no means of support. And this with the winter harvest on the fields … Imagine too the improbable situation which white cattle farmers are facing thanks to Mugabe. Cows simply need to be milked.</p>
<p class="contents">To the power-mad President and his entourage, the country’s white farmers and the opposition are all one and the same, and they are dealt with mercilessly, even if the country is heading for a humanitarian disaster. By the way, President Mugabe had the audacity to show up in all his glory at last month’s World Food Summit in Rome.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, a Zimbabwean economic expert lamented that “not one government in Africa has condemned this theft of private property”, rightly following that up by asking what trust the outside world can place in the New Partnership for African Development. This joint motion for a resolution faces all African leaders with the same pressing question. It thus calls for credible African action against Mugabe’s reign of terror. I hope and expect that the Council, the Commission and the Member States will actually endorse this appeal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicholson (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, it is quite clear from the previous speeches that the situation in Zimbabwe is one of clear and total demoralisation amongst the people living there. President Mugabe has presided over the destruction of a once vibrant country. Not only that, but he has reduced what was once one of the strongest economies in Africa to the depths of despair.</p>
<p class="contents">While we all condemn this, we have stood by and watched his henchmen murder innocent white farmers and be rewarded by the President for their actions. Nobody should stand by and allow this to happen. Yet the world has stood idly by and allowed it to happen. That must not continue.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Tannock when he says Zimbabwe should be removed from the Commonwealth. It should not be allowed to take part in the Commonwealth Games. But you will not resolve the problems of the long-suffering people of Zimbabwe by simply turning a blind eye and pretending they do not exist, nor by allowing President Mugabe to leave the country and attend conferences.</p>
<p class="contents">It is high time that strong sanctions were imposed. We should be prepared to help, and make clear that we are prepared to help a democratic Zimbabwe rebuild, because a democratic Zimbabwe could once again flourish in the African continent. I have no hesitation in saying that. Zimbabwe was once the bread basket of Africa. Zimbabwe was once a flourishing country and it could be again. But it cannot be if we stand by and pay lip service to a despot like Mugabe, who is not only destroying his country and his people, but ensuring that the aid that is given does not even reach those who really need it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to ask the British MEPs to have a look at the text. Paragraph 12 of the Dutch text states that “eist dat deze maatregelen de uitbreiding omvatten van de lijst van buiten de wet geplaatste individuen...” [demands that these measures include the extended list of individuals placed outside the law]. In my view, what is meant here is individuals to whom access to our territory is being denied because this is a reference to the sanctions. The French text states “<span class="italic">des personnes frappées d'interdiction</span>”. This should, in my view, read: “<span class="italic">interdiction d'accès</span>”. I do not have the English text here, but I think that these three texts relate to the same kind of sanctions, namely the ban on access to our territory in the European countries, in the EU countries. I should like to ask for these texts to be checked and for paragraph 12 to have the same scope in all language versions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Violence and oppression continue, the opposition has, to all intents and purposes, been crushed, civil society and an independent press no longer exist and, of course, there is the issue of the highly adverse impact of the land redistribution policy on food security, especially for the most vulnerable sections of the population and, may I say, for workers on large farm holdings.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is the political and social crisis, the humanitarian disaster which is at the top of the Commission's agenda; as you know, the European Union undertook at the General Affairs Council in June to respond generously to calls by the United Nations for action on the humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe and other countries in the area. In addition, the Union is pushing for the farm reform procedure to be revised in accordance with the guidelines in the proposal contained in the United Nations development programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The humanitarian crisis has taken on huge proportions. The Commission, for its part, has already set the procedure for responding to demands for food aid in motion and has earmarked a total of EUR 55 million for the area. These funds will be managed by the World Food Aid Programme and non-governmental organisations. We are, of course, doing the best we can, but we know from reports that the Zimbabwean government is making political capital out of the food crisis. We have emphasised in our contacts with the Zimbabwean authorities that aid must be given to everyone facing a humanitarian emergency, irrespective of their political persuasions, and we have reiterated the need for food to be distributed impartially.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, numerous members referred to what we too have stressed, i.e. that Zimbabwe was a food-exporting nation and that the current food shortage is mainly the result of misguided policies and only due in part to the drought. If order to prevent a repetition of the crisis and the situation from worsening in forthcoming years, the government really must review its macroeconomic and sectoral policies, in order to get the country back on the road to a more stable economy and development.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission accompanied the United Nations development programme mission to Zimbabwe to examine the farm reforms and expressed its wish to support transparent and fair reforms predicated on the needs of the poorer sections of the population. It also emphasised the particularly useful role which neighbouring countries can play by exerting pressure. However, in order to deal with this situation, priority has to be given to resolving the political conflict through negotiation, so as to put an end to the violence. Only if the rule of law is restored will there be any chance of changing the situation and resolving the pressing problems in Zimbabwe, which is why I should like to highlight the action we are taking to find a political settlement to the crisis, to contain the violence and support democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">After so many unsuccessful attempts at mediation and the deterioration in the situation in Zimbabwe, we understand that people are sceptical as to whether or not these initiatives will succeed. However, it is very important to understand the particular significance of contacts established between the European Union troika and the Southern African Development Community or SADC. The troika has tried to support international initiatives to manage the crisis in Zimbabwe. We need to give these efforts some time before condemning them. During the troika's mission, our partners in the SADC insisted that European Union sanctions had had the opposite effect. Even though we do not share this view, we need to seriously reconsider if our objective is to support regional efforts to deal with the crisis in Zimbabwe. The European Union imposed specific sanctions on 20 members of the governing party by refusing visas, freezing assets and suspending bilateral ministerial contacts. Because the dialogue has ground to a halt and violence continues in Zimbabwe, most groups in Parliament propose that the Council should impose further sanctions. The Commission realises that the Zimbabwean authorities are endeavouring to undermine the reliability of the ban on visas. However, the advantage of extending this ban to other people should be examined in relation to the damage which this might inflict on the Union's contacts with the SADC.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for these reasons that, come what may, we must continue to support the initiative of the Southern African Development Community and to monitor events and re-examine our policy towards Zimbabwe after the summer recess. Of course, our support for the people of Zimbabwe will continue under our programmes in the humanitarian aid sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
