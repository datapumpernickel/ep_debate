<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">De Melo </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (PT)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, over the final years of this century we have witnessed an increasing trend towards globalisation in politics, not only on security issues but also on economic and social matters and environmental protection. If we are to deal with all these issues at global level it is vital to have a world organisation capable of formulating rules governing universal conduct that will be respected and complied with once they have been accepted. Although the scope of its activities is limited, such an organisation has already existed for so long that it is part of modern history, and the role it has played, its conduct and the actions it has taken deserve general praise. One slight criticism of this organisation is perhaps that it has failed to widen its range of powers and the scope of its activities, which have virtually become set in stone. I am, of course, referring to the United Nations Organisation, which is to be applauded for the pivotal role it has played in solving many world conflicts and problems over the last 50 years.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, which I think are hard to contest, I am convinced that the United Nations Organisation is the right platform for centralising the efforts of the international community to rise to the challenges of globalisation. But to do this, the UN needs to have at its disposal the means required for effective management of political issues at world level, starting with the changes needed in the philosophy and logic of international relations.</p>
<p class="contents">First, in the field of peace and security the UN needs to be given effective means of action and these actions should be legitimised by a clear right and duty to intervene. The creation of the International Criminal Court has been a great step forward, in that it establishes the international criminal responsibility of the individual. The Security Council, whose composition reflects the outcome of the last world war, needs to be reformed to reflect the world's current geopolitical balance. A parliamentary dimension needs to be introduced into the UN system, so as to give the organisation more weight in its relations with parliaments throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, economic globalisation and the liberalisation of trade and financial markets have brought about a shift in decision‐making centres from the political authorities towards economic power. This means that in most cases crucial decisions for the world economy are being taken by a small number of globalised companies unrestrained by any democratic scrutiny, often with negative social and environmental consequences. For this reason it is becoming necessary to steer globalisation on a more controlled course. Let me say it again: a more controlled course for economic globalisation is needed. Mutual recognition of cultures, an ethical approach and fairness in international negotiations are essential in restoring a balance between political power and economics. To ensure international observance of these principles, it would be advisable to create a Global Security Council that would coordinate and monitor not only security issues as such, but also problems of economic development, social justice and environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the UN and all its member countries should be obliged to make the principle of the universality of human rights and of duties, freedoms, solidarity and justice an essential condition of any pact between the institutions and the states. We should also reiterate our support for the creation of the World Environment Agency, and for the reaffirmation and consolidation of environmental protection policy in international relations that this would entail.</p>
<p class="contents">For the reasons that I have presented briefly here and have developed at greater length in my report, together with the generally helpful amendments tabled by honourable Members, I ask you to vote for this resolution.</p>

And secondly, is the United Nations Organisation the appropriate forum in which to develop this desire and capacity for governance? We answer both of these questions in the affirmative. Yes, it is not only necessary but also possible to deal democratically with the major problems and challenges facing humanity: security, poverty, the environment and so on. Yes, the UN is the principal international forum in which to explore and shape the necessary responses. The UN should not of course be viewed as a monolithic body. Its tasks must be set out clearly, and the necessary synergies must be developed with the Member States, with regional organisations – first and foremost the European Union – and with other international institutions. At the same time, the UN is in urgent need of a number of organisational and operational reforms. Among the ones which we outline, I would stress those relating to the composition and functions of the Security Council, the establishment of a global ‘economic security council' and the streamlining of the structures of the specialised agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Matters such as the worldwide challenges of human development and the fight against poverty and marginalisation must receive particular attention at the UN. To this end, we are convinced that – contrary to what has happened until now – the work of bodies like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund must be brought into line with the aims of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">The opinion which I have drawn up on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation contains all our detailed proposals in this context. Much will depend, however, on the EU Member States adopting a coherent approach at the UN over the next few years. This will be the acid test of an effective European common foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to end by complimenting the rapporteur, Mr De Melo, on his excellent work on this report.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Barón Crespo </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Madam President, first and foremost I should like to congratulate Mr De Melo on this excellent report which tackles the fundamental issue of wise global governance. His report is certainly timely as the concept of globalisation features prominently in all statements and studies attempting to explain what is going on in the world. Indeed, globalisation must not be allowed to get out of control as we are currently witnessing, particularly in the financial sector. Instead, faced with a global reality that is increasingly leading to a single entity, it is incumbent upon us to create a framework of appropriate legal and security arrangements. Hence, a report such as the one before us today is not simply a theoretical study, but is extremely relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth pointing out that there is uncertainty concerning the European Union"s responsibility in terms of the future of the UN. The 15 Member States currently contribute 38 % of the UN"s operational budget, and our payments are up to date. The problem is that we are contributing as 15 individual states and not as a single entity, so our contribution does not carry enough weight. The same is true of our contribution to all the buffer and peace‐keeping troops and to mediation efforts, that is, what are known as the’Petersberg missions" in European jargon. The Member States of the European Union make a vital contribution to these. Our involvement in development aid should also be highlighted.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, our efforts are not adequately promoted. This state of affairs is particularly regrettable since the European Union is a regional organisation based on the principles of peace and cooperation. As such, it has an automatic vocation to establish links and to promote the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to highlight certain issues that the Socialist Group"s amendments focused on. I think that more work on these issues is called for. We must continue with our efforts as we approach the new legislature, particularly since now that the cold war has ended, when its operations were very much restricted, the UN is being called upon to undertake a wide range of missions and is swamped with requests, though it lacks the resources to deal with them all. This may put us in mind of a problem we are experiencing much closer to home at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Clear criteria on the creation of an Economic Security Council are therefore needed, as is a common European position on the composition of such a council. There is currently no consensus or basic agreement on this issue, not even amongst the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, our involvement in peace and security missions and in the establishment of the International Criminal Court certainly deserve a mention. So too does the ongoing search for dialogue with the United States, which in my view is fundamental in ensuring the future of the UN. As things stand at present, we have reached an impasse in our dealings with our main ally.</p>
<p class="contents">Sustained efforts are also required to develop the economic order following Bretton Woods. This will mean agreeing on solutions and modifications to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation, thus defining their future role. Their relationship with the International Labour Office should also be clarified. Environmental considerations must feature prominently in this process, particularly sustainable development, as it is one of the distinguishing features of the European Union.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Spencer </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Madam President, my group welcomes this excellent and important report and congratulates the rapporteur. Some two weeks ago I was in New York talking about this report to the secretariat and I was distressed to learn that the whole process of UN reform, which was supposed to culminate in the year 2000 at the Millennial Assembly, is blocked. The European Union must play its role in unblocking this process of reform with considerable urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I want to stress what has already been said by other speakers, that we need to be holistic about the way in which this reorganisation is carried forward. It is not just the United Nations institutions, it is also the Bretton Woods Institutions which, at a time of financial dislocation and global environmental challenge, all require a consistent policy to be developed so that they interact better with each other. That became very apparent last week in Geneva at the WTO High Level Seminar on Trade, Environment and Development which was Sir Leon Brittan's initiative. It became very clear by the conclusion of that seminar that the chances for a successful Millennial Round of the WTO will depend on a parallel reform and enhancement of the other global institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw attention to one particular idea in the report which is valuable in terms of the legitimacy of these institutions of global governance. That legitimacy can only flow from parliamentarians. I do not believe that the time is yet right for a full Parliamentary Assembly at global level. We know our own problems in running a Parliament even in a coherent single continent such as our own. But I endorse the idea of parliamentary Oversight Committees composed of the chairmen of the specialist committees of the planet's parliaments. Meetings of all the chairmen of the foreign affairs committees, or all the chairmen of the trade committees relating to the World Trade Organisation, or all the chairmen of environment committees relating directly to the World Environment Organisation or to UNEP could be creative.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude by saying that we are facing the critical decade from the year 2000 to 2010 for the survival of our species. There can be no better way to mark the Millennium than to equip humanity with the global institutions which it needs to pass on its heritage to its children.</p>

Unlike some others my group has no problem with this, but good management of the world order does require an effective world body. We have that world body in the form of the United Nations. But the UN is still not being given the resources and procedures and indeed the respect it needs in order to be effective and I am glad that Mr De Melo has spelled that out in his report, for which we thank him.</p>
<p class="contents">The loss of credibility which the UN has suffered in matters of peace and security must be remedied quickly. And what does quickly mean? There has to be an end to decision‐making methods which tend to end in deadlock. In specific terms that means, for example, a rapid reaction force. The UN must be able to react quickly in the event of a humanitarian disaster. That can be easy enough. The process of decision‐making simply has to be adjusted in order to make it possible. There is no place here for vetoes.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, the UN has to be properly financed. It is scandalous, I am sure you will agree, that the USA has for so long failed to meet its financial obligations, and international pressure must be brought to bear on each and every country which is behind with its contributions to make it pay its dues.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Alavanos </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, the United Nations is an institution that was established in the wake of the catastrophes of the Second World War and, with all its weaknesses and deficiencies, contributed to the extent its powers allowed to bipolarisation and the cold war period. However, it also contributed to security and, if you like, to the avoidance of greater confrontations and conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">But since the 1990s, a fundamental question has arisen: does the United Nations really exist? Does it now play any substantial role in ensuring international security and peace? This question is becoming an increasingly topical one. In the space of a few minutes, or a few hours, there may be military intervention in Kosovo, in the Republic of Yugoslavia. Where is the UN? When did the UN meet? What has Kofi Annan said? We are hearing from Mr Solana, Madeleine Albright and Mr Holbrooke. But where is Kofi Annan? Why does he say nothing? Is it possible for the UN, in a climate of total monopolisation in which the European Union is totally submissive and compliant, to play any special role?</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I would like to stress that, of course, the proposals from Mr De Melo are very positive and interesting and should be promoted. However, I do not think we will find an answer simply by putting in place a network of measures, unless the major powers in the world today, such as the European Union above all, abandon their childish dependency, unless they acquire a sense of independence and self‐belief, unless they move forward and take on a substantial role and call into question this suffocating monopoly that is being established by the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN is absent from Kosovo and from Kurdistan; the UN is closing its eyes to the intervention in Yugoslavia and to the total indifference to the rights of the Kurds. The UN is maintaining this unacceptable policy of two steps forward and one step back, and in this way it is impossible for the UN to move forward. All this hinges to a great extent on the European Union today.</p>

At present a sort of global constitution is taking shape, though, unfortunately, it is all happening very undemocratically. We have often seen cases where national parliaments accept these agreements, and because they take so long to debate, the details can no longer be examined at such a late stage, and so important issues are decided among governments in what are ultimately secret negotiations. I believe that the European Parliament is one of the best forums for voicing opinions, one where we have had the courage to take a position on these agreements, such as the one on the World Trade Organisation. Furthermore, I have the impression that national parliaments do not always have the courage to exercise whatever rights they have with regard to their governments, when agreements are being negotiated. Perhaps the situation would improve if we were to have something like parliamentary meetings for international organisations, like the World Trade Organisation. These would most certainly have the important task of guaranteeing improvements in communication as well as transparency and openness. We should be aiming at a sort of global federalism, in which some of the decisions are taken globally as openly and democratically as possible.</p>

I agree with other Members, such as Mr Barón Crespo, who have suggested that we have taken a step backwards. Whereas in the previous report we asked for the European Union to be represented on the Security Council, this point does not appear in this report. In my opinion, the Security Council question is central but for different reasons from those put forward by my friend, Mr Alavanos. I feel that the Security Council is currently demonstrating the limits of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Guatemala, we saw how China blocked the peace process because of the veto which it holds on the Security Council. The same thing recently occurred with regard to Macedonia where, again because of China, the peacekeeping force had to change its mandate. Now with Kosovo, Russia is bringing strong pressure to bear because of its right of veto. This has very serious implications for the continuation and possible strengthening of the United Nations system.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now increasingly being forced to rely on American leadership and, unfortunately, the absence of European leadership in order to undertake peacekeeping operations outside the United Nations, such as those that are probably about to take place in Kosovo. This is highly regrettable and demonstrates the need to change the way the Security Council operates. The veto system leads to a complete stalemate, and I am sorry that Mr De Melo did not stress this point more in his report.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Imbeni </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, I am grateful to Mr De Melo for his excellent work, following on from that of our former colleague Mr Trivelli, who produced an extremely important resolution on the United Nations in 1993. The debate in this House has reverberated with the echo of a protest, heard throughout the world in recent years, concerning the tragedies in Africa, Bosnia and elsewhere. Much has been said about the failure, the impotence of the UN, almost as though the United Nations were some kind of club of associates, without assessing the crucial role played by the most important associates, these of course being the United States and certain other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, is the problem? It is, as Mr De Melo quite rightly says in his report, that the reform carried out must be in keeping with the major changes which have occurred in modern times. We can no longer think of the United Nations in the way we did during the cold war, when the Soviet Union still existed and there were still dictatorships in South Africa and South America. We must reinvent the UN, and this new UN must play a role in the most significant fields: the historical, traditional one of conflict prevention, the increasingly relevant one of championing human rights, that of preventing economic and financial turbulence, and that of coordinating measures against old and new forms of crime.</p>
<p class="contents">In this light the question of reforming the Security Council, already referred to here, is a truly enormous one. We shall have to be rather more bold. One of the most important associates of the future must be one which is currently divided into 15: the European Union. As Mr De Melo suggests in his resolution, we must seek to ensure that this reform of the Security Council is implemented as soon as possible.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Carnero González </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, we find ourselves at a transitional stage in the development of a new world order, first envisaged at the end of the cold war. Progress during this stage appears to consist of taking one step forward and two steps back. Previous speakers have pointed out that the transition is characterised by two main features. In political terms it is marked by a tendency towards single polarity, and in socio‐economic terms – which are also political in their broadest sense – by the acceleration of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with my colleague Mr Vecchi that the question here is whether or not we are in a position to control this process of globalisation. In my view, we can, and we should ensure that we do so. International procedures must be democratised and socialised. They must be controlled, thus promoting the interests of efficiency as well as the interests of justice. Greater efficiency will facilitate conflict prevention and better handling of crises. It should prevent further financial crises like the one we are currently experiencing, and do away with the north‐south divide. We must remember that the gap between the rich and poor countries of the world is actually increasing at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">You may wonder how all this could be achieved. I envisage specific courses of action. First, we must strengthen and develop international law. It does exist in theory but is often ignored. Suitable instruments are required if international law is to be properly implemented, beginning with the United Nations. I agree with Mr De Melo that despite all the criticism levelled against it, the UN"s usefulness cannot be disputed. Its inefficiency should not be blamed on the UN itself. It is really due to a lack of political will on the part of its members, to a failure to implement and observe its charter, to the fact that it has not been granted genuine decision‐making powers or adequate resources, and to the absence of real democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN should not be done away with. It must be reformed, strengthened and developed and the European Union has a major role to play in this respect. European public opinion demands it, because who will take the lead if the European Union fails to do so?</p>

As I see it, his aim is to identify a way of changing direction and establishing some kind of balance between the leading players and civil society. If global decisions are to have legitimacy, then of course they must be representative. Consequently, civil society should also participate in laying the foundations that underpin the decisions taken at global level. If one looks at the financial crises that are occurring all over the world, the widening gap between rich and poor and the growing number of environmental problems, there is good reason to take heed. It is high time we did so and showed more sympathy towards the establishment of global links between such things as investment and development.</p>
<p class="contents">Before an agreement such as the MAI comes into existence, it should be compared with the evaluations which have been made and the decisions which have been taken, as set out at the major UN conferences. One hundred and fifty Nordic organisations have taken the initiative and said that if talks are to continue on an MAI agreement in the WTO, they must take place under the auspices of the UN in order to give them legitimacy.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that it was appropriate to single out the USA in the report. It is really shameful that this country has not paid its contributions for so long.</p>
<p class="contents">Promoting peace and security is, of course, the UN's most important function. I should just like to add that, in my view, NATO should delay its bombing campaign so as to allow the issue to be discussed by the UN Security Council.</p>

However, I want to restrict my speaking time specifically to support the proposal for the creation of a UN Economic Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Camdessus, Head of the IMF, is on record as saying that the UN is just one of the four pillars of the world system. This view sees the IMF, the World Bank and the WTO handling the serious economic business whilst relegating social affairs alone to the UN. No wonder that the World Bank and IMF have evolved in a way contrary to their founding objectives to reduce poverty. They have imposed structural adjustment programmes in response to the third world debt crisis of the 1980s, which have actually had the effect of increasing unemployment and eroding social welfare provision for the poor.</p>
<p class="contents">The only answer is to integrate the Bretton Woods agencies effectively in the UN system, to make them more directly accountable to all the nations of the world irrespective of ability to pay, to spread the principle of poverty reduction from the UN's development programme into economic decision‐making worldwide.</p>

It has had this role for more than 50 years, since the catastrophe of the Second World War. Of course it has had – and still has – weaknesses and shortcomings, and it may have more to come. Let us look for the causes.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been powers, in particular the United States and those close to it, and NATO itself, which have undermined its authority, bypassed it, disowned it and taken initiatives that run counter to what the United Nations should have said. We are now moving towards the brink of an explosive situation, with unforeseeable repercussions not just in Yugoslavia and the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I would have liked the report by Mr De Melo, which correctly recognises the unique nature of the United Nations, to stress the need for the UN to arm itself against these attempts to undermine its authority and to take initiatives, to put forward ideas and proposals, to strengthen itself further so that it can assume its role. As regards the issue of the veto which applies in the Security Council, I too would be in favour of abandoning it, but this would simply be jumping out of the frying‐pan into the fire. If this were to happen, the UN would become, in institutional terms, the puppet of the United States, of a bloc of questionable interests which would manipulate the Security Council for its own benefit and to the disadvantage of the people.</p>
<p class="contents">One final point: I am concerned about the role of the International Criminal Court. I am afraid that, under the slogans of ‘terrorism" or ‘crimes against humanity" – and I repeat that these are just slogans – it may be used as a tool to suppress and quell what are clearly national liberation movements. Just look at the way the Kurdish movement is being treated, and the fact that it may even end up being punished before international courts!</p>

Here the UN could be the ideal terrain on which to build an EU common foreign policy to consolidate all of our economic successes to date.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the specific reforms required, the UN Security Council needs to be updated along democratic and non‐élitist lines; moreover, this subject already appears as item 59 on the agenda of the General Assembly. Many countries are hoping for such a reform, so much so that, from its original complement of 30 members, the ‘Coffee Group' has grown to 49, and even the Durban summit of the 113 non‐aligned countries rejected by a large majority the temptation to abandon recourse to Article 108 of the UN Charter, pursuant to which the vote on the reform principles requires a two‐thirds majority of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Reform is of course a lengthy and complex business which cannot be summarised in a minute and a half. We now have the single currency; the next step has to be the common foreign policy, and the United Nations could be the basis on which to work towards this important goal.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van den Broek, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (NL)</span> Mr President, I too must compliment Mr De Melo and all the other Members who have worked on this report, which is comprehensive and so very much geared to the future. It comes at a time when we are all looking to the challenges of globalisation. A time too when many people can see the negative aspects but cannot agree on solutions. We must ensure that the great potential advantages of globalisation are realised, and that this works to the benefit of all countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Like you, I believe that the solutions have to be found within an improved multilateral forum. In this context, a leading role is marked out for the United Nations, but also for the international financial organisations and for the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Member State governments must ensure that the reforms currently under way are indeed continued. The many important aspects you mention in your report, such as human rights but also economic, social and security aspects, must be integrated into general policy. The numerous international organisations must seek to coordinate their measures and approaches closely. We believe that the UN millennium summit scheduled for the autumn of 2000 will provide an excellent opportunity for acknowledging the challenges of world management and defining more precisely the role of the United Nations for the twenty‐first century.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also our sincere hope that the enlarging European Union will play an important part in this whole debate and will contribute its experience of problems and opportunities in integrating these various aspects of policy into general policy on a multinational basis. But if the Union is to be a credible voice in this debate, as this House has remarked on numerous occasions, it must also have a more powerful, more consistent and more easily recognisable common foreign and security policy. The necessary institutional measures must be taken and the necessary instruments put in place. We very much hope that this will be done shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">May I add a brief footnote on the institutional provisions at the end of the resolution now before the House, although I appreciate that these are directed mainly at the Member States. The EU memorandum is an integral part of the statement which the President of the European Council makes each year to the UN General Assembly. It is a very broad summary of recent EU policy and measures and it covers a broad range of issues and geographical areas. As such, it is a very useful reference document. However, because it covers such a diversity of issues, I do not think it is well suited to serve as the basis for joint action within the meaning of Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty. Joint actions of this kind can be devised for more precisely defined subjects and should be less descriptive in nature. And that was the comment made yesterday at the General Affairs Council when we looked again at joint action by the EU in its relations with Russia, to be approved in Cologne.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the request that the Commission should report on the Union"s position concerning the specific points in your resolution in the context of forthcoming UN assemblies and other relevant gatherings, the Commission will certainly, as usual, continue submitting communications to the Council and Parliament in advance of important international events which require a position of consensus from the Union. The Commission will naturally also continue to keep the relevant committees of the European Parliament informed of any significant developments in the foreign and security policy of the European Union.</p>
