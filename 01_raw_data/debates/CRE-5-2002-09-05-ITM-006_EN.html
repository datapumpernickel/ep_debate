It is true that this company was not ‘of direct and individual concern’, but if the action had not been declared admissible, the company would not have had any other means of defending itself in law, and would thus have been ‘denied access to the courts’.</p>
<p class="contents">We also welcome this judgment, but merely regret that it had not been passed earlier, for example when we tabled an appeal, which was obviously justified on its merits, against changing the name of the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Commission, probably feeling under threat, immediately requested that the Jégo-Quéré ruling be overturned, and it also immediately obtained a ruling in line with its wishes during the judicial vacations …</p>
<p class="contents">The European institutions have therefore succeeded in putting themselves in a position where they can constantly destabilise the Member States, whilst practically guarding their general regulations from individual appeals by citizens.

In the former Soviet Union, attempts were made to turn the citizens of different federal republics, with different languages and cultures, into Soviet citizens. This was never successful. In Yugoslavia, attempts were made, alongside Serbs, Croats, Slovenes and Macedonians, to create new generations of real Yugoslavs who were meant to organise the country's future. These people are now second-class citizens. The creation of EU citizens who are constantly on the move between Member States in search of the most privileged jobs, leads to conflicts with their environment and to misfortune for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">A second goal of this proposal is to increase the level of participation during European elections. People do not vote in order to meet a ritual obligation which they do not experience as useful. They only want to vote if the body they need to choose has a decisive say and if there is an actual choice between conflicting alternatives. Asking people to vote as an expression of sympathy with a united Europe does not work. If we carry on like this, even fewer people will vote in the next round of elections. I do, of course, support the reinforcement of civil rights, including those of immigrants, and better information about the Ombudsman. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report is based on Article 150 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which provides for, in a vague and debatable manner, the implementation of a European vocational training policy ‘while fully respecting the responsibility of the Member States’. Then the report attempts to extend this competency to the rest of education. In particular, it proposes that the Commission should develop (albeit ‘acting in close collaboration with the Member States’) a ‘European framework of basic skills’ to be acquired by all students before they leave compulsory school education.</p>
<p class="contents">In such circumstances, the attempts to extend powers are never-ending. In addition, the European Parliament once again states that the current situation in the area of qualifications ‘constitutes a serious obstacle to mobility between Member States and the emergence of a Europe-wide labour market’ (recital F). Yet, we had been led to understand that the European labour market was already functioning. In reality, it is clear that, since the aim was that of full mobility in a totally unified labour market, it is the nations themselves which will soon become the obstacle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For example, although its recommendation for a single course of initial study is to be welcomed, this course must be guaranteed not to be made excessively short on the pretext of meeting the needs for courses that will make students rapidly 'employable'. These courses would be cheaper but it would be students and families, once again, funding the system, with students paying once they have graduated.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that, with regard to what is known as the Bologna process, which contains this and other proposals, on the basis of the Bologna declaration of 1999, which was reiterated and developed in Prague in 2001, a distinction must be made, on the basis of the objectives underlying the entire process, between the official line and the practices that are taking place. Despite the statements to the contrary, the set of measures that we have already seen, some of which are already underway, suggest an attempt to cut costs by the Member States in higher education, as is happening in Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore wish to stress our opposition to attempts to commercialise knowledge, to reduce the role of public higher education, to make structural changes to the social function of higher education and to its organisational structures and to attempts by the ruling classes to hijack the contents and objectives of education for ideological reasons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I find it extremely regrettable that my own Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats tabled two amendments which weaken the committee’s original text. Amendment No 1 removed the wording in paragraph 30 to the effect that the European Parliament ‘expresses its indignation at the increasing number of executions in China’ and ‘recalls that the Chinese government systematically uses persecution and torture as a means to silence dissidents and minorities’. The way in which the Chinese Government violates human rights is clear from, for example, its treatment of Christians and Falun Gong adherents.</p>

One is an authoritarian state view in which citizens are seen only as obedient conscripts and taxpayers who must leave the actual decision-making to a specially selected elite who know how to do things much better than ordinary people. The other reason is economic interest. The protection against pollution, nuisance and dangers in their living environment that most people want often means that businesses are hindered in their pursuit of profits. This also results in an authoritarian approach in which decisions are governed by economic interests instead of being taken by everyone collectively. Over the last few decades these hindrances seem to have been broken through. There are forms of citizen consultation everywhere, and the EU also prescribes this. Unfortunately the results of this participation are still often twisted to mean the opposite. I support Mrs Korhola in her quest to put an end to the exceptions that are still being made for military interests and civil disasters. The military often still think that they are above civilian society and that they can impose their own ideas. Measures to prevent disasters can often be very drastic, like flooding polders in the Netherlands when river water levels are high. Such decisions must not be taken without consultation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This development is, of course, welcome. That is why I support the Commission’s proposal for a directive of 19 January 2001 seeking to transpose into Community law the second pillar of the Aarhus Convention of 25 June 1998. This proposal is innovative, but it is down to the Member States to give the public effective opportunities to take part in the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to express some reservations about the amendments of the Korhola report which go further than the Aarhus Convention and which confirm the opinion of the rapporteur himself. The MPF delegation believes, of course, that transparency of information and public participation in the decision-making process must be encouraged and well defined. This should not, however, create overly complicated procedures that would go against the objectives of the proposal. If excessively restrictive provisions are introduced, there is a risk that the whole process of access to information and decision-making could be impeded. The only thing we should do is transpose into Community law the provisions – which are wholly appropriate – of the Aarhus Convention in order to encourage the effective application of this convention.</p>

This old saying might illustrate the attitude of the European Union towards those affected by the floods, which have devastated Member States and candidate countries. By reacting swiftly, by dispatching representatives to the affected areas and by agreeing to make available financial aid, the Union has boosted its Community policy and its closeness to the people. The Union has proved that it can show the solidarity expected of it and which we work to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we can welcome the commitment to set up an assistance fund for natural disasters in the Union, we must certainly bear in mind the causes of this unpredictable weather. Scientists throughout the world are all telling us that global warming is irreversibly changing the way we live and greenhouse gas emissions are only serving to make these disasters worse. On one side of the planet, we have to sell livestock due to a lack of water and fodder. Elsewhere, entire regions have been devastated since July due to thunderstorms. Incidentally, Mr President, let us reiterate that, in Nepal, 422 people have died and 173 people have been reported missing. In Russia, 50 people have lost their lives and 100 have been reported missing. In Mexico, torrential rain has cost 21 lives and 15 000 people have been affected. In Asia, 250 people have died this year. Millions of homes have been affected by the rising water levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, as we know, these geographical areas do not have the opportunity that we have here to provide victims with solidarity. Although Members can welcome the fact that aid has been granted and emergency measures have been taken swiftly and effectively, it is not enough to call for the application of the Kyoto Protocol, we must do much more than that. We must integrate the environment into all our projects, into all our policies so that we can create a glimmer of hope. We must lead the way in trying to slow down climate change. The Rio Summit brought little in the way of results, so it is up to us to lead by example! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This stems not only from our traditional links with the country our families come from, but also from the fact that in situations like this we realise that as neighbours we are dependent on each other, for good or ill. Sometimes there are what you might call neighbour disputes, but in emergencies like this we see the value of good neighbourliness. Czechs were in action in Germany and in Austria, Austrians and Germans were in action in the Czech Republic, and I believe that there are two important points here. The first is that no victim of the floods should be worse off in the Czech Republic, which is a candidate country, than they would be in the existing Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we also need to show solidarity when it comes to prevention. We need to recognise that we are all in the same boat and that what is happening in central Europe today could happen tomorrow in southern Europe or northern Europe. Above all, we should avoid something which I heard in this House earlier – by which I mean adopting the disdainful tone we heard during the topical and urgent debate about victims of the floods in the south. A lot of people from the north said that is typical, special pleading for the south, and vice versa.

<p class="contents">Secondly, if we want to better protect the territory of the Union against floods – and this is undoubtedly the desire of the European Parliament – we must take into account river basins, which ignore borders mapped out by history.

This is no coincidence. They carry rainwater and ice water from the Alps and the Carpathians to the North Sea and the Baltic. Rain has been on the increase due to global warming, the deforested soil is no longer able to retain the water and the river beds have become too narrow. The dikes along these canalised rivers have been built too close to the main flow and houses have been built in alluvial areas where flood water was previously allowed to overflow. This is therefore certainly not about chance but about predictable accidents. The reference to the need to implement the Kyoto agreements worldwide is extremely appropriate, but it is to be feared that America will remain obstructive on account of pressure from the oil companies and the motor industry until they themselves become more and more affected by desertification and flooding. Attention is now once more being paid to finding the money to help the victims of flooding. This is necessary but unsatisfactory. The same disasters may happen again in future years, and the likelihood of their happening again is unfortunately very great. Our river management will therefore have to change radically, and this is still in danger of falling by the wayside. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am afraid to say that I am very pessimistic, as I have the very clear feeling that we are heading towards a fresh crisis. In Afghanistan, which is a multi-ethnic state, there is an increasingly strong feeling amongst the largest national group, the Pashtuns, and whether it is justified or not I cannot say, that they are being neglected as compared with the peoples who lead the Northern Alliance, such as the Tadzhiks and the Uzbeks. This feeling is giving rise to an increasing potential for conflict, which the surviving Taliban are exploiting. People talk about the Taliban withdrawal area in eastern Afghanistan as if it were just a military or police problem. Unfortunately this is a nationality problem, since as I have said the largest group in this multi-ethnic state feels that it is being treated as second class, and that is something that could be explosively dangerous in the long run. That is why we need a clever strategy for Afghanistan, in order to integrate all the ethnic groups more or less uniformly, which up to now clearly has not been the case. Despite all the humanitarian successes and all the progress made on paper there is still a time bomb ticking away in Afghanistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In every valley the people determine their often stubborn points-of-view and they do not appreciate outside interference. Over the last twenty-five years, ideologues from Russia, Saudi Arabia and now the US have wanted to try out their various experiments on Afghan society. This has mainly resulted in death and destruction. The latest intervention was not so much aimed at helping to solve the many problems that exist in Afghanistan, but to avenge the destruction of two office towers in New York a year ago. Whether this dreadful attack was devised from within Afghanistan has never been proven, but the American response was that the established regime there had to be punished and ousted. Just as they now also want to oust the Iraqi regime. In a world in which there is only one big military and economic superpower left, will the national government of another country only be legitimate from now on if it is well-disposed towards America and acts in line with American interests? The resolution falls between two stools. On the one hand, it justifies the war and the continuing military presence. On the other hand, it is looking at the war crimes of the victors and the need to investigate and punish for the first time. The latter is new, and is a step forward compared with earlier attitudes. In the light of this improvement, I am voting in favour of the resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I am genuinely concerned about this issue. On the subject of Mrs Stenzel's report, I would like to congratulate her very warmly on it. I am pleased that we have adopted it today, as elections are being held in Macedonia on 15 September. What is at stake here is the democratic stability of this important country, to which we are now linked by an association agreement. This country has experienced a huge refugee problem. It has had two wars within its borders, many disasters, and now it is afflicted by terrorism. That is why it is very important for us to signal to Macedonia today that this democracy has our support, this democracy, which over the last four years – during which there have been several major disasters – has amazingly succeeded in achieving a balance between different nationalities. Even if quite a lot that glitters is still not gold, when you see the remarkable things the Macedonians have achieved, you have to say that they have earned our solidarity. One sign that we could give would be to abolish the visa requirement for Macedonia at long last. There was never such a requirement for Yugoslavia, there is not one for Croatia or Slovenia, and in fact Macedonia is the only associated country with a visa requirement. We should finally accept this small country as a genuine European partner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has the advantage, however, of being extremely clear on certain key issues, particularly on the desire of the EU’s leading bodies to take action over any unequal liberalisation in trade and in the movement of capital, and to provide the WTO with even greater powers. No lessons have been learned from the 1997-1998 financial crises and from the crash in Asia, the current stock market crisis or from the crash in South America. Reality must fade into the background in the face of liberal dogma<span class="bold"> </span>in the era of capitalist globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The ASEM 4 Summit in Copenhagen will also discuss security. At a time when, in Europe, immigrants are being used as scapegoats for the social crisis and, in Asia, Washington is deploying its policy of a ‘lasting war’ in the name of combating terrorism, is once again sending forces to the Philippines and is threatening to invade Iraq, we would hope that the EU would guarantee the rights of immigrants and would oppose American interventionism.</p>
<p class="contents">In the real world, however, the European Union is behaving like an economically dominant force in Asia and the United States like an aggressive force. This is certainly something that the European Parliament should oppose. There may be different situations that set Asia apart but there are general developments which affect the entire continent of Europe and Asia.</p>

These comments serve only as padding for the EU's stance favouring Taiwan over China. Taiwan has recently changed from a place of exile from the old pre-1949 Chinese regime into a country in which the majority is non-Chinese, where the old <span class="italic">Kuo Min Tang</span> party has lost power to movements of indigenous Taiwanese, and which is looking more and more like Europe and Japan from a political and economic point of view. The majority will probably now choose to become an independent state in a referendum. Not even so much because this has actually been the case for 53 years, but rather because they never felt much kinship with the Chinese mainland. The fact that the previous regime in Taiwan had for decades sought foreign backing to recapture the mainland is a problem. The existence of two Germanies, two Vietnams and two Yemens ultimately came to an end because one was able to swallow up the other. The EU Member States withdrew their recognition of Taiwan in favour of China. If a majority of the European Parliament now chooses to recognise two states after all, the debate about this must be conducted openly instead of being concealed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore their duty to contribute to its restoration. Not only in Kosovo but also in Serbia. This has now been proposed, and rightly so. In 1999 there were good grounds for suspecting that the war was not only about Kosovo. The deep loathing that the inhabitants of Kosovo had developed against Yugoslavia looked as if it would be misused as a crowbar with which to achieve a whole different set of objectives. The coercive proposals made to Milosevic before the outbreak of the war did not, oddly enough, provide for independence for Kosovo, but rather for foreign influence on the government and the economy of Serbia and Montenegro. If it is now being proposed that the European Agency for Reconstruction, which was originally intended for Kosovo, now be extended to include Serbia and Montenegro and if there are also calls for Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro to be made more dependent on one another by creating a common energy supply, this raises the question as to whether Serbia has been promised that it will get Kosovo back in exchange for adapting to and integrating into the EU. If this is the case, it will not only evoke a lot of resistance within Serbia but will in particular cause uncontrollable anger on the part of the deceived inhabitants of Kosovo. The EU is playing with fire. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
