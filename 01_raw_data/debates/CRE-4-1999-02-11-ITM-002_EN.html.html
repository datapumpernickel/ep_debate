<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lagendijk </span> <span class="bold">(V), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (NL)</span> Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the Commission on its proposal, which I feel is a successful attempt to combat the pollution that is still being caused by vessels dumping their waste at sea. The approach adopted here is, in my view and that of the Committee on the Environment, a balanced one, in that vessels are required to deliver their waste and ports are required to build facilities to deal with it. So far so good. But you will not be surprised to hear that there were also certain points where the committee wanted to improve or tighten up the proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all – and this is the most important point on which there was the most discussion, as there probably will be in future – there is the issue of payment. The Commission proposes that a substantial proportion of the costs of receiving and processing the waste should be paid by all those using the port. In my view this is rather too vague, so we have tabled an amendment to replace the word ‘substantial" by 90 % of the costs. Why? Because I think it is extremely important to prevent ships from having a financial incentive to dump their cargo or cargo residues at sea outside the port. If only a small part of the costs are shared in the port dues, then there will always be an incentive for vessels to consider dumping their waste at sea. This is why we are in favour of replacing the word ‘substantial" by at least 90 %, not because we want to have a precise figure, but because we simply want to make it clear that the processing costs are to be shared among all vessels, irrespective of whether or not they use the reception facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point on which we think the proposal could be tightened up is the monitoring of compliance. This operates on two levels. First, monitoring at ports of call. If a vessel, for some good reason, does not have the time or the opportunity to deliver its waste at a particular port, it must not be free to do likewise at the next port. It must be possible – and it is already possible – for ports to inform each other about the situation of vessels sailing to and fro between them or calling in at subsequent ports. The systems are already in place, but they need to be further developed, which is why we are calling on the Commission to support efforts to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect of monitoring concerns inspections within ports, and here too we were a little unhappy with the rather vague wording used by the Commission, which says that ‘a sufficient number of such inspections" must be carried out. Instead of this we would prefer to use a figure which the Commission itself suggested in earlier regulations, so that 25 % of all vessels must be inspected. This figure is already included in a number of regulations. The Commission has said that it may be dropped, but at the moment we do not feel that there is any reason not to go ahead with this, so as far as we are concerned the directive should contain the reference to 25 %.</p>
<p class="contents">The third change to the Commission proposal concerns fishing vessels. The Commission itself has admitted that it was a mistake that its proposal excludes all fishing vessels. We do not want to create unnecessary red tape, so we are not in favour of bringing all fishing vessels within the scope of the directive, but it seems too stupid for words that huge vessels like factory ships which generate enormous quantities of waste should be excluded from the rules. This is why we have proposed to exclude vessels under 15 metres and include vessels over 15 metres.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth improvement concerns rewarding environment‐friendly behaviour, which we feel is an important part of any environment and transport policy. We should be in favour of rewarding vessels that do their best to encourage environmentally friendly work practices on board or in dealing with waste. To do this we need to make it clearer exactly what an environment‐friendly ship is, which is why we urge the Commission to support the attempts being made to produce a more detailed definition.</p>
<p class="contents">My conclusion – and this is perhaps more of a comment on EU proposals in general – is that all too often, the Commission and sometimes Parliament too put forward proposals that are difficult to implement because they do not correspond to the situation in practice. I am convinced that the Commission proposal, with Parliament"s amendments, does correspond to the situation in practice. There are ports which already have reception facilities or are planning to build them. Vessels are prepared to deliver their waste. There are plans to produce better definitions of what environment‐friendly vessels are. It is precisely because these plans are already being made and the proposal dovetails with them that I think the Commission proposal is a necessary, useful and viable attempt to prevent the dumping of waste at sea.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Sindal </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when the British Presidency put marine pollution on the agenda, following quite a few requests from the Committee on Transport and Tourism, among others, there were many of us who said: At last! And I mean this quite sincerely. We have witnessed many accidents involving oil in European waters. We have witnessed many ships that have spilt oil in our waters. This directive imposes obligations on the ships. We are moving from a convention – an IMO convention – which was a recommendation, to legislation, whereby we oblige the vessel and its master to give an account of any oily waste that may be on board.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we shall be obliging the ports – but not necessarily all ports – to receive waste oil. In my opinion, it is essential that this directive should be made as functional as possible. It must not be difficult or bureaucratic. I hope that in the final version, the Commission and the Council find a model that makes this directive workable and attractive for the ships and the ports.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two problems. The rapporteur has touched on one of them. There are two problems that I would like to address. Of course it must be paid for. Of course it is not free of charge. I hope that these costs will not become yet another restriction on shipping. After all, the short‐sea report clearly demonstrated that port charges are one of the contributory reasons for choosing other forms of transport. So the small coaster – or the large coaster for that matter – will certainly incur a charge here, and I consider this to be a problem. If one were to regard this as infrastructure, it would be possible to make it free of charge. It is also possible to look at it from the point of view of the waste oil that is brought ashore. Surely this can actually be recycled and used. If one were to exempt it from oil taxes, VAT and so on, then it could actually finance this system. I think that we should come up with some good ideas with regard to this question of financing and present them to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Ships in transit in international waters that do not call at European ports are a different matter. After all, we do not get hold of them. I feel that we should think back to what happened with the <span class="italic">Pallas Athene</span> . Here we have a vessel which bursts into flames in international waters, drifts through Danish territorial waters and ends up on German territory, and there we all are, sitting down together and playing a kind of official ‘pick up sticks". The first ones to make a move lose the game, since it is they who pick up the bill. If we had had a monitoring system in the North Sea, we could have intervened collectively – Denmark, the United Kingdom and Germany – but we did not. We allowed the bill to be passed on to the place where the ship ended up. I therefore believe that it is also our job to get the Member States to take ships in transit into account in their deliberations on future policy. I am well aware that this is not covered by this directive.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Jarzembowski </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, let me express my thanks for the preceding remarks and extend a special welcome to my honourable colleague the Transport Commissioner. I am delighted that we have been given another rare opportunity to discuss this matter in the morning, rather than at 11 o'clock on Tuesday night.</p>
<p class="contents">But let us turn to the business in hand. I believe that the Commission has adopted an excellent approach in the directive. As a native of Hamburg, I am pleased to see that it incorporates all the results of a European international conference on the issue of port waste‐discharge facilities, which was held in Hamburg. Practice has shown us, of course, that the Marpol Convention with its discharge requirement for ships is inadequate. We must ensure that the waste on board ships is actually discharged. If we say here that the ports must provide discharge facilities and that everyone will have to pay anyway under a no‐special‐fee system, I believe that more captains will decide to use the port discharge facility, since they have paid directly for it in their harbour dues. This is a very important issue, because we have no other way of cleaning up our beaches, especially those on the North Sea and Baltic coasts. We still have a lot to do here, but the same can be said for the Mediterranean and other parts of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The approach, then, is exactly the right one. I thank Mr Lagendijk, who is a new member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, for his excellent cooperation. I believe the committee adopted the recommendation unanimously, and it is a good thing and to be applauded that all the groups in this House are pulling in the same direction on this occasion, promoting environmental protection without neglecting economic interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to deal briefly with two more points. We have tabled a number of amendments, and I hope the Commission will be able to approve them all, Mr Kinnock. At any rate, I should like to highlight two things. First of all, the Commission must be urged to ensure that the system of charges now being introduced does not distort competition between ports. It is to be expected that one port or another will try to offer a particularly attractive scale of charges or to obtain particularly large profit margins in order to secure a competitive edge in the usual conflict, so to speak, that occurs between ports over cargoes. The Commission must be watchful, and we may have to beef up the legislation. I also believe, as the rapporteur said, that we must require Member States and ports to ensure that 25 % of all ships are actually inspected every year. After all, we are familiar with the problem of inadequate control from our experience with rest periods for long‐distance lorry drivers. We had to tighten up there, because the Member States were not sticking to the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Commissioner, should not be a problem either, since we have the same figure of 25 % in the port state control directive. One and the same official may be able to carry out both types of check. We need effective control of waste discharge, for the sake of the sea and for the sake of animal and human life.</p>

<p class="contents">International rules do exist, but everyone recognizes that they are not always respected, far from it, in fact. These international rules include the MARPOL Protocol, and the proposal for a directive transposes its provisions into Community law. These include reducing dumping at sea, improving port reception facilities, stepping up monitoring in order to force vessels to hand over their waste, and establishing a system to fund these facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">On the whole, we can agree to this, but the methods of implementing these objectives are of some concern and add to those we already expressed when considering the Green Paper on ports and maritime infrastructures. I would like to mention here the principle of subsidiarity. I would point out that the Maastricht Treaty does not give any particular powers to the European Union to organise the port system and the rules for managing sea ports. It would be unfortunate if the Union tried to interfere in that management through environmental issues. We should therefore ensure that the principle of subsidiarity, to which my group is particularly committed, is not called into question through such methods.</p>
<p class="contents">With these reservations, we approve and support the proposal for a directive, as amended by the Committee on Transport and Tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to commend the excellent work carried out by the rapporteur and congratulate him on the quality of his report.</p>

The requirement that ships discharge their waste in port follows the same elementary logic. I believe that Mr Lagendijk's report makes that perfectly clear. There must be no incentive, such as the avoidance of special fees, to circumvent that requirement. There must be a 50 % inspection rate. Anything else will give rise to absurd or dangerous situations, and the system must be weighted in favour of environmentally friendly vessels.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, this report pussyfoots its way indirectly towards addressing three key points. The first is the question of a European maritime regulatory area. The United States has had one for a long time. The European Union continues to act as if it were a patchwork of small states, between which only the IMO standards apply. That is an indefensible state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is the need for control by the port state. This is an imperative of the first order, given the development of flags of convenience and dual registration.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is the primacy of ecology, since the destruction of our vital resources is certainly no basis on which to develop an economic activity.</p>

This is to be welcomed, since by unit transported, water transport is one of the cleanest modes. However, even it has disadvantages for the environment, and busy waterways regularly show evidence of pollution from ships.</p>
<p class="contents">This is just one of the consequences of discharging ships" waste, and it is easy to imagine just how much such discharges threaten the marine environment, which is seriously affected by this branch of shipping.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed directive is designed to provide a solution to these sorts of problems. This is far from easy. On the one hand, as the rapporteur said, is it important that the polluter should pay, as in other situations. On the other hand, the size of the payment must not be so great as to encourage vessels to try to get round the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the new system a substantial part of the costs are to be shared, while the remainder must be paid only in exceptional situations. This is very much in line with the principles I have described. The possibility of reducing the payment for environment‐friendly vessels is a further plus point.</p>
<p class="contents">The success or failure of this directive will depend on the extent to which it is observed and complied with. The proposed notification system and making the delivery of waste a requirement seem to be good ways of discouraging vessels from getting round the legislation. In conclusion, this report makes a positive contribution to protecting the environment and can therefore count on our support.</p>

I fully agree with what was said by Mr Jarzembowski and would merely like to clarify a few points.</p>
<p class="contents">As was mentioned, the aim of this proposal on port reception facilities for ship‐generated waste and cargo residues from ships is to reduce pollution and thus protect the environment, in particular by monitoring the legal discharge of waste and other pollutants at sea. In this case, the Commission proposal was a necessary and desirable addition to existing legislation on the protection of the marine environment and the creation of fair conditions of competition between the ports of the Community. We therefore welcome this opportunity, especially the legal requirement for ships to dispose of waste and cargo residues in ports.</p>
<p class="contents">The fee system proposed, which comes very close to a ‘no‐special‐fee" system but avoids any downward pressure, is to be welcomed in general terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal includes provisions that mean that ship‐generated waste is treated slightly differently from cargo residues. Ships are required to deliver both types of waste in ports, but under MARPOL 73/78 rules in the case of cargo residues. This means that the treatment and disposal of cargo residues are not covered by port charges but special fees could be charged for the process.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by saying that it is only natural that warships should be exempt from the provisions of the directive and, generally speaking, we support the proposal.</p>

This situation will hopefully be remedied by this directive, together with the amendments proposed by the committee, whereby the ships must – under all circumstances and regardless of the quantity of waste – pay a port fee to dispose of their waste. Like the rapporteur, we in the June Movement normally uphold the principle that the polluter pays. But we also agree with the rapporteur that in this case there is a need to depart from this principle, since a fee which corresponds to the quantity of waste would make it tempting to dump the waste at sea. Control is the cornerstone of this directive. But in order for this to become effective, the June Movement is urging that the amendments tabled by the rapporteur should receive particular support with regard to the following points: that a definition should be found for the term ‘environmentally friendly ship"; that the controls should be made more specific; that the expression ‘a substantial contribution" should likewise be made more specific, so that this becomes sufficiently large to ensure that it does not pay to dump at sea; and finally that cargo residues should be covered by the port dues.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Stenmarck </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV) </span> Mr President, it is in many contexts a major problem that waste from ships is not being managed in the proper way. The traffic through the Baltic Sea is a particular problem in this respect, not least due to the extremely sensitive nature of this particular sea. Every year huge quantities of oil are discharged directly into the Baltic. In Swedish waters alone, there are hundreds of discharges of this type every year. And it is virtually never possible to determine which vessel the oil has come from.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this situation, Sweden has a law which gives every passing vessel the opportunity to enter practically any port and dispose of its surplus oil there. Of course, such a system has both advantages and disadvantages. Naturally, a huge plus point is that this means that nobody will need to dump oily waste directly into the sea for purely economic reasons. At the same time, however, a system like this costs a great deal of money – above all when there are only a few countries that apply the system.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this situation, it is a natural and obvious development to implement the same type of measures in a European context and also, in my view, to make the same demands of all the EU's applicant countries. This would mean that, within the near future, practically all the countries situated around the Baltic would be subject to the same conditions with regard to the reception of such substances as oily waste.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, let me put a question to the Commissioner responsible: what steps is he prepared to take in order to include the EU's various applicant countries in today's decision?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Kinnock, Neil, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission</span>. – Mr President, I wish to begin by welcoming Mr Lagendijk's report, not only because it supports the Commission's efforts to ensure a major reduction in marine pollution, but also because it is his first as a member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism – I congratulate him on that. It is an accomplished piece of work, if I may say so, and in return for the support and the quality of the work, I am very happy to say that the Commission can endorse many of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically, the Commission can accept at least the underlying principles of Amendments Nos 1, 3 4, 5, 12, 16, 17 and 18 (England 0, France 2 – I thought I might get that in). There is, however, another set of amendments which the Commission must reject, mainly on the grounds that it feels that the concerns expressed have already been dealt with in other parts of the existing text. I am sure that, on further examination, the honourable Members will understand and, I hope, accept that point. I refer specifically to Amendments Nos 6, 10, 14 and 15. That leaves just 6 out of 18 amendments where there is a more substantial degree of disagreement with Parliament and I must say that, even in those cases, the divergence is not fundamental.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 2 and 7 propose to extend the obligation to notify the onboard waste situation in writing to fishing vessels over 15 metres. Mr Lagendijk referred specifically to this in the course of his speech earlier on. The Commission's concern is that this could easily lead to an excessively bureaucratic system <span class="italic">without bringing</span> any substantial benefit to the environment. We should bear in mind, of course, that fishing vessels are not excluded from the requirement to deliver their waste in ports and to contribute to the cost of facilities. They are <span class="italic">only exempted</span> – I emphasise this – from the obligation to make a written notification before each port call. The reason for that is simply that most fishing vessels, obviously, have one or more standard ports where they normally land their catches. The prior notification proposal exists in order to allow the port to make the necessary arrangements for receiving waste from ships. In the case of fishing vessels, the port will generally be very familiar with the needs of the vessels, even without a written notification.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that the length limit of 15 metres, like any other limit, is bound to be somewhat arbitrary and therefore difficult to justify. For those reasons – we hope that the House will accept practical reasons – we cannot accept Amendment No 13 either. Having said that, however, I share Parliament's concern that if very big fish factory vessels were to be excluded from the statutory obligation, that would be very retrograde. I should like to reassure the House that those vessels <span class="italic">are </span> definitely subject to the notification and control obligations, since fish factory ships, which are not engaged in catching fish, are not considered to be fishing vessels under the terms of this proposed directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The most controversial amendment, as indeed Mr Lagendijk said, is probably No 8 on the charging system for the delivery of ship‐generated waste. Here the objectives of Parliament and the Commission are absolutely the same: all of us want to achieve a charging system in which ships are not given incentives to discharge waste at sea. However, we differ about methods of securing that objective. The Commission's proposal seeks to strike a balance between the need to make the best possible progress in encouraging waste delivery to ports and the plain political reality of taking into account the very different views of Member States on this issue. The end result of both Parliament's and the Commission's approach is that fees cannot only be based on actual delivery. Neither of us thinks that ships which do not deliver waste should be free from the fees associated with waste management. Our divergence, therefore, arises only from the fact that the Commission's proposal preserves a greater flexibility for the Member States in deciding the extent to which the so‐called no‐special‐fee system will be applied.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we should bear in mind that ports, marinas and fishing ports in Member States are obviously very different, not just between but also within Member States. As I said, however, the fundamental objective of sharing the cost between users and non‐users is crucial if we want to encourage the delivery in ports of waste and reduce and, indeed, prevent the pollution of the sea.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 9 is unacceptable because the Commission can adequately deal with competition matters under the powers it already has under the Treaty. The proposed amendment would have the effect of reducing those necessary powers merely to the possibility of making a proposal, and that, clearly, would not be in order. Again, I hope, on reflection, that amendment may be withdrawn.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we cannot accept Amendment No 11, which relates to the number of spot‐check inspections to be carried out for control purposes. The Commission considers that a certain flexibility is needed, partly because of the potential future inclusion of the waste control regime in the existing port state control directive, which obviously would have exactly the effect anticipated correctly by Mr Jarzembowski. Our feelings arise partly from the fact that the main elements for enhancing compliance with this directive are not only set down in the control part of the directive. The Commission, therefore, considers that a slightly less systematic spot‐check system is adequate for the purposes of the directive and achieving the purposes of combating the pollution of the sea, at least as far as checks outside the port state control regime are concerned. Clearly, as Mr Jarzembowski said and as other Members have noted, in the course of the normal port state control check, it would be extraordinary if the inspector taking his 25 % quota, as it were, were not to pay attention to the waste‐disposal situation on board the craft. One could readily anticipate that will be undertaken – it is a relatively simple check.</p>
<p class="contents">One or two questions were raised by the honourable Members, to which I should like specifically to respond very briefly. Mr Sindal raised the question of wrecks in international waters. We recall in this House that he has fastidiously pursued the questions raised by the disastrous wreck of the <span class="italic">Pallas</span> in international waters. Currently, as the House and Mr Sindal know, just vessels are the responsibility of the flag state but we are all aware of the deficiencies of that system, and coastal states may get involved in order to protect their own environment. Clearly there is something to be desired in respect of using those powers as well. The House may be glad to know that the Commission is supporting discussions in the International Maritime Organisation about placing the mandatory responsibility for safeguarding against pollution and other effects of wrecks on the vessel owner. In my view, that could be a very real breakthrough in our efforts to achieve quality shipping in all waters, particularly in European waters. I hope that progress can be achieved without great delay in the IMO. Naturally we would prefer the standards to be global, if that is at all possible, and then followed up with a legal regime in our own maritime area. I hope we can embark upon that without great delay when the discussions are completed in the IMO.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, Mr Sindal also asked about VAT on waste disposal fees. That is a crucial question which is probably why discussions on the matter are still continuing. However, in the course of the further development of this legislation, I will be in a position to give a more specific response.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Jarzembowski's point, which is well taken, that it is essential that the fees levied do not result in the distortion of competition between ports, because their rivalry is, to say the least, very interesting. After I retire I propose to write a novel about this to do them real justice – maybe a fairy tale, who knows! There will be differences in the level of the charges which arise mainly because of the relative efficiency or inefficiency of the system. If a port, because of its efficiency in handling waste disposal, is able to charge smaller fees, well the very best of luck to that port. What we are then seeing is effective competition and not a distortion of competition, as I am sure Mr Jarzembowski will agree.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude by expressing my gratitude to the Committee on Transport and Tourism and specifically to the rapporteur, Mr Lagendijk, for the expeditious work and the excellent report on this detailed and important proposal.</p>
