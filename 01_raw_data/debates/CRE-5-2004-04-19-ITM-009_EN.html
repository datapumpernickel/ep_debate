There continue to be very significant national barriers in the form of different national regulations, national legislation and national supervision; even today, these make it difficult to create a single internal market for bulk payments, which would ultimately benefit the citizen. We took the first steps in this direction some time ago with cross-border transfer fees. That, too, required an initiative at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">We also support, for example, the introduction of a single direct debit system, which has not so far been possible. Imagine, it is now possible for a citizen to travel to another state, but he still cannot have payments debited at home, but he has to choose a national bank to do it.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is, how do we achieve this objective? I am a strong advocate of the approach of incremental legislation in line with the principle of subsidiarity, with self-regulation in first place, that is self-regulation by the banks. We have the European Payments Council – which can, should, and indeed must set the parameters for the creation of the technical interfaces for cross-border activity, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, also with subsidiarity in mind, I would prefer the next steps to be taken in directives and only enact in regulations what is really necessary to do uniformly. I would also like to sound a warning to the industry here, since it is itself always talking about self-regulation: these requirements will also have to be complied with and corresponding standards created without undue delay.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumer protection presents a greater problem in this Commission document. It contains some ideas which in my view go far beyond our objective, and I have the impression that there are some people in the Commission – let me make clear that I do not mean you, Commissioner Bolkestein – who have lost sight of the idea of citizens taking responsibility for themselves. They suggest that the bank should in future be liable for a basic transaction. For example, if customers buy something over the Internet and the purchase is void, they want their money back, and if they cannot turn to the supplier, they should be able to turn to the bank, which had nothing to do with the basic transaction. I am sure things like that can be settled by the market – and you are an advocate of the market, after all – by having products that provide safeguards; a fundamental liability of the banks in such cases should be rejected, however, as should the proposal that cardholder’s liability be limited to EUR 150 when the card is lost, regardless of how they have behaved. If they go away on holiday, discover on setting out that they have lost their card, and report it three weeks later, the cardholder’s liability will still be limited to EUR 150. I think we should give a little more protection to people who act responsibly than to those who act irresponsibly.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, however, pleased to welcome the fact that the Commission has taken up the idea of establishing a single EU-wide telephone number that can be called if a card is lost – a short number that is easy to remember and that the citizens can dial quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress that the creation of a single payment area should not result in national structures that are working well and efficiently being made less economic. We must not go about it in a way that is detrimental to operational national systems. Coming back to consumer protection, however, may I appeal to you, Mr Bolkestein, in the ongoing discussions within the Commission, to speak up for mature and responsible citizens and see that responsibility is left with them. The Lisbon objectives of becoming the most innovative and fastest-growing region in the world are held up to us repeatedly. Everyone is brandishing the slogan ‘less bureaucracy’. Mr Bolkestein, the text we have before us should be judged by whether it creates more bureaucracy or makes life easier for banks and citizens in the single European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An efficient and secure payment system is an essential complement to the free movement of goods and services in the European Union. Let me give you one figure to illustrate this. Every EU citizen carries out, on average, 138 non-cash payment transactions each year. An efficient system must be based on a robust and dynamic regulatory framework that ensures competition, consumer protection and safety in payment transactions. Pan-European trade needs an effective underlying payment system if it is to expand.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation on cross-border payments adopted in 2001 has made it easier and cheaper to perform many types of payments in euro within the internal market. However, we are not yet where we want to be and need to be. Significant obstacles remain, as are highlighted in our communication. To deliver an improved regulatory environment for payments, remaining legal and technical barriers to intra-EU payments should be identified and removed. In other words, the whole internal market ought to be transformed into one efficient domestic payment area. That is our main purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">EU legislation in this field is necessary. But for certain issues, self- or co-regulation could be the best approach. That also satisfies Mr Radwan's desire for more subsidiarity. As always, the solution should be proportionate to the problem it is intended to solve.</p>
<p class="contents">The four guiding principles for the Commission’s future regulatory proposal should be as follows. Firstly, to modernise the existing EU legislation on payments. Secondly, to inject more competition into this market for the ultimate benefit of our citizens. The basic idea is that the provision of payment services should be open to all appropriate providers, but without sacrificing consumer protection. We must therefore design an appropriate supervisory framework matching all types of payment service providers. The guiding principle here must be: 'same business, same risks, same rules'.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we need to develop a trustworthy pan-European payment area in which consumers feel that they have the same protection, no matter where they are and what kind of payment instrument they use. A single and balanced set of rules should be defined on parties' rights and obligations regarding, for example, misuse of a payment instrument and revocability of payment orders.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we need to incorporate the relevant Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, special recommendations into EU legislation to combat the financing of criminal activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me stress that given their decisive contribution to the competitiveness of our economy, payments are high on the Commission’s agenda. We shall need the strong support of this Parliament, and in this respect I am encouraged by the terms of the resolution which has been put forward by Mr Radwan. I welcome all amendments submitted by Members of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall wind up by thanking Mr Radwan for the report which he has submitted and I assure him that, just as he wishes to have less bureaucracy, that is precisely what this Commissioner and the Commission as a whole also want. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has now, in the current legislature, become the currency of twelve countries of the European Union. The creation of the single currency does not, however, automatically mean that there is a single payment area, in which the same rules apply across the board. This is one of the major tasks facing the European Union in the next legislature.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission waited until the last possible moment for the banking system to establish self-regulation following the creation of the single currency. After the Euro’s inception in 1999, however, two markets were established for the purposes of payments – a national market and an international market. There was no internal market governed by domestic rules regulating payments in the new currency, which, although a single currency, functioned as a foreign currency, subject to commission and other foreign exchange charges.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation was partially solved by Regulation No 2560 of December 2001 concerning electronic transfers and payments. Since then, self-regulation still does not appear to have worked; the directives have not worked either, as they must be transposed into the law of each country, and this has not been carried out at the same time or in the same manner. This is an area that requires rigorous rules to be applied simultaneously and uniformly throughout the internal market. It is therefore my opinion that only by establishing regulations can we give the citizens and companies the security that a payment system requires. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Herzog (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, it is a pity that the debates on consumer credit and on the single payment area were not combined, because the same issue is at stake in both of them: do we want to construct a European market in retail financial services? Up to now, priority has been given to the wholesale market and to investment services. During this legislative period, the only initiative of any note – though it is an important one – has been the one on the rules for setting rates for cross-border payment transactions within the euro zone.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate is, therefore, important and I believe that we must now set a clear political objective. That, I believe, is what the Commission wants. The euro cannot be a complete success unless we construct the euro zone as an internal area for payment methods. In order to do that, it is vital that we should achieve interbanking in the infrastructure. The activity of supplying payment services presupposes, admittedly, the removal of national obstacles, but at the same time it also requires prudential supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">It is on that basis that the internal retail banking market, and in particular the consumer credit market, will be able to develop, and that in turn will allow European banking operators to emerge. Of course, within that integrated area it will be necessary to take into account the diversity of the operators involved, and in particular the special nature of savings banks and mutual societies.</p>
<p class="contents">What, though, is the best way to proceed? The application of the ‘country of origin’ rule with minimum harmonisation seems to us to be negative, both as regards consumer protection and from the point of view of fair competition. Mr Radwan’s report, which leans in that direction, gives far too much preference to self-regulation. On the other hand, however, maximum harmonisation would leave no room for diversity and would, therefore, also cause a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I believe that the best solution is to agree on the common principles of general interest, the common concepts, particularly with regard to universal access to payment methods with a high level of security, services which are inexpensive but in which there is great confidence. The rules governing cross-border transactions must be precise, and intense cooperation is necessary between national regulators.</p>
<p class="contents">With that in mind, there are several points in Mr Radwan’s report which in my opinion require adjustment. Thus in paragraph 17 the rule recommended by the Commission should be reinstated, that is, the rule restricting customers’ liability to EUR 150 in the event of unauthorised transactions where they have not given notification. As for pan-European direct debit, account-holders must be able to refuse a payment before it is debited from their account.
