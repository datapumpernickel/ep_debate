<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fraga Estevez (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I am speaking in order to present, and ask your support for, a new Fisheries protocol, this time with Madagascar – as you have said – with whom we have had relations since 1986.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of what has come to be called cost/benefit, it is an excellent protocol which clearly demonstrates the viability of this type of agreement for the European Union. In this case, the Community fleet, industry and market are ensured a stable supply of a raw material, tuna, of which we have a considerable deficit, by means of our own fleet, which means that many Community jobs will be retained, not only in the extractive sector, but also in the activities dependent on it. Furthermore, the protocol once again demonstrates that, in the Southern agreements, a high proportion of the fishing opportunities are utilised, in this case reaching 91% for tuna seiners.</p>
<p class="contents">It is just as viable for Madagascar, which in addition to the EUR 308 000 in annual financial compensation, will receive a further EUR 517 000 for development aid actions, mainly aimed at improving the fishing control of the area and the training of its fishermen. Furthermore, the number of Malagasy seamen which must be employed rises from 6 in the protocol currently in force to 40 in the protocol under discussion. This is therefore a genuinely significant quantitative leap.</p>
<p class="contents">Community fishing activity in itself does not interfere with small-scale fleets, since our fleet does not have access to the twelve mile zone. Meanwhile, the presence of the European Union in itself makes a significant contribution to the control and guarantee of greater sustainability of the resource. We must not forget that the fleet carries with it all the control regulations of Community policy, which is a very important element in terms of ascertaining the details of catches and the state of the resource in the region, to a degree which cannot be matched by all the other diverse foreign fleets that fish in those same Malagasy waters.</p>
<p class="contents">Following this brief summary of the content of the protocol, and reminding you that, as a Southern agreement, the shipowners contribute to its funding, I would like to focus on two issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw your attention firstly to the fact that with this agreement, as in Southern agreements in general, there remains the possibility of granting licences to those interested Member States that would not have access to the fishing opportunities on the basis of relative stability, as demonstrated by the presence of Italy and Portugal. It is therefore time to ask the Commission once and for all to implement the views of the 1997 Council of Fisheries Ministers, which clearly request that fishing opportunities which remain unused may be used by interested Member State fleets in all agreements of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I do not believe it necessary to point out that we are all committed to the development of third countries, as clearly demonstrated by the Lannoye report, which preceded the debate on fisheries. The fisheries sector has been one of the first to cooperate in this development, since its presence in the waters of third countries has been the catalyst for many of the first industrial centres in their coastal regions, if not the definitive element in terms of many nations now having taken on the genuine vocation of a fishing State.</p>
<p class="contents">But, having said that, I believe things are reaching the point where clarification is necessary from several points of view. To begin with, we must not forget, as the aforementioned Council of Fisheries Ministers also made clear, that fisheries agreements are essentially of a commercial nature. However, they are increasingly becoming a complement to Community development aid policy. In the case of this agreement, the proportion intended for development cooperation actions is now rising to 62.6% of the total cost of the agreement to the Community budget.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation raises many questions. Firstly, there is no reason why fisheries budgets should be financing the development policy budgets and, from the point of view of budgetary transparency, this state of affairs should be clarified as soon as possible. Secondly, this situation should also be clarified in order to silence those voices which complain about the high budgetary cost of the fisheries agreements, when in reality, as we have seen, considerably more than half of that budget is pure development policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to pay tribute to the excellent work carried out by Mrs Fraga Estéves, the rapporteur. As a Member from Réunion, I am naturally interested in the conclusion of this seventh fisheries agreement between the EU and Madagascar, given its implications for fishing in the Indian Ocean and, obviously, off Réunion too.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start by pointing out that there is an enormous paradox between the restrictions imposed by the establishment of a European common fisheries policy and the precautionary principle the European Union advocates. In fact, at the same time that the Commission was refusing to countenance any increase in the rate of public aid for longliners in Réunion on the grounds that this resource could be at risk in this part of the Indian Ocean, it was also saying that this same resource was abundant enough to allow for an increase in catches under its fisheries agreements with third countries. For those of us who come from Réunion, this is rather difficult to understand, as, moreover, I explained, in Réunion, to some of our MEPs in the Committee on Fisheries, pointing out that the fishing resources of this sector are young, specific and over-abundant, with the result that the catch quota criteria imposed by the common fisheries policy are inappropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur refers to the increased fishing opportunities given under the agreement between the EU and Madagascar, which will make it easier for fishermen from Réunion to acquire additional fishing rights in Malagasy territorial waters. We would be allowing them to increase their catch quota, which, at present, accounts for only 0.12% of the total EU catch in this zone.</p>
<p class="contents">The fisheries agreements are the EU's main instrument for contributing to the development of the fishing industry in third countries. A large part of the total financial contribution is allocated to this under the agreement with Madagascar. Since it is quite familiar with the real situation in Madagascar, Réunion is prepared to offer its experience and to take part in co-development projects, based, in particular, on the creation of joint enterprises with Madagascar and the development of aquaculture. In fact, some projects of this kind have already been conducted and simply need reinforcing.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I do hope the European Union will adopt a strict policy with regard to poaching in the Indian Ocean. Madagascar has recently signed bilateral agreements with Japan, Taiwan and Korea, the terms of which are not always entirely clear. I therefore feel it is crucial for the European Union to keep a very close watch specifically over the implementation of the special surveillance and monitoring measures aimed at restricting poaching activities in this zone and thus to ensure that the signing of the fisheries agreement with Madagascar is genuinely and indisputably valid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also support the excellent report by Mrs Fraga Estevez , and we ask the Council to incorporate the amendments approved by the Committee on Fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">On many occasions we have complained, always justifiably, about the lack of coherence of the Commission and the Council, which sometimes verges on the arbitrary, in relation to the negotiation and signing of fisheries agreements. It is the sector itself which suffers from this lack of direction, and it does not feel that it is supported by the Commission. The Commission sometimes gives the impression that it wants to forget the conclusions of the Luxembourg Council of October 1997 on the policy of fisheries agreements with third countries, which explicitly recognised the socio-economic advantages of those agreements for the Community, both in terms of the supply of raw materials and employment, and which are – and will continue to be – an essential element of the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the concern mentioned by the rapporteur in her report relating to the fact that more than 62% of the cost of the agreement corresponds to development cooperation actions and has nothing to do with financial compensation for the agreed catches. We are in favour of development cooperation and budgetary transparency. These actions must therefore be financed by the European Development Fund which, to date, has financed the development of the fishing sectors of the developing countries to the not inconsiderable tune of EUR 421 million.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement, like all fisheries agreements with third countries, is aimed at a specific form of fishing – in this case, tuna – clearly outside the 6-12 mile zone, and includes absolutely limited and measured annual fishing opportunities for an also limited and measured number of ships – 80.</p>
<p class="contents">The shipowners pay an amount per tonne – EUR 25 – which, as the rapporteur has pointed out, is something that only happens in the Southern agreements. The shipowners are obliged, furthermore, to employ a significant number of Malagasy seamen, which is rising from 6 to 40, as has also been pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate Mrs Fraga Estevez once again on her excellent report which clearly demonstrates that, of the fisheries agreements signed by the developing countries with third countries, it is those which they sign with the European Union which achieve and guarantee a greater degree of transparency and control of fishing activities in those areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Just as I said earlier in connection with Mr Gallagher’s report, those of us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party are concerned that, in line with developments, we allow the self-funding sector, that is to say the ship owners and fishermen, to pay a larger contribution towards those agreements from which they of course benefit most. The fisheries agreement with Madagascar is valuable not only for the Community but also for Madagascar. The high degree to which the Community’s fishing opportunities are exploited is impressive and worth emphasising. I should like to support Mrs Fraga Estevez in saying that, in the funding of the fisheries agreements, a sharp and clear distinction should be made between the portion used to fund fishing opportunities and the portion used to fund development measures which, in the EU’s budget, should appear as development aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreements are exceedingly important to those regions of Europe in which fishing is the most important activity, and we are concerned here not merely with the work of the fishermen but also with associated businesses on land. It is the EU’s responsibility to ensure that, when we conclude agreements, it is surplus resources with which we are concerned. Matters must be arranged in such a way that local fishermen are provided with development opportunities, and that means that the EU must secure the concept of sustainability. This agreement, like the one with Senegal, is important to the Community, partly of course in the light of the fact that the fisheries agreement with Morocco was not renewed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am also pleased that you are able to adopt the draft. The new Protocol refers exclusively to tuna and offers fishing opportunities for 80 vessels. The financial contribution totals EUR 825 000. I would like to emphasise that over 60% of this amount is allocated to specific measures and thus benefits the local fisheries sector. These resources benefit, above all, monitoring and supervision, but also research and non-industrial fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, this is the first time this Parliament has dealt with an agreement with an ACP state, providing for the satellite-based surveillance of all Community ships operating within the scope of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Amendments Nos 1 and 3, I draw your attention to the interinstitutional agreements in force and most especially to the 5 July 2000 Framework Agreement between Parliament and the Commission. In the context of this Agreement, we are complying with the demands of these amendments, which are therefore not necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot support Amendment No 2, as negotiations on a protocol to a fisheries agreement do not require their own new mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">What I have already said about Senegal applies correspondingly to Amendment No 4. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.</p>
<p class="contents">The self-discipline of the speakers who, in contrast to their usual practice, have not wholly exhausted their speaking time, means that we have now closed the debate earlier than originally planned. Commissioners, too, Mr Fischler, usually require more time than you, with your characteristically Austrian succinctness, have done today. I ask for your understanding that we must now suspend the sitting. We cannot bring the vote forward, as it is fixed in the agenda for 6.30 p.m.. I shall suspend the sitting until 6.30 p.m. and request you to reassemble punctually.</p>
