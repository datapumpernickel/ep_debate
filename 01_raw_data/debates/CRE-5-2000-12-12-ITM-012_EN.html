<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Theato (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, in its communication the Commission writes that the protection of the Communities' financial interests concerns us all, the bodies and their members at political level, the European and the national public service and their staff. But the need to guarantee equal, effective and deterrent protection throughout the European Union particularly affects the chief contributor, namely the European taxpayer. That is whom we represent here and to whom we are accountable. So I welcome the fact that the Commission document presents an overall strategy showing how it proposes to tackle the misuse of EU funds.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I think the proposed period of five years, 2001 to 2005, is too long, for if we look back we will see that the issue of fighting fraud has been on the table for a long time now. A constantly growing budget has, unfortunately, also led to more irregularities and fraud. The single market has also opened the borders to fraudsters, while they remain closed for investigation and criminal prosecution. It is true that the regulations for the protection of the Communities' financial interests and on-the-spot checks were adopted, UCLAF was set up and then, one and a half years ago, OLAF was created, and articles on fighting fraud were enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty and then in the Treaty of Amsterdam. These were all good measures, but they are not enough. The fraudsters are still one step ahead of us if not more. The enlargement of the Community and the introduction of the euro could bring further risks with them.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we must bring together police, administrative and criminal law resources and instruments, both between the Member States and with the EU. The Commission's four guidelines set out approaches that I find very welcome. First, an anti-fraud legislative policy. Here we must apply Article 280 of the Treaty of Amsterdam as the legal basis and develop it further, in order to bring the different national legislations under a common denominator and accordingly standardise penalties and procedures. The Commission intended to submit a document on this at the end of November. I have not received it so far. But above all, the legislation must be clearer, to prevent law-breakers from exploiting any loopholes.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a new culture of operational cooperation. It is important that all the Member States pull together. After all, more than 80% of the fraud in EU monies is carried out in these states. So far it has not been the case that they have joined forces, because otherwise they would all have ratified and therefore enforced the 1995 convention long since. Meanwhile parts of it have become out-dated and the Nice summit has not improved matters either. But the Commission also wants to create a new internal culture, as President Prodi promised. It is to be implemented through internal reform. We are keeping a watchful eye on this process.</p>
<p class="contents">The third guideline is a supra-institutional approach to preventing and fighting corruption. What is at stake here is the credibility of the European bodies. That is a most important point, and here we must emphasise the importance of setting up OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, which is not so very new any more, and of its activities. We must finally remove the obstacles that prevent it from acting independently, especially with regard to recruiting staff and to its own structure. That is equally necessary for the Office and for the Commission. We propose appointing a hearing officer to give some protection to the rights of the accused. We call on the EIB and the ECB finally to accede to the Interinstitutional Agreement relating to OLAF.</p>
<p class="contents">The system for fighting fraud must finally be perfected by enhancing the penal judicial dimension. We support the Commission's proposal to appoint a European Public Prosecutor as a first step towards creating a European judicial authority, given that this is something Parliament has long been calling for. This Public Prosecutor, assisted by Deputy Public Prosecutors in each Member State and supplemented by a judge in investigative procedures, in accordance with the 'Corpus Juris' expert report, would satisfy the principle of legal certainty and subsidiarity by acting as a kind of investigative and coordination office, without encroaching on the powers of the competent national courts. His remit must be limited strictly to the protection of financial interests; the rules and mechanisms governing his operation can then be regulated by reference to secondary legislation in the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that there are still many reservations about this. They need to be allayed, because it is only through constitutional and uniform regulations and measures, which the Nice summit did not, alas, produce, that we can tackle these kinds of crimes. I thank the Commission for its efforts and its work ...</p>

The same applies to the European Union. That is why we and the other EU bodies agree that we must give priority to protecting the Community’s financial interests. However, we are of different minds on the question of how and by what means we can guarantee this protection. If we are to fight fraud efficiently, we must bring together all police, administrative and criminal law resources, for this is a matter of the European taxpayers' money and indeed of far more than that. It is a matter of trusting in the care taken by the European institutions, and above all of trusting the way the Commission handles the monies entrusted to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed we know this trust may be failing somewhat in view of the sum the Commission itself named in its 1999 report on fighting fraud, namely a loss of some EUR 850 million as a result of fraud and irregularities. So the Commission must carry out internal reforms so as to finally make good its announcement that fraud will no longer be tolerated and that it will consistently follow up all cases of fraud. OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, must operate alongside it. The report before us rightly devotes most space to that institution. The conclusion of the OLAF Supervisory Committee of 5 December makes it strikingly clear that OLAF is still far from being independent or functioning properly. It says that the obstacles the Commission sets in the way of recruiting OLAF staff can under certain circumstances constitute an irreversible risk to the fight against fraud. I expressly call on the Commission to refrain from any interference in OLAF's activities. Finally, I am in favour of appointing a European Public Prosecutor, so that those responsible for fraud face criminal prosecution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Nice Summit brought no progress in the protection of the Union's financial interests either. It is now crucial for the Commission very rapidly to put forward resolute and imaginative proposals so that we can move ahead within the existing legal framework. Mrs Theato's excellent report points to a number of options. It once again confirms the proposal set out in the report by the five independent experts on the reform of the Commission, namely that it is possible to set up a European Public Prosecutor's Office on the basis of the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">As early as May, this Parliament called on the Commission to present proposals for a first stage, during which the European Public Prosecutor would be responsible only for offences and crimes committed by members and officials of the EU institutions against the financial interests of the Union. Its task would be to direct the relevant OLAF investigations and to make it easier for the competent national courts to prosecute these crimes. I am sure, Commissioner, that once this first step is taken, the discussion about the European Public Prosecutor's Office will no longer seem like a religious war between those for and those against, which has blocked all progress so far. And the Commission has this chance to take a first step, especially after Nice. Mrs Schreyer, you have our full support if you take this first step.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous speakers have already had quite a lot to say on the question of OLAF. The Supervisory Committee's latest and very serious opinion on recruitment has also been quoted.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Schreyer, you have repeatedly emphasised to this House that as the Commissioner responsible for fighting fraud you see it as your special task to guarantee OLAF's independence. Please tell us whether you do or do not support Mr Brüner on this crucial issue. We know that the Commission discussed this question at its last meeting, without coming to a decision. Do tell us what you think will happen now on and how we can get out of this impasse! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this context I would therefore also like to thank the rapporteur for her persistence in entering this item on the agenda again and again, for her persistence in repeatedly calling for a European financial Public Prosecutor. I think precisely that should be the end result, of Nice too. We must continue to work towards it with perseverance. We can see that there are major deadlocks in the Council, that some Member States have made no progress since 1995, that there are still deadlocks. However, we also see, and that is something I really welcome, that the current Commission has taken up this issue and endeavoured to draft a document for Nice, and that it is working on this issue together with Parliament. I believe that is an opportunity for us in this situation, because Parliament and the Commission can achieve something jointly. And the only way to break the Member States' resistance is by working jointly. Above all, we must seek to create openness.</p>
<p class="contents">We held a hearing a short while ago. I believe we should continue with this. We also have to convince the members of the national parliaments, because that is the only way we can go on working and make progress. We urgently need a step in this direction, in order to persuade our electors, and especially our taxpayers, that the fight against fraud really is taken seriously at European level too and that we shall seek to ensure that the same criteria apply at European as at national level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we are nonetheless to vote against this report, it is because we do not believe in the effectiveness of the resources proposed by the report for combating fraud and crime. Despite our having every possible sympathy for the rapporteur, Mrs Theato, and for her sterling efforts, we are opposed to establishing an independent European prosecution authority because it is a staging post towards the federal Europe we oppose.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the very establishment of a form of economic administration at EU level that creates the problems, because those models for redistributing EU taxpayers’ money which have been established by the so-called ‘Community’ are poorly designed and in many cases quite unwished for. The less money there is in the EU’s coffers, the less fraud there is. In her speech at the meeting last month of the justice ministers of Germany’s constituent States, Mrs Theato expressly said that the open frontiers facilitate criminal activities. I agree. The Schengen Agreement is a catastrophe for probity, but who has created Schengen? The EU has done so. We do not believe that more solutions at Community level can improve the fight against crime because the efforts will be characterised by just as much indifference, slovenliness and secrecy as the EU’s administration in general. We can clearly see from the treatment of recent years’ auditors’ reports that powerful forces here in Parliament too are busier preventing the clearing up of fraud than in prosecuting the people responsible. We welcome negotiations between the Member States concerning uniform legislation in the area of crime, but we shall not submit our countries to a federal EU prosecution authority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Anything that is good derives from the Committee on Budgetary Control and all that is bad comes from elsewhere; this is why the report is full of references to the previous resolution. As we said three months ago, you would think that the whole world were under the rule of the Committee on Budgetary Control alone.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we will vote against the report for two reasons: firstly because there used to be UCLAF, and you would have thought that UCLAF were an avenging angel come down to earth. UCLAF could do not wrong and we forced a Commission to resign on the basis of UCLAF's inquiries. Now – for some strange reason – the former UCLAF officials are no longer in favour and we have to banish them and give an OLAF director the power to decide the life or death of these hard-working officials; upon the decree of the Committee on Budgetary Control, these officials have to leave OLAF, being originally from UCLAF and UCLAF was all that is wonderful for some people, to the extent that we forced the Commission to resign.</p>
<p class="contents">The other reason why we will vote against the motion is because, with regard to the request to establish the post of European Public Prosecutor, it is not enough to have included a reference to the <span class="italic">juge des libertés</span> but we must ensure, once and for all, that there is a system of guarantees: indeed a Prosecutor alone with no system of guarantees is a step not towards democracy but towards an inquisition-like system which is likely to be dangerous, so much so that the proposal was not adopted at Nice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would very much like to congratulate the rapporteur – someone I like and admire as a person and politician – on this report, but unfortunately I cannot. Had it not been for the amendments concerning OLAF being adopted at the committee stage, I would have struggled to find any part of this report to support. Fortunately this idea found very little support at Nice last weekend. The Council – as pointed out so eloquently by Mrs Rühle earlier – does not like this idea either.</p>
<p class="contents">My personal view is that the European Public Prosecutor is just the first step along the road to <span class="italic">corpus juris</span>, a body of common law across the continent. Indeed I believe that is what the Commissioner feels too. Perhaps, Commissioner, you would be so kind as to let me know whether that is the case – whether this is the first step to something that would be a common body of law across the continent. I thought I heard you say something similar to that in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to know why the Commission's paper on this subject had its release delayed until the day after the Danish referendum on the euro. Perhaps the Commission knows that whilst this proposal has some support in the political classes of Europe, its support stretches no further than that.</p>
<p class="contents">Often in argument for a European Public Prosecutor, you hear that these proposals are only to protect the Community's financial interests – something that everybody should agree with. Interestingly though, they are often sold as being a small step – there is not much behind them. So why all the concern? Well, for those of us who are still wading through the Court of Auditors' report, we will find that one definition of fraud against the Community is the black market – paying for goods <span class="italic">à la belge</span>, as they say in Brussels. This is fraud against the Community because the EU takes a small percentage of all VAT transactions. So another question springs to mind: if the European Public Prosecutor is allowed to investigate every VAT transaction across Europe, how big will that office be?</p>
<p class="contents">There are so many other questions – the relationship with OLAF, who appoints the European public prosecutor, who they report to and how it affects the Member States – that I am afraid I am urging the British Conservatives and others to vote against this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to congratulate Mrs Theato on her report and in particular for making the effort to come here as I know she is not feeling very well tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">The report deals with the protection of the Community's financial interests and how we deal with that and these are the major questions. It is always the area where we see hugely inflamed headlines in the papers and we need to tackle these issues seriously otherwise we are going to continue with a largely Eurosceptic public like the people represented by Mr Heaton-Harris.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget that 85% of the money is spent within the Member States and we must also not forget that Parliament’s and the Commission's role is to take a pan-European approach to these things. We must also remember that fraud also concerns money that is not collected, something that happens very often. We lose serious amounts of money because it is not collected by the Member States. It is interesting that several countries, however much they protest about fraud, still have not signed up to the Convention on the Protection of the Communities' Financial Interests. I put an amendment down to name these countries because it is about time they were named and shamed. We need to bring these countries out into the open to reveal their hypocrisy.</p>
<p class="contents">It was quite interesting to hear what Mr Prodi said today because he sounded quite enthusiastic about the European public prosecutor which is quite a shift from what we have seen in the past. I must emphasise, from the point of view of the political group, the amendment that was tabled by Mr Bösch was critical of the report because it talked about concentrating on the institutions of the European Union, the public prosecutor being relevant only in that sense. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against fraud detrimental to the European Union is a high priority of the Commission's activities and is an important aim for the reform of the Commission's overall financial management. Today we are debating Mrs Theato's report on the Commission's report on its strategy for fighting fraud. The Commission presented its report in June this year and I welcome the fact that we can debate the reports as early as today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission takes an overall approach in its strategy for protecting the Communities' financial interests and fighting fraud; overall means that it involves all levels of activity and also all the players, all the players in the European Union institutions as also in the Member States as also in the candidate states or third countries that are responsible for dealing with European money.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy is built around four main lines of action: an anti-fraud legislative policy, operational cooperation between the relevant authorities, an interinstitutional approach to combat fraud in office and enhancement of the penal judicial dimension. Since time is short I will present the individual points briefly. The first strategic line of action consisting of comprehensive legislation to combat fraud includes legal provisions to prevent, detect and prosecute cases of fraud. For if a policy to protect the Communities' financial interests is to be effective, it must be based on clear and easily applicable legal rules that contain provisions on efficient financial management.</p>
<p class="contents">The second line of action relates to operational cooperation with the Member States and the candidate states and third countries. It is precisely in this area that thanks to the creation of OLAF we have a very powerful instrument. We are expanding its field of application step by step, which means first and foremost making greater use of OLAF for the collection and evaluation of information, as a kind of intelligence service for the fight against fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">The next step will be to organise OLAF's working methods in such a way as to turn it into a real platform of services for the Member States and for the authorities involved in the fight against fraud. As Mrs Theato rightly points out in her report, OLAF occupies a crucial position in the Commission's anti-fraud strategy, which is why, and I want to stress that very strongly, the Commission is extremely keen to see this authority built up rapidly. There are, however, a number of difficulties with regard to the legal basis for setting up OLAF. You know that the Commission would have preferred OLAF to be set up as a totally independent authority. But, and here I am addressing Mr Bösch, a different legal basis was created. OLAF is independent in the operational field while on the other hand it has to carry out tasks for which the Commission is directly responsible. That is bound to create difficulties, which must of course be resolved. I can only assure you once again, in regard also to the issue of the recruitment authority: the director of OLAF is entirely independent in the appointment of staff, and that applies not only to the lower level but also to the more senior and top levels. What you are addressing now is the following issue: will OLAF also use an advisory committee in order to bring more transparency into the selection process for senior officials? Actually I am sure that it is also in OLAF's interest to make the selection of senior officials transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to point out the following: we now have to live and work with this legal basis. The Supervisory Committee is constantly putting forward interesting proposals and considering the further development of the legal basis. In this regard the Commission is very open to proposals and reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">The third line of action is common action by the European institutions to fight and prevent fraud in office, and here let me point out that the Commission's complaints against the EIB and ECB because of the disputes about OLAF are still pending and that the complaint by 70 members of this House against OLAF's investigative powers is still pending.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the fourth line of action concerns the penal judicial dimension, and along with it, the penal judicial consequences of established, detected or presumed fraud. Here the overall situation remains as unsatisfactory as ever, especially as regards cooperation with the Member States, not because of any unwillingness but because of the structural inadequacies and difficulties that exist in this field. That is also why the Commission took the step of submitting a draft document on establishing a European Public Prosecutor's Office to the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice. More and more countries took a positive view of this proposal during the preparatory discussions for Nice. That did not give rise to any hope that the Treaty would be amended accordingly, but did justify the hope that a decision would be taken in Nice on how to move forward on this issue. Unfortunately, no such decision was taken in Nice on the Saturday evening, because of the objection of one state, which I find most regrettable. Nonetheless, the Commission will not be discouraged and we will ensure that there is a public debate. The next target date is 2004, the next Intergovernmental Conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
