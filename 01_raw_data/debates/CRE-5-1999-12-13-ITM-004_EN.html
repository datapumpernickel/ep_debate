<p class="contents">The discharge of the 1998 accounts is undertaken in a context very different to previous years. Our institutions have been both protagonists in and witnesses of major events on the European scene. For the first time the European Commission has resigned during its term of office and for the first time management and control of European funds have been put in the forefront of political attention.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union suffers from a fundamental problem inherent to a period of growth. The Commission structure has not evolved in parallel with the increasing variety of Community policies and funds that have to be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">As the reports of the Committee of Independent Experts clearly state: the Commission's organisation, staffing and procedures have become obsolete and are unable to deliver the policies with the expected high degree of efficiency and accountability. This failure brings about financial management and control weaknesses which have persistently been reported by the Court of Auditors. I believe that there is a general consensus on these observations. The crucial corollary is, in my view, that all European institutions and the Member States share responsibility for this situation and consequently that we have to work together to improve it.</p>
<p class="contents">To this effect and as part of its contribution, the Court addressed a letter to President Prodi, when he was still President-elect Prodi, on 15 July this year, drawing his attention to those basic improvements that we, the members of the Court of Auditors, considered to be the most essential. They involve making policy performance possible to assess, enhancing the structures of control, drawing up simple and more consistent financial and accounting regulations and finally managing staff more efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">The special reports and opinions adopted by the Court during the year in the Court's 1998 Annual Report submitted to Parliament provide additional evidence to corroborate this analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">As you have seen, the report that you now have in your hands contains the statement of assurance for the 1998 financial year. In response to the requests of this Parliament, the Court has expanded its work with the statement of assurance. It now provides additional information per sector of revenue and expenditure in each chapter, which should make the report more useful in assessing the particular situation in each field.</p>
<p class="contents">The global conclusions in the 1998 statement of assurance do not differ substantially from previous years. Firstly, the court is of the opinion that, overall, the accounts reliably reflect the Community's revenue and expenditure and the financial situation at the end of the year, subject, however, to certain qualifications concerning the omissions of debts and potential liabilities, overstatements of outstanding commitments and the presentation of advances as definite payments.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Court declines to give a positive statement on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the Commission's payments. The audit revealed a material incidence of error which affected the amount of payments made or the eligibility of the transactions financed. The audit also showed other failures to comply with regulations. Although these do not have a direct effect on the amounts of the transactions they often indicate a failure to apply control procedures properly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court found a significant number of errors when checking the final beneficiaries of subsidies. This demonstrates that, not only the Commission, but also the Member States still have problems in the administration and control of the Community programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the Member States are now embarked on a reform of the major areas of expenditure, notably agriculture, structural funds and the PHARE programme. Real progress will depend on far-reaching fundamental changes in the Member States' system also and in many cases, in Council regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">The observations concerning the activities of the sixth, seventh and eighth European Development Funds are, in this Annual Report, presently separated along with a separate statement of assurance. The audit revealed failures to comply with the EDF regulations and errors affecting the amount of payments made.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from these points, however, the Court is of the opinion that the European Development Fund accounts are reliable and the underlying transactions legal and regular.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these circumstances, in most of the areas of expenditure the Court has identified Community policies and programmes that are imprecisely designed and cannot be properly evaluated. Under these circumstances, actions cannot be correctly planned and the resources needed cannot be accurately estimated. That leads to poor results and the squandering of funds.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, in our Special Report No 2/99 on the effects of the Community agricultural policy reform in the cereal sector, the Court observed that there is no evidence that the reduction of institutional prices has brought significant benefits to the consumer nor that the reform has improved the position of small farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the policies and programmes lack clear and measurable targets in terms of output and costs, it is not possible to assess the extent to which policy goals have been attained and whether value for money has been obtained.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">Faute de mieux</span>, the prime indicator of financial performance commonly used is the extent to which the appropriations allocated in the budget have been utilised and not whether they are efficiently and effectively spent. That confirms the persistence of the "spending culture" within the Community, more concerned with the volume of expenditure than with its quality. I underline that this is about the Community as a whole. At the same time, evaluation is not consistently applied and rarely results in concrete corrective action. This is the case, for example, of the mid-term evaluation of the structural measures where the methodological framework remains inadequate and relevant indicators are lacking. The Commission should ensure a proper link between evaluation results and programming.</p>
<p class="contents">The 1998 annual report again reveals weaknesses in the three layers of the Community's financial control: at the Commission; in the Member State systems; and in the Commission's supervision of Member States' systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's internal control did not prevent the cases of mismanagement and irregularities that have recently been uncovered. At the same time the internal audit function is carried out in an uncoordinated way by several bodies. The Court's audit of the 1998 accounts has found cases where the internal control failures have led to ineligible costs being financed by the Commission, overcharging, backdating contracts or an absence of supporting documentation. These have adversely affected the Court's statement of assurance, notably in the area of internal policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can Member States' control systems be relied on to prevent errors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the area of structural measures the Court has detected a high incidence of errors with regard to the final recipients of the Community aid and the public bodies managing the funds. The most common errors are financing ineligible transactions, overpayments, breaching tendering or state aid rules and insufficient supporting documentation. They indicate that Member States urgently need to reinforce their control systems.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Treaty, in those areas where management is shared with the Member States, the Commission has the responsibility to supervise and ensure that national control systems are adequate. The Court's audit in 1998 reveals shortcomings in supervisory activity. The Commission also needs to step up its supervision of bodies implementing Community funds on its behalf, such as the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">As noted in the Court's Special Report No 3/99 on the management and control of interest-rate subsidies, on occasions the Commission had little knowledge of the projects or of the final beneficiaries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has now embarked on a process of administrative reform which should embrace fundamental improvements in financial control both at the Commission and in the Member States. As Parliament knows, the Court has already pointed out in Opinion No 4/97, on one of the Commission's proposed revisions of the financial regulation, that the role of the various officials responsible for control should be redefined. In particular, the authorising officer must be responsible for checking the regularity, the quality and effectiveness of the measures undertaken.</p>
<p class="contents">A genuine, independent audit function should be introduced. Its purpose should be to check the way the control structures set up by the managing departments work and to ensure that they are satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">Management and control of Community programmes are being decentralised from the Commission to national authorities and other intermediaries. This should be accompanied by development of management information and accounting systems, which would enable the Commission to exercise proper supervision to detect errors and cases of misadministration promptly. Where national systems of management and control are found inadequate, the flow of funds could be halted until remedial action has been taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Currently, the Commission is preparing a global revision of the Financial Regulation. This exercise must be carried out with care and vision even if it means extending the duration of related work. As I have already said, when presenting the annual report to the Committee on Budgetary Control, the Commission should increase its effort to simplify its financial and accounting regulations and procedures. They should be aimed at facilitating and speeding up operations while maintaining the required degree of control.</p>
<p class="contents">Improved management also requires mastery of human resources. The Commission's staffing is a general problem that the Court has frequently highlighted. The 1998 annual report again draws attention to shortcomings in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, like any other efficient organisation, needs a flexible staffing policy which will allow it to recruit, allocate and redeploy its staff better, taking account of the numbers and skills of staff needed for specific activities. In the meantime, the Commission should ensure that it accepts no additional responsibilities without sufficient personnel being made available.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the protection of the financial interests of the Community, this year has been marked by the establishment of the European Fraud Investigation Office, OLAF, in which the Court's opinion and reports have played a certain role. The Court will continue to work closely with OLAF while at the same time continuing to examine the way in which it carries out its duties.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to recall that the Treaty requires Member States to cooperate with the Commission to ensure that funds are used in accordance with principles of sound financial management and to take the same measures to counter fraud against the Community budget as are taken to protect national financial interests. However, only one Member State has fully ratified the conventions and the related protocols signed in 1995 and 1997 on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests and on fighting corruption. Only three other Member States have done so partially.</p>
<p class="contents">I have now presented to you the Court of Auditors' annual report for 1998. The audit findings confirm that the financial management culture urgently needs to be changed. It is indispensable to set measurable policy objectives and evaluate performance against these; to seek for efficiency and effectiveness; to transform the Commission's internal audit function and to reinforce Member State controls; to find better ways of ensuring legality, regularity and value for money; to simplify the financial rules and stick to sound budgetary and accounting principles; to promote accountability; to adopt the necessary measures to allow the recruitment and allocation of staff according to needs; to sustain reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Implementing all these measures will take time. I am convinced that the new Commission is determined to achieve this change, which is needed for the success of future enlargement of the Union. By speeding up the enlargement process the Commission has given us the task of speeding up reform.</p>
<p class="contents">The other European Community institutions and the Member States are consequently called upon to collaborate. On behalf of the European Court of Auditors, I can assure you that the Court will contribute to this initiative in a constructive manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We Members of the European Parliament have now been able to take an initial look at the report, which is almost 500 pages long, after having been alarmed by premature press reports. Not knowing the content of the Court of Auditors' report, we were unable either to confirm or to deny these reports. The issue of the Court of Auditors providing Parliament with information in good time is one which the two institutions need to resolve as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">President Karlsson, I am sure that you agree with this request and that for your part you will see to it that Parliament – in its capacity as the people's representative and as the control authority – is given information first, before the results of the Court's audit reach the press. I also refer to the report of my colleague, Mr Wynn, which the European Parliament adopted in spring 1998. Since then, I hear that the Court has identified the office in its house from which the report – and possibly also the confidential preliminary report – was clearly leaked. There has also been a suspension. In this case, the pressure exerted by the European Parliament to find out where the leaks had occurred has led to success.</p>
<p class="contents">The audit report on the table will not only provide us with a basis for our forthcoming work on the 1998 discharge; it will also serve as an important document for reforming the administrative structures in the Commission and will be used constructively to bring about the necessary improvements. We now have the opportunity in this Parliament to monitor this significant process of reform in the Commission constructively, but critically. Once again, the Court criticises the unacceptably high incidence of errors in budgetary management in 1998. It refuses to confirm the legality and regularity of the Commission's accounts and thus – for the fifth time in succession – does not give its statement of assurance. This is very serious.</p>
<p class="contents">On examining the report, it is striking that once again cases of mismanagement, irregularities and fraud are described, and that they occur in nearly all of the areas investigated, on both the revenue and expenditure sides. Every year evasion of duties and VAT payments causes significant losses to the Community budget. There are serious shortcomings in the Member States' management and control systems here. We ask, when does the Commission finally intend to remind the Member States of their duty? And, do the Member States not realise that by allowing funds to decline, they are cutting off their nose to spite their face?</p>
<p class="contents">In the agricultural sector, the situation remains disturbing. Overall, it is here that the most serious cases of incorrect utilisation of funds are found. Here too, the Court refers to the Member States' carelessness. In the important sector of research and development, mismanagement and a lack of transparency associated with advance payments and the final account caused losses. Over 50% of payments are said to be incorrect, with around two thirds even containing serious errors. The same applies to the Structural Funds.

I would condemn the other groups for not allowing us to discuss this in November: That was a wrong decision. It was outrageous that we did not allow the Court to have a press conference. We lost the opportunity of an important public platform. I was also extremely disappointed that the President of the Court of Auditors did not remain in Brussels earlier this month.</p>
<p class="contents">The report proves beyond all doubt that the reform process is long overdue. We need radical reforms if we are to see improvement of a very serious situation. This is the fifth time the Commission has not given a statement of assurance and it is clear that the Commission needs to understand that it is engaged in reform and it will be judged not by its words and its reports, but by its actions. It is clear that in efforts to reform itself, the Commission needs to concentrate not on where the money is spent but the extent to which policy goals are met, and that with a minimum cost. As Mr Karlsson said, we need to tackle the spending culture. That means we need clear, precise and measurable goals from the Commission. In my own country of Wales we receive significant money from the structural funds, but the line between creating a job and safeguarding a job is unclear and therefore it is difficult for us to assess how effective those structural funds have been.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission needs to make fundamental improvements to its own internal control mechanisms. One of the main problems, highlighted again, is that of passing the buck. Nobody is taking responsibility and the responsibility for spending money well is shared between too many people. That clearly needs to be reformed. We expect to see rigorous new management and control systems in the forthcoming reform. In particular, we need to see a reform of the Financial Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">But let us not forget that over 85% of the money that comes from the EU budget is spent within the Member States and they need to put their own house in order. Human resources is also an issue which clearly needs to be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">This report has vindicated the forced resignation of a sloppy, slapdash Commission and revealed a catalogue of irresponsibility by Member States who are prepared to criticise but not act on fraud and irregularities. The new Commission is heading in the right direction and we hope that we will see an end to these kinds of reports. We can put them behind us once we see an improvement in terms of the reform process.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish by putting a clear question to Mr Karlsson: does he personally think there is anything specific in the 1998 report which should stop Parliament from granting discharge?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Annual Report is extremely critical and the statement of assurance has again been denied. Nothing new there, for this has been the case for years now.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the last elections left us in no doubt as to the fact that the public has had enough of stories about the European finances being in a shambles. That is why it is of the utmost importance that this report at last be taken seriously. The Court of Auditors report must not be an annual media spectacle that ends up in a cupboard afterwards. This represents a real opportunity to improve Europe’s financial management. As President Karlsson has already said: all institutions must play their part in these improvements, and this should be done in the following way.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Member States really must take responsibility now. Fraud in Europe is still equated with fraud in Brussels. But for all that, more than 80% of the money is spent by the Member States. National control mechanisms can and must do better. Above all though, we must foster the notion that one should spend European money just as wisely as national money. </p>
<p class="contents">We would ask the Commission to show that it is in earnest where the promised reforms are concerned. Managers must also be brought to account in respect of their financial management abilities. Every year, DGs must set out the steps they have taken to address any criticisms raised by the Court of Auditors. </p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors itself could make its Annual Report more useful still by making two additions. Firstly, it could include statistical data, which would make sticking points even more visible, and secondly, it could refer back to set topics at regular intervals so as to enable us to see if there have been any improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course the European Parliament must keep its finger on the pulse of reform, but above all, this Parliament must set a good example and, at long last, adopt a statute.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">European money is public money. In order to win back the citizens’ trust, all institutions must demonstrate that they are serious about fighting and preventing fraud. This is the only way that we will be able to win back their trust. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Karlsson, I would like to thank you for the clear and unambiguous presentation of your annual report. The report itself does not exactly make for light bedtime reading. However, that has not stopped you and your colleagues from rubbing salt in the wound throughout 500 pages. Mr Karlsson, you have been able to take the floor here today. Third time lucky I would say. I regret that this important document could not be submitted during the previous part-session here in Strasbourg. It was leaked to the press and this prompted us to adjourn the affair. I regret that. Like Mrs Morgan, I too regret that you were unable to give a press conference. This is not a good state of affairs as far as the European Parliament is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Anyhow, this is an important document. Together with the two reports by the Committee of Wise Men and the OLAF report on 1998, all these documents in fact constitute the information on which we must base our decision as to whether or not we should grant discharge for the 1998 financial year. I would like to draw three tentative conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission in particular has been under fire these last few years. This led to the fall of the Santer Commission, we all know that. The new Prodi Commission was then given the explicit task of putting the house in order. This will first bear fruit in February. It is my hope that the new Commission, Mr Kinnock and Mrs Schreyer will be able to ensure that in future, the Court of Auditors will indeed be able to grant a statement of assurance.</p>
<p class="contents">My second conclusion is that this report emphasises very clearly that we should not just look for the money-grabbers amongst the eurocrats. It is indeed the case that eighty to eighty five per cent – a number of Members have already made reference to this – of all European expenditure is undertaken not by the Commission but by national, local or regional governments. There is therefore a need for more cooperation between the European Court of Auditors and its national counterparts. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Karlsson, it is obvious that organised crime has set its sights on a considerable share of European money. I believe that we need to work towards more cooperation and making OLAF effective, and that ultimately we are going to have to ensure that a European Public Prosecutor will keep crime firmly within limits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Irrespective of which programmes or areas are examined, 5% of the funds, that is to say SEK 40 billion, have disappeared from the system. I genuinely welcome these reports. </p>
<p class="contents">In spite of the fact that you in the Court of Auditors have previously pointed out irregularities and given good advice to the Commission, we note once again this year, that is to say for 1998, that the Commission’s changes have not in any way made the system as a whole either any clearer or more comprehensive. We are talking here about exceeding budgets. Sometimes, there is a complete lack of information. It is public purchasing procedures which are lacking. Sometimes, straightforward doubts about how to proceed are also in evidence. </p>
<p class="contents">SEK 40 billion is two years’ worth of funds contributed by Swedish tax-payers to the European Union. For SEK 40 billion, two million Swedish workers could go over to a 35-hour working week and still receive the same wages. Moreover, this is a trend I think we could look into and encourage when we consider how we use the structural funds, for this would be one way of making good use of these in terms of job-creation measures. In short, we can see that we could do a lot of good things for SEK 40 billion. The new Commission has said it wants to tighten up the system, but then it has also been saying as much every year.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as I am concerned, it is quite obvious that the European Union has too much power and too many budgetary resources compared with the ability and qualifications it has to handle these. That, I believe, is why the Member States have a lack of interest in accepting due responsibility. </p>
<p class="contents">Constantly patching up the system just seems to encourage various degrees of crookedness, most recently now in Sweden where the Commission’s own Stockholm office has just been suspected of having paid out wages to people who do not exist. That is amazing, to say the least. </p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude with a question to the President of the Court of Auditors: why have you not obtained the right to examine the European Investment Fund? I hope that it is not for reasons of making future savings that the President of the Court of Auditors is not availing himself of the language of our common, untamed homeland, that is to say of Swedish. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Dell'Alba (TDI).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, President of the Court of Auditors, apparently your presentation is not well starred. Last month, your speech was cut off, and now you are suffering a power cut. I hope that in the end we shall be able to see our way clearly here. In any case, you should not worry too much, because we have just adopted an urgent motion since it seems that the President of the Nicaraguan Court of Auditors has been imprisoned. You see, all we did to you was to prevent you taking part in a sitting. I regret this just as much as Mr Staes. I hope that light will be shed both on European accounts and on this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">Puns apart, I would like to congratulate you on your report, which is always significant for the European Union. You may gauge the extent to which this report and your comments have been significant for the European Union in the crisis which shook it last year. I think we must go ahead.</p>

<p class="contents">Well, there you are, this is the effect my words can have: <span class="italic">fiat lux, </span>let there be light!</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I wished to tell you how significant your role was and how well the message has been received, I imagine, within the institutions of the Community, properly speaking, i.e. the Commission and Parliament. It has perhaps been less well received by the Member States who continue to be the parties chiefly involved in the deficits and frauds affecting the Union budget, simply due to the fact that they administer the majority of the funds. The wish I would express is that next year, which is a key year, since 1999 was the year when a number of Structural Fund programmes were concluded, your action should be more concerned with the Member States, in order to get the idea across to the public that the administration of Community funds is an important issue about which we feel very strongly, and one which is of concern also – I shall not say primarily, but also to our national administrations, our Member States. Next year, then, an even greater effort could be made on this chapter, in my opinion, in closer cooperation with the national audit authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To a large extent, the problem lies with the Member States, but the Commission should not hide behind this fact. The Court of Auditors is right to point out that the Commission must ensure that any shortcomings on the part of the Member States are properly dealt with. What is more, the Commission’s housekeeping has a lot to answer for too. It is most revealing that the highest percentage of material incidences of error has been detected within the internal management department. After all, it is the Commission itself that has exclusive responsibility for financial management within this department.</p>
<p class="contents">The Annual Report underlines once again that we must work out, in structural terms, what the added value of the various European programmes amounts to. Up until now, the Commission has focused too heavily on high levels of expenditure. There has been little or no testing of effectiveness on the basis of clearly measurable policy objectives. The Commission must also keep a closer eye on whether individual projects abide by general community objectives. Accordingly, we must call an immediate halt to financing from structural funds projects that are at odds with objectives relating to environmental protection. The Court of Auditors is right to put its finger on this serious problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the whole state of affairs with regard to the leaking of the draft report raises questions as to the independence of the Court of Auditors. It is right that the Commission should be allowed to inspect the Annual Report before publication so as to correct any factual errors beforehand. But did the Commission confine itself to this? Or is it true that the Court of Auditors toned down the report under pressure from the Commission? In order to clear this up, the European Parliament ought, in the process of the discharge procedure, to analyse the differences between the draft report and the definitive report in detail and assess them on their merits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Karlsson, this is something that apart from causing our citizens, officials and institutions unnecessary harm, gives the impression that the Court of Auditors is a political body that is accountable to the electors through public opinion. </p>
<p class="contents">These leaks, Mr Karlsson, do not occur in the great majority of the Courts of Auditors in the Member States or in the European regions. Therefore, it should not be impossible for you to prevent them either. </p>
<p class="contents">It shows a lack of respect for this House and for yourselves, because it shows that those whose duty it is to monitor are not actually monitoring the process itself. </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr Karlsson, if these leaks occur again, my group will demand a reform that goes beyond merely postponing this debate. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to say that the problem of the irregularities and of the way the budget has been misused is not a geographical problem, but one that cuts across all divisions. Here there is no North, South, East or West. There are no rich countries or poor countries. What we have here is simply a problem of the inadequacy and the misinterpretation of national and Community legislation. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like the countries who bear the burden of the effort towards internal economic and social cohesion not to use this kind of argument as, of those countries, it is the countries that receive funds from the European Union that have the most to gain from the effectiveness of this effort. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to stress the fact that the Commission still intends – as the report that you have presented to us states – to use the degree of use of the financial credits allocated in the annual budget as the main gauge of the success of their financial management. What the Commission must in fact do is to measure its success by the degree to which it manages to achieve the objectives that it has been given, at the lowest cost. This change of philosophy is what, by supporting the report that you have presented, we demand of the reform that President Prodi promised this Parliament he would carry out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to make just a few brief comments on this. Firstly, how did the new European Commission react to this Court of Auditors' report? I have read that it is reasonably happy with the fact that the situation is not said to be visibly worse than it was in 1997. For a new Commission this seems to me to be alarming and a sign that it is moving in the wrong direction. It would suggest that nothing has been learnt from the mistakes of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in my view, this report lacks a certain clarity and simplicity of expression, President Karlsson. What are the people of the Union supposed to make of your statement that where internal policies are concerned, one third of payments contain substantial errors? I expect clearer position statements in future Commission discharge procedures and also in future Court of Auditors' reports, not least because, firstly, internal policies are the sole responsibility of the Commission and secondly, we know that this House is particularly interested in internal policies.</p>
<p class="contents">In future discharge procedures, we will have to be able to ascertain, on the basis of this report, that the lessons of the past have actually been learned in the Commission. The initial reactions to this report were disappointing in this respect, but of course, it is always possible to do better and this is what we are all called upon to do together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Both have a duty to ensure that tax-payers' money is well spent. If we are to keep the people's trust and win their support for the ambitious plans outlined at Helsinki this weekend, three steps are essential.</p>
<p class="contents">First, Member States themselves must do more to detect fraud. Cooperation between the European Court of Auditors and its national counterparts must be strengthened, if necessary by means of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, as Mr Karlsson just made very clear, the Commission's financial management must be improved. The Commission has announced a programme of reforms. If these are to be successful they must be radical, comprehensive and based on a very clear timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, Parliament must put its own house in order. We can only be credible as the people's watchdog if the recommendations of the Court of Auditors which relate to this institution are implemented without delay. Parliament must do everything within its powers to demonstrate that it is serious about eliminating waste. It is for this very reason that, like many of my colleagues, I shall not be attending tomorrow's opening ceremony of this expensive and obviously flawed building that nobody asked for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That may be seen from the large number of Socialists who are speaking here today. It is also a very important tool which citizens have for scrutinising and supervising the European Union’s activities and holding it accountable. </p>
<p class="contents">As has been said here on a number of occasions, that is also why we were irritated by the fact that the President of the Court of Auditors was not previously able to appear here before Parliament. At the same time as the annual report of the Court of Auditors was being presented, an incident occurred at the Commission’s official office in Stockholm. It emerged that inadmissible wage payments had been made there. One wonders how it is going to be possible to keep the whole of the European Union in order if a small office of 20 people cannot be kept in check. That is where the Court of Auditors comes in. I should like to say that how this small office and the way in which it has carried out its duties and managed its finances is to be dealt with will be a test of the European Union’s credibility in this context, that is to say of its openness and accountability. </p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask the President of the Court of Auditors, who has visited Stockholm, what impressions he has obtained of the incident there and what measures might be expected to be taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not possible for them to come up with a positive opinion. There is a need for the Member States to take greater responsibility. They administer approximately 80% of the budget and they do not do it particularly well. I am naturally pleased that Denmark is not singled out for attack this year. I am a little surprised, however, that the Court of Auditors should again have volunteered a remark about the feta issue. In fact, that matter was closed a long time ago. </p>
<p class="contents">In February, Mr Kinnock will be submitting a proposal for a reform of the Commission. This is perhaps one of the things we are to be tackling. One of the most important changes concerns the staff culture. It happens too rarely that employees are suspended or fired if they are incompetent or corrupt. There does exist the opportunity to dismiss incompetent employees on the basis of Article 52 of the staff regulations. This Article ought to be made use of, and in general it never is. This practice ought therefore to be changed. If we are to stamp out irregularities and fraud, we need to change the staff culture and the tendency for people’s being able to get away with murder if they have the right friends to cover for them. We should be cleaning up our act after previous scandals. What signals are being sent out to future leaders of the Commission if those responsible for the scandals can just carry on in good jobs? In this way, we shall never see a positive opinion from the Court of Auditors. We need to put our house in order following the mistakes of the past, both internally within the Commission and also in the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it is also an historic day today in so far as we for once witnessed one of our colleagues seeing the light, namely Mr Dell’Alba. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, ladies and gentlemen, to use taxpayers' money in accordance with clear political priorities and in accordance with principles of economy and efficiency are objectives which all those who deal with a public budget should be determined to achieve, and these are the objectives which the new Commission is determined to achieve. The Court of Auditors has the task of checking to see whether these objectives are met; it has the task of ascertaining whether public funds are being managed in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Regulation, and it tells the Commission what changes need to be made to ensure proper financial management.</p>
<p class="contents">In its report on the 1998 financial year, the Court of Auditors has explained in how many areas urgent changes need to be made. And Mr Bösch, I am not aware of any statement by the new Commission saying that we had found it reassuring that once again the statement of assurance could not be made. On the contrary, we said that it is disturbing – as has also been stressed here – that for the fifth time the regularity of the payments effected could not be confirmed. That is why the Commission will, of course, also be setting about implementing these changes with vigour.</p>
<p class="contents">In some areas, changes have already been put in train by the old Commission; this is the case with the Structural Funds, for example. For the new aid period there will be new rules governing the financial steps which the Commission can take if the provisions under which grants are awarded and implemented are infringed.</p>
<p class="contents">President Karlsson emphasised in his speech that wide-ranging reforms are necessary in order to achieve better financial management. I am, therefore, very pleased that the Commission is resolutely planning a process of reform and is committed to pursuing it. I should like to mention three components of the reform, which are of great significance for financial management.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is activity-based budgeting. In the future, beginning with the 2001 budget, it is intended that when the EU budget is drawn up, it should more closely reflect political priorities than has been the case in the past, and that the decisions on priorities should not only affect operating appropriations but also the required staff appropriations, so that more staff are deployed in the areas of political priority.</p>
<p class="contents">The second key aspect of the reform is strengthening the financial responsibility of all the departments which administer EU funds. The Commission will adopt the approach which has long since been advocated by Parliament, which Mr Karlsson has also outlined once again just now and which I also announced in my written answers to parliamentary questions in August. This consists of devolving responsibility for financial control to the departments in charge of the spending programmes, thus decentralising and at the same time increasing the level of financial responsibility in the administrative departments which effect the expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">The third important component is amending the Financial Regulation. A new, extensively amended version is required and work on this is underway. It will take account of very many of the Court of Auditors' criticisms, including, for example, the issue of recording advance payments and final payments separately in the accounts. It will be an important step towards greater transparency across the accounting system.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like briefly to comment on the premature publication of the Court of Auditors' report and the anger felt about this in Parliament. I think that we should reflect together on the timetable for publication and the debate in Parliament. In my opinion, it is right for there to be an interval of time between publication and the debate here in this House, so that all Members are able to familiarise themselves with the full report beforehand. I think it is a matter of urgency to initiate a consultation procedure here so that a better solution can be found.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, ladies and gentlemen, it is my intention to go through the Court of Auditors' report sector by sector with the departments, and, above all, with the Member States, and to find out why the mistakes were made in the first place. Who ought to have acted differently? What instruments are available to avoid mistakes of this kind being made in the future, and how quickly can improvements be achieved? A systematic follow-up of this kind is essential. I will do my utmost to implement this kind of systematic follow-up and I am very pleased that the Commission has decided – as part of its reform package on financial management – to formalise the structure of this systematic follow-up, so that in the future the observations of the Court of Auditors really can be used to improve financial management, and I would ask the European Parliament to support this comprehensive project of reform.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karlsson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Court of Auditors.</span> – Mr President, I shall try to comment on all the interesting contributions to this debate. Some have commented that Parliament must be the first to receive the material the Court produces, be it our annual report or the special reports we produce throughout the year. Let me make an unequivocal and clear statement that this is absolutely the rule we shall obey, that this Assembly will be the first to receive our reports.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may add one thing immediately to the point made by Mr Pomés Ruiz: I entirely agree with him that you must make very special requirements of a Court of Auditors, that it must be like Caesar's wife. But what has happened in this case is that the Court has found out who was guilty of leaking the draft annual report to the press, and has taken the appropriate measures. All of us know that this is not the only time that information on classified material has been passed on. What has happened hitherto is that the Court has established this. I hope we can continue to do the same in every case but I would not deny, as President of the Court of Auditors, that special demands could be put on us as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">Many speakers have pointed out the responsibility of Member States. I can only confirm that this is a positive response to the challenge of Member States' willingness to fight fraud, to put their house in order, to enhance control systems, a challenge that we have pointed out in the annual report may be even greater this year, while not for one minute diminishing the role and the responsibility of the Commission in this context. The Commission must, at the same time, dare to impose clear demands and requirements on the Member States' control systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Morgan asked me a clear-cut question: is there something specific in this annual report that should make Parliament not grant discharge? Let me underline what the Court's role is in this context: it is to give you all the material we find it appropriate and advisable to put forward, and leave it to you to make the political decision on discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">I will only say that the question that needs to be asked is whether the Commission has done everything in its power to remedy the shortcomings that have been pointed out. I would certainly not make any specific detailed remark on any one point. It is the overall material that has been produced both in this annual reports and in the special report we have produced, and will produce, that should be the basis for Parliament's decision on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">I would underline what Mrs van der Laan pointed out concerning fraud in the Union, and would point out that, judging from press reports about fraud in general and attacks on public budgets, you would think the European budget was more vulnerable than any.</p>
<p class="contents">This is, of course, not true. What has been stated many times is that this is a problem that all countries, both in their regional and national budgets, have to fight.</p>
<p class="contents">May I take this opportunity to point out that the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato and myself addressed jointly a contact committee of all the presidents of Member States' national audit offices and the Court of Auditors, just to point out to these key people that fighting fraud in European funds is also a national task. This is a clear example of Parliament and the Court of Auditors working to draw this to the attention of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Staes that this is no bedtime reading and I was very worried when they started to put out the lights, but because of Mr Dell'Alba's courageous intervention this was stopped.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also stress that the work undertaken in constructing OLAF has to be continued. In the Court's special report on the UCLAF activities we have pointed to a number of proposals that we think both Parliament and Member States should undertake, concerning a European prosecutor and other measures to continue the fight against fraud. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think that, following a habit already established in the Budgetary Control Committee, I will stick to my second language and I hope that you will forgive me for this national treason.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bösch, I agree with you and I think everybody agrees with you that there are special requirements to be placed on those parts of the budget which are managed by the Commission itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already underlined that it is important that the Commission should also shoulder its responsibility concerning the Member States; but when it comes to internal policies, external aid and personnel administration, we can put clearer demands on the Commission and we can also deal with it differently when it comes to the statement of assurance, something which we have started to do and will continue to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate Mr van Hulten on his first speech here. I agree with him as regards the need in our work to reassure tax-payers that their money is being spent well and I also underline, as Mrs van der Laan has done, the need for Member States also to fight fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schori asked me about my conclusions, or the conclusions of the Court of Auditors, concerning events in the Stockholm representation of the Commission. I have two reflections to make; one being that this shows that the only way to cope with problems of this kind is to have functioning internal control systems. There has to be, whenever expenditure of European money is concerned, an internal control system which is efficient and reliable so that the external controller can ascertain whether systems function and not go through every detail of administration. The other is that I have also publicly stated that this is a test case for the Commission's willingness to reform its disciplinary procedures, of which we are very critical and which I know that the Commission also intends to do something about.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already pointed out in my first speech the same problem that Mr Blak brought up – that staff administration has to be improved. As for Mrs Eriksson, who asked me why we do not audit the European Investment Fund, we asked the Council when it was established whether we should do so and the reply was "no" and that is why. I do not agree with the Council but it is the Council that decides.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I will make a general comment on what Mrs Schreyer pointed out in her speech. As you can hear, the attitude of the Commission to this annual report is to take it to its heart and to start embarking upon the reform programme we are discussing today.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say, on behalf of the European Court of Auditors, that we hope that we can, in a climate of dialogue and openness, work together to see to it that this new Commission can carry out the reform that we are eagerly looking forward to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
