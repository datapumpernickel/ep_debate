<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Weiler (PSE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, employment policy in the EU was successful last year even though not all our ambitious objectives have been achieved. But the points have been set. In few other fields do we have to think in the long term as much as in employment policy. My impression is that the Member States have not only grasped that, but that they are also acting accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">My report takes the same line as that of the Committee, which has kept to it over the past few years. We have always followed employment processes in the Member States and offered constructive criticism. I have therefore concentrated this year on some new key points. The first of these is the new theme of work quality, on which we in Parliament agree with the initiative of the Commission and the Belgian Presidency, which have also made the quality of work a pre-eminent item on the agenda. We are very keen that this topic should find its way into all policy areas by a kind of mainstreaming.</p>
<p class="contents">The second key point is gender equality in the employment market. Here, too, according to the Commission's figures, we have achieved an improvement. The proportion of women in employment has increased by 2% in any case, which is of course not enough for us, but it is the right way to go, and also shows the change in the Member States' thinking. This reorientation also means – and even that was not so simple – that a change of consciousness has taken place, at least in some Member States such as Germany, Greece and Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">A third point is very important to me – the integration and incorporation of disadvantaged groups into the employment market. This has for some years been an important topic for this Parliament. In my report, I put forward the argument that employment policy measures should include immigrants as well. I believe this to be an important area for the future, precisely because we will otherwise be creating new social flashpoints.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like finally to mention the area of continuing education. We had debates in Committee as to whether it made sense to demand a right to continuing education and to direct the national governments to translate it into action. I believe that, now, of all times, when we are already finding that bottlenecks in certain trades result from too little training and development in the past, such a national right to continuing education would represent the dictates of the hour. I am, moreover, convinced that we will have achieved it within four or five years. Why, then, should Parliament not be the trailblazer for once?</p>
<p class="contents">National and European targets need to be set if these policy objectives are to be achieved. There is, I believe, an additional need for more intensive cooperation between enterprises and institutions of higher education than hitherto, in order to facilitate more effective knowledge transfer and more speedily initiate entrepreneurial innovation than has previously been the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal also to the Member States, to the Council and to the Belgian Presidency to have the courage to initiate a public debate on employment policy in Europe. The fact is that we have observed that there is in the national parliaments – with the possible exception of Denmark – and in the regional parliaments and assemblies, still, little or no, discussion of European employment policy. Even employers' organisations and trade unions, at regional level, do not know of the significance of our debates and resolutions in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, effective employment policies and coordinated and farsighted economic and financial policies belong together. I cannot draw a veil over this Parliament's present dissatisfaction with the Council's objectives in this area and with its debates on the subject. I cannot help thinking that we could do with a bit more courage on the part of the finance ministers on the Ecofin Council, in order to guarantee here, too, the appropriate and proportionate goal for a rational European employment policy, for only then can an offensive for growth and employment in Europe be realised.</p>

It goes without saying that the European Union can contribute towards it. I believe, though, that dialogue between the ministers of the various Member States is particularly important here.</p>
<p class="contents">On looking into the matter more closely, we note that we have in some countries of the European Union almost full employment, but in others unemployment – and, in particular, youth unemployment – on a frightening scale. I believe it to be a matter of extraordinary importance that the States should learn from one another and avoid making the mistakes already made by others. We can see that the countries that perform best have created jobs on the basis of a solid financial policy and have got to grips with the necessary structural reforms earlier than others.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also ask ourselves the question: who, then, actually creates jobs? It is not the state, it is often not the major enterprises, which indeed tend rather to retrench. It is, far more, the small and medium-sized enterprises that create the most jobs. If we want to be successful, the establishment of new enterprises is especially important. It is a matter of creating the appropriate framework for them. We must make it our concern that the European Union is not the institution that contributes to life being even more difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises or to making it difficult to set up new ones. The European Union's activity must focus more on creating the conditions that will give these enterprises a better chance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Twenty-five million fewer women than men participate in the European labour market. That is a huge unexploited resource which needs to be made use of if Lisbon’s employment objectives are to be achieved and if economic growth is to be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the birth rate is falling dramatically. Demographic experts predict that Europe’s labour force will consist of considerably fewer people in the future, when more women will therefore have to be in gainful employment and, at the same time, give birth to more children. How are we to balance the equation? A basic prerequisite is an equality perspective in all four pillars of the employment policy guidelines, and I am therefore very pleased that Mrs Weiler has been so attentive to the proposals tabled by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important thing is perhaps to ensure that European women and men can combine professional life with having a family and children. The Member States must make child care available and offer parental leave. The women of Europe must not be forced to choose between professional life and having a family. The Commission’s focus on <span class="italic">better</span> jobs is very encouraging, for better jobs and better working conditions for women are among the prerequisites for having more women in paid employment. Precarious and low-paid jobs which require little in the way of qualifications and in which women are over-represented at present are hardly going to attract women.</p>
<p class="contents">Quality, which is the recurring theme in the guidelines for the year 2000, must also apply to work done by women. Overcoming gender discrimination at work and in the social insurance systems is a <span class="italic">huge</span> challenge. Discrimination against women in the labour market is not only unproductive, it also ruins the opportunities for individual women, for women as a group and for society as a whole. Quite simply, growth and human development require us to put an end to gender discrimination. Equality is an investment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, we are confirming this strategy, these undertakings and guidelines in an economic climate which we all know to be much less favourable, or, rather, full of risks, and we are therefore doing so, first and foremost, by duly recognising the need, already established at the Lisbon Summit, to bring the economic policy guidelines adopted at Community level and by the Member States into line with employment policy recommendations and guidelines. This does not diminish the specific role of the Luxembourg procedure and the economic policy guidelines in the context of what has been defined a coordination process, an open coordination process. We are aware that these alone are not enough; however, they are, or can be, decisive for maximising the effects or reducing the risks for employment, which are also linked to the economic trend.</p>
<p class="contents">All this must be subject to certain conditions, focused on in both the Commission’s proposals, which we judged to be positive, and Parliament’s position. I will mention them very briefly: we feel that this is a process which warrants careful attention, controls and monitoring. It is not enough just to state the objectives which are then included under the principle of subsidiarity in national employment plans.</p>
<p class="contents">There must also be consistency in terms of effectiveness and implementation: that is why we call for the adoption of auditable, reliable common indicators at Member State as well as Community level, in order to achieve national objectives without whose achievement it would subsequently be difficult to reach our common European and Community objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">There must be consistency with budgetary policies at Member State level and at local and regional levels as well; there must be quality employment objectives seeking to combine flexibility, social dialogue, protection, rights and safety, but which also extend beyond that context to include lifelong training, integration policies and employment with a view to increasing the productivity of less elderly workers. Lastly, and most importantly, there must be equal opportunities policies and active employment policies.</p>
<p class="contents">If these conditions are met, the contribution of the Luxembourg procedure will not be the only factor but it will certainly be decisive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">No one will now deny that the European employment policy, since it first started in 1997, has led to a certain level of convergence stress in the Member States and has brought with it increasing unanimity as to what an active labour market policy in Europe could be.</p>
<p class="contents">That is apparent from the continued refinement of the employment guidelines, although I would add that this is rather unilaterally evident from the first pillar, namely employability, and that the results in the field of adaptability of undertakings still leave something to be desired.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, the moment of truth is now upon us, in my opinion. In this economic slow-down, Member States must prove that the Lisbon objectives, being sustainable growth, full employment and quality of jobs, were not simply prescribed for periods of boom, but must also remain applicable now. That means that the Member States will need to lend a hand, for at the same time, I have noticed that a number of cracks are starting to show in the employment strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I have noticed that people have cold feet about laying down specific, let alone European, objectives and benchmarks. For example, I think it is great that the Council has recognised that equal opportunities for men and women is a question of social justice as well as economic efficiency. However, I should also like to see the Council go the extra mile by formulating clear, quantitative and specific objectives in terms of reducing the wage gap and setting up a number of child care centres.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I hope that you will be monitoring this closely.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the mix of policy measures, the method of open coordination is an interesting policy instrument in areas where Europe previously had nothing to say, and I very much applaud the fact that the Belgian Presidency has included the aspect of quality of employment. Commissioner, it seems obvious to me, however, that collective agreements as well as social legislation will be needed in different areas where the social dialogue has failed. That is why it is of the utmost importance for my group, for example, to know whether the European Commission will, after the failure of social consultation, produce a draft directive on temporary employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, temporary employment can create new opportunities. However, for temporary employment to be quality employment which offers social rights, trade union rights, right to training and, at the same time, guarantees for permanent staff in the firms making use of their services, a European directive must be compiled which offers a number of warranties, warranties which have, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, been presented in the joint declaration recently concluded by Euro-CIETT and UNI-EUROPA and that include, for example, equal treatment at temporary employment agencies and at firms making use of their services.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, following on from this debate, I should like to know when you will be presenting this draft directive to Parliament and in what way these essential basic conditions will be met. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I very much agree with her remark about the significance of training and the importance of making a special effort on behalf of older people in the labour market. I do not agree that we, in the EU, should have a directive granting any rights, but I well understand that many in this House want to see special emphasis and importance given to actually ensuring a right to training. However, this is something which the individual countries must take care of. The employment guidelines provide, of course, both some political priorities and some political objectives, and they also provide a framework for deciding which funds are to be used in order to achieve the objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The funds are allocated to four pillars. The unemployed must be made better qualified to obtain jobs. They must be given more incentives to get into employment. That is the first pillar. Secondly, entrepreneurship must be promoted so that we see more companies and jobs created, partly through the removal of constricting regulations and bureaucratic arrangements. Thirdly, adaptability and flexibility must be promoted so that companies become more competitive. And fourthly, more opportunities must be provided for combining working life and family life so that there is a real opportunity for women to achieve equality in the labour market, leading to an improvement in the employment situation where women are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Many points have been registered under the four pillars, and I believe we are coming to a point at which it is worth considering whether we are pinning too much on this process, for the more objectives we add to the process, the more we are also in danger of watering down the cooperation and perhaps losing sight of the real goals, namely those of creating more jobs and getting the unemployed into work. That being said, I am very pleased that, this time, we have obtained an innovation in the guidelines for the year 2000, whereby local and regional efforts are to be involved and local and regional employment strategies developed. I also believe this underlines the fact that the Commission will need resources for carrying out analyses and studies within this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At times like these, when a recession may be looming, we find it even more regrettable that employment is not the main priority of the economic and monetary guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reiterate that the Group of the Greens believes that employment policy cannot only have the function of monitoring or softening the peaks and troughs of the globalised economy by creating safety nets, by helping those who are out of work to find their way back into the job market. This is all the Luxembourg process has achieved, it is also, evidently, all that the guidelines proposed by the Commission for 2002 are likely to achieve, and is also all that the Weiler report, which is part of this approach, can achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst expressing regret that the Member States did little in response to their invitation to set objectives for unemployment levels, the Commission and the Council have quite rightly placed the emphasis on verifying the qualitative impact of the policies implemented. In order to clarify this approach, we are proposing two amendments. The first proposes to draw up comparable statistics on the various types of employment, in other words, including underemployment, partial unemployment, and to assess the consequences of so-called employment incentive measures in terms of enhanced social inclusion or exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second amendment proposes to strengthen the action of employment monitoring services in order to prevent flexible short-term contracts being abused.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, as a matter of urgency, curb the development of poverty, lack of job security, and unpleasant working conditions. We still need to introduce a policy to create businesses and jobs. Instead of despairing over poor growth forecasts as if these were gloomy weather reports, we should try to shape this policy in accordance with our objectives on social and territorial cohesion, and decide on, for example, the necessary large-scale investments, including public investment, draw up a European job creation policy, and not simply a work placement policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission reports on which this debate is based presuppose that there are to be no major changes this year, because a large-scale evaluation of the first five-year period is to be carried out in the course of next year. We do not, therefore, wish to start making changes at the present stage. Naturally, this state of affairs has also had a marked influence upon the current report, which concerns what we have discussed in previous years.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the rapporteur has added some important aspects: quality at work, training, professional education, life long learning, equality etc. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs submitted a number of proposals for the report, of which a number were adopted and introduced into the report. These amendments worry me because some of them place such heavy emphasis upon price stability policy, budget restriction policy and such like. They worry me because we are heading for an economy which is no longer as strong. The Luxembourg procedure has been very focused upon improving the supply of labour, but this presupposes that there are job opportunities and that current economic policy is creating job opportunities and countering the trend towards economic recession. I therefore believe that, in the current situation, the amendments in question militate against a European employment strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say a few words about the future. A number of evaluations are now under way. I have been in contact with people working on a number of the ongoing research projects, and I believe that one of the things that will be emphasised is the fact that the Member States are failing to implement the policy properly. There is relatively broad agreement between those pursuing labour market policy in the Member States but, in spite of that, no such policy is being implemented in the Member States themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The labour market administrations really do not have much to do with the procedure itself. They are pursuing their own policy. The parliaments have no influence at all, but it is nonetheless they who must fund the national efforts we are demanding. It is therefore incredibly important that more attention be paid to the parliaments in particular, but also to the entire political process in the Member States, if the result is to be effective. I believe that this will be the major task in the forthcoming evaluation. It is not enough simply to emphasise indicators and such like. The bodies that supply the finance and then administer the measures must also play an active role in the process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has identified unemployment as one of the most serious economic and social problems faced by the European Union. This was true prior to 11 September. It has now become an even more stark reality in the aftermath and against the background of continuing economic uncertainty which results from war.</p>
<p class="contents">One in 12 EU citizens is unemployed today. This is an intolerable situation and one which is of great concern to all of us. Indeed, unemployment rates are much higher in some Member States. Solving the problem of unemployment requires active labour market measures. Labour markets do not always function efficiently, and Member States must be prepared to take up their responsibilities when the need arises. The Luxembourg process of employment guidelines is intended to give the Member States a powerful stimulus in shaping their employment policies.</p>
<p class="contents">In the short time available to me I want to focus on recent events, but firstly I want to say that a number of key European industries are facing unprecedented difficulties. Every effort must be made to secure the maximum number of jobs. Hardest hit at the moment is the airline industry but we must not forget the tourist industry which has already suffered greatly this year from foot-and-mouth disease. In the case of the Irish national airline, Aer Lingus, 40% of their business and 60% of their profits are generated on trans-Atlantic routes. Ireland's location as an island state in the north-west periphery of the Union creates a particular set of circumstances to which I would urge the Commission to give full consideration. The collapse of Aer Lingus simply cannot be permitted. The economic and social consequences would be unparalleled in any other Member State in the Union, and the knock-on effects to related industries would be enormous. The fact that we are an island state without any linkage to the rest of Europe means that we require this. The Commission must look at this sympathetically and favourably. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By far the majority of these are to be welcomed and are politically correct, and many are in response to urgent needs, especially the conclusions of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, which Mrs Theorin has reported on. However, I have some general remarks on employment policy and the EU’s labour market policy which have, of course, been an overriding theme of a number of reports and proposals here this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I have a remark to make about the reality as it is perceived. There is, of course, a very big gap between the reports of various kinds and the social reality. Armchair manifestos are largely absurd descriptions of social reality and will be completely unrecognisable to Europe’s enormous army of unemployed and socially excluded. A similar remove from reality is reflected in quite a few places in this report. We see this, for example, in recital F, which emphatically opposes the attitude that ‘labour market considerations are subordinated to economic policy’. The Treaty’s convergence requirements and such like may, upon examination, perhaps be seen as wishful thinking, but the only problem is that the Treaty is out of step with reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The other remark I have to make is that employment policy and labour market policy, in general, consist, in large measure, of just such political confessions of faith. On the one hand, this means that we are operating in an area where what is decided is not legally binding, and this, of course, gives free rein to a lot of fine words and good intentions. On the other hand, we are, to a large extent, in areas for which the Treaty provides no legal bases for proper legal regulation. What, however, there is, at present, no legal base for, there may in future be a legal base for. I am thinking, for example, of the reference to harmonisation of social arrangements, of tax policy etc. However, I would remind you that, in Denmark, we have a saying about all good intentions, to the effect that ‘the way to hell is paved with good intentions’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But how? There are considerable differences in how we answer the question as to how we want to achieve this objective. Many advocate, to the exclusion of all else, additional measures for employees, but that alone cannot reach the goal. We must indeed implement measures to benefit both employers and employees – or transpose such measures, as the case may be. This means, though, that we, together, have to be consistent in ensuring that there is a durable improvement in the economic conditions for our small and medium-sized businesses. Two-thirds of all European workers are employed in them. Their productive capacity must be improved, and that by means of easier access to additional finance on more favourable terms and a distinct reduction in the tax burden. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Young people, women, older people and people with disabilities have a particularly hard time of it. There is a lack of access to training, vocational and continuing education, retraining and, of course, work itself. Society's weaker members must, though, be strengthened in a spirit of solidarity. Mrs Weiler is right to draw attention to the 1997 Luxembourg Summit. The Member States have been showing their true colours since the guidelines on employment policy appeared. Progress has been made in lifelong learning, in the application of practices which have proved their worth, in the involvement of both sides of industry and in action plans for local and regional employment. Above all, though, incentives for active jobseeking and for investment in research and development, the reduction of the tax burden on work and structural reforms are all still lacking.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report, I do not find long-term strategies, but rather feverish measures for dealing with periods of slack growth. Not everything can be blamed on the tragic events of 11 September. Predictions of growth must be substantially adjusted, for example Germany's from 3% in January to 0.75% this week. Chancellor Schröder will not reach his goal of reducing the number of unemployed to 3.5 million in the election year, since the figure is expected to shoot up to 3.8 million. His famous steady hand is trembling.</p>
<p class="contents">An additional EUR 2.5 billion will be required for unemployment benefit and for the Federal Institute for Employment. If Germany, the engine of growth, falters, the whole of the European Union will be affected. It is high time that there were financial concessions for SMEs. Taxes must not be raised still further, especially at a low point in the economic cycle. Tax reforms must be brought forward and the Member States must become more active in the fight against the black economy and tax evasion. I urge both sides of industry to make employment contracts more flexible and further modernise the organisation of work. In doing this, I am counting on the expertise and commitment of responsible managers and employees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When we look back at the very short period during which we have worked on employment policy within the EU, we have to note that it has been relatively successful. The level of employment has increased and unemployment has gone down, and that is indeed progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that the economy is in decline, the moment of truth has, however, arrived, and I believe that the need for a coordinated employment policy is even greater than before. Even though the situation is encouraging now, we still see shortcomings, such as women’s low share of the labour market. It is not just that women’s share of that market is much lower than men’s. Rather, women are over-represented when it comes to atypical and precarious jobs in the labour market, even in countries which have a very high proportion of women in gainful employment.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been observed in recent years, there are also problems when it comes to the older workforce. It is really a pity that such a small proportion of the population between the ages of 55 and 65 are in work. In this area, a range of measures relating to the working environment, skill development etc. is needed if we are going to be able to increase these figures. There are also very large regional differences and, for groups such as immigrants and the disabled, levels of employment are still very low.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the discussion about quality at work and about not only creating more job opportunities but also increasing the quality of those jobs. In this area, a long list of measures is, however, required. That applies, of course, to the working environment, and especially to the new problems arising in the working environment in connection with people being stressed, excluded, burned out and such like. It also applies, however, to the issue of life long learning. I believe that this is perhaps the most central issue if we are to be able to obtain economic growth and create more employment opportunities in the future, and that is why I am supporting this universal right.</p>
<p class="contents">I genuinely want to see a framework agreement at European level in which the social partners agree to this right. I do not know whether that is possible. Otherwise, the Commission will have to act. However, it would be the best solution. This right to skill development must then be adapted at national level within different sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a view of the open coordination method. The open coordination method exists parallel to legislation in the areas of employment law and the working environment. The open coordination method is good, but is lacking in the areas of democratic control and transparency. We must free the European Parliament to exercise influence on this process.

Mrs Weiler, I would like to express my congratulations to you on this work, but also wish to point out three major problems that I find in the real world, which is not quite as rosy as it is depicted in some of the Commission's assessments or, indeed, in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">First among them is the strategy of full employment by 2010 on the basis of a 3% growth rate. I found that illusory from the very start. The problem with it, though, is that other ways of combating unemployment have been disregarded. It is lamentable that even Social Democrats stay aloof if you advocate the reduction of working hours. Scant regard is paid to elements of a third economic sector for social, ecological and cultural services or indeed to the greening of society.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problematic aspect – one to which Mr Andersson has just referred – is the split development of employment policy. There are, of course, some positive trends. Full employment in engineering and in technical and managerial occupations has increased. Modernisation really does have winners. The other side of the coin is, though, a clear increase in part-time employment, especially of women, among whom it has now reached 45.7%. in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The third problem is this: you have addressed the issue of the quality of work but, in my opinion, the social content of work is largely disregarded. The law on employment contracts is ‘made more flexible’ but in reality it is relaxed. We see the promotion of the low-wage sector. The right of the long-term unemployed to choose their work is being limited. It is precisely because these things are naturally long-term phenomena that we are, I believe, obliged to act with sensitivity in taking precautions, so that no new social division arises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This House has been an enthusiastic supporter of the quantitative objectives laid down at the Lisbon and Stockholm European Councils with regard to the overall rate of employment, the rate of female employment and the rate of employment amongst the elderly. Unemployment, as has already been said, is one of the most serious economic and social problems the European Union faces and, currently, one in twelve citizens is unemployed, with the worst-affected groups being women, young people, the elderly, the disabled and members of ethnic minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2002 guidelines for employment must be accompanied in all aspects by qualitative objectives, hence the importance of adopting special measures for incentives and action in the field of economic and social cohesion for the least-developed regions which lack the appropriate structures. One pillar of the employment strategy, the entrepreneurial spirit, calls for priority to be given to the creation and growth of SMEs, which have enormous potential for job creation, as we can see from the most recent data from Eurostat, which shows that micro-enterprises with between one and nine workers made the greatest increase in terms of job creation in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The report quite rightly highlights reducing bureaucratic and tax obligations as a means of stimulating the creation and growth of companies. Nevertheless, we must reiterate that active support must be provided for the creation of infrastructures to support research and development, vocational training and lifelong learning so as to ensure the quality and continuity of employment. We all know that the European Union will only become a knowledge-based economy if all Member States make investment in human resources their absolute priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am citing the example of Moulinex, because the decision has just been taken. I could, however, cite dozens of other businesses scattered throughout Europe, from Philips to Siemens, as well as several airlines. This is a tragedy for many thousands of employees, and a disaster for the regions that are affected. I would like to express my solidarity with the workers of these companies and my indignation at the attitude of their bosses, who have become wealthy on the back of the workers. The latter are made to pay for their bosses’ economic blunders, and they are now jobless, have no wages coming in, sometimes after they have been in employment for many years.</p>
<p class="contents">These workers have reaped no benefits whatsoever from their companies’ periods of prosperity, and in no way are they responsible for their difficulties. Both governments and the European institutions are helping to prolong this despicable situation, where workers are suffering to enable company owners to safeguard their assets. The money needed to finance jobs must be deducted from the wealth accumulated by shareholders, past and present, and from the resources held by banks.</p>
<p class="contents">Without this political will, these great promises on employment policy are nothing more than idle talk. So, I warn you, workers will not let themselves be pushed around forever; the greed of their bosses and the policies that favour their employers will eventually cause social upheaval. This is what will require a genuine employment policy, as it is this alone that will force those who have made their fortune on the back of others to shoulder their responsibilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, there is the method of coordination itself. It has become a popular method in the social sector with regard to a number of themes which fall within national competence but which create common problems across all European countries. It is therefore possible to put forward common goals.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Commissioner, the success of the method, given the fact that it is not a binding mechanism, relies on the moral and political pressure that can be exerted. Media attention plays an essential role in this. The employment process based on the open coordination method has now been running for some five years, and a dramatic decline has been noticed in the level of attention given to this. Media attention has waned and, as a result of this, there has been less pressure on national governments to take serious account of the objectives and of the annual criticism levelled by the Council and Commission at their national action plans.</p>
<p class="contents">The open coordination method is only successful insofar as convergence stress continues to exist, and efforts will need to be made in order to sustain its existence. The question therefore arises as to how the pressure can be kept up. In my opinion, this should be one of the crucial points in the evaluation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is best practices. The different reports include best practices for national Member States. The question is: to what extent is a policy being adopted to actually learn something from those best practices? How many Member States have visited projects in other Member States? How many best practices have been discussed in the different Member States? It is one of the methods, even if the pressure subsides, to keep the employment policy going.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore ask for both these points to be looked at in the evaluation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, this is the fourth public debate in the European Parliament on the Employment Strategy. The Employment Strategy is just one part of the European debate, but this is the first time there has been a general downturn in the economy, the first time there has been anxiety and, however much we want to avoid creating fear or panic, the situation is clearly going to be more difficult and problems with employment and economic development are bound to appear at the beginning of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Several honourable Members have raised the question of the Lisbon target, that is, is it feasible and is the proposal in question an adequate proposal now that circumstances have changed? It is true that the analyses underlying our proposed guidelines are based on the excellent results for 2000, which possibly painted the most positive picture of employment and job creation in Europe in the last twenty years.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is different now, however. Can we continue within the same framework? Can we continue with the same approach to the employment strategy? Mr Schmid put this question very clearly. I think that we should start from the following premise: thanks to the reforms introduced on the job market over recent years, the common, healthy, budgetary base in the Member States and the efforts made to achieve monetary union, the European Union is better placed than ever before to cope with a recession. Let me just remind you of previous recessions, which were exacerbated to a frightening degree by differences and fluctuations between currencies within the Union. So today, we are better, much better placed to cope with a recession.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that, obviously, if serious problems arise in the future, we have tools to deal with them in the form of monetary policy and interest rates, in the form of economic policy and the margins allowed within the Stability Pact. But what is important is for us to maintain the employment strategy without chopping and changing. It is important for us not to make short-term changes, but to keep to our objective and step up the implementation of the employment strategy. It would be a huge reversal at this stage if the Member States failed to focus their energies on efforts to apply the employment strategy as agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">There are very specific policies which the Member States need to develop in relation to the targets for employment quotas, the need to incorporate policies on the quality of work, better management of change, especially corporate restructuring, investments in human resources and policies on equal opportunities, where, it has to be said, the results of our evaluation in the joint report on employment were fairly disappointing. The Member States have not put enough emphasis on policies for equal opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">No major changes have been made in the proposed guidelines, first, because we made changes last year, taking account of the message from Lisbon, and because we are currently in the process of a more general evaluation. The changes which we propose include three basic factors. The first is the need for national targets. The Member States need to set national employment targets. The second is the need for policies on the quality of work, and the third deals with the widening wage differential between the sexes. Unfortunately, there is still a huge discrepancy, as much as 15%, between men's and women's wages for the same work.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the European Parliament resolution is concerned, I should like in particular to thank Mrs Weiler for her very serious approach and to point out that your reference to the question of rationalising procedures, to cohesiveness between individual procedures in the European Union is something we fully endorse – we are planning to move on to a new framework for the package next year – and that we agree with you wholeheartedly on the need for cohesion between the general economic policy guidelines and guidelines for employment. I would refer again here to the agreement between Parliament and the Commission and the view taken by the Council that labour issues should be dealt with within the framework of the guidelines for employment and that the guidelines for employment should be policies which are absolutely distinct from the economic guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">There are numerous points on which there is consensus and agreement. There is the question of the social partners and their role, there is the question of flexibility and security on the job market and, to reply to Mrs Van Lancker, may I say that the Commission is determined to submit a proposal for a directive by the end of the year, due to the lack of success of the social partners. This proposal is being prepared as we speak. There is a common view on the need to work with the candidate countries, so that they can incorporate the strategies for employment, and to step up policies on sexual equality.</p>
<p class="contents">Your text contains proposals for changes to the guidelines. The European Commission will examine a good number of them. Certain particularly important points to which I should like to refer are: the lack of adequate information on the financial means available to the Member States in order to apply the strategy; the need for a framework between the social partners and the Member States for applying lifelong learning to companies; the need to combine the objective of promoting mobility with reductions in regional inequalities and for stronger measures to combat illegal employment – this links up with the issue of immigration to which Mrs Weiler referred in her personal presentation – and the need to deal with specific entry barriers to women on the job market.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, we are planning to submit a revised proposal to the Council over coming weeks which takes account of these questions. I should like to offer you my warmest thanks because the open and highly interesting debate on the guidelines in Parliament has enhanced the substance and role of the strategy for employment in European policy in general.</p>
