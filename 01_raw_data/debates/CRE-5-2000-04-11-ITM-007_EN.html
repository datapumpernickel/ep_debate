But I would like to focus on two issues touching on external relations and one of those issues in particular. Briefly though, I will first of all mention our communication on election observation and assistance, which we will now be publishing and which I will look forward to discussing with Parliament over the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say straight away by way of a confession – and since Dr Paisley is not in the House I can probably make a confession – the paper does not represent a radical new approach, but it does attempt to bring order to an activity, which has become a very real growth area in recent years. We have spent EUR 150 million on this important activity. It is now clearly a first- pillar activity following the adoption of the regulations, which provide a legal basis for human rights and democratisation activity.</p>
<p class="contents">As Members of Parliament will recognise, the communication invites both Parliament and the Council to work with us on a more coordinated approach. It invites everyone to try to learn the lessons of the past. It is a very practical document. It suggests that we need greater coherence in what we are doing and I am looking forward to hearing the views of Members of Parliament on the document, which I hope they will regard as an important and useful contribution to a debate which is going to become more important, not less important, over the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to a subject on which I would like to address the Parliament at rather greater length. It is a subject which is very close to my own heart – imperfect a specimen though that may be. It is the rapid reaction facility, which we have been discussing for some time and on which we have come to some conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague, Commissioner Nielson, was talking a moment or two ago about the EU-African summit in Cairo just over a week ago. It is true that the President of the Commission, my colleagues Pascal Lamy and Poul Nielson and myself were all confronted during that summit with a litany of complaints about the slow delivery of European Union assistance. The people making those complaints were very often justified in doing so – not always – but very often. It is not a new problem, as Members of Parliament will know – particularly Members who have been on delegation visits to other countries. I have been frustrated at our slow and cumbersome procedures ever since I have arrived at the Commission last autumn. I want to say once again that this is not a problem created by our staff, who work extremely hard, thin on the ground as they are. It is a problem which they have been labouring under for a number of years.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems of slow decision-making and delivery are both structural and cultural. Our procedures are old fashioned, they are as I said 'cumbersome'. But the traditional legislative approach to Community business is also sometime ill-suited to the fast changing realities in external relations. This is particularly true for conflict prevention and it is particularly true for crisis management efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are criticised for being slow, today we are criticised for being overtaken too frequently by events, and I think to borrow a cliché 'history is not going to wait for us any longer', nor will our international partners, nor even will the Council, and they are right. We have to make sure that we are ready and capable of acting when action is needed, not six weeks later, not six months later. We have to do better and we can do better. Now we have embarked on an ambitious reform of our external assistance programmes, designed to bring a serious improvement in their effectiveness and in their speed of delivery. We will present our proposals in the next few weeks. Some things we can do relatively quickly, others will take longer if, for example, complex legal changes are required. The rapid reaction facility is something that in our judgement we can do fairly quickly if we have the support of Parliament and if we have the support of the Council. I hope that support will be forthcoming because we have time to lose. The Helsinki European Council called on us, in the context of development of the Union's crisis management structures within the ESDP, to set up a mechanism for rapid reaction. Inertia is only part of our problem today.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also be able to combine different tools more effectively and flexibly into a tailor-made mix to suit the particular situation. The rapid reaction facility responds to these needs. It is intended to allow us to draw without delay on existing Community resources and expertise to address specific crisis situations, complementing the valuable work already undertaken by ECHO in the humanitarian field. I am suggesting a mechanism with the following broad characteristics. First, there are the urgent time-limited operations in situations of crisis or emerging crisis. Action should not normally last for more than nine months. Second, where longer-term intervention is necessary, actions under the rapid reaction facility will anticipate operations under existing instruments, which can take over the action using the normal procedures. Third, as with ECHO, the procedures must be streamlined. The Commission should mostly be able to act under its own responsibility and if it has to consult Member States it will be on the simplest possible advisory basis. Fourth, the management of the rapid reaction facility will be the responsibility of a small team, the crisis coordination unit in the Directorate-General for External Relations. I do not want to build up large structures where people create work while waiting for a crisis to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">The added value of the rapid reaction facility is speed and flexibility in Community intervention in crisis situations. It will help us to overcome procedural hurdles which have slowed us down in the past and it will allow for the combination of several instruments within a single action and for a single purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I have heard concerns expressed that we are taking on new responsibilities when we should be focusing our efforts. I understand that concern, but the rapid reaction facility does not create new responsibilities, it tries to get better mileage out of what we already have. It builds on existing Community instruments, putting them to concerted use in a new framework. It can cover action in areas as diverse as human rights work, election monitoring, mediation, institution building and media support, customs and border management, mine action, support for police operations, civil emergency assistance, resettlement and rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an inevitable, indeed necessary, area of overlap with existing instruments. I repeat: the facility does not create a new instrument. It provides a mechanism for drawing more effectively on the existing ones and the overlap is limited by the procedural nature of the rapid reaction facility and the time limit to its interventions.</p>
<p class="contents">The facility is a kind of quick-start package. It will allow us to react in time and if necessary, to take the initiative in urgent circumstances. In doing so, we will be better placed to put the wealth of Community experience and resources to optimal use in the interest of the Union as a whole. But rapid reaction facility action is not meant to last longer than absolutely necessary. If it needs to be pursued beyond the immediate time frame of the crisis situation, it should be taken over as soon as practicable by the regular geographic or thematic Community instrument most suited to manage it in the longer term. That is why the Commission proposes a rather modest budget allocation for the rapid reaction facility: about EUR 30 million for this year and EUR 40 million for subsequent years.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to have sufficient funding available to get crisis action started quickly, but we do not want to tie up large resources, which could and should be put to better use in regular programmes. Similarly we do not want to create a large new bureaucracy which would hang around waiting for the next crisis to happen. I have dealt with that point earlier in my remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">In sum, I am convinced that the facility will help us both materially – I would have loved to have had it in hand when we launched the Energy for Democracy scheme last autumn – and institutionally by providing a concrete Commission contribution to the evolving ESDP. It is not an ideal solution. My own favourite economist and guru, Jane Jacobs, points out that everything is disappointing in practice. There are rarely ideal solutions, but I do think that it is a very workable solution and if, when we review the programme in three years, we find we no longer need it because we have integrated similar rapid reaction mechanisms in the regular programmes for external assistance, no one would be happier than me.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have a question pertaining to his first point. As I understand – and I am delighted to hear it – the European Commission intends to provide more structure to the way third-country elections are observed within the European Union. My question is: will this be a structure similar to that employed in the United States? I have always noticed that it is the Carter Institute which is responsible for election observation over there, and it always acquits itself of this task in a very professional and very transparent manner. The European Union, which may be present on a massive scale, is really lacking such an image. Could you explain whether you will use this American model as a gauge, because I think this is an excellent example of how things could be done and how they could be done properly? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think Members of this House will have sometimes been frustrated to discover that, on the basis of European Union funding, people from other countries, even North America, and some other countries are getting all the credit and none is coming to the European taxpayer who pays for all these things. There is no such thing as European funds, there are European Union taxpayer funds, and it is an important point to remember. Image is important and we have addressed it in this document. I hope that if the honourable Member thinks we have not done so adequately, she will let us know.

I concur with Mrs Maij-Weggen’s question. I have taken part in several election observation exercises and, according to the principle of “do good and be seen to do good”, we, and I do not mean just I, have often remarked that visibility was often lacking. Now I am all in favour of our continuing to work together with the OSCE and the Council of Europe. However, it is a poor show that we, the European Union bear all the costs, as is often the case, and yet nobody even notices that the European Parliament is present to observe the elections. I think that we should take reasonable account of visibility in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Commissioner, I should like to ask you when you intend to have at least the basic structure of your rapid reaction facility up and running, because it is also important for Parliament’s work? What sort of timetable should we be working towards? Thirdly, Commissioner, not all, but many crises to which we must react can be prevented. Are you satisfied with the state and development of crisis prevention or do you want to couple crisis prevention to the rapid reaction facility? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It states that EU visibility is not as ever-present as one would like because of a number of factors. The first is the lack of a clear EU policy and the necessary instruments to implement it. The adoption of a CFSP joint action is no guarantee of increased visibility, as people found in Nigeria last year.</p>
<p class="contents">Another factor is the participation of the European Union under the umbrella of other international actors. That has often been a problem in the Balkans, and one with which the honourable Member will be familiar. In other cases, like Palestine, the lack of visibility was due to insufficient effort with the media.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we finish perhaps a shade provocatively: "Unlike the United States the European Union does not appoint retired high-level politicians for this kind of job." We have politicians who are actually still in the kitchen feeling the heat. Maybe we should learn something from that, though I agree that there are some important high-level retired politicians whom one would not want to see necessarily supervising elections. At which point discretion is the better part of valour.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as far as the rapid reaction facility is concerned, I want to see this up and running as quickly as possible. I have enough anecdotes to justify my impatience. I have no doubt at all that our "energy for democracy" programme, which I mentioned in my remarks, has been an extraordinary success. The mayor of one of the towns which has benefited wrote last week to his colleagues in the Serbian opposition making that point. We are now looking at what we can do during the summer, now the winter emergency is over, to build on it.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor have I any doubt at all that the tortures of the damned which our officials had to go through to get the scheme launched would have been much easier to cope with had we had a facility like this. Anybody who thinks that we do not need one should just try talking to our officials who were operating pillar 4 in UNMIK in Kosovo. Again, there is a legion of almost unbelievable stories which underline the importance of a facility like this – a facility that is not a cop-out, not a way of getting round budgetary procedures but one that allows us within our existing budget to do things more effectively and more flexibly.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, if you can act more rapidly, you make a contribution to crisis prevention. It is one of the oldest saws in the book that it is incomparably more expensive to fight a war than to keep the peace. Very often what is required to keep the peace or to prevent a crisis is not just doing things generously but doing them quickly and generously. We are, as the honourable Member knows because he has been in this business much longer than I, actively involved in trying to develop an intellectually respectable case for preventative diplomacy, trying to pull together all the various non-military capacity headline goals which we think are required.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of things we will be doing. I look forward to coming to Parliament with some further ideas over the coming months.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that it would make sense if you as Commissioner supported the view that the late payment directive should also apply to the European institutions, because then payment could be made, if there was a legal basis, within a certain period of time, namely between 21 and 30 days or, we hope, even sooner. The idea is that the late payment directive could also be applied in these areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, concerning coordination: what will the relationship be between this unit and the European Union special envoys? One of the problems we had with Kosovo was not just coordination within the Commission but also coordination among the Member States of the actions they took as individual governments.

For a start, it would be nice always to know what Member States are doing.</p>
<p class="contents">The High Representative and his colleagues in the secretariat are bending their best efforts to try to achieve that at the moment. They are trying to explain, for example, to the United States the full scale of what Europe is doing in the Balkans. We have had problems which should not have arisen because we have not always known in sufficient detail exactly what Member States, as well as the European Commission, are up to. So we need to work more closely and in a more coordinated way. That is an issue which the High Representative and I are attempting to take on more positively. I hope that the Stability Pact conference a couple of weeks ago was a help along that road but we will certainly continue to pursue that issue.</p>
<p class="contents">On the relationship between the rapid reaction facility and the special envoys who are, of course, responsible to the Council – even though we are responsible for the budget – we will want to work closely with them. There are some in particular whose activities bear on the sort of things we might find ourselves wanting to support through the rapid reaction facility, like the work being done by one of our special envoys in the Great Lakes region in Africa. We will keep in touch with them.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that the sums of money that we are talking about are going to give us budgetary problems. We can manage EUR 30 or 40 million. I am sure I shall have other opportunities to come back to Parliament and explain some of the pressures we have with much bigger items of expenditure in category 4.One of my continuing obsessions is the gap between the language of our communiqués and what is agreed when finance ministers meet to discuss these things. I am looking forward to what is called a full and frank exchange with Parliament on those issues.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is very difficult to compartmentalise these crises. Very often you need to use a number of instruments. For example, we discovered very early on in the Mozambique crisis the requirement for helicopters and the importance of using some military capacities in support of civil-power operations. What we have to ensure is that there are not any "Chinese walls" between these various operations.</p>
<p class="contents">There need to be "Chinese walls" only in the budgetary sense. We need to make it absolutely clear that we are not using the rapid reaction facility to cut corners in our budgetary practices, which are not justified by an emergency on the spot.

It would be challenging politically, to get up and make a speech in favour of incoherence. The honourable Member is entirely right about that. But one has to bear in mind two important facts about ECHO. ECHO is justifiably jealous of its reputation for delivering humanitarian assistance without political strings being attached and without any political infusion. For example, you can distinguish very well between the humanitarian assistance which ECHO has given in Serbia and the assistance we have given through the Energy through Democracy programme. They both help to improve people's lives made miserable by Mr Milosevic but they clearly have different triggers and slightly different purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is very often the case that what marketing managers would call the deliverables are different. Very often with ECHO one is talking about food, medicine and blankets. With our rapid reaction facility one is very often talking about advisors, mediators, observers, customs officials, police officers, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">There are differences. But I totally accept that there is a need for more cohesion. It is a considerable advantage that in this Commission the external relations commissioners work together as a team. We are about to start sharing all the programming decisions together. I very much hope that, without breaking down some important distinctions, we can ensure that the Community's various instruments, which involve the expenditure of quite substantial amounts of assistance, are moving together in the same direction.

I shall be setting out the figures for our actual disbursements of food aid in Ethiopia and Eritrea.</p>
<p class="contents">I just wish to add two points. Firstly, I do not share the honourable Member's views on ECHO: it does a very good job in difficult circumstances. I want to make this point about the Horn of Africa. I was a development minister from 1986 to 1989 and I spent much of my time trying to deal with the food crisis then in Ethiopia and Eritrea.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel rather strongly that we have managed over the years, despite problems from time to time, to increase our ability to get food and other assistance to people in the most appallingly difficult circumstances. We have managed to increase our ability to deliver humanitarian assistance. What we have not done is to increase our ability to make that humanitarian assistance unnecessary in the first place. There is a food crisis in the Horn of Africa. There are two large armies dug into trenches, buying expensive military equipment from other countries with money which should be going to agricultural extension, to improving water schemes and the life chances of babies and young mothers. So I hope I catch your eye tomorrow in the debate and make some of these points.</p>
<p class="contents">I have great sympathy for the problems being faced by Ethiopia and Eritrea. However, I have to say that I was dealing with these problems 13 or 14 years ago and, alas, much less has happened to the good than one would have liked.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
