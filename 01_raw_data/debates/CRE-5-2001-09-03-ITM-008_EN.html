<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Κoukiadis (PSE)</span></span>  <span class="italic">, rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Madam President, we should all look on the report on the application of Community law as one of the all important reports because this is the report which reflects the real state of the European Union, which measures its heart beat and how it relates to the man in the street on a daily basis. This report is the first to be drafted for this new decade, which is also the beginning of a new century, and I think that it could turn out to be an opportunity to take a more integrated approach to the problems associated with the practical operation of the single market, the European Union as a whole, and the vision of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of three new factors, impending enlargement on an unprecedented scale, the quest for the deepening of the European Union and the ever-increasing rate of legislative intervention, we need to radically rethink how we control the application of Community law. This entire subject is inextricably bound up with the review of the Treaties and should be one of the top items on the agenda for the next Intergovernmental Conference. The White Paper identifies the problems; all we need to do now is to see how we can resolve them.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless we eliminate delays in transposing directives and unless we forge a uniform interpretation of Community law, there will be no single economic area and it will be impossible to promote the idea of European citizenship. A citizen from one country who goes to work in another country and has trouble getting his professional qualifications recognised feels like a foreigner, not a European. Competition rules applied selectively in various countries adulterate European competition and so on and so forth. That is why the question of the application of Community law must be a matter of concern to each and every one of us and why we must put it at the top of our agenda. It is futile to spend hours at a time debating whether or not this or that amendment will get through and then do almost nothing to check if a directive is being applied. Greater importance needs to be attached to this report because it reflects real life in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">A second line of approach taken in the report is to question what becomes of suggestions by the European Parliament from previous reports. I have read several previous reports containing interesting suggestions. I was surprised to discover that most fall by the wayside. However, more importantly, the Commission report contains no explanation as to why these suggestions were not applied. We need to find a way of ensuring that Parliament's suggestions are followed up.</p>
<p class="contents">The third basic comment is that, despite the improvements reflected in the data on the application of Community law, these improvements are not constant; there are reversals and the improvements are not impressive enough to appease us. The general diagnosis remains the same. We should therefore pay serious attention to this phenomenon and deal separately with the multiple reasons and causes for it.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to use the time left to draw a few general conclusions. The best rate of transposition is in Denmark, with an average of 98%. As far as procedures for controlling infringements are concerned, we must remember that the control system as a whole is based on 4 stages. Letters of formal notice, which constitute the first stage, ran into large numbers. The three countries which received most letters were France, Italy and Greece, with 236, 160 and 154 and the three which received the fewest were Denmark, Finland and Sweden, with 40, 43 and 46. The number of reasoned opinions, which constitute the second stage, was fairly small, proving that this procedure is effective for certain countries and extremely effective for others. In all events, the relative reduction in the time taken to send out letters of formal notice and reasoned opinions is one positive aspect of attempts to speed up the control procedure. As far as referrals to the Court are concerned, the number of cases of non-compliance again fell significantly.</p>
<p class="contents">Our general conclusions are as follows: first, there has been a gradual reduction of 35%-40% from one stage to the next; secondly, the order of countries committing infringements remains the same at all stages; thirdly, at the third stage the number of cases of non-compliance is marginal for certain countries, with other countries persisting; fourthly, the efficiency of control procedures should not be used to play down the fact that these procedures are used by the Member States as a way of delaying the date of transposition, thereby creating a new de facto transitional period.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that certain countries with different systems constantly perform worst, while certain other countries perform best means that, basically, infringements are a matter of political will. In other words, the problem of the application of Community law is a political problem and not a legal or technocratic one, as many believe. It masks the clash between national sovereignty and European authority and reveals just how much the European conscience has matured. Finally, the Commission has not analysed the circumstances or reasons behind these statistics. I do not wish to take up any more of your time but I would like to say a word or two about the amendments. I can accept two of the three proposed amendments. I do not understand Mrs Thors' amendment and it requires clarification if it is to be accepted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is obvious.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Koukiadis on his kindness – and I would go as far as to say his wisdom – in including the conclusions of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in his report.</p>
<p class="contents">I am speaking as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment, and this suits me because I would like to pose the question out loud, before you all, of what kind of Europe it is we want to build.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1996 in Turin, the French President, Mr Chirac, said that if Europe only makes progress along the economic route, the commercial route, it would be a failure. He said that we had to deal with the situation of the Europeans, that we had to revive the idea of the European, and that that would herald the road to success.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that my country, Spain, is beginning to prepare for the Presidency, the competent authorities, the President, Mr Aznar, and the Ministers, talk every day about the idea of creating more Europe. What does more Europe mean? Probably realising the contents of our Charter of Fundamental Rights, that is to say, a Europe which is concerned about Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why this report is important and essential, and I would like to highlight certain points in it.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, something that should be of concern to all of us – in the Commission and in the Council – and that is the transposition of directives, because it is precisely in the social sphere that a very low percentage of directives is transposed when compared to other fields or to transposition in general.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there are certain especially sensitive subjects; our professions always accompany us and, as a works inspector, I am enormously concerned that in the fields of safety and health at work, directives are not transposed more quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, equality. I believe that we must demand from the Commission more power to impose fines, which would have sufficient coercive effect, greater inclination to coordinate the different governments of the Member States, in order to achieve that greater coordination and, in summary, greater intensity in its activities, so that the principles enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights might become reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After we had prepared the report, two important documents came from the Commission. I am thinking firstly of the White Paper on governance and secondly of the communication on the Information and Communication Policy. Having studied these documents, I am quite confused about the way in which the Commission intends to help us supervise the application of Community law and about how it intends to prioritise the issues concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Where, firstly, the Information and Communication Policy is concerned, the communication says that the future of what is known as the European justice system is in the process of being looked into. In sharp contrast to what is stated in the communication, we in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market had been given to understand that this network of specialised lawyers, which can provide people with advice and which operates at the Commission’s delegations in the Member States, was viewed as valuable by the Commission. The June communication now tells us that the Commission is considering how the system is to look in the future and that the tasks of the lawyers concerned are perhaps to be transferred to national administrations.</p>
<p class="contents">Who, I should like to ask the Commission, believes that a national administration will help people obtain justice from the self-same administration?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I am confused about the fact that, according to the White Paper on governance, there is a desire for ‘networks of similar existing bodies in the Member States capable of dealing with disputes involving citizens and EU issues’, at the same time as an intention to improve people’s knowledge of their rights under Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">How does the Commission intend that we should monitor the application of Community law? I believe that we need to do some serious thinking, and I think that the Commission could have been more practical when it came to how this very issue was dealt with in the White Paper. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is true, as my Spanish colleague said, that there is a low level of transposition in the social field of only 71% of directives, but it is even truer that in the Commission, on environmental issues, there is not only poor transposition, but flagrant non-compliance, which is the worst thing: lack of application.</p>
<p class="contents">This is something that we note every day in the Committee on Petitions, since it is the main form of non-compliance: 40% of non-compliances reported by citizens to the Committee on Petitions relate to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Koukiadis rightly says in his report, the right to petition is the principle <span class="italic">par excellence</span> of the recognition of European citizenship and therefore we should be worried by this repeated non-compliance in the social and environmental fields, which are so closely related to the rights of that European citizenship. If we examine each of the petitions which reach the Committee on Petitions – naturally I am most familiar with the petitions which come from my country – we will note the enormous interest amongst European citizens in collecting information and perfectly understanding Community law in order to report non-compliances with great rigour.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore believe that in the annual report a section should be dedicated to petitions, as the rapporteur rightly says, because it is in that committee that a real contribution to compliance with Community law is made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bernié (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, with 1075 formal notices, 470 reasoned opinions, 178 referrals to the Court of Justice – twice as many as in 1998 – the 1999 balance sheet for the application of Community Law is proof enough of serious discontent.</p>
<p class="contents">To tell the truth of the matter, Europe legislates too much and too badly. It even manages to legislate in areas where it has no competence. It did this in 1979 with the ‘conservation of wild birds’ directive and more recently, without any legal foundation, on the status and financing of European political parties.</p>
<p class="contents">If Member States drag their feet in transposing Community law into national law, if disputes have multiplied in number, it is because European regulation is often restrictive, finicky, unsuited to local realities and far removed from the worries of our fellow citizens, that is, when it is not directly opposed to their will and our republican principles. Additionally, last year the French government proclaimed its disagreement with the ‘genome’ directive. Mrs Guigou, the Minister of Justice, felt that this directive, was "incompatible with French bioethical laws, with the code for industrial property and also the civil code that prohibits the marketing of the human body".</p>
<p class="contents">Can we, in the name of Europe and its qualified majority, impose legislation upon a people who reject it? This is a fundamental problem. Should we standardise everything and sacrifice our differences, our true European diversity? We do not think so. In addition, in a democracy, it is not the business of the Court of Justice to create legislation through case law. It is up to elected representatives. At the present time, MEPs, uniquely elected by universal suffrage, have no true right of legislative initiative, a monopoly that is jealously guarded by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not by using the threat of fines and penalties in the unrelenting attempt to apply poor texts, as Article 15 so clearly wants, that Europe will solve problems. Stubbornness has its limits and when a text is poor, there should be the clear-mindedness and the courage to change it, as we are proposing to do with Article 12.</p>
<p class="contents">It would therefore be a good idea to legislate less in order to legislate better, to respect national will and democracy by applying the principle of subsidiarity to the maximum. For example, regulation on the transport of hydrocarbons is becoming an urgent matter, but once again it has been postponed indefinitely for purely mercenary reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Contrary to that stated in item M of the preamble, we do not think that strict application of Community law will lead towards the emergence of an unwanted European nationality. We are too worried about the respect of identities, of democracy and the right to difference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, the application of Community law is the cause of an ever-growing number of problems, for according to the Commission’s own report, it has opened 2270 files on this subject since 1999, compared with just 124 in 1978. This rapid increase is caused on the one hand by the constant proliferation of Community Law, and on the other hand, from the increased severity of a Commission that has at its disposal, since the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty, effective instruments of oppression, notably Articles 226 and 228 of the EC Treaty. The report we are debating today in the European Parliament adds further to this sense of repression, for it urges the Commission to use these articles more than ever before, to threaten Member States with fines or penalties to a greater extent, and even to propose a new system of automatic sanctions applicable to those who do not transpose Community directives quickly or sufficiently enough.</p>
<p class="contents">So why do Member States, who are supposed to have accepted the Council’s directives, drag their feet when it comes to applying them? This is the big question everybody seems to avoid. As far as I am concerned there are three answers. Firstly, a bizarre side effect of the extension of qualified majority voting causes institutions to have what I will call a type of regulatory illusion. We think that because we have voted by a majority in the Council, everything is solved. In reality, however, if members of the minority have good enough reasons and if application does not follow through on ground level, nothing is solved. And to redress the balance, we launch Europe into a downwards spiral of repression that better consensus at the start would have prevented.</p>
<p class="contents">Second cause of non-application: the unsuitability of certain parts of Community Law, such as the 1979 Directive on the conservation of wild birds, toughened further by the Court of Justice behind the back even of the Council. In a case such as this, which, take note, is from a unanimously adopted directive, what is lacking is the opportunity for an automatic revision to be made after a ten year period, at the request of a single Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the third cause of non-application: certain directives are still not transposed or are badly transposed because the governmental representatives sitting on the Council wanted to turn over a new leaf in relation to Europe by closing their eyes to future difficulties that they of course knew would be inevitable. This is for example what has taken place in France with Directive 98/44 on the patentability of living matter, which now proves to be non-transposable because it is contrary to several essential parts of our own law. This is, alas, the usual behaviour of French leaders, up to the highest level. Nowadays, we agree to sign such and such a European text, not daring to raise objections, and tomorrow we will have to deal with their application. It is precisely this that has just taken place with the Treaty of Nice, and France will have a high price to pay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallis (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, the rapporteur should be congratulated on his wide-ranging and important report and he has rightly identified the problems of transposition and application of Community law, mainly with regard to directives. But we may have seen nothing yet, because we are moving into an era of new legislation – the era of co-regulation. Will this in future form part of Community law, whose application and uniformity we should be looking out for?</p>
<p class="contents">In its White Paper on governance, the Commission states that co-regulation will not be appropriate where rules need to apply in a uniform way. Nor will it be appropriate where fundamental rights or political choices are called into question. Yet this year we had to produce Parliament's own-initiative report on the EEJ-Net, a European alternative dispute network set up by the Commission using a co-regulatory approach. Yet what could be more fundamental than our citizens' access to justice or the way that law is applied and dispensed? Will we be watching every arbitrator and regulator to make sure that Community law is correctly applied? We have enough trouble at the moment with the normal judiciary.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to be aware of these issues. They are fundamental to our citizens and also to the rights of this Parliament as a co-legislator, not to mention their possible fragmentary effect on the achievements of the internal market if they are not very carefully monitored by this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU stands or falls according to whether or not a common, effective legal system is established. Community law, the ‘<span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>’ and European unity are based upon European law. However, the problem, which is illustrated very clearly in the Commission’s report as well as in the previous reports and in this one, is that there is no such thing as European law, any more than there is such a thing as a single European people. There are profound differences between the different legal systems. The Roman-dominated common law and the Nordic legal traditions are incredibly different on a range of crucial points. Legal systems cannot, as it were, be transplanted like flowers from one pot to another. There are a number of structural, or what might be called cultural, differences, and that is also transparently obvious from this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph D contains a statement well worth noting. The European Parliament believes that one of the reasons for the poor implementation of Community law is the inability ‘correctly to understand secondary Community legislation’. I thought that this was a translation error, even though the translation services are well thought of, but we find the same turn of phrase in a number of other languages: ‘<span class="italic">l'impossibilité d'une compréhension correcte</span>’, ‘<span class="italic">umuligt at opnå en korrekt forståelse</span>’<span class="italic"> </span>etc. It is therefore impossible to achieve a correct application of secondary Community legislation. That is certainly an interesting acknowledgement. It might even be imagined that, as previous speakers have suggested, integration and supranational regulation have consequently gone too far, but that is not the conclusion. As is made clear, using almost military technology, on page 11 of the report, the conclusion is that we must establish a system leading to the ‘elimination of national opposition’. If Community law and national legislation are inconsistent, respect for national legal traditions will decline, and this may perhaps be an explanation of why, not only in Denmark but also in Ireland and many other places, there is growing opposition to this system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kinnock,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – The report on monitoring the application of Community law that is before the House today is the seventeenth that has been produced in response to the request originally made by this House in a resolution in 1983. These reports give, as the House knows, an annual record of the work of the Commission in discharging one of the most vital parts of its role as guardian of the Treaties by taking action against infringements under Article 226 of the Treaty. It is obviously right for the House to scrutinise these activities. The Commission is gratified by the fact that Parliament has given a warm welcome to this latest report and grateful also to Mr Koukiadis and his colleagues for their work.</p>
<p class="contents">Every year, each of the two periodical reports on suspected infringements produced before infringement proceedings are open and each of the two reports on established infringements that are produced after notice has been given to the Member State concerned cover some 2 000 or so cases investigated by the Commission. The bulk of these are individual cases of incorrect application of Community law by the Member States' authorities. Clearly it is only possible to deal with such a caseload with a procedure which combines the advantages of individual examination of cases, speedy processing and compliance with the principle of collective responsibility applied in the Commission. The development of an efficient computerised system is also essential to fulfilling this task. For this reason a single management database has been set up, covering all infringement files opened by the Commission and covering data on the transposal of directives by Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">One benefit of this system is that it enables the Commission to take action systematically against Member States which have not adopted national measures to implement directives before the time allowed for transposal is completed. As the House will know, this is not an obsession with uniformity for some bureaucratic reason. It is essential in the interests of equity across the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of an efficient computerised system will also make it possible to report in greater detail to the public on the action taken by the Commission to monitor application of Community law whenever a decision has been taken to issue a reasoned opinion or to refer a case to the court. The Commission is continuing its policy of issuing immediate press releases, which we first established in 1998, and in addition, since January of this year, decisions giving notice of an infringement, issuing a reasoned opinion, referring the case to court or terminating a case have also been published on the European Communities' Europa server as soon as they have been adopted by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The peer pressure exerted by this greater transparency of decisions that relate to infringements by Member States may also help to promote more rapid conformity from Member States as they all now learn immediately of the decisions taken against each of them. Greater transparency can also be seen as a guarantee of fair hearing of complaints.</p>
<p class="contents">The House will be aware that because the Commission has a privileged position in bringing infringement proceedings it therefore has a unique ability to safeguard the interests of complainants. The guarantees offered by the Commission have been built up over time and they now mean procedural arrangements, which ensure registration of the complaint, strict confidentiality and information for complainants who may make their views known before any decision is taken to close the case. We are dedicated to ensuring maximum strength and maximum dependability in these vital procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">In its reply to the Ombudsman on the criticism of the management of the infringement case concerning the award of the contract for building the Thessaloniki metro, the Commission has therefore pledged itself to consolidating the administrative rules for complainants in order to facilitate contracts between complainants and Commission departments. Parliament will be informed of this consolidation as soon as it is complete.</p>
<p class="contents">The report adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market – which is the basis for the motion for a resolution before the House today – contains several findings and recommendations. For brevity, I hope that the House will permit me to deal only with the main ones.</p>
<p class="contents">I begin by saying that the Commission does not agree with the report's conclusions that the growing volume of infringements handled by the Commission departments, in particular on the basis of complaints, reflects a deterioration in the application of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">The main reasons for that are as follows. Firstly, the overall volume of complaints and of cases handled is actually stable. The number of complainants registered even dropped slightly in 2000. Secondly, account must be taken of successive Community enlargements and the expansion of Community law, particularly in connection with the Community's wider powers and the growing public and business awareness of Community law. These are all factors that affect the number of infringements handled by the Commission and on that basis the increase in the absolute number of cases handled is a positive development rather than something that should cause disquiet. As Mr Koukiadis states in his report, it is important that every effort should be made to get to the root of infringements and find ways of reducing their number without relying exclusively on the standard infringement procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the interpretation of statistics in the annual report, the scope for interpreting the figures is still restricted because of the many causes of infringements, the Commission's great dependence on complaints and the political dimension of the work arising from the fact that proceedings are at the Commission's discretion. The Commission is in a position to determine an order of priority for proceedings by reference to, firstly, the perceived damage to the Community legal order, secondly the perceived damage to the interest protected by the rule that has been breached, thirdly the recurrent nature of certain infringements which are the subject of individual or collective complaints and fourthly the harm caused to Community's financial interests. In addition, topical events in any given area of the Community law can also trigger an increase in complaints to the Commission and cause the Commission to step up its action to satisfy the needs of the political agenda. The various stages in the completion of the single market were a good example of that. The increasing awareness of the possibility of infringement of environmental law is another instance. All of these points are of course made in very clear terms in the White Paper, which is, as some Members have reminded us, to be considered in this House tomorrow. It must be borne in mind that the national courts are the first guardians of the Community legal order and therefore the Commission deals with a relatively small proportion of Community law infringements.</p>
<p class="contents">It also has to be recognised that, since much of this law is made up of directives which have to be transposed into the Member States' domestic legal systems, once they have been transposed, the instrument concerned belongs to domestic law and any infringement must be dealt with by the national courts. I know that is understood in this House, but I spell it out for the record in the hope that it might eventually trickle through to the understanding of the press in Member States and maybe eventually to the public, who are persuaded daily by the newspapers that there is a great centralising process going on in the European Union when in fact the opposite is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">The report from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market refers to the need to shorten the time taken to deal with complaints. Naturally we sympathise with that objective and we are therefore contacting relevant Member States with a view to securing faster compliance with Community law and reducing Member States own handling times, particularly by greater use of the computerised system. As I have already said, in the interests of greater transparency the Commission is now publishing its decisions to send letters of formal notice, to issue reasoned opinions, to refer cases to the Court or to close or withdraw cases immediately a decision has been taken.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also stress that specifically in response to Parliament's concern, the 18th Annual Report relating to the year 2000 will contain a specific section on the management of exceptions to the harmonisation which Member States enjoy under Article 95 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also notes Parliament's concern about the need to improve cooperation between the Commission and the national authorities responsible for implementing secondary legislation. As you know, there are regular contacts between Commission departments about specific problems with the application of Community law through package meetings and so-called directives missions. However, the Commission is also looking at ways of improving the procedure for the notification of national implementing measures as an extension of the IDA programme for the interchange of data between administrations. That work involves the networking of Community and national legal databases covering directives and national implementing measures and will also give the public easier access to Community law and assist with the training of lawyers in Community law. The network will also provide direct access to the reports on domestic application of Community law produced by specific national authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Commission action on monitoring Community law is crucial to fulfilling our essential mission of preserving the Community legal order, fairly, firmly, consistently, and with public understanding. The active interest of this House in such activities is invaluable and we are therefore grateful to it for its continuing support and understanding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
