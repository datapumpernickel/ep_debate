<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio, Loyola,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that today’s debate is an important one. We are about to enter the final phase of the legislative process relating to the range of measures on the internal energy market.</p>
<p class="contents">I would insist that I consider it important to bear in mind that this package is emblematic within the Lisbon process, the objective of which, we must remember, is to create a more competitive Europe, with an economy which by 2010 will place the European Union at the cutting edge of international economic activity, with a knowledge-based society, full employment and also respect for the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly like to stress the extremely positive role the European Parliament has been playing throughout this procedure, in the quest for the result which I hope we will achieve during this part-session. The European Parliament has always firmly supported the Commission in its efforts to create a competitive and integrated internal energy market, which furthermore means moving beyond national markets.</p>
<p class="contents">I would sincerely like to thank the three rapporteurs, Mr Turmes, Mr Rapkay and Mr Mombaur, for the fantastic job they have done. And I would also like to mention the shadow rapporteurs and the other members of the committee who have participated actively over recent months in particular in order to achieve this positive result; I would particularly like to express my gratitude for the efforts of the delegation which has been negotiating within an informal tripartite dialogue so that we could hold this discussion today and on Wednesday reach an agreement in this Parliament allowing us to achieve a definitive text.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise we are reaching does not differ substantially from the Commission’s initial proposals. What is more, these proposals have subsequently been reinforced by a series of points following first reading by Parliament, particularly with regard to the public service aspects laid down in the Directives. Once this series of measures has been established, all European Union consumers will be able to choose their provider from 2007. Small consumers will not therefore be deprived of this right and of these internal market advantages.</p>
<p class="contents">From a structural point of view, many of the obstacles to fair competition will be removed, in particular the lack of independence of system operators and the absence of effective rules. At the same time, the public service requirements have been reinforced, largely, I would insist, at the request and on the initiative of this Parliament, with the universal service obligation in the electricity sector and strict protection measures for vulnerable consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">The range of measures includes an essential component relating to the internal electricity market, that is, the Regulation on cross-border electricity exchanges which lays down clear rules in order to facilitate trade in the European Union. Although Parliament and the Commission would have liked to have made quicker progress with regard to a series of points, such as the opening up of the market and legal separation, I consider it essential that the directives establish unconditional dates and that the regulatory framework is clear for the industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Everybody now knows what the rules are going to be and I would therefore insist that this is a very important step forward. The common positions have improved the results of the parliamentary amendments, above all with regard to labelling and the competences of the regulatory authority. The degree of influence of the parent company over the activities of the network operators has also been clearly defined.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an aspect which I would like to deal with expressly this afternoon, because it is one of the most controversial aspects. It is of course the issue of the funds for decommissioning nuclear power stations. We all know that it is an essential part of the agreement reached. So much so that the last Conference of Presidents has included it as a specific point in this afternoon’s debate, Mr President. I would like to present the Commission's positions with regard to it. Firstly, as I said on the occasion of the debate on these texts at first reading, the Commission fully shares Parliament’s concern that the funds reserved for decommissioning and waste management should be spent as they were intended to be. On 30 January 2003, the Commission adopted two proposals for directives relating to a Community strategy and standards on the safety of nuclear power stations and the treatment of waste. The first of them focuses specifically on the issue of funds for nuclear decommissioning. I would like to remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that I committed myself to this before Parliament at the first reading of the legislative package, and that in January 2003 I gave the response I had committed myself to at that time.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, following our contacts during the tripartite dialogue, we have reached an agreement amongst the co-legislators on the basis of an interinstitutional declaration and a Commission declaration on control and transparency in the management of those funds. In particular, Mr President, and in accordance with the request of the Conference of Presidents, I would like to refer to the statement which the Commission will make, a statement which corresponds to the Commission as a whole and which has been debated within the College of Commissioners. In the statement, the Commission points out the importance of guaranteeing that the funds established for decommissioning and waste management activities relating to the objectives of the Euratom Treaty are managed transparently and used solely for those activities. Within this context, and within the limits of its responsibilities in accordance with the Euratom Treaty, the Commission intends to publish an annual report on the use of the funds for decommissioning and waste management. In particular it will stress the need to guarantee the full application of the relevant provisions of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the Commission will review the situation of the funds and their use in an annual report, which will be transparent and will be communicated to this House. Thanks to the specific directive and the Commission's report, I am satisfied that this issue is coming to fruition and that it will impose greater transparency in relation to these funds because, ladies and gentlemen, although you proposed it here, in Parliament, I believe it is something that concerns all of us, and that in the meantime the facts have proved us right with regard to the need to deal with this issue, and I am thinking specifically of something that happened over recent months in a company in Great Britain.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to repeat that the Commission accepts all those amendments which are in line with the agreement reached.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by thanking Parliament once again and in particular the three rapporteurs and the delegation which has participated in the negotiations with the Council and the Commission within this informal tripartite dialogue which we have carried out and for the constructive work they have done with regard to all these measures. I believe that, without this fundamental contribution, we would not be on the point of creating the most integrated internal energy market in the world, a market which means, furthermore, implementing the Community model, that is to say, liberalisation together with regulation, something which previously was thought to be contradictory, but which, as we in Europe are demonstrating, can be combined: the advantages of the market and the maintenance of a cohesive society, from which nobody is excluded, which not only looks after the weakest, but which also thinks of the future, of future generations and specifically of the protection of our environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Turmes (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, after three years of intense debate, Parliament will this week vote on the second directives on the electricity and gas markets. What did Parliament and the rapporteurs try to achieve? Instead of focusing only on the quantitative aspects of market opening, Parliament and the rapporteurs have made efforts to ensure that equal importance is given to the qualitative aspects. I am proud to be able to say today that we have managed to re-regulate and to make this market 'greener' in many areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who are sceptical about the process of liberalisation will have to admit that this second directive on electricity implies a much better regulatory environment than was the case with the first directive from 1996.</p>
<p class="contents">What have we achieved? The objectives of the market today give equal status to competition, security of supply and the environment. Secondly, we have stronger regulators and we have taken the first step on the way to unbundling the separate interests of grid generation and retail. We were able to strengthen the public service obligations and impose stronger obligations on grid companies to ensure the necessary investment. There are strong requirements on the suppliers of electricity to inform customers in the contracts. I am particularly happy that we have obliged the suppliers to give full information on the mix of electricity and on the environmental consequences of their production.</p>
<p class="contents">This will allow consumers in Europe to make an informed choice. It will also allow society to continue the debate on energy services. We also have a universal service, but not only that, we now also have the obligation to establish a supplier of last resort.</p>
<p class="contents">All these measures will not be enough, however, to ensure that small customers will receive the benefits of the liberalised market. A single domestic customer will have to compete with big industrial consumers to get a fair price. It is only because we will favour and encourage small customers to bundle together in order to form sales communities that small consumers will now be able to get a good price.</p>
<p class="contents">We were also able to strengthen the status of decentralised energy producers. We managed to establish the concept of long-term avoided costs. This will mean that the practice in certain countries, where you pay as much to transport energy for 200 metres from a co-generation unit to a neighbour as you pay to transport energy for over 500 kilometres will change and this will give small generators a real chance. It is the small generators, the innovation which we have through the miniaturisation of engines, the intelligent grids we have through the development of software, together with new independent power producers, that will be the panacea of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">But these innovations will only come onto the market if, as politicians, we have the courage to impose a real level playing field. Innovation will not come from dinosaurs. Therefore we have to be careful over the next few years to ensure that the large integrated companies are not allowed to play too many games. We need ownership unbundling. We need ring-fencing of the decommissioning funds. It is absolutely nonsensical to speak of a level playing field if we allow the EDF to use EUR 30 billion, Eon EUR 12 billion and RWE EUR 10 billion from the decommissioning funds in the market. We also need a much more stringent merger policy against these oligopolies which are coming onto the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally – and probably the most important point – we need one competition policy for one market. We cannot allow double standards in a single European market and we therefore need the DG Competition competences under the EU Treaty rules on competition. The game which the Commission, and especially Mr Lamoureux, as head of DG TREN played with the Council and Parliament over the last weeks is not right. This was an attempt to remove the decommissioning funds from Mr Monti's competences on competition policy. Commissioner, you did a good job on ensuring the establishment of an internal market. The games must stop. We as a Parliament will not accept double standards on competition policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to thank all the rapporteurs for their good cooperation. Often it was trust in the rapporteurs that secured this important piece of legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rapkay (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. –<span class="italic"> (DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by making the point with which my friend Mr Turmes concluded his speech, namely that we owe a debt of gratitude to our fellow rapporteurs and to the shadow rapporteurs. We have a total of two years of work behind us, and I have found the cooperation between the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs right across the groups to be highly collegial, very frank and full of trust, something I believe to be reflected in the outcome that we have achieved. I think this is a good result.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make four observations following on from what Mr Turmes has just said, with which I can only agree. Firstly, this legislative package opens up the way for more competition in Europe’s energy markets. In opening up the way for a truly integrated internal market in energy, we are making a contribution – our contribution – towards our shared goal of making the European Union the most competitive region in the world. We have to make use of the efficiency gains arising from an integrated internal market and its capacity for bringing about political integration in order to achieve this goal, but also especially so that our small and medium-sized enterprises should benefit from this internal market, and so that other consumers benefit more than they have done in the past from its outcomes and from its positive effects.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the essential consequence of previous directives on the internal market was that markets were opened up in an unbalanced way. They certainly brought about greater competitiveness, enhanced efficiency and reduced prices, but the unbalanced development of the opened markets and substantial deficiencies in the detailed rules mean that we now have to enact specific measures to speed up the process of opening up markets still further. This means that we have to ensure equal conditions for all participants in the market, minimise the danger of the market being dominated, and, as far as possible, put a stop to predatory practices, for example those engaged in by the big players to the detriment of small enterprises. The fact is that we are not aiming at the replacement of public monopolies by private ones, but at a wide-open internal market in energy.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is, therefore, indisputable. An essential component of what we have submitted to the vote in this House is to lay down an ambitious timetable for the complete opening-up of the market. The timetable that we have now laid down jointly with the Council is ambitious, and, if we can make it work, this will be a great leap forward in comparison with what we have had so far.</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth point is that the access of third parties to the network – competition, in other words – has to be regulated, with transparency but without discrimination. One of the essentials for this is unbundling, the use of company law to unbundle the network from production on the one hand and retailing on the other. We need one or more regulatory authorities with supervisory capacity, with the capacity and obligation to report, but, above all, the power to give instructions and the capacity to impose sanctions. We have also established the need for the State to be able to impose obligations for the general benefit without at the same time nullifying competition. Although the basis on which this will be done is laid down in an appropriate way in the directives that we will be voting on the day after tomorrow, it remains incumbent on the Commission to keep a very watchful eye on market developments. It is the Commission that must take appropriate measures to prohibit anti-competitive conduct by companies, and, above all, the Commission that must see to it that the Member States transpose the directive properly and promptly. It must be conceded that the Council has, in the informal trilogue, moved some way from its original position and closer to that of Parliament, but that was urgently necessary in view of the fact that a number of detailed rules in one or more of the Common Positions were, in my view, somewhat problematic, containing openings whereby competition might be nullified.</p>
<p class="contents">The tight time-frame therefore means that prompt transposition is of the essence; everything has to be transposed into national law within the space of a year. With reference to this, I want again to make it clear that it is for the Commission to monitor the market and the terms of competition. Let me again underline what Mr Turmes has just said, that the internal market in energy must be subject to Treaty competition law and must be evaluated by reference to it. The Treaty instruments must be applicable to it, especially where state subsidies and the control of mergers are concerned, and I think that, on this issue, the Commission can depend upon the political support not only of my group – I can promise them that – but also of this House as a whole.</p>

<p class="contents">The voting lists for Wednesday that have been circulating here so far are wrong, or at least misleading. Let me say, referring to my own report, that Amendments Nos 1 to 5, are not the compromises they are described as in the lists. The Committee officially withdrew them. Amendments Nos 7 to 10 are compromise amendments, but Amendment No 6 is not, contrary to what is stated on the prepared voting list. Amendment No 6 is not part of the compromise; indeed, as I see it, it is out of order. I ask the Bureau to check whether it is out of order, so that Wednesday’s vote can proceed in a correct manner.</p>

There are to be funds to compensate transit networks for their services. In the Member States, charges on producers in respect of cross-border exchanges in electricity will be harmonised in order to avoid different competition conditions prevailing in different states. Bottlenecks in the networks will be apportioned in accordance with the laws of the market rather than on a territorial basis, and tariffs will no longer be determined by the distance between the contracting parties, but solely on the basis of the physical flow.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a good thing that this law opens the way for new electricity plant to be properly sited, specifically in the vicinity of centres of consumption, and not, for example, where the primary energy used is especially cheap, thereby giving rise to massive new transport networks.</p>
<p class="contents">Taken together, all three laws that we are adopting are milestones for the EU’s internal market. After fifteen years of discussion, they are putting into practice the freedoms in the area of energy that the Union’s citizens were guaranteed in the Treaties – freedom of establishment, free movement of goods and freedom to provide services. These directives make these quite explicit. Moreover, they mean that the competition will put pressure on European firms to perform well, and it is to be hoped that these will soon, to an ever-increasing extent, discover their roles and capabilities in the global market.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make it abundantly clear, however, that those who make laws can do no more than grant citizens freedoms; it is the adult citizen alone who can make use of them. It is like an election. Voting in one is a right, but it is for the citizens to decide whether or not to exercise it; the reciprocity of supply and demand in the areas of electricity and gas is likewise something that the public have to understand and of which they have to avail themselves. This legislation hinges upon the question of how the remaining technical monopolies – the networks – are to be brought to market in such a way as to make competition possible. These laws contain important provisions for this purpose, in that, firstly, they put the networks themselves under the aegis of their own companies; secondly, they create regulatory systems in the Member States to guarantee neutral management of the networks; and thirdly – something that has been particularly important to Parliament – they govern the way in which these regulatory authorities in the Member States cooperate with one another and with the Commission, so that we do not end up with fifteen – and soon as many as twenty-five – different approaches in the Member States’ regulatory authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one thing I want to make perfectly clear, and in doing so I am following on from what Mr Turmes said. If, after a number of years, Parliament or – Madam Vice-President – the Commission should find that this legislation has still not brought about a truly Europe-wide internal market in electricity and gas, then let nobody be surprised if the concept of a European regulator is mooted and then actually brought to fruition – which we are not doing right now – along with the unbundling of property rights over the networks, which we are not doing now either. Both these options are still under consideration. It is now for the participants in the market to avoid the situation in which the legislature would have to take such action. In view of that, my hope is not only that the legislation will be adopted, but also that the participants in the market, the consumers and service-providers, will bring it to life in a tremendous way.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs and draftsmen, who have worked together in a quite remarkable way on these issues for years on end. Likewise, Madam Vice-President, I thank the Commission, you yourself and all its members. Many thanks to all my fellow workers, whom I congratulate on doing a difficult and first-rate job. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union’s energy supply will be a central issue over the coming years and decades, one that will be ever-present and will demand our attention.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy takes the view, and environmental considerations demand, that the primary objective of any directive dealing with the generation and supply of energy, or with trade in it or the distribution of it, should be that the primary energy used should be, and be capable of being, derived in as socially compatible a way as possible and that its ecological aspects should be acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">That the generation of energy is, in itself, a fundamental ecological problem, is an important insight, one that is reflected in this directive and, above all, in the rapporteur’s and draftsman’s positions and reports. It is therefore incumbent on Parliament, the Commission and the Council to ensure that the conditions under which electricity is produced in the medium and long term are such that the primary energy is derived exclusively from renewable energy sources, such as wind, water, sunlight and biomass. The same goes for the production of gas, where we should do everything possible to replace the old system of gas supply, with all its weaknesses, with indigenous biogas derived from non-food crops.</p>
<p class="contents">This will work if we succeed in compensating for the present disadvantages of renewable energy sources in competition with current fossil and nuclear energy sources, and if we manage to make the production and use of energy reflect the costs involved.</p>

I hope and expect, therefore, Mr President, that you will instruct the services to ensure that we have the right package tomorrow. It is really disheartening for something like this to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of the issues we are discussing was expressed eloquently by the Commissioner, and I shall not repeat it. I should like to give sincere thanks to my fellow Members, the rapporteurs, the shadow rapporteurs, and the Commissioners, too, of course – everyone who contributed – for this result. Above all, however, I also wish to commend the Greek Presidency – as it has not yet been mentioned for its tremendous commitment, because it has done sterling work.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy have fought hard with the Council. In all fairness, I must say that Parliament has invested a great deal of effort, and I was not expecting the result that we have now achieved. I believe we owe this to the flexibility, commitment and constructive approach on everyone’s part.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us focus on a couple of points. Parliament has invested a great deal of effort in strengthening the position of the supervisory body. We want the supervisory body to be independent not only of the industry, but also, as far as possible, of the national authorities, because we want to avoid the PET problem, as it was then known. In any case, we have increased the gap between supervisory body and government. We have tightened up the competences of the supervisory body, and we have obliged it to contribute to the development of the internal market and the creation of a level playing field, in order to avoid the prospect in many people’s imaginations of there being 25 partial markets instead of a single internal market. My colleague Mr Mombaur also pointed this out earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point for which we have fought hard is of course unbundling: functional unbundling, obligatory as from July 2004, and legal unbundling, obligatory by 2007 at the latest. It has been made clear that not one Member State may deviate from this, because there is a requirement for the Commission to produce an amended directive, which then has to pass through the whole parliamentary and Council process once more. This is the way it should be, too. I am also very grateful that we have strengthened the independence of the subsidiaries, that is to say, the transportation undertakings, from the parent company, so that the parent companies, that is to say the production or distribution companies, cannot just dip into the coffers at the expense of the maintenance of the networks, thus de facto frustrating a level playing field in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is that a great deal more attention has been paid to the level playing field. We have fought with the Council, and the Council has been well-advised enough to take over specifically those compromises that we have reached in the electronic communications sector. That will be the crux of the matter. The question – the key question – will also be whether the Commission is able to look into whether that level playing field has been achieved on an annual basis, by means of concrete analyses. There is an enormous amount of anxiety that we will end up having perhaps five, six, seven, eight oligopolistic undertakings – large undertakings – in Europe. On that point I throw down the gauntlet to the Commission to take hard action in cases where there is a lack of ‘fair play’, in cases of market distortion. Only then will we be able to convince our citizens that liberalisation is a good thing.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that the compromise on the decommissioning funds was a very significant achievement. I still do not understand why Member States do not dare to simply put down on paper, in legislation, that a decommissioning fund must be transparent, that it must be used for the intended purpose and that the normal competition rules are to be applied. Mr President, why do Member States not dare to put that down on paper? I still do not find convincing the legal drivel – forgive me – to the effect that all this belongs in the Euratom Treaty. I can endorse the interinstitutional agreement, I welcome the new declaration by the Commission, but the Member States that prevented that from becoming law, from being incorporated into the directive, have got a lot of explaining to do to their citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We also welcome the fact that, as regards the public service obligations, there is not just an incredibly long list to be seen, but also a provision preventing public service obligations constituting a barrier to newcomers. This seems to me to be another important point for the Commission to note.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, I think that we have achieved an excellent result. Of course, as a parliamentarian, one wants more, but, given the point of departure, we have achieved an enormous amount. We can be proud of this, and if we do have any explaining to do to our citizens, it is that there are going to be improvements in quality and in service provision.</p>

Even the United States is recovering from the California and Enron affairs. In Latin America, liberalisation has been marked by failure. In the United Kingdom, the state is facing the bankruptcy of British Energy. In Sweden, prices rose this winter by over 50% because of tensions between supply and demand.</p>
<p class="contents">Electricity is a sector which requires long-term investment. It is concerned with security of supply, environmental protection and providing a public service. It cannot be governed by market forces and competition alone. In a number of our countries – my own, for example – the public electricity service means, in particular, equal pricing, access for all households, whatever their rate of consumption or geographical location, to low-cost electricity at the same prices. The mandatory total liberalisation planned for 2007, which you are proposing to us, will not allow preservation of the social and pricing adjustment mechanisms which safeguard this equal pricing.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we are going to vote for an amendment rejecting the motion which we, the French Socialist delegation, have tabled together with the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and the Belgian Socialist delegation. We believe that the plan to open up the market in two stages, without even an assessment of the first stage – the 2004 stage applying to all non-residential customers – being carried out before the sector is then opened up to competition for all residential customers in 2007, is an approach to liberalisation that is more dogmatic than pragmatic.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, as regards competition, what we are witnessing is more a powerful trend towards concentrations of companies and the establishment of a market of oligopolies and cartels rather than of a genuinely competitive market. We consider it to be absurd that total liberalisation is being forced on us when the debate on the Green Paper has just been opened and we have not even had time to examine the possibilities of creating a framework directive to safeguard public services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">He wanted me to say that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party welcomes this very strongly because it is a major breakthrough in the single market and for the Lisbon agreement into a sector which has previously been closed. We welcome strongly and fully support the compromise on labelling and unbundling and on the dates of market opening.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the principal point that the Liberal Group would like to make is about the funds for decommissioning in the nuclear sector. We want to support and thank the Commission for its revised declaration. Previously the Commission had told us that funds from the Euratom Treaty would be sufficient for the decommissioning. However, as everybody knows, the Euratom funds are not subject to proper transparency and accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that the Commission has told us that the competition provisions will apply fully in this sector, we are extremely pleased because this means openness and transparency and proper rule for the single market. My group will vote in favour of this tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A smokescreen of market confidence has been cast to cover up certain real problems. Markets are always about just one thing: they always operate in the here and now. Prices take no account of the structural changes that happen when resources peter out.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberalisation of the gas market will not guarantee investment over the next twenty or thirty years. As it is gas that is to meet the EU’s entire need for additional energy, and as gas is imported from the east, those that need gas should share in the investment costs of new gas fields. In a liberalised market only the short-term benefits are taken into account. We should be able to conclude long-term delivery contracts for gas. In a market of short-term benefits they are not made. Network ownership patterns might become a problem in the electricity market. Unless a government invests in or maintains backbone networks the market will not function. If the government does not invest in the network and take responsibility for it, electricity cannot be transmitted from one place to another.</p>
<p class="contents">I am rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy with respect to a report on the safety of nuclear power plants. In that capacity I see the problems that can impact on the pricing of electricity. Electricity produced from nuclear energy may be cheap on the spot markets but we cannot be certain as to whether the prices have taken full account of the costs of decommissioning nuclear power plants and of waste disposal, which will extend over hundreds and perhaps thousands of years. If these costs are not reflected in today’s market price for electricity, competition will be distorted.</p>
<p class="contents">The liberalisation of the markets determines prices in the short term, but will not solve the big problems of the future. There will be new Iraq oil wars. Our group would have liked to safeguard the public and universal energy sector services in connection with these directives relating to liberalisation and privatisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I particularly welcome the demands that nuclear decommissioning funds be fully subject to EU competition law. The management of nuclear decommissioning funds should never have been used or misused by the utilities as a form of state aid and as an excuse for going on a buying spree across Europe for other utilities. We risked this acceleration and creation of cartels. Therefore, I welcome the Commission's assurances here today. Neither the Commission nor the Council has covered itself in glory in the past on this issue but we have a more consistent approach now. In particular, although many Member States ring-fence these funds, France and Germany are allowed to set aside the funds for waste management and use them for acquisitions. This amounts to a clear misuse and even corruption with regard to them, and I welcome the fact that competition law will now apply. It would otherwise have had a very distorting effect on the energy market across Europe. How can we have a free market when there are three companies with EUR 10 billion or more at their disposal to buy up other companies? I am glad that logic has obtained and that these funds will be subject to competition law.</p>
<p class="contents">I also very much welcome the inclusion of sustainability objectives and the equal status given to sustainability together with competition and with security of supply. In particular, renewable energies need to be promoted throughout Europe. For too long they have been the poor relation, particularly to the vast funds that the nuclear lobby has been able to access by fair means or foul, as I have already outlined. I hope that more funds will be available for renewables in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">European electricity and gas networks constitute key pieces of strategic infrastructure. If we want to achieve our Lisbon goals of making Europe the most competitive economy in the world by 2020, we need a truly unified internal market in our major energy resources. I am satisfied that the compromise adopted by the Council involves an important role for the national regulatory authorities. I am convinced that the national regulatory authorities will significantly contribute to the development of the internal market and create fair competitive conditions. Naturally there is need for close, transparent cooperation between the NRAs and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that relations between parent companies and subsidiaries have been better defined. A parent company must have effective means of exercising control over its subsidiaries. The original wording could have led to the spinning off of subsidiaries and the breaking up of companies by stealth. This would have been particularly problematic in small Member States like Ireland where there are some naturally imposed restrictions on energy subdivisions due to the geographical isolation and the limited size of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly the way forward for an energy market such as the Irish one is through interconnection. I am pleased that this point has been taken on board and that it has been recognised that building interconnectors is a valid way of opening up the energy market. In Ireland's case this will involve both north-south and east-west connectors and, in due course, a giant UK-Ireland market will be created, offering greater consumer choice and more competitive prices.</p>
<p class="contents">The European approach in opening up energy markets and making them more efficient is well balanced. We can learn from the experience of the United States and avoid disastrous mistakes such as the Enron affair. We must reassure both customers of electricity and gas – in particular domestic users and workers in this sector – on this point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In effect, although I am not calling into question the work of my colleagues, I cannot resign myself to accepting proposals from a Commission which is becoming increasingly liberal, especially where energy is concerned. As in too many cases, the Commission is blindly following the dogma of the opening up of the markets to competition. Indeed, the Commission does not have the courage to create a universal energy service at European level and to explain how it is to be funded.</p>
<p class="contents">Without this universal service, however, which is an essential prerequisite, there should never have been an attempt to challenge, at European level, the public service missions defined in the Member States. These missions follow definitions and methods of funding decided and guaranteed according to specific territorial, legal or constitutional requirements. Under the principle of subsidiarity, according to which measures are to be taken at the most effective level, only the Member States are capable of carrying out these missions to meet the demands of their citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out, moreover, that even the rapporteur seems to have reservations as to whether the effects of opening up the electricity market to competition will be entirely beneficial. Therefore, I cannot endorse a Parliamentary debate which does not provide a solution but continues to destroy what does exist. Furthermore, it is inconceivable that we should presume to pursue the opening up of the energy sector to competition by extending to individuals a system originally designed for companies. It is irresponsible of the majority of the Member States to have given way to the Commission’s proposals in the end. It is true that the primary responsibility lies with the Commission, which has sole right of initiative and is disregarding the negative economic, social and territorial consequences of its proposals in its endeavours to create a single market which is subject to competition alone.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, in view of all these considerations, I confirm my opposition to these proposals seeking to finalise the opening up of the energy sector to competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many of our fellow Members have dedicated themselves to this for years. At the very least, then, the result can be described as commendable. In the first place, the long-awaited liberalisation should provide benefits for the consumer: I am thinking in particular of improved service and more competitive prices.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that there is a paradox inherent in this. In my view, liberalisation will come at a price. It is a price which, paradoxically, will primarily be borne by the consumer. Particular attention will have to be paid to the way in which the distribution network is to be used, therefore. The price that the consumer will have to pay is of course the sum of the generation price, the tariff for transportation via the high-voltage network and the distribution tariff, plus all the levies on distribution and transportation. Distribution costs are the largest cost item on the bills of customers of the distribution networks.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides, the chance of the average consumer seeing his or her electricity bill go down significantly as a result of the liberalisation of the electricity market is very small in some Member States. The reason is obvious. The limited increases in efficiency in the sector are too small to compensate for the new levies. On the other hand, account must also be taken of the fact that the scant connections between the various national networks are not designed for importing or exporting large quantities, but rather as mutual support in the event of the unexpected failure of generation units in one country. There is still a considerable lack of commercial intercapacity, therefore. If a genuine internal market is to be achieved, there is an urgent need for us to effect a significant increase in this commercial intercapacity.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, it can be said that an important step has been taken in the opening-up of the energy markets in the European Union, but that a close watch will have to be kept over the way in which this opening-up is realised, on an ongoing basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European-wide energy networks will heal the market’s spine and skeleton. The liberalisation package will, moreover, improve the market’s circulation and digestion. Liberalisation must be continued and the network improved. In the first round of enlargement the new Member States must also be involved more fully.</p>
<p class="contents">We have really had to wrangle with the Council over both issues. With regard to the energy networks, a compromise was eventually reached that will guarantee there is the necessary flexibility to amend Annex III, while at the same time ensuring there is sufficient parliamentary monitoring. Achieving this compromise has not been easy.</p>
<p class="contents">The liberalisation of the energy markets is not any dramatic breakthrough, at least not from the point of view of the Nordic countries, although it is good that they are indeed being liberalised. This is definitely a step in the right direction. If necessary the Commission will probably make new proposals for further liberalisation of markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Contrary to what some of our Socialist friends think they know, the free and open markets of the Nordic countries are functioning well. Freedom of choice for the consumer has grown, prices have fallen, services have improved and things run more efficiently. The market mechanisms have been working perfectly. It has to be accepted that prices can sometimes also rise in a free market. Rarely, however, are there situations where the same year sees one of the century’s driest summers together with one of its coldest winters.</p>
<p class="contents">What is most crucial in the liberalisation of the energy markets is that unhindered access to the networks is guaranteed. Consequently, the clear unbundling of network activity and the fact that the tasks of the regulatory authorities should be sufficiently harmonised are two of the most central elements in this package. Without them we can forget the word ‘competition’ when we talk about the electricity and gas markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Now is the time to bring the debate on the package to an end: the compromises before us are completely acceptable. The package is an essential, albeit inadequate, condition for a viable market. We are now establishing framework legislation, but its implementation must also be monitored. The Commission must be equipped with the proper tools to monitor the viability of the markets. It will also be crucially important to ensure there is sufficient investment in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, thank you again to all those of you who have been involved in working on this package. This has been a long, challenging and arduous process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Much as I respect him, the great majority of our group backs this resolution, this compromise that we have reached. I might add that we also take the view that this directive safeguards the <span class="italic">service publique </span>or – as we would say – services of general interest. Indeed, what results from it is a new legal certainty. Services of general interest are compatible with competition, and, should the public interest so require it, the Member States will also be able to decide on derogations from the law on competition.</p>
<p class="contents">What the French may, however, find painful is the fact that <span class="italic">péréquation</span> will come to an end, so that prices will not be the same everywhere, but I wonder what disadvantage is involved in the possibility of prices falling in one part of a country? That is precisely the effect we intend competition to have. I would remind you, by the way, that one of the reasons why we started this debate on the liberalisation of energy markets at the beginning of the 1990s was that prices in Europe were very high, so that it was not only the companies, but also we ourselves, who were complaining that we were at a competitive disadvantage against the USA, our main competitor.</p>
<p class="contents">These directives, in fact, represent the end of a long process. Having been in this House for a long time, let me point out that this process actually began at the end of the 1980s – with the absurd variation, incidentally, that the White Paper on the internal market made no mention of energy – and that, at that time, it was by way of the European Court of Justice that the attempt was made to open up the internal market. We said at the time that we did not want to leave the opening-up of the market to judges, but wanted to make it a political process, and that political process has now been concluded at European level by the resolution on these directives.</p>
<p class="contents">What comes next? That is the question. Transposing this directive into law will not be straightforward. It will affect the companies, and – as national enterprises become European enterprises – the work of trade unions as well. This liberalisation will entail new legislative tasks, especially as regards our obligations in the areas of environmental and climate policy. We will also have the important task of introducing elements of these into liberalisation, in that it will be a new task to make climate policy compatible with competition policy as embodied in these two directives. It will, not least, be important to involve the candidate countries in this process. I too would like to end by thanking all those who have played their part in this. Let me say this: it is not often that we work together in such a collegial fashion! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposed restructuring only benefits the strong monopoly groups and has adverse repercussions on the cost to the average family, national energy planning and the position of the workers in this specific sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Communist Party of Greece considers that energy is not simply a consumer product, but a sector of strategic importance to development and, as such, it cannot be the object of business activity and speculation, but should belong to the public sector. Consequently, we refuse to discuss the details, the terms and the speeding up of liberalisation and the relevant rules of competition; instead we shall support the proposals for overall rejection tabled by our political group.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, however, a few comments on the regulation for the networks, which is being used to promote increased exports from strong Community monopolies which will benefit from the reduction in actual transportation costs. At the same time, it safeguards high profitability by passing the new financial burdens on to the average family, while the increase in exports will limit the development of generating stations in the weaker Member States in order to make use of domestic energy sources. In addition, control of national grids is being shifted from the Member States to the Commission, thereby cutting the potential for national energy planning in order to reduce energy dependency and ensure the needs of each Member State are satisfied.</p>
<p class="contents">Cross-border exchanges in electricity can be used to reduce energy dependency, safeguard cheap energy and make use of domestic sources. However, the precondition for this is a policy of mutually beneficial cooperation between countries, quite unlike that being promoted by the regulation and the policy of the European Union in general. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

May I congratulate all my colleagues on their hard work with the Commission and Council in achieving this compromise result. It is a tribute to the effective working of our committee.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not achieved all we want. Past experience on previous directives shows that a foot in the door can and does lead to more opening than expected. My particular interest is in the interaction between market opening and liberalisation and the issue of security of supply. It needs to be said that more effective markets make for more efficient use of energy, and that is an essential element in maintaining security of supply.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also stand back from the details to remember the purpose behind these measures. First and foremost, it is about choice, better value and better service to consumers of energy, both domestic and commercial. Experience shows that competition drives these objectives forward, and we have seen the benefits in lower prices and improved service in the UK. We need to see more improvement throughout Europe before we can say that we have done enough. We have learned over the past 15 years that progress in liberalisation cannot be achieved all at once and a step-by-step approach is more likely to lead to a better outcome in the end.</p>

<p class="contents">The Lisbon aspiration has been an ambitious one, and it has taken dogged and indefatigable rapporteurs, as well as a quite determined Commissioner, to reach the stage we are at tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">We have considerable experience with the original rather limited liberalisation directive in our Member States. We have seen that there has been market opening in some countries to 100% of customers, that there has been an unbundling of network operators in all Member States to some extent, but not completely, and there has been a limited increase in clarity and transparency of regulation. However, those earlier directives were inadequate. There is still market dominance and predatory, anti-competitive behaviour in some Member States, and some European citizens have not benefited from an enlarged and opened market in particular countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no fears that what is being suggested is wild and savage liberalisation because we have insisted on regulation unbundling, public service guarantees and labelling for environmental impact which leads to informed choice by customers. We have seen that cross-subsidies will be prevented, particularly the quite scandalous use of decommissioning funds in the nuclear sector. That is not an anti-nuclear remark, that is a pro-fair play remark.</p>
<p class="contents">There are risks from liberalisation, but they do not concern security of supply. Types of energy choices can be affected, however. We need to look at that. Environmental protection need not be at risk, nor need access by the public to energy. Indeed, fuel poverty has decreased thanks to liberalisation as carried out in the UK.</p>
<p class="contents">The risks are to research. That is an important risk and we must draw our attention to that in future work. And there is a risk of skills being lost; again this is a risk to which Member States and the European Union must pay attention.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow's vote is an historic one, though we call many votes historic in this Parliament. It is an important move forward. Amendment No 6 to the Mombaur report should not be admissible. It is not something that was covered earlier, but I commend those who have worked hard on this package. We will have a better use of energy in Europe because of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is highly likely that Parliament’s vote will serve only to support the strategy for the – rapid – liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets and of the public service sector as a whole. The exaltation of the alleged positive effects of competition, namely transparency, lower production costs and increased job possibilities, is being contradicted every day by reality. In actual fact, what are most apparent are non-transparent decisions, the diversion of public funds into private interests, whatever the status of the undertakings, the rapid increase in prices for users, the granting of benefits to unethical private groups and the abolition of hundreds of thousands of jobs in Europe, while, as for workers’ statutes, they have gone right out of the window.</p>
<p class="contents">For us, energy is an absolutely essential requirement and access to it a fundamental right. We believe that only genuine public, democratic control would allow us to streamline energy production and consumption while still guaranteeing respect for the environment and flat-rate adjustments. This would be an initial step towards a European public service which meets the needs of users and employees today. Parliament appears to be disregarding this concern. If it is to fully shoulder its responsibility to the citizens of Europe, Parliament must reject the directives on the energy sector and launch a genuine democratic debate on the actual effects of the policy which seems to be taking root in the European Union today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why is it to their advantage? It is because they can buy on the market the service that is best for them. Not only, as they did before, can they differentiate quantities, but now also in terms of quality and, in future, they will be able to do so as regards prices.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that one tremendous thing we have been able to achieve together has been with regard to labelling, in that public utilities will, in future, be under an obligation to indicate the source of the electricity, which will in future be independently monitored by the Commission, with the establishment of a group of European regulatory authorities which will share their experience with one another and thereby promote competition, to the benefit of consumers and of Europe’s citizens. The fact is that competition means service, and that is what the public want; they want service and freedom of choice.</p>
<p class="contents">In future the mix of energy sources will have to appear on the bill every year. What that means is, quite simply, that I, the consumer, will in future – or at least after 1 July 2007 – have the right to choose an electricity company, 100% of whose electricity is generated from hydropower. I think that is a great leap forward for all of us, and that, in future, greater transparency will result from this as a matter of course. Energy imports will have to be monitored by the Member States, and their sources will have to be certified.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, we regard the full application of Community law as having most especial priority. We believe that the decommissioning funds, together with the interest they yield, should be applied only to their original purpose, so that the costs must be borne by the form of electricity generation from which they result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The energy market is different from other markets. On the one hand, there is a natural monopoly in the distribution and transport networks, which reduces competition. On the other hand, it is a sector in which the lack of adequate regulation means that price variations can be huge, given the rigidity of demand and the impossibility of storing electricity. Lastly, access to energy for all citizens must be seen as a genuine right, which brings us back to the question of public services.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the texts do include the public service obligations but they do not go far enough. Indeed, the Member States are given too much leeway to organise and define these public service obligations, which means that the behaviour of the Member States which attach least importance to social cohesion requirements and citizens’ rights will be legitimised. In consequence of that, free competition between operators will take precedence in these texts over public service obligations. This is happening at a time when the Commission, with its Green Paper, is launching the debate on services of general interest! Why could we not have taken a little time to take stock of the sectoral liberalisation process and to make this issue the focus of a European policy? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Despite the procedural precautions and despite the undeniable eloquence of our Commissioner and our rapporteurs, we believe that these proposals run counter to the need to save energy and, therefore, to environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">They will lead to job losses and, above all, to further deterioration of public services, and to the deterioration of energy networks and price adjustments, which are land-use planning tools. They will run counter to the diversification of energy sources, even though these are becoming more and more vital. They will favour short-term vision and calculations. The logic of the internal market is thus particularly inappropriate for the energy sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by reiterating that, far from harking back to the days of state control, I am in favour of a regulated world and a future for which we have prepared. In this sense, energy is a major tool, maybe even the most important tool.

I would like to focus briefly on the electricity market. The situation in Europe reveals structural differences which I believe the launching of the liberalisation process will not alone suffice to overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The electricity market in Europe has been concerned with linking markets but not with creating uniform conditions for access to generation, institutional systems and symmetry in fuel choices, with a view to establishing competing symmetrical conditions in the generation sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The cross-border regulation, through market mechanisms such as specific auctions, for instance, in countries penalised by internal production conditions, prejudices the situations of economic advantage for the end consumer deriving from the availability of imported energy. Given the differences in cost and the congestion caused by a demand for energy which is considerably higher than supply, the effect will ultimately be convergence of the external and internal prices. The nuclear issue would exacerbate the situation, creating the strange situation where some people are called upon to contribute to the cost of decommissioning in other countries when they are not actually in a position to benefit, because of the market-based mechanism provided for by the cross-border regulation, from energy produced by nuclear plant.</p>
<p class="contents">While we feel that the cross border flow efficiency mechanisms proposed can be endorsed in the long term, we consider that applying them in the short term would be extremely harmful. Therefore, we would support the raft of directives only if this were achieved by means of phasing-in the market mechanisms, for the cross border regulation cannot produce identical positive effects for the end consumers of the Member States when there are disparities in trade flows. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I endorse and welcome Mrs de Palacio’s work to this end. However, I can see that neither our states nor our institutions are taking on board the concept of public goods as yet, nor are they adopting the idea of a common policy. Moreover, the Treaties do not give them competence to do so and the outcome of the Convention with regard to this matter is extremely uncertain. The sectoral directives are undeniably seeking to move towards<span class="bold"> </span>public service obligations, focusing on universal service, the environment, interconnection and security of supply, but they are only recommendations to the states. As we are quite aware, we have no legislative authority to enforce a European right. Without a doubt, we are entering the realms of a regulation too, and by a regulation I mean a public measure allowing us not just to introduce genuine competition but also to bring it into line with public service obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, competition needs to be developed further. Some Members want to force this. It is easy to criticise dinosaurs, my dear Mr Turmes, and overlook the contribution made by historic operators and what they did for consumers. It is easy to call for ever-increasing ‘deintegration’, but absolutely nobody has any idea as yet how to regulate a ‘deintegrated’, multinational competition system properly. It is ten times more difficult than regulating a national integrated monopoly system. We have not taken into account the Californian experience, price volatility or the inadequacy of long-term contracts. We are not capable of securing development investment.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I noted the obligation, which I believe is premature, of separation in respect of distribution, with regard to which the Members are trying to outdo the Commission, for they want to go as far as separating ownership. We are not the only ones to want to create a retail market for household electricity supply. There is fierce debate in the United States and Canada. Do the gains offset the costs? What are the gains? Maybe the price of a pizza for an average household once a year. And the disadvantages? All the transaction costs and lack of security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is now time for regulated liberalisation to be succeeded by a period of further deregulation. Rather than the pressures of regulation, we want more competition. That is why we say ‘yes’ to the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Where this is concerned, I start by asking myself why it is that, in most cases, it is still by reference to the national market that competition is assessed. Does this old thinking bear any relation to cross-border exchanges in electricity and gas, or to the realities of the networks? I would say, no, it does not. Does it not foster distortion of competition in favour of the larger states and energy-producing companies as against smaller ones? I would say that it does. Reconsideration of this is necessary and appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to my second area of concern, I am grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Mombaur, and the Committee for taking on board the concerns of the Association of European Transmission System Operators and of <span class="italic">Vorarlberger Illwerke AG</span>. These have to do with the way in which the definition of cross-border flow is being changed to refer to regulated zones instead of to the borders of the Member States. The old definition is national rather than European and hence contrary to the promotion of cross-border exchanges in electricity through the integration of the internal market in electricity. It is something that we have to change.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would like to have something clarified. We keep talking about the regulatory authorities of the Member States concerned. By this, we should always mean the competent authorities – for it is not always necessarily the regulatory authorities that are competent.</p>

I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their speeches and say that perhaps Mr van Velzen – one of the shadow rapporteurs along with Mr Linkohr and Mr Clegg – summed up best what most speakers have said here, in other words, that we would like more. I agree. The work that has been carried out here, however, has been superb and has led to the result we have now achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps it is not perfect, but it is sufficient to represent a spectacular change or step forward in the electricity and gas sectors, and will boost these sectors and contribute to the internal market. It will also address an extremely important issue, and here I am referring to what Mr Linkohr, amongst others, has pointed out, as has Mrs McNally, namely the problem of symmetry created by the current situation of partial liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are trying to do here is establish a European market rather than 15 markets – 25 as of May 1 – that is more or less open to competition. What we are trying to do is create an internal market and, in this regard, I would like to say, as has already been pointed out, that we do not want uncontrolled liberalisation, but regulated liberalisation, as I said at the start. Furthermore, Mr Herzog spoke of the problem of networks. I am going to discuss these by referring to Mr Clegg’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Greek Presidency once again, in particular, for the work carried out with regard to the liberalisation of gas and electricity in these two Directives and this Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now address the matter of networks, which Mr Herzog quite rightly raised. The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has just voted on the amendments concerning subjects relating to the financial regulation and in this regard, in this context, I would like to state on behalf of the Commission that in our report to the other institutions we too shall present the reasons justifying increased support for any individual project.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commission proposed in revising the financial regulation, the possibility of such increased support should be clearly justified and should be an exception.</p>
<p class="contents">Why do we need to establish trans-European networks? Mr Herzog said that there is no Community logic in the networks, which is clear in some cases, and that in order to establish this internal market in the gas and electricity sectors we do not just need regulatory standards, but also infrastructures that support this idea of an internal market, and security within this internal market that allows sufficient capacity for peak demand points; extraordinary increases or extraordinary situations.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that in this regard the regulation we are adopting today represents a model for something we have been discussing for some time, which is the public service aspect of certain issues. This is the regulation that most takes account of the public service concept in addressing the issues of protection and support for the most vulnerable customers, security with regard to the service itself – in this case security of supply – and also quality of service, by drawing up minimum basic requirements for all the Member States in order to guarantee security in practical terms, not only in terms of production, but also in terms of transport, which are essential when we are discussing energy.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to these networks – Mr Clegg’s report – I would like to raise two further matters. As regards the amendment on presenting regular reports, the Commission can accept a reporting period of two years. With regard to updating projects, all important updates will continue to be the responsibility of Parliament, and I would stress this, while the Commission will simply retain the capacity to introduce technical changes into the projects.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also welcome the compromise achieved in this area by Parliament and the Council, which will enable us definitively to adopt trans-European networks in the energy sector, completing the entire framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to thank the Greek Presidency for the superb work that has been carried out and express my sincere congratulations. In particular, I would also like to thank and congratulate Parliament, the three main rapporteurs, plus Mr Clegg and all the shadow rapporteurs who have carried out this work that has led, even if we might perhaps have wished for more, to this superb result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
