<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Haug (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to start by thanking the President-in-Office, who negotiated with us, with Parliament, in a shrewd and tenacious manner, often without the support of her colleagues, by thanking the Commissioner, who never once lost sight of global European interests, both on and off stage, and by thanking all my colleagues who backed me at the most crucial moments, even where they were of a different opinion, and who were supportive and joined forces in order to defend Parliament's position. My sincere thanks to one and all. Without such teamwork we could never have arrived at what is now a relatively comfortable, by that I mean perfectly tension-free situation. There now appear to be no further obstacles to Parliament's passing a resolution on the European Union budget for 2001 on Thursday.</p>
<p class="contents">The chairman of the Committee on Budgets tells me that this is the very first time that agreement has been reached between the Council and Parliament at conciliation. So well done everyone!</p>
<p class="contents">There is a proverb which says that money makes an evil master but an excellent servant. As the elected representatives of the people, we parliamentarians have acted in accordance with this proverb. We have not harped on about principles. We have not set budgetary objectives in advance and then tried to tailor our policy to them. We wanted a proper, economical, logical budget which would allow us to honour our political commitments and really help those who need our help.</p>
<p class="contents">So we agreed with the Council during the night of 23 to 24 November on the main points of what is a perfectly reasonable, although by no means brilliant budget. Whichever way you look at it, it is reasonable not to give up in the fight against unemployment in Europe, which is why we keep insisting on the need for action at every political level – at local, regional, national and at European level. The European budget will include EUR 450 million to promote employment over the next five years by supporting small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">If we implement the action lines described in the charter on SMEs and help SMEs to apply new technologies, we shall, I think, have found a way of creating jobs. The agreed EUR 450 million is more than four times what the Commission proposed in the preliminary draft budget and frontloading EUR 100 million next year should get us off to a flying start.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets proposes that plenary remove the reserves set up at first reading. This applies both to the performance reserve under the heading foreign policy and the administrative expenditure reserve. We have stated time and again that we support the reform of the Commission and that we agree to the 400 new posts, combined with a new early retirement scheme, but only subject to certain conditions. Some of these conditions have now been met. The Commission has submitted its analysis of outstanding commitments and its strategy for eliminating abnormal outstanding commitments. We put the final touches to a joint declaration by the Council and Parliament in a trilogue last Tuesday. We all agreed that the Commission should draft a report by the middle of next year on progress made in phasing out commitment backlogs, implementing programmes and simplifying project cycles, a report on how comitology is working, on progress made in implementing the reform package and on the performance targets of the main programmes under Category IV, to mention just a few aspects of the joint declaration. We now expect the Commission to start work at soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from a few minor skirmishes started or continued by the Council at second reading, our second reading has been stripped of most of its contentious points, mainly because we have stated that we are prepared to help the Council achieve what it sees as the extremely important objective of reducing the increase in payments to 3.5%. This will be achieved mainly by removing the Structural Funds reserve set up at first reading and making fewer payments for Community initiatives, which need to be rebudgeted anyway. The Commission's Letter of Amendment no. 2 which, following renewed calculation, has deducted around EUR 900 million from the sum needed for Category I, was also extremely helpful here. This Letter of Amendment is most welcome and I imagine that Parliament's consent to it is most welcome in the Council, because it also contains an estimated surplus for the current budget of EUR 900 million, which can be entered straight away under revenue for 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">What worried us most right through the budget procedure was how to fund our foreign policy. Our financial perspective for Category IV was clearly way off target since the war in the Balkans. The Commission therefore suggested revising the figures by EUR 300 million. The Council fought against this tooth and nail and it was impossible to reason with it on this point, just as it was last year. For the Council, the financial perspective is a monstrance and must not be changed. It has made it into its evil master, to continue the proverb which I quoted earlier. We were therefore forced to do a deal with it on the EUR 200 million flexibility instrument, as if this did not represent a change to the financial perspective. But at least we now have a further EUR 200 million at our disposal, although we did in fact need another EUR 300 million. But we can at least fund what we think is the most important task, i.e. the democratisation and reconstruction of the western Balkans, from a total of EUR 839 million, including EUR 240 million for Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">We refused to allow our other foreign policy priorities to be whittled away still further. We can finance cooperation with the Baltic region and our crisis reaction forces and we have given MEDA EUR 40 million more than the Council provided. So, as you can see, we have cobbled together a solution for the 2001 budget. However, this solution is weak on political and budgetary planning, because it takes no account of the fact that money is needed over a period of several years.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to have responded to long-term requirements with proper multiannual planning. All this means, of course, is that we shall face the same mountain of difficulties during the next budgetary procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the person who succeeds me as Parliament's general rapporteur and the Belgian Presidency of the Council, which will be taking over in the second half of next year, enjoy their discussions. I know from my own experience just how difficult it is to keep all the groups in Parliament together. However, I also know from the discussions that it is far more difficult to formulate a negotiable Council position, obtain a mandate and accommodate pure national chauvinism in a fairly reasonable and tenable overall European decision. Naturally, that does not only apply to purely budgetary processes, as the Nice Summit so graphically demonstrated yet again.</p>
<p class="contents">So we stand once again at the end of a year and ask ourselves how, in Heaven's name, we can make the Council see reason and make a good servant out of an evil master.</p>

I have the honour of dealing with the minor budgets: here the procedure is relatively straightforward and we all know who has the final word. They may treat us shabbily in Nice but to reverse everything Parliament has done, as in the case of the European Court of Justice, knowing full well that we shall correct it all again this week, is just a waste of resources and we could have helped protect the environment by using less paper. Meeting Parliament half way would not have come amiss here and would have saved us some work, although I have no objection to the work because what I want for the future is an efficient European Court of Justice which can do its job and, more importantly, clear the backlog of translation work. If the Council had shown itself to be more accommodating, we could have brokered an agreement back in October.</p>
<p class="contents">Having been allocated so little time, which is a pity because the budget – and the rapporteurs – deserve more than a derisory two and a half minutes, I must confine myself to just a few comments.</p>
<p class="contents">We must consider internally how all the present requirements can be developed into transparent procedures in the area of promotions policy. I am delighted that not only the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors but also the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions have already started to review their promotions policy and develop a transparent, merit-based procedure in which individual performance rather than seniority is the deciding criterion. I think that we are on the right path and, as part of the budgetary authority – in this case as the budgetary authority because the Council does not play the most decisive role here – we shall help to ensure that this continues in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We here in Parliament must also check to see that our budget still meets the criteria of honesty and clarity. Let me be quite clear here: we have a number of vacant positions here in Parliament, which save us several tens of millions of euros from one year to the next. We must therefore consider if the whole way in which we draw up our own budget is still correct, which is why our resolutions will call on our own administration – and I hope that the House will come on board here – to submit a full report on the vacant positions in the House, so that we end up with a budget which meets the criteria of honesty and clarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that work will progress on a European recruitment agency – or “joint recruitment office” as we call it in our very best German – so that we can jointly overcome the problems which all the institutions – the Council, the Commission, Parliament and the other institutions – will face over coming years, i.e. the problem of staffing over coming years. I trust that we shall make real progress here.</p>
<p class="contents">I have overrun by one minute and it was a pleasure to do so. Have I now been allowed more time? If so, I shall gladly give it to the group because I only prepared for two and a half minutes and intended to overrun by one minute. I have therefore met my personal target. I should like once again to thank all my colleagues. As far as the other institutions are concerned, we have worked together to achieve what I think is a good result which cuts across all party, group, country and other divides. If the Council were prepared to follow suit next year, if it listened to Parliament more readily, it would be even easier to achieve a good result.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Colom i Naval (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, when a delegation from this Parliament was visiting the People’s Republic of China some time ago, we were in Xiamen, in the south-east of China, and there was an island visible on the horizon. We asked what is was called and they said, “It is the unmentionable.” It was Taiwan and its name cannot be mentioned in China. Here the thing that we are not allowed to mention is ‘revision of the financial perspective.’</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I think that we should almost be kneeling down to deal with this matter, because it is a religious one. In the Council’s religion it is forbidden to mention the word revision. That is crystal clear. But I challenge my esteemed colleague, the President-in-Office of the Council, to explain to me what the difference is between the revision of the financial perspective and the use of the flexibility instrument: the majorities are the same, and the amounts can be the same.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from it being taboo, it is really difficult to explain why the Council refuses to recognise the need for a revision of the financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, of the thirty-eight revisions that the Community has had since 1988, which is when this system was set up, twenty-odd have been annual revisions. So not even the argument for annual or multiannual revisions is an excuse.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps another reason why we should discuss this on our knees is the attitude of some Members of this House, as all they seem to want to do is blindly obey the instructions of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We have really fought a great battle in order to achieve a 0.02% increase in the Council draft budget. I do not know whether this is a great success for this Parliament. It can even be seen in the Structural Funds, where the Commission told us that 8 000 million additional payment appropriations were needed, and the result is that we have cut them by 340 million, which is, of course, the request of the Council, not of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I wanted to briefly point out that, when we adopted the financial perspective in force, in 1999, we were still – I say ‘<span class="italic">we</span> were’ due to the involvement of the Union – bombing the Balkans, particularly Serbia. And we left it that when the conflict ended we would revise the financial perspective. We agreed this between the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council refuses to carry out this revision – it seems that now we should have the information – and I want to warn you: using the flexibility instrument two years in a row, two consecutive years, in fact, in less than fifteen months, and the first time less than six months after the adoption of the perspective, is financially draining the flexibility instrument because it prevents it from being replaced and from possible accumulation, which is planned for up to 600 million. But it is also draining it politically and this is much more serious, ladies and gentlemen, because it could lead to Parliament having a complete lack of confidence in the very system of financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">To be honest, the Council is leading us to believe that the system is not satisfactory because one of the contracting parties is not fulfilling the political requirements involved in signing an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The needs of the Balkans have not come to an end, they are multiannual. So now what are we going to do? At the moment we are beginning to sacrifice MEDA, which went down from EUR 980 million in 1999 to EUR 741 million in 2001. It is the first victim of not having a revision. I wonder who will be the next victim?</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to know, Mrs Schreyer, what is going to be done with the initial proposal for revision of the financial perspective. The Commission has not withdrawn it. I would therefore like to know what you are going to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Are we going to continue to fund the Balkans with juggling, as we have done now, at the end of 2000, "pre-budgeting" things and then introducing EUR 200 million in the 2001 budget? What are we going to do in March? I know that it will be the job of the Swedish Presidency, but in March we need to look at the perspective for 2002, and what are we going to do? The matter of the Balkans will not have been resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">To be honest, I think that I have to recommend to this House that it approve the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument because, in short, it enables us to solve the Serbia issue and because it is a revision that no one is daring to call by its name.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Parly,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following the Nice European Council, where European integration made significant progress, which the President of France will shortly present to you, I am delighted to present you with the second reading of the draft budget of the European Union, as established by the Council on 24 November. It is a pleasure, but also an honour and an emotional moment for me to be here with you, at the heart of European democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s second reading was preceded on 23 November by a conciliation meeting between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The outcome of this long meeting was, I believe, a twofold success. It was a success for Europe because we were able to overcome our initial differences of opinion and a political success because this budget is an expression not only of a compromise, but also – especially – of our priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the representatives of the three institutions spared no effort to conclude an overall agreement on the 2001 budget and I wish to take this opportunity to thank, on behalf of the Council, both the members of the parliamentary delegation and Mrs Schreyer.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has therefore proceeded to its second reading of the budget, taking account of the agreements concluded with the delegation from Parliament, with the ever-present desire to vote for a budget that will enable us to fund all of the European Union’s priorities and a budget that matches up to real needs and to our true ability to make use of appropriations. This budget will also enable us to implement the reform of the common agricultural policy and to carry out the programming of structural actions as defined in 1999, as well as all of the major programmes decided on jointly by Parliament and the Council. I am thinking specifically here of research, the Trans-European Networks and culture or audiovisual creation, with the MEDIA Plus programme, on which an agreement was concluded on 23 November.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to focus on the main progress made at the second reading in Council. The first point of agreement between the Council and Parliament concerns external action, that is, heading 4 of the budget, on which our institutions shared a common goal, which was to release substantial funding for the Balkans region in 2001, given recent developments in Serbia’s political situation, and to do so without passing the costs of this on to the other geographical priorities of the Union’s external action.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement reached on 23 November therefore defines an overall allocation for the Balkans of EUR 839 million, of which EUR 240 million are earmarked for Serbia. This very considerable amount, which matches the heavy requirements for 2001, will be largely funded by mobilising the flexibility instrument for an amount of EUR 200 million. Parliament thereby retains considerable room for manoeuvre at second reading to fund all its other geographical priorities and to do so within the ceiling of heading 4, as the Council had hoped.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important aspect of the Council’s second reading concerns Letter of Amendment No 2, which enables the Commission’s new provisions in the field of agriculture to be implemented. The Council has accepted this Letter of Amendment in its entirety and, out of the same concern to act in accordance with the most recent data available, the Council has also accepted the European Parliament’s amendments on rural development expenditure, which demonstrate the progress that has been made in the adoption and implementation of national programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Council voted, as had been arranged at the conciliation meeting of 23 November, in favour of additional credits to the value of EUR 60 million, for the funding of screening tests for BSE. This sum of EUR 60 million is a preliminary, rapid budgetary response to the Council’s decision to extend tests carried out on cattle. It must therefore be seen as a provisional sum. The BSE crisis will indeed require other measures, for which a budgetary assessment has not yet been completed and when a system has been more precisely defined, we will, of course, have to take account of its potential impact on the budget and to release the necessary appropriations whilst, as a matter of priority, studying the possibilities of redeploying funds within heading I. Additional funding can then be provided through a supplementary and amending budget within the financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that our institutions have been able to reach agreement on adopting, at only one reading, all aspects of this Letter of Amendment No 2, which concerns not only agricultural expenditure but also the fisheries agreements and the inclusion of an estimated balance for the 2000 financial year in the preliminary draft budget for 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">The third important aspect of this Council second reading concerns the agreement reached on the allocation for the “Spirit of Enterprise” programme, which continues and complements the “Employment initiative” for the years 2001 to 2005. The Council and the President have agreed on a very substantial allocation of EUR 450 million for this period and on an allocation of EUR 100 million for 2001. The credit for this result, which is proof of the priority given by the European Union to the development of small and medium-sized businesses and to employment must be given to your rapporteur, Jutta Haug, who is in the Chamber today. This action is also one of the Council’s political priorities, as expressed at the Luxembourg, Lisbon and Feira Summits.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, agreement was reached on 23 November on an increase in payment appropriations for the 2001 budget, which is an increase of 3.5% over the 2000 budget. As you all know, this aim is particularly “dear” to the Council and I wish to emphasise that an increase of 3.5% will require a considerable effort on the part of the Member States, given that this is slightly above the increase in their national budgets. However, I am, of course, aware that this agreement will also require a considerable effort by Parliament, because it will require you to arbitrate on sometimes sensitive issues in your first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement on the increase in payments has been made possible by the Commission’s proposal to rebudget an amount of EUR 1600 million in commitment appropriations for Community initiative programmes for 2002 and for subsequent years. This proposal, which is the result of the time limits necessary for the adoption of these programmes, has been accepted by the Council and by Parliament. It therefore means that payment appropriations requirements for the preliminary draft budget will be reduced by EUR 700 million.</p>
<p class="contents">When the Council voted at second reading for a budget increase of 2.5%, it took due account of this new factor. For its second reading, Parliament therefore has the considerable margin for manoeuvre of around EUR 1 billion to fund its budgetary priorities, whilst remaining within an overall increase of 3.5%.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council did not, of course, limit its second reading to the four points that I have just mentioned. It also accepted several European Parliament amendments in heading 3 on internal policy, particularly in order to take account of developments in legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Council accepted certain preparatory actions and certain pilot projects within the limits laid down by the Interinstitutional Agreement, having consulted the Commission on their feasibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the list of points of agreement between the Council and Parliament would not be complete if I did not mention two important texts that have been adopted this year. First of all, a joint declaration on improving the information provided to Parliament and the Council on the Commission’s financial programming, which was adopted in July, on the initiative of Mr Colom i Naval, which I welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a joint declaration has just been adopted, quite recently, on the progress report on the reform of the Commission, on the initiative of Mr Elles.</p>
<p class="contents">These two declarations improve the transparency of the budgetary procedure and of the reforms currently taking place in the Commission. I think that they are bound to improve the efficiency of these procedures, which is, I believe, an objective shared by all our institutions. Personally, I consider this to be extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, I wish to emphasise that the budgetary procedure that will be completed in a few days has clearly demonstrated the interest in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999. It is as a result of the consultation between the three institutions, which is provided for and regulated by this agreement, that we have been able to work together on this draft 2001 budget. Mobilising the flexibility instrument, which is one of the key innovations of the 1999 agreement, has therefore enabled us to conclude an agreement on the funding of the European Union’s external actions in 2001, whilst taking account of factors that may occur along the way. These additional appropriations will enable us to speed up the European Union’s aid programme for the Western Balkans in 2001. By the same token, within this Interinstitutional Agreement, the Council has left substantial margins within the ceilings of the financial perspective established in 1999, largely for heading 3 – internal policy – and for heading 4 – external action. These margins will give the European Parliament the opportunity, at second reading, to set its own priorities within the various Community policies and actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, before you proceed to the final adoption of this budget, I wish to stress the importance the Council attaches to some of the fundamental budgetary rules, in the field of entering appropriations in the reserve, the legal basis and the classification of expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the entering of appropriations in the reserve can only be carried out by the budgetary authority if the corresponding legal basis has not yet been adopted, in accordance with the provisions of the financial regulation. The Council therefore, at second reading, re-established all the appropriations entered into the reserve by Parliament for reasons other than the absence of a legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I welcome the agreement that has been reached at first reading by our two institutions to abolish the conditional entering of appropriations in the reserve, which had been carried out by Parliament, for heading 4, the performance reserve, and for heading 5, with regard to appropriations relating to the reform of the Commission, under Letter of Amendment No 1.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to insist on the respect for the rules that is incumbent on the institutions with regard to classifying appropriations as compulsory or non-compulsory expenditure. Your Committee on Budgets has proposed to change two budget lines by amendment at second reading, one concerning the early retirement scheme and the other expenditure relating to the fisheries agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to draw the European Parliament’s attention to the fact that, under the terms of the Interinstitutional Agreement, these budget lines constitute compulsory expenditure, which was, moreover, acknowledged by Parliament at first reading. Consequently, appropriations included in these lines must be considered to have been definitively adopted following second reading in Council, in accordance with Article 272 of the Treaty and cannot therefore be further modified.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude this overview, I wish to join those who have highlighted the excellent climate in which this budgetary procedure has taken place. The discussions were at times frank, but were always relevant and underpinned by ongoing exchanges of views, which enabled us better to understand each other and therefore to more easily conclude an agreement, which I hope everyone will find satisfactory. A good budget is a budget that has been thoroughly discussed. This budget should therefore be born under the best auspices. I wish to personally thank Terence Wynn, chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and the three rapporteurs, Jutta Haug, Markus Ferber and Joan Colom i Naval as well as all the members of the Committee on Budgets that I have had the pleasure of meeting during the six months of the French Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that the Council’s objective, throughout this budgetary procedure, has been to produce a budget for 2001 that will enable the European Union to respond to the crises that affect it within Europe itself but also those occurring beyond its borders. I think that, together, going beyond the priorities of each of our institutions, we have created, step by step, a budget for the 2001 financial year, which reflects the ambition that we all advocate, of a Europe at the service of its citizens. You must now give this outcome your approval.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unlike the negotiations in Nice, a substantial result was achieved on the 2001 budget in a single joint night sitting. Unlike Nice, all three institutions – the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission – are, I think, well pleased with the final result.</p>
<p class="contents">It provides a good basis for Community policy next year; to be honest, the Community approach has been most productive throughout the year, throughout all the preliminary discussions and, on behalf of the Commission, I really must thank you and your colleagues, Mrs Parly; you proved to be a very skilled midwife at the birth of this 2001 budget and focused the debates and negotiations on the core issues. I should also like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Haug, for her highly original combination of total determination and willingness to negotiate which culminated in this good result.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Ferber and Mr Colom i Naval, the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Wynn, and the members of the Committee on Budgets for being so committed. It was thanks to their commitment that negotiations were brought to such a successful conclusion. The 2001 budget which we now have before us gives us funds of EUR 96.2 billion for new commitments next year and EUR 92.6 billion for payments. That translates into a rate of increase in the budget, as you pointed out, of 3.1 and 3.5% in comparison with the previous year, roughly in line with the rate of increase in the national budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">One very important point is that the total budget only accounts for 1.06% of the joint European gross national product and, in terms of expenditure ratios, is lower than this year's budget. This illustrates that we have applied budgetary discipline, but it also illustrates that the financial planning concept decided in Berlin, i.e. that expenditure for the current Member States is being cut back in order to find room to fund enlargement, is being taken into account and is working. However, we must also note that the figures before us today do not include the supplementary budget which still needs to be addressed in the wake of the BSE crisis. I shall come back to that in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">First: what is so special about the 2001 budget? In the Commission's view, it is the fact that the second pillar of agricultural policy, namely promoting rural development, shows the highest rate of increase at 10%. I think this is worth mentioning because it means that we have a total of EUR 4.5 billion at our disposal. I really must disagree with the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, who stated recently in a newspaper interview that this amounted to no more than a toothpick, never mind a second pillar, because this fails to do justice to the size of the sum in question: 4.5 billion is a considerable sum of money – it is almost as much as we have for the whole of foreign policy and the size of this sum and this ratio need to be highlighted. We really can say, in foreign policy, that the policy of the European Union is having a huge effect, even with this budget, and I am positive that it is thanks to Community policy that we now have democratisation in the Balkans and a chance, hopefully, of stability in the near future. I am positive that no such success would have been possible with the old concept of bilateral friendships, with Member States being played off against each other. It is the outcome of Community policy and it is therefore excellent that we have again managed to include EUR 839 million in the 2001 budget for the Balkans. It was no easy task, but we managed thanks to the agreed use of the flexibility reserve, which was used to provide funds over and above the sum provided for or decided in Nice as a basis for the Balkan policy – namely a total of EUR 4.65 billion over the period up to 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">In providing the EUR 200 million emergency package, the Union has also proven that it is perfectly able to act quickly and take full account of its foreign policy responsibilities. What is important is that no country in the Balkans will now be offered less aid than originally planned before developments in Serbia due to the democratisation of Serbia. I think it is also important to signal that we fully support the new potential for cooperation which has arisen at last.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like at this point to take the opportunity to thank Mr Kouchner for his splendid work in Kosovo; we were also able to provide huge support here from our budgetary resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The process of reforming the Commission is also extremely important, particularly with a view to good financial management. Good financial management needs sufficient, well-qualified staff. Allow me at this point, on behalf of the Commission, to thank the budgetary authority for its support and for approving 400 new posts. You have linked this with a call for a concerted effort to bring about improvements, especially in areas in which financial support programmes have been implemented late or badly and I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen – especially you Mr Elles – that the Commission will do everything it can to improve its past record on the implementation of financial programmes. But let us not delude ourselves: we need both good financial management and the corresponding means of payment if we are to eliminate outstanding commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">Nearly a third of the budget is set aside for structural policy, in order to help regions in economic difficulty overcome their problems and make up economic ground, especially through the Cohesion Fund. The Court of Auditors recently confirmed in a special report that this objective is being achieved and that the money from the Cohesion Fund is being put to good use. Here the Community is demonstrating solidarity by using Community funds to provide real support for economic development and it goes without saying that the regions and countries which are now on the receiving end of our solidarity will be prepared in the future to demonstrate their solidarity with the new countries, as and when we enlarge the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, with the new outbreak of BSE in cattle, immediate action was also required in the budgetary area in order to protect health and consumers and help the farmers affected. The budget being voted on today includes EUR 6 billion to subsidise beef production, in addition to the EUR 60 million budgeted in order to cofinance BSE tests. The agricultural ministers meeting in emergency session have proposed new measures in the wake of the BSE crisis, but we are all agreed that it makes no sense to postpone the resolution on the budget in order to include these new measures and that a supplementary budget will be submitted post haste in order to fund the necessary measures.</p>
<p class="contents">A considerable amount of money will be needed, which is why I think that the Ecofin Council needs to address the budgetary consequences as a matter of urgency, because there are still points at which there is a discrepancy between our claims, or what we have in mind, and the funds at our disposal. Plus – and this was again stressed in Nice – we have to comply with the financial regulations and ceilings for the agricultural budget. Here we are in the peculiar situation of having even less room for manoeuvre because of the change in exchange rates. I was therefore most annoyed when the agricultural ministers, whilst fully aware of the BSE situation, rushed and served themselves from Christmas tables piled high with fruit and vegetables, bananas and nuts which required a total of 85 million in increased subsidies.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that when a new emergency arises – and with the BSE crisis new priorities obviously need to be set in the agricultural budget – then certain consequences also apply and clear resolutions need to be taken and the core issues defined for the agricultural budget, which does, after all, total EUR 44 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner responsible for the budget, I am completely behind the emergency action which needs to be decided, including support for the beef market, but the fact that we subsidise beef production to the tune of EUR 6 billion on the one hand and must now pay out thousands of millions to subsidise its destruction is proof positive, in my opinion, of the urgent need for action in the whole agricultural policy sector. I trust that the European Parliament will support me here.</p>
<p class="contents">Several decisions taken at Nice are highly relevant to the budget and the budgetary process. All the institutions will have their work cut out here. All the more reason to rejoice in the fact that negotiations on the 2001 budget were conducted in such a good atmosphere and led to such good results and, on behalf of the Commission, I should like thank everyone involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, the repeated use, two years in a row, of the flexibility instrument could be considered, wrongly in my opinion, to be a form of revision of the financial perspective. Personally, I think that this is not true in terms of procedure and certainly not in terms of substance. The procedure for the flexibility instrument was laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement for the purpose, in exceptional cases, of funding specific expenditure over and above the ceilings agreed in Berlin, without calling the financial perspective into question. I therefore think that, with regard to content, there is no contradiction between the two approaches, but rather a form of complementarity.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the specific cases that we have experienced for the last two years, in other words, Kosovo and Serbia, mobilising the flexibility instrument has enabled us to fund exceptional expenditure through an exceptional effort. In both of these cases, the flexibility instrument has enabled us to anticipate needs. In Kosovo, for example, there was a need to implement aid more quickly whereas in Serbia, the need was to commit a significant sum, even before a definitive assessment of needs was carried out and even before the distribution of roles between the various donors could be defined.</p>
<p class="contents">From the Council’s point of view, therefore, mobilising the flexibility instrument does not represent a challenge to the viability of the financial perspective laid down in Berlin. Furthermore, the Council has defined a multiannual sum, admittedly indicative in nature, which is compatible with this financial perspective, for the framework programme for aid for reconstruction in the Western Balkans.</p>

However, it is not just a success for the Committee on Industry and for Parliament; it also reflects the priorities of governments in Europe.

<p class="contents">My committee is very interested in the research area. We praised Commissioner Busquin, who has exceeded our expectations in that area. We have heard the Council say on many occasions that it wants to ensure that Europe becomes pre-eminent in research. Then we see the Council make a significant cut in payment appropriations, so that Mrs Haug then has to make some changes. We have heard from the Council today that it is prepared to improve the record by 3.5%. That is the context of the process we are engaged in. I congratulate our rapporteur.

I have two comments to make in connection with the document now on the table, and these are directed at the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">To start with, I want to talk about the overall agricultural budget. Of course we know that it comprises almost 45% of the EU budget, but if you add up what the EU Member States contribute and what the European Union contributes to the agricultural budget, you arrive at 1.9%, and a substantial amount of that is spent on the development of rural areas and environmental development. That is a mere pittance compared with what other trade blocks in the world spend. If you consider that American companies receive the equivalent of three times as much aid and a capricious country such as Turkey spends in excess of 10% of government money on agriculture and horticulture, then it is Europe that wants something for nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns BSE. I think you should know that on the night of 23 and 24 November, when we sat round the table with Mrs Parly, we fought like lions to get more money for BSE. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development told us to use the financial leeway between the financial perspective and the final budget, which amounted to upwards of generous EUR 900 million at the time, EUR 600 million of which was to be used for BSE. We fought tooth and nail to add a few extra million euro. A week further down the line and two cases of BSE have come to light in Germany. This means that in actual fact we already need a supplementary budget of EUR 900 million. This would suggest that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this House was keenly aware of what needed to be done and was also fiercely critical of the Council and the Commission in this respect, for their handling of BSE policy. Swifter decision-making based on tests as opposed to draconian measures after the event would have cost considerably less and it would be too stupid for words, regarding this political policy, also on the part of the Council and the Commission, to say that from now on we will include the bill in the agricultural budget. That is impossible because we have an agreement with the Council and the Commission for the remainder of the agricultural budget, for all the necessary allocations, and that means supplementary budgets. It also means that this extra money must come from the Member States, and not be plundered from the existing agricultural budget, because – and I am addressing this comment to both the Council and the Commission – I assume you have given your word on this, regarding the agreement we reached. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Haug and the Committee on Budgets have taken account of the proposals by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. Our committee’s main objective was to see that there were sufficient payment appropriations in next year’s budget. In this way, we ensure that problems with last year’s arrears are resolved and new programmes are introduced effectively. If necessary, the matter of payment appropriations must be examined in the supplementary budget in 2001. The amendments to cross-border cooperation are justified, but we were slightly off target with regard to Interreg and URBAN. The focus for transport is the development of the trans-European transport networks. I am grateful for the investment in sustainable transport, but it has to be said that transport and tourism appropriations are little more than token gestures. In the years to come we will need considerably more in these areas. Our committee will be monitoring the implementation of the budget. The effective use of resources will serve to improve the employment situation, particularly via SMEs and new technology. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The amount for the common fisheries policy is scarcely 1% of the Community budget. However, this small quantity, which is essential for maintaining the activity of the sector and the economies of areas that are dependent on fisheries, is a very appetising snack, despite being small, each time we look at where to find money to fund new policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, fish is an essential element for a healthy, balanced diet that is rich in proteins. When European consumers go to the market with concerns about what they can buy, in fish they find a safe, quality product.

The Chairman of the Committee, Mr Wynn, also deserves our thanks. It is a positive step, as far as culture is concerned, that the financing of multiannual programmes, i.e. Socrates, Culture 2000, Youth and the new Media Plus programme, are in order with regard to the budget. Hopefully, the problems that occurred in the implementation of the programmes are over. It is important that the Union should serve the needs of its citizens well. In the budget there is direct financing for European culture networks. There is no doubt at all that they need it. But the rules for financing are not yet working properly. There is too much that is arbitrary about all this. The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport intends to look into this matter early next year.

I would like, in introducing our group's position on this, to welcome the work done by Mrs Haug and by our own rapporteur, Mr Ferber, to thank the Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, and also the Council President, Mrs Parly, for their significant assistance in achieving a budget on 23 November which, as the presidency has rightly pointed out, was a landmark in the way in which Parliament, the Council and the Commission have been able to help decide collectively a budget for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a budget which is under 1.06%, we have a budget, Mr Colom, which is within the financial perspective. I suspect that, to put it simply, flexibility is for small amounts and revision is for large amounts, but we will see in the next few years how that will go. But I would like to thank both the Commission and the Presidency-in-Office of the Council for their remarks about the joint declaration which we have put together, because that is also a first indication of how we are going to monitor improvements and performance in the running of the programmes, particularly in category 4.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to that for a moment, we have a lot of work in front of us and we await with interest the report by Mrs Schreyer, preferably before 30 June, so that we can use its contents for shaping up the 2002 budget. But in thinking about the question of the backlog on commitments and how we limit the duration of new commitments – obviously this comes into the domain of the financial regulation which we will have to negotiate. We believe it is absolutely fundamental that this progress report should be seen to restore the confidence of our citizens in the way in which the European Union institutions operate.</p>
<p class="contents">A word on the reserve, Madam President-in-Office of the Council. You said, if I understood you correctly, that we should not be using the reserve because it was against the rules to do this. We use the reserve, particularly on first reading, to draw attention to particular points of weakness in the way in which policies are operating. The information policy in the institutions at the moment is a scandal and therefore, rather than putting money on the line for information policy when we know it is not being used effectively, we are going to be keeping much of that money in reserve waiting for the Commission to come up with the right proposals. Of course, the solution would be to allow us, as a joint budgetary authority, to lift funds being spent during the year and that may be an invention which we can insert into the revision of the financial regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would say, looking to the future, that Nice has shown us that there is perhaps a feeling that we are shifting a little bit towards intergovernmentalism, with the Council deciding on the numbers of our Parliament without our being consulted beforehand. Our confidence as one of three institutions, will only be maintained – and therefore the institutional agreement and the financial perspective maintained – if we manage to create mutual confidence and if we are consulted at every stage on our fundamental interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank Mrs Schreyer, who has continued to help us with her highly constructive approach and, of course, my friend Jutta Haug, who has done an excellent job, not forgetting Joan Colom i Naval and Markus Ferber.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now at the point at which we must decide whether or not we can vote in favour of this budget next Thursday. Obviously we need to take a very close look at it and this is exactly what Parliament in general and we Social Democrats in particular intend to do. We believe that we managed to do a great deal of good during the discussions, both retaining and extending crucial priorities. With unemployment still at over 8% throughout Europe, the European Union needs to use the budget at its disposal to send out a clear message and to set about fighting this scourge in the economy to our citizens, which is why it is important that we have this 450 million at our disposal next year, starting with 100 million this year. It shows people that we take their problems seriously and are doing something about them.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that we have managed in Category IV of this budget to show those living in the greatest need or in the process of democratising their countries throughout the world that this European Parliament and this European Union has not forgotten them, even if we have our own problems to resolve, and that here too we are making sure that there is enough money to go round. It is important for the people in the Balkans to understand, following the long period of hostilities during which our side presented a united front, that they can also rely on us when it comes to reconstruction. There are people sitting in this House who are at pains to ensure that the money needed will in fact be provided as and when it is needed and that flowery words will be accompanied by specific actions.</p>
<p class="contents">So I think that, along with much else which there is too little time to mention, we have a great deal to be pleased about. We have also passed a number of resolutions containing instructions. Allow me to say to the Commission, by way of example, that we have agreed to the 400 additional posts because we want to improve how various programmes are implemented, because we want you to be able to work better than you have been able to do in the past. But we also say in no uncertain terms that this implies a responsibility and a commitment on your part, because we shall be watching over you throughout this process. We shall be checking up, we shall be in contact with you and we shall be keeping tabs on what is happening, ensuring that there really has been an improvement before we are prepared to go even further with you.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a commitment vis-à-vis the Council. I have a couple of questions to put to the Council – not that I am questioning the compromise. But should we really have to try year after year to see what is left over from the previous year, what can be carried over to provide enough money for regions such as Serbia and the Balkans? Should we really have to check first and see what is left over? Is our message to these people: we will give you what is left over and then we shall see if we can add anything to it? Should that be our message? No it should not!</p>
<p class="contents">By refusing to discuss the specific long-term aspects of this challenge with us, you have brought the whole spirit of the Interinstitutional Agreement into question. You keep saying that the financial perspective is sacrosanct as far as you are concerned. But the Interinstitutional Agreement between the three institutions is also a valuable item and should help us to achieve joint planning security. The Balkans and other regions need planning security. Repeated use of the flexibility instrument also contradicts the Interinstitutional Agreement, because it was an instrument which this European Parliament secured in order to pay for contingencies and so that it could let it run up to EUR 600 million. It was never meant to be used for firefighting every year in areas which we have to fund in any case. You are undermining the Interinstitutional Agreement and let me assure you that we shall consider whether or not we intend to have a part in this next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The same goes for Mr Wynn, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, for the splendidly accomplished conciliatory work he has done and for his constructive leadership of the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Next year’s budget will be very much based on strict budgetary discipline. Although agricultural expenditure, which accounts for almost half the entire budget, will increase by more than 5%, when the Letter of Amendment has been taken into account, the overall increase in the budget is just 3.5%. This means that great restraint has been shown in the use of funds in the other categories. This makes just 1.056% of GNP, which must be considered very low as the ceiling for the financial perspective is 1.11%. This means a saving of more than EUR 2 billion. This, however, conceals a danger. The budget will be seeing a structural distortion, as money spent on payment commitments comes to over EUR 3.6 billion more than that for appropriations for payments. This means that there will be an increase in arrears. For that reason, Parliament’s concern that the problem of arrears will have to be dealt with is a justified one, and that is why there has been a very real need for a joint declaration by Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the fact that the Council and Parliament reached agreement regarding the EU’s budget for next year is to be greeted with satisfaction. It shows that both budgetary authorities are taking responsibility for the administration of the EU in an appropriate manner. However, it is unfortunate that Parliament once again had to fight with regard to funds for the West Balkans. Regarding other matters, I would say that for my group it is a positive move that a 450 million euro multiannual programme was agreed for the employment initiative; and, moreover, that it was agreed that funds remaining unspent from Community initiatives – totalling EUR 1 600 million– would be budgeted in the years to come. We failed to fill a considerable number of parliamentary posts throughout this year. This shows that in future there must be better use of personnel resources. With these observations, my group is prepared to adopt the draft budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our group will also vote in favour of this budget because it shows that, once again, we have reached an exemplary compromise, despite being under increasing pressure. The main sources of this pressure are unemployment, the BSE crisis and the Balkan stability pact. We have resolved and reached satisfactory compromises on all these urgent problems – and never once to the detriment of the interests of the EU. We wanted to secure the EU's ability to act and the confidence of the people. Nonetheless, I should like expressly to agree with Mr Colom i Naval, who said earlier that the financial perspective has become more and more of a straightjacket, preventing any real planning, any real long-term planning. Constant use of the flexibility reserve is undermining the transparency of the budget and in time this too will lead to a loss of credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Even the Notenboom procedure, whereby funds are transferred to critical regions, in this case to fund the Balkan stability pact, does not really guarantee a transparent budgetary procedure. It already looks likely that the huge risk of a clash between MEDA, Mediterranean rim projects and the Balkans will increase over the next few years, despite the fact that we all know that this is where money is urgently needed. On the other hand, we are also aware that the Council is perfectly capable of suddenly questioning the financial perspective when it comes to BSE, when it comes to national interests. I found Mr Chirac's statement at the Nice Council extremely interesting. I think the Council urgently needs to consider how it, for its part, intends to handle the financial perspective. In all events, Parliament will be a much tougher negotiating partner next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
