<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Queyranne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council of Ministers has been deeply shocked by the events at Dover and the deaths of 58 Chinese nationals in tragic circumstances. </p>
<p class="contents">These events demonstrate the increasing pressure that migration is putting on Western Europe, which we have been aware of for some time. In order to respond to a situation which is of great concern to our continent, European solidarity must be considerably strengthened. Firstly, the point must be made quite forcefully that the existence of organised criminal networks, as well as the scale of professional smuggling, which is contemptible but lucrative, plays a central role in illegal immigration, both in increasing the flows themselves and in the methods for smuggling people, of which the tragedy at Dover is an extreme example. </p>
<p class="contents">We know that most illegal immigration arrives in Western Europe, as a result of smugglers, particularly in the case of those people coming from far-off destinations such as China. This point must be emphasised in order to respond to those who say that it is immigration control that creates illegal immigrants. The increase in non-lawful immigration, on the contrary, leads to greater activity by gangs providing illegal entry to our countries. It is quite clear that this activity benefits from legislative or operational weaknesses in the destination countries and from all factors that allow the illegal immigrants to enter and remain in these countries in violation of their laws. </p>
<p class="contents">That is not all, however. Behind the smugglers, we are beginning to see mafias operating to an ever-greater extent. Police Chiefs have identified a Russian mafia, exploiting Sri Lankans and Chinese, and a Turkish mafia is taking charge of Kurds, Afghans and Iranians. We also know that illegal immigrants from the Balkans are under the protection of Albanian mafias. The fact that many of these illegal immigrants are concentrated in Calais, a bridging post for the United Kingdom – more than 10 000 have been arrested since August 1999 – shows the extremely active nature of the smugglers: 400 of them have been arrested since August 1999. </p>
<p class="contents">We should also no longer hide the fact that illegal immigration has become the subject of a veritable traffic in human beings, which consequently leads to crime, even to major organised crime. Since it is easier, more lucrative and less risky than other forms of trafficking, such as drug trafficking, for example, trafficking in illegal immigrants is becoming a major issue in police and judicial action and cooperation. The trade in human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation is one of the most odious aspects of this trafficking. When there is this level of organisation, it is no longer simply a question of combating illegal immigration, but of properly fighting crime itself. The real culprits are those who organise illegal immigration, in whose hands those people hoping to emigrate are merely the playthings of a script that could easily become a tragedy. </p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore combat these smugglers first of all. Non-lawful immigration or the trafficking in human beings is a new form of slavery that cannot be tolerated in our democratic societies. We know, for example, that in order to use the services of a smuggler, it costs a Chinese national between EUR 10 000 and EUR 20 000 and years of illegal work to repay this debt. They generally live under constant threat, without rights or any protection, often in horrific conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The rhetoric of calling for a massive opening up of immigration for work or for the automatic right of residence for all immigrants only feeds this dream of Europe and helps to push hundreds of thousands of people every year into the clutches of criminal networks working in illegal immigration. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must therefore not make the mistake of targeting the wrong people. It does not intend to do so and will concentrate on those who organise this traffic in human beings, which is one of the most cowardly and odious forms of trafficking. </p>
<p class="contents">The Council is determined to implement all necessary measures to combat this odious trafficking. European cooperation must be based on the means available to the Member States, and the States have clearly decided to provide themselves with the means to fight this scourge effectively. Since 1995, France has had a central office for the prevention of illegal immigration and employment, which has greatly enhanced its action in breaking up criminal networks in the last two years. This body has succeeded in breaking up and halting the activities of around fifteen criminal networks per year. </p>
<p class="contents">Given the reality of the trade in human beings and of the traffic in illegal immigration, the French Presidency wishes to promote European cooperation, based on the conclusions of the Tampere Summit and on the following principles: co-development, the integration of foreigners, the fight against illegal immigration and the common policy on Asia. </p>
<p class="contents">The first point involves taking account of the situation in the countries of origin. How can we deter people from wanting to leave their country for Europe under any circumstances and thereby often putting their fate in the hands of slavery networks? The Council must base its action on the guidelines adopted at Tampere and I quote: “The European Union needs a comprehensive approach to migration addressing political, human rights and development issues in countries and regions of origin and transit”. </p>
<p class="contents">Migratory movements are actually due to numerous factors: demographic differences between the North and the South, the continual increase in inequalities of income and wealth between the richest and poorest countries, the instability of certain political situations and the often false image that immigrants have of what a future in Europe might hold for them. Illegal immigration and the trafficking in human beings are not inevitable, however. They can be combated by means of a firm political will. In a world that is undergoing profound upheaval, the task of controlling long-term flows must shift from politics to co-development and the stabilisation of the countries in which immigration originates. The whole purpose of co-development is to link up these countries’ policies for development in order to exercise control over migration flows. </p>
<p class="contents">France will strive to provide new impetus to this progress towards co-development, making use of its experience in this area. An agreement has already been signed with Senegal and others are being negotiated with Mali and Morocco. </p>
<p class="contents">There are two questions to be answered: how can we encourage the development of local projects, specifically through aid for training and the resettlement of foreigners who wish to return to their mother country in order to contribute to its economic development, and how can this local development contribute to controlling migration flows by stabilising the population? The study being carried out on these two issues will benefit the future work of the High Level Working Group on Asylum and Immigration, which is today striving to implement the specific measures established in five action plans, covering Morocco and Sri Lanka. Implementing this priority led to a seminar being held on 6 and 7 July in Paris, in which experts and several Ministers will take part. The purpose of this seminar is to draw up the text which will guide the work of the European Union, on the basis of a few pilot experiments carried out with countries that have cooperated in this area and which have stable state structures. I am thinking here of Morocco. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s second main priority, which was established at Tampere, is to integrate foreign nationals who are legally entitled to be in our countries. This is an important point with regard to the fight against trafficking in human beings, which feeds off the fact that some foreign nationals in the European Union are on the margins of, or excluded from, society. This integration requires a firm policy to provide equal economic and social rights and an equally staunch fight against any form of discrimination, particularly in the field of employment. </p>
<p class="contents">The French Presidency is planning to hold a seminar in October on this theme, with a view to presenting the Council with a draft text on the harmonisation of permits for extended periods of residence, which is an essential mechanism for integration. The opportunity to adopt the nationality of Member States is also a fundamental aspect of integrating foreign nationals in Europe, but we realise that, in this area, each country applies its own laws. </p>
<p class="contents">The third point emphasised at Tampere is the fight against the criminal networks that I mentioned just now, and against the traffic in human beings. This aspect is clearly one of the French Presidency’s central concerns. The Tampere Council specifically stressed this priority, and I quote: “The European Council stresses the need for more efficient management of migration flows at all their stages. It calls for the development, in close co-operation with countries of origin and transit, of information campaigns on the actual possibilities for legal immigration, and for the prevention of all forms of trafficking in human beings. The European Council calls for closer co-operation and mutual technical assistance between the Member States’ border control services”.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the events in Dover, the Feira European Council called once again for rapid action by the European Union. This Council, and I quote, “condemned the criminal acts of those who profit from such traffic in human beings and committed the European Union to intensified cooperation to defeat such cross-border crime, which has caused so many other deaths across Europe”. The Council has urged the forthcoming French Presidency and the Commission to ensure that the Tampere conclusions on this subject are implemented as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">The French Presidency has already proposed four initiatives to the Council. The first of these is a draft directive establishing sanctions against transporters who give lifts to illegal passengers. This draft text would extend the measures provided for in the convention applying the Schengen agreement and the purpose of the text is to provide the Union with a common mechanism for sanctions. This restates the obligation on transporters to do everything they can to ensure that the passengers they are carrying have travel documents and, if appropriate, the necessary visas. This mechanism also restates the transporter’s obligation to send back or to accept responsibility for sending back foreign nationals who have not been allowed to enter for the reasons I have just mentioned. This draft directive also provides for sanctions against those who have transported passengers who do not have the necessary documents or visas. The proposed text provides for a minimum fine of EUR 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">A second draft framework decision seeks to increase the criminal punishment for aiding the illegal entry or stay in a country. On this issue too, by extending the measures of the convention applying the Schengen agreement, covering the obligation of States that are signatories to the convention to provide for sanctions against anyone aiding an illegal entry or stay, France has presented a draft framework decision whose purpose is to encourage the harmonisation of national legislations with regard to defining offences. This text will therefore play an important role in more effectively curbing the traffic in human beings. </p>
<p class="contents">The French Presidency’s third initiative was to also submit a draft directive on cooperation in the matter of expulsions. The purpose of this draft directive is to facilitate the implementation of an expulsion measure passed by one Member State against a foreign national who is not legally entitled to stay, when this measure is taken by any other State, the foreign national having been arrested in their territory.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly and finally, an improvement in European cooperation in the area of controlling migration flows and increasing control over external borders is one of the Council of Ministers’ priorities. In its capacity as holder of the Presidency, France has submitted new proposals in this field, specifically an action plan, which the European institutions are about to discuss. First of all, it is crucial to increase police cooperation in the exchange of information on illegal migration flows and on criminal networks. The centralisation, cross-checking, analysis and use of this data must be carried out by the existing Working Group. As the Feira conclusions emphasise, it is particularly important to develop Europol’s role in curbing the traffic in human beings. The French Presidency therefore intends immediately to ask Europol to submit a report on the action it has undertaken in this area. </p>
<p class="contents">The other aim in the field of police cooperation is to strengthen the rapid warning mechanism, which must be made sufficiently effective to enable Member States to be informed about and to react in good time to events connected with illegal immigration. This mechanism specifically involves the designation of points of contact between Member countries and entrusts the Council Presidency with the task of organising the necessary agreement for implementing the appropriate measures. </p>
<p class="contents">Increasing this coordination also involves establishing a network of liaison officers from the Member States in the countries where the immigration originates, in order to improve understanding of particular situations, to control immigration at source, particularly through the checking of travel documents at the point of embarkation at airports. </p>
<p class="contents">This whole range of projects, designed to strengthen the fight against illegal immigration, will be the subject of a seminar on criminal networks, which is to be held in Paris on 20 and 21 July, in other words, in a few days’ time. This seminar will bring together high level representatives of the Member States, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the United States, Australia, Canada and Mexico. Several Ministers from the Member States as well as the heads of various immigration services and border police from Member States will be taking part in this symposium. </p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to emphasise the fact that one of the fundamental points resulting from Tampere is the principle of harmonising the right of asylum between Member States. This is another important tool in the fight against illegal immigration. We have seen requests for asylum increase dramatically in most countries in the European Union. This increase reflects the higher number of illegal entries, since 80% to 90% of requests for asylum are rejected by the countries to which they are made.</p>
<p class="contents">The right to asylum is frequently used by criminal networks as a legal tool to make the entry into a country and the stay there easier for illegal immigrants. The main difficulty in our task is therefore the need to reconcile this fundamental right to asylum, which is recognised in international conventions, with the fight against fraud. With regard to this matter too, I shall refer to the Tampere Summit, where the European Council restated the importance attached by the Union and its Member States to fully respecting the right to asylum. The Summit conclusions state that “this system should include, in the short term, a clear and workable determination of the State responsible for the examination of an asylum application, common standards for a fair and efficient asylum procedure, and common minimum conditions of reception of asylum seekers”. </p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore crucial first of all that we make progress with projects that seek to improve the functioning of the Dublin Convention, with regard to determining the State responsible for the examination of an asylum application. France is paying close attention to the work currently being undertaken by the Commission. We will have taken an important step forward if we are able to ensure that the State that is the original point of entry for a foreign national into the European Union has sole responsibility for examining that person’s application for asylum. The Eurodac system, which will soon be up and running, enabling the fingerprints of asylum seekers to be stored centrally, will certainly contribute to the fight against fraud involving multiple applications. </p>
<p class="contents">We must also rapidly attain the objective of a fair and efficient asylum system in Europe. There is therefore an urgent need to harmonise the conditions of reception for asylum seekers, in order to limit internal flows into European Union territory and thereby achieve a more balanced division between Member States. This is why the French Presidency has submitted a draft set of guidelines, which is designed to make the Commission’s work and the drawing up of a future directive easier. </p>
<p class="contents">We hope to reach our first conclusions at next December’s Council, so that we can contribute to the preparation of the Commission’s draft directive, which is planned for the beginning of 2001. The Council is therefore determined to use all necessary means to fight against the traffic in human beings and to do so in accordance with the Tampere and Feira conclusions. The Council takes the view that the issue of the ways and means of illegal entry is no longer a question solely related to the problem of immigration. This issue also involves the fight against organised crime. This is the approach that must inform our work, and the French Presidency hopes to mobilise all necessary means – national, Community and intergovernmental – to succeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, first of all, I wish to emphasise that the Commission shares the sense of grief caused by the tragedy at Dover, which President Prodi expressed at the Feira Council and as I myself have expressed on behalf of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that these events are a particularly tragic illustration of the need for a common policy on immigration. The Commission is pleased at the request made at Feira by the Heads of State and Government to speed up the process, and is firmly committed to play its part in this process, in conjunction with the French Government. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wishes to reiterate the fact that the framework for such a policy was established by the Tampere European Council and that precise deadlines have been set for implementing it, both by the Treaty of Amsterdam and the European Council itself. </p>
<p class="contents">If such a policy is to have a lasting effect, it must form part of the overall approach defined at Tampere, which requires both a more efficient management of migration flows and the development of partnerships with the countries of origin and transit, the establishment of a common asylum system and the guarantee of fair treatment for nationals of third countries who are legally resident in Member States’ territory. </p>
<p class="contents">It is within this overall framework that efforts must be made to overcome the particularly odious types of crime that are the traffic in and exploitation of human beings. These crimes are what lie behind the Dover tragedy, as well as all the anonymous tragedies that are played out every day, which we do not hear about since they are not reported in the press. Unfortunately, however, they do exist. </p>
<p class="contents">More specifically, the Commission wishes to point out that a very short deadline has been set for the Council to adopt the necessary legislative measures to be able to prosecute and punish the behaviour of those who profit from trafficking in human beings. A deadline, which runs up to the end of this year, has been set for the formal adoption of the legislative instruments that will enable the main players in this kind of trafficking to be punished. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wishes to confirm its desire to cooperate with the Council to ensure that this deadline is scrupulously observed and notes the fact that the French Presidency is about to present its first initiative, which is a framework decision designed to strengthen the fight against aiding illegal entry and residence. We welcome this response by the French Presidency and we shall study the text closely to see to what extent it covers the objectives that the Commission had set for itself under its own proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two aspects in particular to which we should pay attention in this context: employers’ responsibility and the consequences of employing workers illegally. This does not only involve monitoring the European Union’s points of entry, but also monitoring what is happening within our Member States, particularly with regard to the illegal labour market. </p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the traffic in human beings in particular must be curbed, since it involves trafficking in women and children for the purpose of sexual exploitation, which is a specific feature of the traffic in human beings in general. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wishes to point out that the protection of victims and the respect for their rights must remain a constant concern of this presidency, as some victims pay with their lives and others are forced into slavery </p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the Commission plans to submit a proposal on providing short-term residence permits to victims who agree to cooperate with the police and judicial authorities in fighting the criminal networks that traffic in human beings. Victims’ testimony is in fact crucial to the police and judicial investigations being able to produce effective results. If we expect victims to provide this testimony, we must guarantee them a minimum of personal security. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also urges Member States to increase their cooperation with Interpol, so that this body is able to make full use of all its resources in the fight against organised crime in this area. In this respect, we wish to emphasise the importance of the conference to be held by the French Presidency on 20 and 21 July in Paris, which the Minister has just mentioned. </p>
<p class="contents">We also need to develop and strengthen the Schengen acquis as included in the Treaty of Amsterdam. Priority must be given to researching the means for ensuring the proper implementation of existing laws on granting visas and controlling external borders by using the surveillance and monitoring mechanisms that are available for this purpose. </p>
<p class="contents">A review must also be carried out of existing measures, and, should they be required, the necessary legislative amendments could be introduced to the Schengen acquis. All means should be investigated in order to facilitate administrative cooperation, following the example of the Odysseus programme, a third of whose projects that have been retained for 2000 are already contributing to the fight against illegal immigration. </p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission shares the desire of the French Presidency to see the procedures for placing responsibility on transporters reviewed and adapted as a matter of priority and has noted the Presidency’s announcement of an initiative to this effect. In our opinion, this initiative should form part of the development of the Schengen acquis and should deal appropriately with the various means that could be used in close collaboration with the operators because, without this cooperation, it will be difficult to fight effectively against the trafficking in human beings. </p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of cooperation with countries and regions of origin and transit in general, particular attention must be paid both to combating poverty and to respect for human rights. More specific action could be also be undertaken with regard to developing awareness-raising campaigns on the real possibilities of legal immigration and on all forms of trafficking, as well as increasing the ability of the authorities in the countries of origin or transit to effectively combat this type of crime themselves. We should consider the option of increasing the appropriations that have been earmarked for this purpose in the preliminary draft budget for 2001. </p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this, forms of closer cooperation could be considered for applicant countries, particularly in the areas of training, equipment, and the exchange of information on criminal networks. With this in mind, we feel that it is important to develop cooperation agreements between Europol and the police forces in applicant countries as quickly as possible. </p>
<p class="contents">The conclusion and the effective implementation of Community agreements on readmission will also contribute to diminishing the attraction of the offers made by traffickers, who claim to be able to provide their victims with guaranteed access to the destination country. In more general terms, we must review repatriation policies as a whole, including the issue of assistance for voluntary return, so as to guarantee coordination and efficiency whilst respecting the rights of the people involved. </p>
<p class="contents">It is imperative that we make rapid progress in establishing a common European asylum system, based on absolute respect for human rights and on the principle of <span class="italic">non-refoulement</span>, which seeks to provide the appropriate status for any person in need of protection, through the use of fair and efficient procedures. </p>
<p class="contents">The proposals that the Commission has already submitted concerning the European Refugee Fund and temporary protection, as well as the launch of the process of revising the Dublin Convention, should be swiftly followed up by other initiatives on the procedures and conditions for the reception of asylum-seekers. The Commission is in the process of evaluating the report by the European Parliament on its communication on a common procedure in order to present, before the end of this year, a legislative initiative on a common procedure for asylum in Europe. By the same token, we welcome the French initiative to submit a set of guidelines on the conditions for the reception of asylum-seekers. </p>
<p class="contents">As was said at Tampere, the whole purpose of the exercise is to achieve, in the medium term, a common definition of refugee status and, to complement this, other subsidiary forms of protection. The Commission feels that any lasting solution will require a genuine immigration policy to be gradually established. This policy must take account of the Union’s views on social, economic and demographic developments, and will consequently guarantee the admission of migrants under an organised and clear framework, as well as their harmonious integration into the communities that receive them. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is preparing a communication on this subject for the autumn, as well as legislative proposals, which follow on from those covering permission for the families of foreign nationals working within the Union to join them. Those proposals are currently under consideration by the Council, and the new proposals should define the conditions and the methods for admission, particularly for purposes of work and study. </p>
<p class="contents">We all recognise the importance of this debate and this exchange of views has clearly been influenced by the emotions caused by the Dover tragedy. It is tempting to say that the solution lies in increasing repressive measures and, as you see, I am not rejecting the idea of doing so. What we must understand above all, however, is that, in the medium term, it is by producing a proactive immigration policy at European level, backed by clear criteria, which are shared by all Member States, that we will guarantee victory in this battle. This must be a balanced policy, both in its measures on “the integration of emigrants” and in its measures on “effectively combating networks of organised crime which exploit the victims of the traffic in human beings” We must never lose sight of the balanced approach provided by the two aspects of the European common policy on this issue. </p>

The Dover disaster has once again opened our eyes to the unscrupulous practices of traffickers in human beings and to the powerlessness – or should that be unwillingness? – on the part of the European Union to stamp out this disgraceful type of exploitation. </p>
<p class="contents">Trafficking in human beings has grown into a bigger business than trafficking in drugs, according to <span class="italic">The Economist</span> last week. Organised crime has discovered that this business is not only more profitable, there is less risk involved too. Every year, about half a million people are smuggled into the European Union. In the port of Dover alone, hundreds of illegal aliens are arrested on a daily basis. As the trafficking in human beings increases, so does the economic and sexual exploitation of these people. Traffickers demand astronomical amounts to smuggle their customers to the West. Upon arrival, their documents are often seized, as a result of which they are completely at the mercy of crime syndicates. Young girls are frequently raped during the journey and end up in prostitution or the illegal labour market later on. It is not unusual for victims who are unable to pay their debts to meet with terror and violence. </p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that traffickers in human beings are becoming more professional in their activities. Their infrastructure, communication and control facilities outstrip those available to the police or courts in the countries of origin or transit. This internationalisation of organised crime is in stark contrast to the inability of the EU Member States to adopt a coordinated approach in dealing with the trafficking in human beings. Everyone is agreed that the problem transcends the control, reception and repatriation capacities of the individual countries and that we need to join forces. But despite the best of intentions, European cooperation is leaving a great deal to be desired. We do not seem to manage, once the police and courts are involved, to rise above the nationalistic knee-jerk reaction. And organised crime is exploiting that situation. Enlargement of the European Union would merely aggravate the problem. The new countries are, due to their location, extremely vulnerable to the trafficking in human beings. What is more, their police and court systems are even less adequate than those of the current Member States. In our resolution, we at least call for the application of the principle of solidarity and make a few very specific proposals for far-reaching cooperation in the fight against the trafficking in human beings. If we want to prevent tragedies such as those at Dover from happening again, extending the Third Pillar should not be delayed any further, and we are hopeful after President Chirac’s address and Minister Queyranne’s speech. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately they are nothing new.</p>
<p class="contents">I live in an area of Europe where, every day, every week, the dead bodies of emigrants from the north and south of Africa appear. These victims do not appear in the news because, fortunately, they are yet to die on a massive scale, but rather they die in a trickle.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I am sure, as Commissioner Vitorino has said, that the European Union needs a common policy in order to manage the legal entry of immigrants – bearing in mind our economic, social and demographic situation – in a reasonable way, preventing arbitrary treatment and, above all, turning to legal immigration avenues instead of traffickers in human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we have the responsibility to establish a legal framework which will allow this to be done. We also have the responsibility – and I would like to highlight this – to apply laws which already exist in the whole of the European Union and which regulate our labour market. It is outrageous that some people import and use labour and then go unpunished. To this end, there is no need to create new immigration laws, but we simply have to use the ones we already have to regulate the labour market and punish employers of illegal workers.</p>
<p class="contents">A year ago in October, the Tampere agreements were adopted. I hope that the Commission will do everything that the Commissioner has said and that the Council is up to the job. In that case they will have the support of this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not so long ago, we talked about the trafficking in human beings at the Strait of Gibraltar, and this was also referred to a moment ago. Prior to that, we held a debate regarding a ship transporting Kurds which ran aground off the Italian South coast. Each time, the authorities panicked, as is the case again now. It is high time we adopted policy. Because that is what it comes down to: each time a policy is announced, but this time, we need to do something about it, because we know that the trafficking in human beings simply continues. </p>
<p class="contents">So what should we do? Minister Queyranne and Commissioner Vitorino already mentioned it. We need to tackle the causes. We need to set up common immigration and asylum policy, fight cross-border crime and at long last establish surveillance of the EU’s external borders. </p>
<p class="contents">But I would like to point out something else. The heads of government themselves, under the leadership of President Chirac, who were here this morning, could chip in straight away. When they meet in Nice, they could abolish the right of veto in European justice policy. In this way, they, and later on the Council of Ministers for Justice, can at long last lay down European immigration legislation by enhanced majority, something which this Parliament has been calling for for many years. </p>
<p class="contents">In the case of crime policy, fighting the trafficking in human beings should not be the remit of Europol alone. It is necessary to harmonise the penalisation of this crime at European level. Indeed, the trafficking in human beings is a prime example of cross-border crime, which is what makes prosecution so difficult. This is why it is necessary to set up a European Public Prosecutor’s department in this field. </p>

It is a cruel and judgmental attitude that has appeared in much of the press and it does not help us find a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">If governments are serious about combating trafficking, these are three areas they need to think about. How can people legally enter the countries of the European Union, especially those coming from third countries which experience poverty or oppression? Secondly, how can we gain the confidence of those who could provide evidence against trafficking organisations. I welcome what we have heard about that this afternoon. Thirdly, how the current policies of the European Union and its Member States help to create refugees. We should not be concentrating so much on a deterrent policy at our borders. We need to look at how we are contributing to the incentive to leave.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to examine the consequences of our policies on, for example, trade, its rules and terms and who we will trade with, the conduct of companies based in the European Union and their operations in other countries such as Nigeria, the arms sales by Member States to repressive regimes. If we are looking at real co-development, that will be a major step forward and I welcome that. I think we should be considering how our open market closed-border policies are assisting the market forces driving the increases in human trafficking.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I, like all of you, am deeply shocked. This crime, however, is a daily occurrence at European Union borders. Let us not forget Yagine and Fodé, the two boys from Guinea, who wanted to see Brussels last summer. Since the beginning of this year alone, dozens of young people from the Maghreb have drowned trying to reach the Spanish coast. Fourteen Kurds died of asphyxiation in the hold of a burning ship in Patras. Dozens of Albanians and Tunisians die en route to Italy. These are terrifying figures. They should be unacceptable in a European Union that prides itself on being based on the protection of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">How then, can we put an end to this? That is the question. The debate that has opened as a result of the Dover tragedy has focused on the traffic in human beings and the eradication of the mafias that organise the criminal networks. The trade in smuggling human beings is undeniably flourishing. For a long time, we have known about the existence of criminal networks, such as the Chinese Triads, who make huge profits by transporting desperate people to countries that they are led to believe are paradises. </p>
<p class="contents">Mafia networks must therefore be harshly punished, but so must the people who exploit illegal labour, since no immigration networks exist without economic networks. As a result, in France, Chinese illegal immigrants are forced to work for years in sweat-shops to pay for their journey. These modern-day slaves supply a cheap labour force to whole sectors of the economy, and bosses are therefore free to move them around, even within the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">The dogma of liberal globalisation has magnified the free movement of goods and capital, but is seeking to stop the free movement of people. Emigration, whether it is a result of political oppression or poverty, merely reflects global inequalities. It is a symptom of the ever-widening gulf that separates North and South, and the incentive to emigrate is all the stronger since images of Western prosperity are invading the screens of the third world. </p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the free movement established by the European Union is a fundamental right, but this is reserved for its own nationals. Nationals of third countries have seen their movement littered with traps, as a result of the Schengen agreement and the mirage of zero immigration. All of these factors have simply created new forms of illegal immigration. </p>
<p class="contents">A purely repressive European response to the issue of immigration would certainly consolidate Europe’s fortification mechanism, but this would be ignoring the most fundamental aspect, which is the uniting of efforts and sharing at global level. A seminar is certainly a good idea, Minister, but it should cover a common immigration policy based on the principle of freedom of movement, improving rights… </p>

These people came from China, after all, in other words, from the other side of the world, from a country that has nothing to do with Europe and for which we can certainly not serve as an outlet for resolving their problems of poverty. </p>
<p class="contents">In a case which is so typical, the best possible response we can provide is to combat illegal immigration and particularly the mafia-type organisations behind this new form of trafficking in human beings. We are rather shocked to hear the words of Commissioner Vitorino, who, on 20 June, on the subject of the Dover tragedy, said that this, amongst other events, was proof of the need for a genuine policy on admission and integration, which makes a definitive break with the fantasy of zero immigration. </p>
<p class="contents">Those who mention the fantasy of zero immigration unfortunately too often do so in an attempt to provide an advance justification for a lenient policy. We do not wish to fall into this trap. On the contrary, we are calling, as a matter of priority, for a halt to this immigration, not only through a policy of co-development and of fighting the mafias, but also through strengthening control at the Union’s external borders and the reintroduction of controls at its internal borders, which have been so carelessly destroyed by European decisions over recent years. </p>
<p class="contents">Where internal borders are concerned, of course, we will probably not reintroduce fixed controls in the traditional form. We must aim for a more flexible network, organised around jointly run border posts, near to borders. In any event, however, controls will be needed, otherwise we will face the gradual collapse of our societies’ structures, which, if the truth be told, match the aims of globalisation too well not to suit Europe’s enemies to a tee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Is it not obvious that we must step up the controls, section more policemen and carry out 20 times the amount of controls in order to be able to guarantee that controls are being carried out properly? And the responses from the Council have not changed; they are still the same: Europol, Eurodac, police cooperation. </p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Council, Minister, you informed us that the immigration policy and the fight against crimes related to illegal immigration are two separate issues. This cannot possibly be true, it is not true and I would argue that even the Members’ speeches illustrate that it is not true. Parliament is ready to vote on a joint text – and I urge it to do so – a text which defines the direct relationship between restrictions on immigration and the way organised crime benefits from this trafficking, for this connection lies in the prohibition mechanism. Where there is no legal immigration integration policy, when it takes months to obtain work permits, when United Nations reports tell us that our societies, our countries in Europe need a regular influx of hundreds of thousands of immigrants each year, immigrants which are not permitted to enter, not only in the highly-skilled new technology industries but also in the manual labour industries, restaurants and services, when we are under the illusion that we are banning everything and preventing all harm, we find ourselves overtaken by a flood of illegal immigration which is only illegal because it has, in actual fact, been banned by these laws.</p>
<p class="contents">Minister, I believe that Parliament may be able to take a stance on this matter which opposes what you have said today.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are here today for the 58 victims of Dover. Like Mrs Terrón, I am also from a country, Spain, in which we unfortunately witness hundreds of deaths and disappearances in the Straits of Gibraltar and the Andalusian coasts. There are outbreaks of violence and xenophobia all over Europe and, while here we are talking about a new globalised economic society and a new information society, we do not realise that organised crime, trafficking in human beings, sexual exploitation and drug-trafficking have also become globalised. All of this is interconnected. That is to say, we are talking about a new form of criminality and human slavery which reminds us of the pre-abolitionist era in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Chinese, Moroccans, Russians and South Americans are transported, extorted and advised by mafias. This is the responsibility of some very important international organisations and there is a desperate need for international cooperation to combat one of the most shameful violations of human rights; international cooperation of European police forces and judges with police and judges in the countries where the migrants come from, who also have responsibility for the problem. If they do not have administrative, judicial or police structures, we will have to cooperate with them so that they may be provided with them. In this regard, the Action Plans which were mentioned by the representative of the Council may have an important role to play and I hope we can debate them in Parliament more transparently than we have up to now.</p>
<p class="contents">We must go beyond words – as he has also said – because words do not solve the problem. We must give the necessary resources to Europol, so that it can work effectively, and to the Action Plans, so that they can be carried out, to the refugee fund and to our borders, so that they can carry out the corresponding controls, because, unfortunately, without economic resources, nothing can be achieved. Anything else is mere verbiage and preaching. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A tragedy for the people involved, a tragedy for their family and friends, but also a tragedy for Europe and the European ideal.</p>
<p class="contents">As a European Parliament, we must do everything we can to prevent a recurrence. This appalling incident was avoidable. Mr Cappato spoke a few moments ago about the controls at Dover. But the authorities in Zeebrugge knew that the lorry in question was suspect. They had never heard of the company on the side of the lorry and the driver paid cash for the ferry. Accordingly, they alerted the port authorities at Dover. Had they checked the vehicle in Belgium some of these lives could certainly have been saved.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank the Minister for his genuine and honest statement. He spoke about the real culprits, the organizers. And of course he is right that we must fight organized crime and global trafficking, but identifying the culprits is only part of the battle. We must do more to support the countries from which these people came and improve the conditions there. Can we here in Strasbourg even begin to contemplate the misery and desperation that drove those Chinese people to spend months travelling in clandestine fashion halfway across the world? And their prospects? Probably to work in Chinese restaurants satisfying Westerners' desire for Chinese food. But to do this they died a tragic and desperate death because as Europeans we failed to come up with common and workable procedures for asylum and immigration and that must be on all our consciences.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The political will has been made clear, indicating that it is time to pass a legislative act for identifying, arresting and punishing the culprits. </p>
<p class="contents">Minister, Commissioner, you have truly disappointed me. You are not even following the line taken at the Tampere Council. The Tampere conclusions make a clear call for the Commission to submit a report on the implementation of the conclusions of the High Level Working Group on Asylum and Immigration for the consideration of the European Council in December 2000. This means that, in six months, you will have to draw up a report on what you have achieved. Listening to your speech, I have the feeling that I have been invited not to a Parliamentary sitting, but to a rather posh get-together. I had hoped that the Commission would go further, that it would have the courage, for once, to submit proposals, and that it would be able to do what the Council of Ministers is asking it to. </p>
<p class="contents">Minister, the French Presidency may be content to make the point at the next summit, without any real desire to study the Commission’s report or to tell us whether the Commission is fulfilling its contract with regard to Eurodac. If, however, the French Presidency is not able to establish a concrete schedule for legislative procedures to be implemented at European level and to be transposed to Member State level, we will once again face failure, which will lead to another debate like today’s, following further deaths. Everyone will complain and Europe will not have made any progress. </p>
<p class="contents">What I am really asking for is for the Commission to show that it is up to the task, and, in line with what President Chirac and Mr Queyranne said, for it to feel sufficiently chastised so that the work requested of it is sufficiently detailed for the politicians, Ministers and the Council finally to be able to take some decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What I do see, however, is that the OSCE, the IOM, the Council of Europe, the Commission and Parliament are all coming up with sound proposals. We talk and talk, draft and produce texts and can be very low, very pessimistic, but it is the first time that we are talking at global level and that something is being done to solve the problem. </p>
<p class="contents">I am always a little hopeful, yet realistic on two counts. Realistic in the sense that practice and theory are two different things. For example, when we repatriate people, for example when we send illegal Poles from Germany back to Poland, you need to realise that, some of them have train tickets, obtained from their illegal employer, to return to Germany, within two hours of their arrival, because that is where they work, where they have their jobs and where they are able to earn money. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we should not overlook the role of the victims. This entails reception and a document entitling them to walk around freely. And the Chinese must be able to speak out. I have experienced this first hand. Chinese girls, and women, in particular, are more communicative than men, because I have the impression that women are less fearful when it comes to this kind of thing. I know of Chinese girls whose faces have been slashed with knives. They are scarred for life. If they return, if they are repatriated to their countries of origin, the scars will still be visible. They cannot go back. You need to realise that we need to be able to repatriate people of their own free will, but I do not believe in this free will. I think that for certain people, the situation is more complex than that. </p>
<p class="contents">There are some who are very hopeful and want to go back, but you need to think of the role of the victims. In Great Britain, for example, in Dover, in the UK in general, there are no shelters for victims of trafficking in human beings. There is not even any sound legislation concerning this issue. Accordingly, Europe is responsible for its own legislation, for what we can do ourselves. And we can do this, we are in this fortunate position, unlike countries in the Balkans, the Ukraine, Lithuania, all these countries which are lacking money and resources, where the NGOs are embroiled in a lopsided power struggle. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish off with a comment on the police forces. I call on you to provide them with the necessary resources for they are fighting a one-sided war. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Since 1993, 2063 victims – men, women and children – have died in the struggle to be allowed to live: the earth’s rejects, suffocating in containers, drowning in our seas and committing suicide in detention centres. The responsibility lies with the traffickers who now form an international network, and the Union will be forced to employ every means and exploit all possible cooperation between countries in order to break these criminal networks; the responsibility lies with a policy which meets the needs of migrant communities with closed borders; an emergency and security policy which induces fear of invasion. Yet immigration from regions near and far is part and parcel of the history of Europe. We will overcome illegal trafficking when we tackle the causes of the gap between rich and poor countries, when we practise a policy of cooperation and development which allows everyone to live as a citizen of the world.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Tragic events of this kind happen to hundreds of people at borders, day after day. What you do not see, however, is any action on our part. We have been discussing the matter here for months and trying to outline a whole range of possibilities, but if you will forgive me for saying so, there is still no package of measures that will actually remedy the situation. Indeed I am delighted whenever the Council Presidency comes up with fresh proposals, and a great many proposals have also been produced on this occasion which are to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">However, it would be desirable if these proposals were to dovetail with each other. There have been a whole host of individual measures where the second measure has often been put in place before the first, instead of the other way around. What we need to do is to harmonise and coordinate these measures more effectively. Hence my call for these measures to at last be put into effect.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to briefly mention some very important points such as cooperation with the countries of origin, the implementation of the action plan, the need to at last put the agreements in place, criminal punishment for traffickers, i.e. the need to make EUROPOL stronger than it used to be, the need to draw up Community legislation governing immigration, and likewise asylum and the fight against abuse. Permit me to ask one question in this connection: we always discuss EURODAC at the beginning of a Presidency and we always hear that EURODAC will soon become a reality. We are now some years further down the line and there is still no sign of EURODAC. I would be delighted if you could actually manage to get EURODAC up and running. My question to you, Minister, is this: will you make it happen, and will you follow Parliament’s advice and leave the authority for implementation with the Commission, or are we to continue having discussions that head off in the wrong direction?</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Permit me just to add a second question. You have mentioned a seminar due to take place on 20 and 21 July, and this is to be welcomed with open arms. Are the parliamentarians invited to this as well, following the commendable example set by Portugal, when we were able to attend these conferences with representatives? Also, in view of Mr Jospin’s comments, permit me, as an Austrian, to ask whether Austrians will be invited to this conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The committee which I have the honour to chair has repeatedly made clear its view that we need a European immigration policy. This tragedy involving those so desperate to reach our shores – and it is of course no isolated incident – throws into sharp relief the lack of an immigration policy. We know that the numbers trying to come to our continent are not in fact increasing over time. It is simply that as the legal avenues have closed, so the private sector has moved in to exploit the illegal avenues.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year's summit in Tampere gave a mandate to the Commission to start moving towards a common policy and I understand from my meeting last week with Mr Chevenement, President-in-Office of the Justice and Home Affairs Council, that the French presidency will launch initiatives to deal with the persons involved, to deal with the transporters of these victims. The European Parliament looks forward to being consulted on these initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">But these are not enough. How long will it take for governments to realize that they have no clothes in this matter? How long will it take for them to realize that the criminals are so far ahead of them, and to develop the methods of police cooperation which will put an end to this vile trafficking? I am even tempted to suggest that they might use things like the Echelon system to start fighting against these traffickers, but that might be rather provocative in view of the vote coming up on Thursday.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that we should be proud that we have developed a society which is so attractive that people wish to come and join us, but we should perhaps also be rather ashamed that our development aid policy has not been more successful in reducing the push factors in some of the countries of origin. Until we succeed – and I recognise the work of the high-level working groups – in reducing these push factors, we ought perhaps to open our doors a little. It might even be in our own interest, rejuvenating an ageing population and enriching our own culture.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to hear that Canada is among the countries invited to the presidency's seminar. We might be advised to take a leaf out of Canada's book. The Liberal Government's proposals there are to close the backdoor to illegal immigration but at the same time open the front door to a legal migration policy.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This element also comprises actions for co-development, which we must improve, since immigration is a result of inequality and of the desire of people without jobs or prospects to come to richer countries. </p>
<p class="contents">The second element is the provision of legal residence for foreign nationals and, from this point of view, I do not think that a policy of zero immigration is right for Europe. I think that this would be unrealistic. We must allow foreign nationals who live in our countries to live free from discrimination, and to become integrated. </p>
<p class="contents">The third and last element consists of combating illegal immigration, and particularly criminal networks. I share the opinion of many of today’s speakers, such as Mr Cappato, for example, when they say that these criminal networks are part of organised crime. We must therefore stand up to these international organisations, these powerful mafias, which deliberately try to take advantage of loopholes in the law, problems in cooperation and the extremely high demand in the countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Under our Presidency, we have the opportunity to build on the proposals presented in this debate. I am thinking in particular of the proposal by Commissioner Vitorino on readmission agreements with the countries of origin, such as China, for example, with regard to making the trafficking in human beings for purposes of sexual exploitation a specific crime. I also think that we must work together on specific proposals, such as the timetable for their implementation that you requested, including the regulation implementing Eurodac, which must be completed by the end of the year, in response to Mr Pirker’s question. </p>
<p class="contents">Above all, we must use this presidency to clarify guidelines, particularly those on Europe’s long-term immigration policy. We have planned an informal Council meeting, a Justice and Home Affairs Council, for the end of this month, in Marseilles, and, to that end, we have tabled this issue on the agenda. Moreover, the Chairman of your Committee, Mr Watson, is also due to take part in this debate at the end of the month. I should like to point out that honourable Members of this Parliament are invited to attend the various conferences that will be held within this framework. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am convinced, at the end of this debate, that there are only two fronts on which we can combat illegal immigration and in particular the types of exploitation it involves. This exploitation has been universally condemned following the Dover tragedy, as well as other incidents in the Straits of Gibraltar and on the coasts of several of our countries. Firstly, we can use the harmonisation of legislation and then closer cooperation. Legislation must be harmonised because people should no longer be able to play on the present differences in laws on asylum and on punishment between countries and consequently play the free movement card to try to evade European vigilance. We also need closer cooperation because we are dealing here with powerful organisations, which must be confronted. </p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, Europe’s role, through the work of the Council, the Commission, which can nurture these ideas, and Parliament, is to promote our concept of immigration, which is balanced and humane, and to guarantee that human rights are respected in spite of the rising tide of organised crime and trafficking in human beings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must emphasise the fact that, since Tampere, the Commission has already proposed a number of legislative instruments, so that they can be discussed by the Council and adopted within the deadlines that have been established by the scoreboard. I am not only talking about the instrument for the regulation of Eurodac. I am also talking about the proposal for a decision on the European Refugee Fund, the directive on temporary protection, the revision of the Dublin Convention, which determines which State is responsible for examining applications for asylum, and the results of the consultation on the definition of the common rules of procedure on asylum issues. </p>
<p class="contents">I think that we could even add the fact that, where legal immigration is concerned, the Commission has tabled a proposal for a directive allowing the families of foreign nationals working in the Union to join them. We carried out these measures in the six months following Tampere, in compliance with the deadline adopted under the scoreboard that the Commission presented to the Council. The Commission is not behind schedule, and although this is a complex debate, it is under way, both in Parliament and in the Council. </p>
<p class="contents">I therefore understand why Mr Ducarme should say that he feels disappointed. We all feel disappointed and the reality of the situation is indeed disappointing, but I must tell you – and this point needs to be emphasised – that the Commission has tabled the proposals that were laid down within the deadlines that were set. You said that my speech did not match the deadline that was set for the end of this year, so that the Nice European Council can evaluate the policy on asylum and immigration. With regard to this point, I suggest that you look more closely at which deadlines we are in fact discussing.</p>
<p class="contents">Nice has the task of undertaking a preliminary evaluation of the work of the High Level Working Group on Asylum and Immigration. These action plans have been drawn up by that Group and I must tell you that the Commission has more grounds for optimism today than it did three months ago, because we have managed to reach agreement with the Member States on measures for co-development that the Commission will have to implement under several Community policies, including those on human rights, economics and development aid. The Commission and the Member States have also reached agreement on measures to be adopted by Member States, with the five action plan countries. </p>
<p class="contents">The deadline of December 2000 that I mentioned is another deadline altogether! This deadline was not set for the Nice Council. This is a deadline that was set at Tampere for the approval of a legislative instrument which establishes common definitions, common incriminations and common punishments for trafficking in human beings, and specifically for trafficking in women and children for purposes of sexual exploitation. The Commission can reassure you on this point. Both the French Presidency and Mr Queyranne have just said that the French Presidency has tabled a proposal for a legislative instrument, a framework decision for the incrimination of trafficking and smuggling. The Commission itself is fully on time with this deadline and with presenting a framework decision for the prosecution of trafficking in human beings. I therefore think that we are indeed putting forward initiatives and I am counting on the support both of the Council and Parliament to be able to conclude these legislative procedures within the deadlines that have been fixed.</p>
<p class="contents">I should simply like to make two additional comments: the first, which is directed at Mr Berthu, who, unfortunately, is no longer present, is that, when I was talking about the fantasy of zero immigration, I meant that sometimes, the argument of zero immigration is used as a rhetorical instrument. It is also interesting to note that some leaders who use the argument of zero immigration in this way are also those who are largely responsible for immigration policies that are lax in terms of integrating immigrants into the societies that receive them. When one condemns the fantasy or the rhetoric of zero immigration, one does so in order to suggest that there is an alternative, and the alternative is to have a proactive immigration policy, which puts at the top of the list of common concerns the integration of legal immigrants into the societies that receive them. One condemns it in order to clarify the criteria and the principles of a coordinated immigration policy at European level. That is the alternative and – I am sorry to say so – I do not share the idea that the alternative is to reintroduce internal border controls by means of jointly run police stations, which would not be on the border, but thirty kilometres away from the border. </p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, my second comment is to say that I am delighted at the fact that this debate has achieved a very broad consensus on the priority we must give to the fight against organised crime, and I shall make a wish. My wish is that this consensus still exists when, at the right time, encouraged by the French Presidency and supported by the Commission, and within the deadlines fixed at Tampere, this Parliament is provided with the necessary instruments for combating money laundering. I say this because to combat money laundering is to have an effective instrument with which to combat organised crime. That is not rhetoric, because it is taking the fight to the very area in which the battle must be won. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
