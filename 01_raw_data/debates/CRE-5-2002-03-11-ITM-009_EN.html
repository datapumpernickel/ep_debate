<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Malmström (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, the annual legislative and work programme is an incredibly important tool for decision-making and planning here in Parliament. It is on this basis that we proceed when we prepare our work – work that has consequences for ourselves, for the parliaments of our Member States and for our citizens. We know how important it is that it should be possible to monitor the decision-making processes in the European institutions. That is the purpose of the work of reform in our Parliament. It is on President Cox’s agenda, and this ambition is the basis of the laudable work being done by Mr Corbett when it comes to reforming the methods of working.</p>
<p class="contents">Increased openness and accessibility are also the basic ideas behind the Commission’s work on the White Paper on European Governance. Unfortunately, work on the annual programme has not always proceeded so well. In a majority of cases, Parliament has criticised the procedures. The programme has been late in arriving. The priorities have been unclear. There has been insufficient follow-up, and many proposals have been recycled. Parliament’s role in preparing the programme has been unsatisfactory, in spite of the fact that the framework agreement states clearly and unambiguously that the Commission must take the maximum account of the guidelines proposed by Parliament. Parliament has, however, responded with extremely long ‘shopping lists’ which have perhaps not always been realistic. Immediately before Christmas, when the Commission’s proposal was presented, Parliament chose, of course, not to regard it as a legislative programme on the grounds that it was a text with only general objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of the co-decision procedure makes it necessary not only for Parliament but also for the Council to play a greater role in preparing the programme, even though it is of course, as stated in the Treaty, the Commission which has the right of initiative. As the Commission takes more and more legislative initiatives, it may be difficult for Parliament to keep up, and we shall sometimes be blamed for legislation’s being delayed. It is therefore important that the Council and the two countries holding the presidency during the year should play their part in planning the annual programme so that it can be synchronised better.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, following nine months of negotiations and a great many meetings, we have agreed upon how to improve the procedures. I believe that we have made a very great deal of progress in the best interests of ourselves, the institutions and the people. The agreement involves quite a long process involving staging posts, regular dialogue and checkpoints, as well as close cooperation and partnership. The year is to begin with a kind of ‘State of the Union’ debate for the coming year, involving all the institutions including the Council. It will be based upon a draft work programme prepared by the Commission and, during the spring, there will then be discussions between the Commission and the committees affected so that priorities within the relevant areas might be debated jointly. Those of us who sit on the committees and work with the issues on a daily basis naturally have a feeling for which issues are topical and for what supplementary legislation and what common positions are needed. By involving the committees at such an early stage, we shall be better prepared when the legislative proposal is, in fact, submitted, and the work can then proceed smoothly and easily.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement also includes a mid-term review of the ongoing legislative work, a feature I think is very much to be welcomed if a situation is to be avoided in which proposals are recycled. The forthcoming programme will then be taken stock of at the time of the Conference of Presidents. The Commission’s proposals will be presented in Parliament in November. All this is to be found in the appendix to the proposal we are to vote on tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">The annual legislative programme is to be presented with reference to a calendar, to the legal base and to any budgetary implications. It is also important to think of the priorities and of the need for the principle of subsidiarity to have a major impact.</p>
<p class="contents">These are obligations for the Commission, but they are also based upon Parliament’s taking responsibility and demonstrating self-discipline when it comes to the number of proposals we ask the Commission to take up. We cannot draw up long lists, but we must show that we know how to prioritise. We should also become better at appointing rapporteurs promptly. We have everything to gain from creating a good climate of cooperation with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">To make it easier for the electorate, ourselves and the mass media to follow the legislative work, a common database should be set up showing who in the Commission and Parliament is responsible for a particular proposal. The database should also contain information about the calendar, budgetary implications and legal base. The database should be publicly available. I believe it should prove to be of very great help to our colleagues in the national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I hope that, no later than in the course of the next few days, the Commissioners will begin to visit Parliaments’ committees so that a start can be made as soon as possible on following the agreed timetable and method of working. By changing the procedures in this way, I believe we can obtain a method of working and a legislative cycle which are more effective, more transparent and more comprehensible. It will then be possible to improve considerably European forms of governance.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to thank Mrs de Palacio who has really made an effort to enable us to bring about an agreement. It is obvious that she has been a parliamentarian herself and understands Parliament’s problems and concerns. I should genuinely like also to thank the other political groups for cooperating with us in reaching this final result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that this result will, both for the Commission and the other institutions have a calming effect on procedures which, over and over again, have led in the short or long term to disputes that might well have been unnecessary.</p>
<p class="contents">For us, this result makes it possible to make debate on the Commission's annual work programme more political, getting away from listing individual projects somewhat in the manner of a book-keeper, indeed, it makes it possible for us to set out at the start of the year, what we see as the European Union's most important projects in the coming year.</p>
<p class="contents">One might say that this procedure and the preparation for it make this annual work programme interactive. I believe that this represents a move forward in terms of the reliability and predictability of the processes we are considering.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Malmström has rightly emphasised, this result also makes demands of us ourselves, for we really must refrain from constantly repeating what we wanted already, and must instead actually limit our deliberations to a period of one year. It is also necessary for us to become more closely involved than before in the actual planning of the half-year presidencies, which may go against our own priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Involvement in the preparation of the legislative programme is important to us also because we still do not possess the right of initiative in the European legislative process.</p>
<p class="contents">On that, let me say something about my personal assessment of the position. Our spontaneous reaction when the Commission's sole right of initiative is called into question is always a cool one. Above all, the Commission itself reacts understandably with great reserve on that point. Despite that, we must of course consider whether we should raise the issue anew, perhaps within the framework of the Convention's discussions, for it is the case that the European Union's great <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, consisting of some 10 000 instruments, can be amended only on the Commission's proposal. I will say here that I doubt whether that satisfies the requirements of a democracy. To that extent the decision we are drawing up today, is also a crutch, helping Parliament to move towards enhanced involvement in initiatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Parliament and the Commission have long recognised that legislative planning is a matter of common concern. The Commission has the right of initiative. My group does not seek to change that. We have the right to call upon the Commission to make proposals already given to us in the Treaty. It has the right of initiative. We are a parliament that is master of its own timetable, unlike some national parliaments. We both therefore have an interest in reaching an understanding on the legislative programme coming up in any given year so as to plan our work, so as to exchange views on priorities, so as to reach agreement and convergence as much as possible. That has long been the case, but the actual procedures by which we have done it have not always been working satisfactorily, and I welcome this updating and rationalisation that has been put forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the number of times that we will be discussing and looking at the following year's programme in the different fora over a year, my one fear is that, if we are not self-disciplined, we will spend an enormous amount of time looking at what will come up well over a year ahead, without being very concrete. We must be self-disciplined and make sure that problem does not arise.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a ghost missing from this feast, namely the Council, and the role of the Council presidency. Council presidencies often present a programme to Parliament as if they were assuming executive office. Council presidents must remember that they are not taking over executive office when they become president of the Council. They are merely chairing the body which is the co-legislative body with Parliament for a short period of six months, with an inherited agenda. We must make sure that this legislative planning works without upsetting the whole balance of the system by delivering it in the wrong way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an important proposal because it introduces a more formal structure into the process of Parliament's scrutiny of the Commission's legislative programme, which is, after all, a very important component of one of our most important functions – that is to say, scrutinising and holding the Commission to account.</p>
<p class="contents">Following what the Commission is up to is always slightly difficult unless one is a true initiate of the workings of the European political system. Most people are not, and so to introduce a more formal structure into this process is, in my view, a very desirable development because it should assist those outside the circle of initiates, by providing as it does a series of markers for the cycle of the year's business.</p>
<p class="contents">Ignorance of the way in which the European Union works, coupled with the failure of national parliaments to oversee and scrutinise European matters properly, are two of the great weaknesses in the European political structure as it has developed. Now, while it is for national parliaments themselves to determine their own agendas, I as a Member of the British second Chamber as well as a Member of this House feel that the formal structuring of the way that the European Parliament scrutinises what the Commission is doing may well be a very useful template for scrutiny by national parliaments and at the same time for disseminating accurate facts about what is going on at European level, to the benefit of all our citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you warmly for offering me the opportunity to participate in this debate on the reform of the European Parliament’s Rules of Procedure and specifically the proposed revision of Rule 57, which takes up the agreement we have reached between the Commission and Parliament in relation to the methods for presenting our legislative and working programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The contacts we have maintained throughout these months have allowed us to reach a solution for structuring a constructive dialogue on this issue, which is important. The text which the Committee on Constitutional Affairs proposes including in an annex to European Parliament’s Rules of Procedure respects the institutional role of the Commission and Parliament and honours the mutual commitments we have made over the last two and a half years.</p>
<p class="contents">I would firstly like to thank Mrs Malmström for her cooperation and constructive work – which has not always been easy, but the results of which have made it all worthwhile – in our debates and discussions, and that of the whole of the Parliament’s team and the representatives of the various political groups, since I believe that this has allowed us to achieve a proposal which I hope will be beneficial to the functioning of the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The College of Commissioners has held in-depth debates on this matter and has agreed that the right of initiative laid down in the Treaties must be retained in its current form, with the collegial responsibility of the Commission. Furthermore, Parliament must be informed on time, and not only informed, but it must also be in a position to be able to contribute its ideas and suggestions on the best definition of Community policies. In this respect, I believe that the agreement, which I am not going to explain, since Mrs Malmström has done so magnificently, includes the ideal procedure for combining these elements.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Mr Corbett’s point, it is true; we should consider how we can involve the Council in this process. We will have to seek a formula which, of course, must be acceptable to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, we in the Commission hope that this structured dialogue can focus our attention, as Mrs Malmström rightly said, on the political and strategic aspects in relation to the broad approaches of our action, with realism, as the new President of the European Parliament, Mr Cox, has also said on a previous occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Prodi Commission fully shares this objective and we want to prevent this process from becoming a mere bureaucratic accounting operation, which should not stop us from applying the relevant rigour, and the debates should be accompanied by general approaches and political considerations which, as has been said previously, can be turned into concrete proposals and political approaches.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, by means of this dialogue, we will discuss our political priorities for 2003, in order to define concrete courses of action for the enlarged Europe. In any event, the Commission, as it has been doing since 1999 when it came to office, will fully comply with the agreements with this Parliament and we hope that the trust and cooperation between the two institutions will lead to the better functioning of the institutions and that, furthermore, when the time comes we can also seek a formula to incorporate the Council as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Congratulations once again to Mrs Malmström. The discussions have been long but the final result has made it worthwhile. In any event, we will soon find out, because within a couple of months a first round of participations by all the Commissioners will begin – by means of the specialised committees – in relation to our future projects for next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
