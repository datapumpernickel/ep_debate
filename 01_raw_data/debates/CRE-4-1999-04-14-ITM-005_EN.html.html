<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Böge </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about BSE, three letters which in the past, before the European Parliament reappraised the matter, stood for a bizarre mixture of mismanagement, misjudgement and sloppiness both in the Commission and in several Member States. In the light of new and disturbing figures in some Member States, we could almost regard this as a never‐ending story. But let us not panic! Many of the problems we have still not dealt with today are in fact a burden from the past, from the time before 1996. With all that we are discussing today, we must not forget that we have achieved a great deal in recent years thanks to the work done in the Committee of Inquiry into BSE and in the Follow‐up Committee, in that a large number of the European Parliament"s recommendations put forward by the Committee of Inquiry into BSE were implemented. I firmly believe that the course we embarked on jointly with the Commission and its departments was successful. On the one hand, it restored confidence in the ability of the European institutions to cooperate internally; on the other hand, it gave the European consumer new confidence in the European institutions" ability to act.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection I would like to give warm thanks to the Commissioner, Mrs Bonino, as also to Mr Reichenbach, Director‐General, and to the Deputy Director‐General from DG VI, Mr Heine, for what they managed to achieve, building on a situation that had arisen as a result of past mistakes. I believe they have all made a major contribution to creating new confidence in this area of European activity.</p>
<p class="contents">In the final analysis we have achieved positive results for the future and improved the quality of preventive consumer protection, over and above the BSE issue. We now have a new quality to the case‐law of the European Court of Justice. I believe that the restructuring of the Commission services, the new legislative initiatives and also the discussion concerning the transparency of the scientific debate are important measures that need to be put into effect in future not only in the European Union but also at international level. I am thinking here of the hormone or BST debate.</p>
<p class="contents">One of our headaches remains that some Member States are not always willing and able to transpose Community law. Further‐reaching initiatives are needed here from the next intergovernmental conference, to ensure that if Member States delay and infringe the Treaties the Commission can take more rapid action, can initiate infringement proceedings more rapidly and can also impose sanctions more rapidly where there is a danger of this happening. That is of the utmost importance!</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also say a few final words in regard to the discussion about the tests. I believe that the current evaluation of the tests under discussion today is such that as things stand at present they can offer no absolute guarantee of the certain presence or absence of BSE. So we must take a considered approach here too and must not be tempted to overreact.</p>
<p class="contents">In short I believe we have pointed the way to firmly establishing preventive consumer protection in the European Union. The Commission has done its homework very well. Let us all take the BSE crisis as a warning for the future!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Roth‐Behrendt </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, we have been discussing this subject here in Parliament for roughly two and a half years. We are now nearing the completion of the work. Of course some questions and problems remain unresolved, but I do not want to go into that in my statement today at the close of the debate. I think it is important to ask what lessons should be drawn from the BSE crisis and what lessons should be drawn for the European Union"s future policy. How can we prevent this kind of thing from ever happening again? I would be interested to know: can this kind of disaster happen again, yes or no? That is what we really need to know today.</p>
<p class="contents">Has our perception – by which I mean the perception of Parliament, of this Commission and of a new Commission – and has the style of our policy now changed radically in relation to what they were three, five or even 15 years ago? Of course absolute transparency is important here. For instance, scientific advice, scientific checks, tests, inspections and controls must be carried out and accepted as a matter of course, even if the results may be inconvenient. It is also important, as Mr Böge just said, to make preventive consumer protection and the precautionary principle the first principle in all other policy areas. That may often be inconvenient, as indeed it was in the past. It may be inconvenient for agricultural policy. It may also be inconvenient for economic policy or foreign trade; it creates an enormous disturbance in these policy areas!</p>
<p class="contents">But only if the Commission and the European Parliament uphold and opt for the precautionary principle in cases of doubt will we prevent something like BSE from happening again. In relation to the negotiations with the World Trade Organisation that logically means giving precedence to the precautionary principle over the smooth running of world trade.</p>
<p class="contents">We will very soon be facing the acid test here, with the question of whether we will in future allow growth hormones in meat from the United States in the European Union. Will the Commission go on taking a tough line here, be hard as nails? It remains to be seen! During the work on BSE Mrs Bonino took a very steadfast and positive approach. We appreciated that, and Mr Böge has just acknowledged it too.</p>
<p class="contents">For me as also for my group, the criterion for a new Commission must be whether consumer protection and preventive health protection are given precedence over the smooth running of trade policy. I am convinced that only then can we give a vote of confidence to a new Commission for only then can we hope never to experience another disaster like BSE.</p>
<p class="contents">We will find out in the next few months whether that will be the case. We will see what names are put forward for the new Commission and what approach the president‐designate of the Commission takes. In his statement to the European Parliament yesterday Mr Prodi never once used the words consumer protection, precautionary principle or anything of that kind. We hope they are on his mind if not on his lips! But we do not know. We will find out in the future. But I am convinced that we ourselves here in the European Parliament would all be making a mistake if we supported him or a new Commission that did not say very plainly whether in a situation where there is reason for doubt it will decide in favour of trade or in favour of agriculture. We too must carry out our tasks, which is why we have always questioned the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Our task in future will be carefully to examine and question this new Commission which – whoever its members are – will not yet be in office. We must ask it how it will decide in a given situation. If we are being serious here, we must only give this Commission a vote of confidence if the answers are satisfactory. Then perhaps we will have some slight hope that preventive consumer protection will really play an important part in the Commission"s discussions, to ensure that nothing like BSE ever happens again.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Whitehead </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I should like to congratulate the joint rapporteurs, commend this report and incidentally say that I believe it is a justification for the contact committee which we maintained for a period of time, as well as the two main committees which endorse what has been said by the rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">BSE was a tragedy for Britain and also for Europe. It remains so. After suffering as we have, in our country, we are alarmed to see the disease still rampant in some other European countries. We have had 2.5 million cattle slaughtered in Britain; we have had to submit about 2 000 pages of documentation on how the disease has been combated, although not yet eradicated, in our country. We live daily with the problem of the victims of new variant CJD, to which the rapporteurs refer.</p>
<p class="contents">And yet we now have a situation in which, as they say, 13 Member States are facing infringement procedures by the Commission. This is a scandalous state of affairs. It is incumbent upon Parliament to make certain that the safety precautions which we have been forced to take are now common practice throughout the European Union as a whole. Parliament needs to be backing the Commission in putting pressure on the Council in this regard. The attitude of the Council over the last two years has not been satisfactory. Danger for one is danger for all. Safety for all depends on danger for none. When we look at the situation in Europe at the moment it is simply not satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Roth‐Behrendt said that the precautionary principle has to be the right approach. I agree. The precautionary principle is no frivolous luxury; it is an absolute necessity. Parliament should say so, loud and clear, to the Council of Ministers.</p>

Our work also involves monitoring the situation that is unfolding in the European Union as a result of public health protection policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We recognise, of course, that a certain amount of progress has been made in implementing measures to restructure and staff the Commission services, and to separate the legislative work from the operation of the advisory, scientific and supervisory committees and services. In this way, the independence of the scientific committees has been strengthened, a better assessment of the facts has been achieved, and the transparency of the work on BSE has been maximised. Many Member States have been slow to carry out checks and inspections, and we believe that these checks must be stepped up. At the same time, cooperation and the exchange of information between the Commission and the Member States must be strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">It is absolutely crucial that a legislative framework be set up to control animal feed and to combat epizootic diseases. We also need a more rational analysis of the use of antibiotics and growth promoters in animal feedingstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">We must point out that there has been considerable delay in terms of the incorporation of Community provisions into the Member States" legislation. Moreover, in addition to specific responsibilities and acts of negligence, this matter of epizootics has revealed institutional gaps in the functioning of the European institutions, particularly the fact that Parliament cannot have complete control. This is why we are asking for the codecision procedure to be introduced throughout the entire agricultural policy. Through the Amsterdam Treaty, animal and plant health measures have already been put in place, and we are asking for them to be extended to the agricultural policy as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I believe that health is one of the greatest gifts of human life. Protecting the health of the European public is one of the highest priorities of the European Union, and it must therefore play a vital role in the development of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Böge and Mrs Roth‐Behrendt, for the excellent work they have done.</p>

They say that ‘it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good", and this also applies here, because BSE was in fact the reason why we had the clear‐out in the Commission. BSE was the reason why we managed to expose some major shortcomings within the Commission and became aware that the Commission was not fulfilling its obligations. I feel that we have achieved remarkable results, and I would like to thank the Commission for having followed the committee's recommendations. The allocation of responsibility within the Commission was not satisfactory, but it has improved. We have also succeeded in reaching a consensus about the need to keep the Scientific Committee separate from other bodies. This, I feel, is extremely important. We have succeeded in making the Scientific Committee more independent, even of parliamentary control. A scientific committee must be detached, so that the scientists are not exposed to political pressure when they are asked to deliver opinions. It is extremely important that the scientific basis should be in order, so that the right decisions can be reached.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that BSE is, fortunately, on the way out. We are fairly clear about when it will disappear completely. There will continue to be a few cases. Creutzfeldt‐Jakob disease is also on the way out, I believe. So what can we learn from all this? The steps that have been taken appear to be effective, and I therefore believe that we can avoid getting into such a situation again. We now have an apparatus which works. We can, in my opinion, be reasonably satisfied. We cannot give consumers a 100 per cent guarantee. But we are now better equipped to deal with such problems than we have been in the past.</p>

Factors that have contributed to this decision include irresponsible behaviour in the more distant past and, more recently, incompetence on the part of people in positions of responsibility. Nevertheless, the European Parliament must agree to political proposals that will help to resolve the situation in each and every Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore tabling an amendment calling for still closer cooperation between the Portuguese Government and the Commission, which will make it possible to eradicate the disease and lift the embargo within the timetable envisaged. To this end, we have also tabled a further amendment calling for the creation of mechanisms to limit the damage suffered by Portuguese producers. BSE must be wiped out and the European Parliament and the public throughout the European Union must be armed with all the facts. This is exactly what a third amendment we have drafted aims to achieve. I would like to compliment Mr Böge and Mrs Roth‐Behrendt on their work and to express the hope that all these amendments can be accepted. The report will then be more politically balanced and fair.</p>

<p class="contents">We have separated out the sectors and made major progress. Today we acknowledge – and we are right to make a point of this – that the action the Commission is taking has not yet managed to overcome the resistance of the Member States. The fact that 13 out of 15 countries are not fully implementing the recommendations which they should implement goes to show that we need to carry on working with the Commission to achieve this objective, so that respecting and safeguarding consumers really does become Union policy.</p>

<p class="contents">For this reason I wish to congratulate my colleagues Mrs Roth‐Behrendt and Mr Böge on the quality of their recommendation and to explain to them the content of the main amendments that I have tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to paragraph 24, we think that it is important that we specify that the precautionary principle should also be applied to dealing with carcasses, animals and health‐related seizures in abattoirs. The European Parliament needs to make a statement on this point in order to guarantee health and safety, both for cattle and also, in short, for the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning paragraph 26 on the Green Paper ‘The General Principles of Food Law in the European Union", this problem needs to be dealt with on a general level, particularly by taking an interest in other fields such as animal and human food and also plant protection. All decisions should be made on the basis of scientific evidence, but also following risk assessment, at Community level. The principle of health and safety for the European consumer is a general one and is not restricted to particular sectors. We should not forget this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to paragraph 29 on the use of antibiotics in meat production, it is true that this can lead to increased resistance to antibiotics in consumers. Resistance to antibiotics is not solely linked to their use in meat production. We welcome the withdrawal of authorisation for four antibiotics as animal feed additives, but I hope that in order to effectively protect public health, additional measures will be taken in the light of the results of the studies.</p>

Thanks to the work of the Committee of Inquiry into BSE and the restructuring and changes made by the Commission, we have now anticipated what will soon enter into force under the Treaty of Amsterdam, namely preventive health and consumer protection. That is a very important foundation on which to build sustainable development of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we must continue to follow up the question of the precautionary principle which we have now anchored in our legislation and that we will also have to incorporate the principles of transparency and of separation of powers, which we now have in the Union, in international treaties and agreements too. In that way we can achieve preventive health and consumer protection not only for the people in our Union but also in relation to products from other countries that end up in the Union. I think Parliament must call on the Commission to show this same transparency in the preparations for the negotiations on these international treaties. So we need more information: what is the nature of these preparations, who is making them, what are the ultimate objectives, how can they be achieved or have they already been realised?</p>
<p class="contents">There is a further point I find most regrettable. As rapporteur for the Green Paper on the future of food legislation I had also expected a stronger thrust in that direction. I hope we will still manage to achieve modern food legislation prior to enlargement of the Union.</p>

The BSE scandal plunged the entire European Union into a deep crisis. It was demonstrated to us quite plainly that even for the people of today, there are limits that have to be respected. Nature has its laws and it is only within that framework that we can and may proceed if we want to make progress for the benefit of mankind. Unfortunately we have still not come to the end of the crisis into which that irresponsible behaviour plunged us, and it will probably take decades before we know its true scale.</p>
<p class="contents">Today I will not fail to express my respect for the Commission under President Jacques Santer for having the courage and the staying‐power to uncover, in the face of resistance in the Member States, the scandalous abuses whose origins after all reach back to the mid−1980s. Even though the scandal has long since been exposed and has now almost disappeared from the media, I would nevertheless point out that we must not forget the BSE tragedy. So it will be most important to ensure that the next Commission constantly presents its activities before Parliament. Especially when public health is at issue, we must not take any risks. As elected representatives it is our duty to stand up for the people. Let me say very frankly, Commissioner, that I am deeply disturbed because I believe that we can still not gauge today how many new cases of BSE and also of Creutzfeldt‐Jakob disease we will encounter in the coming years.</p>

From the beginning of the BSE crisis they have both been extremely constructive in the way they have brought forward their reports and in their analysis of the problem. BSE, unfortunately, is still with us and we must recognise this. We must also recognise that grave damage has been done to consumer confidence and that must be restored. We are well on the way to doing so but we must continue to work at it.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout the whole Union we must face up to the reality that if we had been feeding our animals in the right and proper way the BSE crisis would never have occurred in the first place. In my own constituency of Northern Ireland we have now imposed extremely strict controls. These are expensive and have had to be paid for by the hard‐pressed beef farmers in my constituency and, to be perfectly honest, they question some of these controls. However, at the end of the day, they are prepared to live with them because they know they are restoring confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">While we have strict controls within the European Union, these controls do not apply to the food that is entering the European Union from other countries whether from the United States or anywhere else. Until we tackle that problem and meet it head on, I have to say to the Commissioner that the farmers of Europe will not have confidence in the European Union to meet the challenge that is facing us now. It is the next challenge we have to face up to and we must do it. An inspection is taking place in the United Kingdom at the moment and I hope it will result in a data‐based scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">In winding up, Mr Böge said that we had been given a warning for the future. Let all of us in this House today remember what we have come through in the last few years with regard to BSE and let us take his warning on board and act on it.</p>

The rapporteur deserves thanks for a lively report, as has been mentioned several times. As soon as Parliament became aware of the crisis, a temporary committee of enquiry was set up, and as a result of its findings, the Commission was obliged to thoroughly re‐examine Community policy on food production with reference to food safety and consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the European Parliament continues to take an active part in monitoring the effects of decisions taken, as well as ensuring that Member States are implementing them correctly. I believe, however, we should distinguish between those Member States in which there is no apparent risk with regard to the disease, and those in which there is. Measures in countries in which there is no risk should be less drastic than in those countries where the risk exists.</p>

The Agenda 2000 package, however, does not give sufficient weight to environmental considerations. The BSE crisis, cases of swine fever, and resistant strains of salmonella indicate all too alarmingly that the basis for a Union agricultural policy is breaking up. We have to pay far more attention to matters of agricultural production and food production. Consumers must have greater certainty that products are safe. We cannot afford to be arrogant here.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still precious little scientific knowledge about BSE. Research into its long‐term effects has been arduous and slow. We cannot jump to hasty conclusions one way or the other. Mad cow disease was in the headlines about five years ago. One wonders whether more could have been achieved in the area of research at that time. Have the resources set aside for the control of BSE been used in the best possible way?</p>
<p class="contents">Ignorance as to what causes BSE and its effects on humans is costing the EU dear. Overall, the BSE crisis has cost the Union many billions of euros. It is still not clear what action it is wise and necessary to take, and the extent to which that action should be targeted. We must be able to impose different measures in different countries relating to high risk items such as cattle and sheep brains and meat on the bone.</p>
<p class="contents">The BSE crisis has not yet been beaten, and we need to ensure there is consumer confidence in European agricultural produce. The Commission has implemented many of the recommendations made with regard to BSE in order to promote consumer health and protection. The present situation is hardly satisfactory, however. Too many new cases have once again emerged this spring.</p>

I feel almost as if I am abandoning a child who has not yet fully recovered from an illness in the middle of the street and wondering who will take care of him from now on. Will the next Parliament, as I very much hope, contain two real heavyweights like Mr Böge and Mrs Roth‐Behrendt to replace the two of them? Mrs Roth‐Behrendt is not here, but I trust the term ‘heavyweight" does not offend her. They are two heavyweights who have stood firm even when the issue in question was no longer quite so topical and it would have been easier to let it drop rather than carry on attending countless meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">I am wondering about this because even though the two committees, the Committee of Inquiry and the Follow‐up Committee, have provided answers to many of the queries we raised, there are still further questions which remain. For example, I wonder who will from now on bring the required pressure to bear on researchers and on the world of science, which still has to provide many answers to our queries. Furthermore, will controls and inspections continue in the United Kingdom, both on the epidemiological front and in the ports where some not entirely healthy foodstuffs may still be found? Even though the guide for consumers has been corrected and revised in the latest edition, I am wondering whether it will be adequate to help the target readership to understand what they should be doing.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to put one further question to the House and to the spectres who will fill it during the next parliamentary term. Who will still protect the consumers? Will others be as resolute as ourselves in defending their rights? The families affected by new variant Creutzfeld‐Jacob"s disease have received some compensation, but we should not forget the dire prediction of one professor, who said, ‘Take care, the incubation period lasts for 15 years!" So we should not let the matter drop in this respect either.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the second bi‐annual report states that almost everything has been done. Among the points missing is the follow‐up to the Green Paper on food law. One more question, who will take the lead here? I wish them the best of luck!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Corrie </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr President, I also thank the rapporteurs. I must declare an interest in this debate as I am a beef and sheep farmer in Scotland. As most of my income used to come from exporting live pedigree cattle, I have a financial interest in the lifting of the export ban on beef from the United Kingdom. As a farmer I have watched the devastation BSE has caused, not just to British farmers but also to all the ancillary industries, such as transport, auction marts, abattoirs and downstream industries. British agriculture is now experiencing a crisis in all sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">While I welcome the report in that it gives us a chance to review the situation, there are a number of points I wish to comment on. Firstly, it is a great tragedy that BSE was treated as a British, and not a European, problem from the start. As tens of thousands of tonnes of contaminated feed were exported to mainland Europe, there was bound to be a European‐wide problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted the Commission is taking such a tough line on food safety throughout the beef industry in Europe as a whole, as this is the only way to protect public confidence. It is a pity that some nation states do not feel as strongly.</p>
<p class="contents">Being closely involved in the industry, I can assure Members that a huge effort has been made to make British beef safe. While we still have a few cases of BSE in some herds – mostly dairy – due to consumption of contaminated feed, most beef herds have never had any cases – and that includes my own – yet we all suffer. The paperwork and record‐keeping is now in place to give complete traceability from birth to the finished cut of meat in the shops. It is a huge burden of extra work for farmers, but well worth it to get the market opened up. The market and abattoirs are weighed down with inspectors at every level and the cost of inspections is now about 75 % of total costs to ensure that the rules are followed.</p>
<p class="contents">The British ban on meat on the bone is stupid and unnecessary and should be lifted. However, I welcome this report.</p>

First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, and then I would point out that this is sort of our last debate, the last debate for this Parliament and perhaps also for this Commission, and in a way I shall miss it. I shall miss it because above and beyond what we have achieved together – and the report sets this out clearly – I believe we have developed a working method (although this has not been easy for you, I imagine, nor for me either, I am sure you will grant me that) which makes each side"s responsibility clear, thereby avoiding institutional confusion and seeking cooperation despite our differences.</p>
<p class="contents">Leaving aside specific points, I think this is the most important thing that we have learned together. And I believe that the future Parliament and the future Commission should safeguard this method they have inherited in relations between the two institutions, with regard both to transparency and to scientific excellence. Some dossiers – apart from BSE where problems remain to be resolved as Mr Santini and Mr Imbeni pointed out – deal with complex subjects such as hormones for example, which Mrs Roth‐Behrendt mentioned, or genetically modified products: in short, on the food safety front there are complex dossiers for whoever comes along.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I should like to stress is the precautionary principle. I believe that first and foremost it is important to get this established at European level and then to promote it later at international level. We hope to get a consensus on 19 April for the precautionary principle to be included in the procedural manual for the Codex Alimentarius. If we succeed I think this will not just be an important milestone for the Union but will help in asserting this principle at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the legacy, one might say, that you are leaving for the future Parliament and that we are leaving for the future Commission. I do sincerely hope that whatever specific problems there may be, this working method becomes a shared resource. Perhaps just for once I may do something I never do and thank the Commission departments and my own office which, with you, have shown great patience and also, I believe, considerable tenacity.</p>
