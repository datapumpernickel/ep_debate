This cooperation with the ‘shadow rapporteurs’ has meant that the voting agenda, at least, looks very different than in the first reading: we have concentrated exclusively on the most important amendments. I hope that this fine cooperation will also continue in the voting tomorrow. The Commission, too, has been a good cooperation partner: we have held a great many discussions. Our special thanks go to Sweden, which acted as President during the first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">The main objective of the programme, of course, is to integrate environmental policy with the other sectors of policy. In this respect this forms a continuation to the Fifth Environmental Action Programme, but in the course of this integration we must attain concrete objectives and actual results, and then we will also need structural amendments, for example to the Commission's own actions. The objective of integration is of course that the environmental aspect be taken into consideration in the various policy sectors themselves. Special emphasis must be given to the areas of energy policy, transport policy, agriculture and fishing, since these are the most difficult areas from the point of view of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The future agricultural reform must take steps in the direction of more sustainable procedures, and the new instruments for improving the state of the environment must incorporate a clear focusing of the EU's aid policy on the environmental aspect. The conflict which presently reigns over subsidies from the environmental point of view must be eliminated. An inventory should be established of environmentally-damaging subsidies, and these must be phased out by 2010 at the latest. Money, incidentally, can act as a fine consultant, and in this spirit environmentally-related and energy taxes (for example) must also be developed. I am also very pleased that here in Parliament we have been able to give very broad approval to the idea that environmentally-related taxation needs to be developed also at EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">Qualitative and quantitative objectives, and timetables, must be set for the most important environmental problems. This has been a very contentious question: the Commission has not supported this, and the Council also has doubts. My own opinion is that in this type of programme it is very important to understand those requirements which are to be placed on decision-making from the environmental point of view. By setting objectives and by dividing them sensibly over time periods, we will make it possible for political decision-makers to understand, at any given future stage, what sort of decisions must be made in the situation at hand. In my opinion these objectives are required, in particular, as instruments for directing policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposes thematic strategies, which will subsequently guide the environmental policy of the future. The Commission suggests six; Parliament has added an urban thematic initiative, and this has been very largely approved. The thematic strategies must be approved using the codecision procedure. In my opinion this is quite self-evident, since it is through these strategies that we will be directing environmental policy in its crucial aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">As I stated, there are very few amendments; but I would like to say a few words about one of them. This is the amendment by the European Liberal and Democratic Party group concerning rejection of the common position. In my opinion this will not be of any benefit to this matter, nor do I understand its content; it is only by improving the common position that we will bring about improvements in European environmental policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given the daily practice of this Committee, these could only be concerns relating compliance with this legislation, as raised in some of the rapporteur’s amendments and compromise amendments. All policies should be integrated into environmental policy – as stated in some of the amendments – and public participation and information is necessary – also as stated in some of the amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not hiding the fact that, as a citizen of a small mining region in Asturias – and I am speaking here in a personal capacity and not on behalf of my group – that I have some problems with the amendment on imposing a time limit on subsidies for projects that could damage the environment. I do not have a problem with it in general terms, but specifically with regard to the fact that, in the region in which I live, more than 30 000 jobs have been lost as a direct result of restructuring. For this reason I do not agree with these amendments. However, we completely agree with the rest of them.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree with some of our fellow Members – and I am sure that my colleague Jonas Sjöstedt would support me here – that this latest proposal is not the one put forward by the European Parliament. This is a proposal that was debated, on which agreements were reached between all of the groups and between the rapporteur and the Commission and the Council to arrive at this latest proposal that we have here. For this reason, I also agree with the rapporteur that we cannot accept, and shall reject, the amendment from the Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform party that suggests rejecting the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal is highly important, Mr President. The Fifth Community Environment Action Programme has come to an end. The European Union needs a clearly defined strategy with commitments and specific timetables for the next few years and it seems to me that this is potentially a clearly defined proposal with commitments and a specific timetable, which, indeed, we have a great need to implement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And although the Council and the Commission have made an effort to accept the many amendments from our first reading, I think that we can now say that it is Parliament that has made the effort to try to find, and reach agreement on, common positions. In this regard, the role of Mrs Myller deserves a special mention.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that this is a reasonable programme that allows the Commission to work, makes it possible to legislate and allows States to be flexible within viable programmes, and for this reason we feel that we must support it. This is an appropriate framework for combining the development of European communities in a pivotal policy of sustainable development and I think that it is up to the task. If carried out in this way, it should be clear in conciliation that certain areas are subject to the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to talk about principles. The desire to see all methods used everywhere and to implement a uniform policy in all States runs counter to the principle of sustainability and belongs to the globalist mindset. It is very easy to attack globalisation when talking about the economy yet not to want to call imposing the same rules on the whole world globalisation. Social principles, technological viability and the context in which methods are applied are all of great importance to sustainability; the first principle of sustainability is to know how to combine general principles with the imposed rules to suit the needs of each community, each location, each climate and each context.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be sufficiently generous of spirit to give those in government the freedom to impose their own rules, something that we shall also continue to do, and to adapt them as they see fit.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we support a scientific policy and feel that the function of the Popular Party and of Parliament, in this case, is to support the Council and the Commission because codecision is not only Parliament’s right, but also a responsibility that should be used to help governments. For this reason, for example, we respect the dates of all these agreements that the Commission and the Council are to conclude with other European countries. We need to be serious in this regard and support this policy that has required such efforts to produce.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the thematic strategies and a more scientific policy precisely because this means adapting to the current state of affairs, adapting to the situation of a particular State, sector and to the issue at hand. We have to assess whether suitably adapted and applicable technologies exist, for in many instances, due to the climate, particular conditions, or size of a company, for example, technologies can differ. The results, however, should be the same.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we support the scientific nature and the study of the economic and social impacts that the programme will have, because without social principles, there can be no sustainability. For this very reason we are not in favour of simply revising subsidies, that is to say, of a target date being fixed whatever the subsidy may be, and this is particularly the case for specific sectors that have had to close due to measures dictated by the Commission, which has imposed laws upon them – such as in the coal sector, for example – that are now facing the problem of some criteria being applied more strictly than others.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us first define the criteria for negative subsidies and take account of the fact that five years is not a sufficient amount of time for a generation to recover nor for certain deprived areas to regenerate.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we reject the principle of substitution, because it offers no guarantees to industry, to the citizens, or to society, and lends itself to a very free interpretation by certain sectors, countries, civil servants or experts which may lead to the establishment of measures that are damaging to society and that have no legal guarantee. And the principle of legal guarantee is inherent to the Rule of Law.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this scheme of management can be implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is splendid to know that we are at last at the stage at which we are to adopt a position on the Sixth Environment Action Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this, it is not perhaps so surprising that many of us wish, and had wished, that the programme might have been better and feel disappointed that it is not as good as we would have liked. At the same time, we perhaps also feel some kind of frustration concerning the unfair distribution of power we sometimes seem to perceive between the institutions, and wish in some way to express this specifically in the case of the Sixth Environment Action Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to see liberals and others who are reflecting along these lines pull themselves together and rise above their own frustrations. Let us differentiate between policy and processes and do what we have a mandate for. Let us do it well and take the institutional and constitutional battle elsewhere and not where the Sixth Environment Action Programme is at issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us see what kind of thing the Sixth Environment Action Programme is and see what we are to use it for, namely as a guiding star in all EU policy –environmental and otherwise– and as a lynchpin of the entire sustainable development strategy with which we shall travel together to Johannesburg in September of this year. There is no reason for rejecting this document. We must adopt it today.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Mrs Myller’s reference to the common environment tax, I would make a point of mentioning recent reports in Sweden to the effect that the dramatic fall in the quantities of climate-changing gases is due precisely to the carbon dioxide tax. This further supports the case for our having to continue the fight, together with the Commission, to ensure that the Council is convinced that now is the time for us to introduce a common environment tax, especially where carbon dioxide is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the time, the Commission proposal came under heavy attack from us as the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party. In our view, the programme was far too broad and showed a serious lack of priorities. At the same time, we wondered whether a ten-year plan was really, in fact, outdated.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now eight months further on, and have had input from the Commission, the Council and Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. Any satisfaction or progress? No, unfortunately, neither. The proposal, as it was presented at the time, has since been cut down to the bone. The position of the Council of Ministers is deeply disappointing on all fronts. Last time, I used the image of a Christmas tree, trimmed with a multitude of proposals, which devalued the entire text.</p>
<p class="contents">The current plan has more in common with an empty box than a Christmas tree. The form is just about presentable, but is very much lacking in content. I can tell you straight away who is not to blame for this. Our rapporteur, Mrs Myller, has done sterling work, and the Commissioner has made every effort to tighten up the plan and take the wishes of this House more into consideration. However, it is the Council that has frustrated every substantial improvement to the proposal. It is staggering to realise that when we, as Parliament, vote on the plan’s current version, we shall in fact be back to square one, and this after two years of hard graft on the part of the Commission and Parliament. Can this be justified to the European citizen? They set great store by the environment. It is now the Council that has destroyed all the good work that has been done.</p>
<p class="contents">So what should have been done instead? According to my group, the priorities that are completely lacking in the plan are climate change, energy, waste and bio-diversity. In addition, the plan should have been much more concise and should have been characterised by far more cohesion and vision. In our view, the Council is best summed up as an emperor without clothes. He may seem unremarkable at first glance, but fails the test upon further inspection.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a strategy, it is even less than existing policy in a pleasant format. It therefore constitutes a step back, and we propose to reject the present proposal in its entirety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is also how it has been with the Sixth Environment Action Programme. First of all, it was not certain that we should obtain any action programme at all. When we then saw the Commission’s proposal, we thought that it was extremely vague and lacked both qualitative and quantitative objectives and timetables. An environment action programme must naturally establish environmental objectives if there is to be any point at all in having a programme. Mrs Myller, as rapporteur, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy have genuinely tried to improve the Sixth Environment Action Programme. I wish to thank the rapporteur for this and also thank other fellow MEPs for their valuable cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">When we are now about to adopt a view on the Council’s position at second reading, we see that the Council has in fact introduced a very great many of Parliament’s amendments. When it comes to specifying deadlines etc, things are still extremely sluggish, however. We must now take the opportunity of changing this by voting in favour of the committee’s amendments and the compromise amendments tabled by quite a few political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme’s overarching aim is to decouple, for example, environmental pressures from economic growth. Up until now, the improvements that have been made have been offset by increased production and consumption. Another general principle is to supply the basis and the priorities for sustainable development and to apply the precautionary and substitution principles. So that it is possible to do this, I should like to recommend all MEPs to vote in favour of Amendment No 44, which of course requires it to be discovered by no later than 2003 which forms of EU aid run directly counter to our aims, that is to say have a negative effect on the environment, and requires the year to be established by which this aid must be abolished.</p>
<p class="contents">Where chemicals and pesticides are concerned, I think that all the amendments tabled on this issue are sound. The chemicals organisations’ umbrella organisation, CEFIC, has taken the view that the amendments are not in accordance with the report on chemicals strategy. I maintain that this view has just been plucked out of thin air. It is sad that such an incomplete and one-sided analysis has been carried out. As rapporteur for the White Paper, I can assure you that these amendments are sound and that they strengthen the Sixth Environment Action Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the proposal from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, we should, in common with Mrs Hulthén, have liked the programme to have been more vigorous and have liked to get more measures through. The proposal is not now to be altered, however. There is so much we must do and agree upon within these institutions. That is why I would definitely wish to reject the ELDR’s proposal and call upon everyone to vote in favour of the proposal by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and of the compromise amendments that have been tabled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is a proposal which we cannot support. We think it would be irresponsible not to take a decision on the Sixth Environment Action Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I too should have liked the proposal to have gone much further. The original proposal was extremely weak and also vague. The fact is, however, that some of what Parliament contributed has been incorporated into the joint proposal. We shall therefore have the opportunity tomorrow to introduce a great many of the quantitative objectives and timetables we actually want to see. We must not pass up that opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">We must put this proposal in its context. During the period that this environment action programme is to apply, the European Union will be enlarged through the accession of a large number of new countries. There is a danger of this causing a number of problems in terms of environmental work too. There is a danger of the work’s losing momentum, and it may become more difficult to push through new environmental laws. It would not be particularly wise to do without environment action programmes at such a stage. So that environmental work does not lose momentum, it is no doubt desirable to have a programme with timetables and practical objectives to adhere to when enlargement takes place.</p>
<p class="contents">My group will vote in favour both of the committee’s proposal and of all the compromise amendments we arrived at in these negotiations. We do not think the situation is perfect, but we think it is acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish particularly to mention Amendment No 10, which I think is important. This concerns the European Investment Bank. There were quite a lot of MEPs who voted against this amendment in the committee. I find that incomprehensible because it is an amendment which goes to the very heart of integrating environmental considerations into other policy areas, something that the European Investment Bank has not been successful at doing. What is required of the bank, namely that it take account of the environment, ought to be self-evident. That is why it is so important for them to receive the clear message that they too are not exempt from what is required. The same applies to chemicals policy, where we want to see strict wordings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such is the case with the British government's nuclear installation at Sellafield. This is not just my view: the litany of management blunders and serious technical defects is a matter of public record, which has been exposed, despite efforts to keep it secret.</p>
<p class="contents">It is inconceivable that the British Government should set out to justify not only the continuity of Sellafield in its present dangerous condition, but also wish to add further to its operations by commissioning the MOX processing facility. Because of its closer proximity to Ireland than to most parts of the British mainland, the Irish Government has again raised serious objections to the continued operation of this dangerous plant.</p>
<p class="contents">Records in this House will show that on a previous occasion I called on the Commission to exercise its powers under Article 35 of the Euratom Treaty in relation to verification of nuclear installations at Sellafield. In reply to queries from my political group, the Commission recently confirmed that the last time it undertook such an audit was in 1993, nearly a decade ago. Bearing in mind the number of times that this matter has been raised in the House by all political groups, how can the Commission possibly justify its silence and inactivity on a matter of such serious public concern? I call on the Commission to immediately initiate an examination of all activities on the Cumbria site and ask the Commissioner to give assurance to that effect in his reply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The end result is a real labyrinth that is incomprehensible to the citizen. However, the Council has again adopted a more realistic position by not setting a binding timetable or target. So what does the rapporteur want? Is it realistic, for instance, to incorporate the substitution principle, which currently has no political or legal definition?</p>
<p class="contents">There are also issues surrounding environmental crime, environmentally related taxes and legislation on environmental responsibility. We should also be in step with the resolution that was adopted last November relating to chemicals. These issues, which are crucial for our economy, cannot be dealt with hurriedly within the framework of this report. I am also concerned by the emphasis placed on biodiversity, with the headache involved in setting up the Natura 2000 network, both in France and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">The approach to this subject is not correct either and there are alternatives. We shall therefore vote in favour of rejecting the amendment as a whole. Let us remain realistic and pragmatic. Let us go back to the main aims of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme, namely to ensure a high level of protection, taking into account the subsidiarity principle and diversity in the various regions of the Community. To do this, in my view, is already a fair challenge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like, on behalf of the committee, to thank Mrs Müller for the immense amount of work she has put into this report. I underline my support for the amount of work she has done because I actually disagree with many of the conclusions she has come to. Nevertheless, we have dealt with this matter so extensively that we will probably not gain anything by extending the process to the full beauties of late-night conciliation in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments tabled by the committee and the rapporteur do not really add up to anything of substance and, where they do, the results would probably be to damage the chances of success of the Environmental Action Programme. I draw your attention to Amendment No 11, which is already out of date.</p>
<p class="contents">I would criticise, as Mr Bernié has done, the reliance of the rapporteur to a considerable extent on jargon. Old war horses are trotted out again and given one more exhausted run around the course. The chemical industry is focused on as the villain of the piece and the substitution principle makes a well-earned reappearance in the amendments that the committee has asked the House to consider. The assumption of at least Amendment No 1 – and to some extent Amendment No 30 – is that the substitution principle exists as a fully worked-out concept. It does not. It is an amalgam of assumptions and suspicions fudged together by the green movement as a universal panacea. The amendments talk of this as a fully worked-out policy, but we should at least be consistent. The Schörling report, which we voted on a few months ago, called on the Commission to produce a definition of the substitution policy principle, so we can hardly deal with it now as though it really is in existence.</p>
<p class="contents">Do we need a Sixth Environmental Action Programme? I do not share the cynicism and despair of some in the ELDR Group. Some sort of route map or check list is helpful and desirable. The Commission probably built on previous mistakes by attaching so much weight to the idea of a programme. The poor Commissioner wanted a slim programme and has ended up with a fatty!</p>
<p class="contents">I also regret – and she may regret – the submission of the programme to full codecision because that has certainly lengthened the process without adding to the substance. The best part of the Environmental Action Programme for me is the concentration on better implementation. In the old days we wanted an action programme in order to put pressure on the Council to agree to legislation. Now the trouble is that the Council does agree to legislation and then does very little about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Without better implementation we are deceiving the people of Europe into believing that things are getting better and better, in the words of the old Labour Party advertisement. Just as at home in UK things are not getting better and better, the words remain easy to say but they are often not followed by action and it is up to us to see that they are. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly Mrs Jackson has reached that certain age and she now thinks everything in the past better than it is now.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mrs Jackson, I also wish to thank the rapporteur for her good work. This document is worth voting for, but it would be more worthwhile voting for if it contained a few more of Parliament's amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of chemicals policy, the field of preserving biodiversity, climate change, transport and the protection of air and water quality, there are clear and worthwhile proposals that could be built upon in the conciliation process.</p>

She managed to get an excellent report adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. I have to be honest. The Council proposal is weak, lacks any imagination, any specific goals and is a welter of words. My criticism is also levelled at the four Green Ministers who may have promised progress, but who failed to deliver.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither can the proposal as it now stands be used as propaganda material for young people, as Commissioner Wallström stated. This is why it should be binned, and the large majority of my group will support the amendment of the Liberals to reject the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the political choice of the two large groups, the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats and the Group of the Party of European Socialists. If they vote against and reject the amendment, they too will be responsible for this weak and empty concoction.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, the Greens will support all amendments to improve the proposal. A one per cent reduction in greenhouse gases annually, certification of wood, sustainably-produced and otherwise, the amendment to which the GUE made reference, the European Investment Bank, the chemicals policy along with the substitution principle. Mrs Jackson, I have to get this off my chest. These are not the inspired ramblings of a Green mind, they are existing policy in Denmark and Sweden, and even the new Danish government, that is from the right-wing school of thought, has no intention of changing this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments, which include a legal framework for voluntary agreements between industry and the European Commission, are all sound, but I have very little hope that they will obtain the required 314 votes. This means that, ultimately, the officials of the European Commission will get their way, the same officials who proposed the policy not to present a Sixth Environmental Action Programme under any circumstances. This is why this is a defeat for politics and for European environmental policy. And the key culprit is the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats, prompted by certain officials from the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is still not too late. Tomorrow, we will vote, and I hope that maybe some of the Christian-Democrats will see sense and will be prepared to vote for a number of sensible amendments, so that maybe we will end up with a conciliation procedure, which will have some substance at least and which will not merely be a welter of words. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was very relevant in those days, for we had to start more or less from scratch. A great deal was subsequently achieved, but I am now increasingly feeling uncomfortable. The evaluation of the Fifth EAP has clearly shown that we are up a blind alley. Partly because many Member States have failed to implement environmental legislation, the objectives of the Fifth EAP have not been achieved. Since we are unable to draft a programme that adds value to what we are already doing in the environmental sphere, I wonder whether we should continue drafting environmental action programmes. I will for this reason support Mr Maaten’s amendment to reject the Council’s common position. This is no reflection on the rapporteur, Mrs Myller, or the Commissioner, Mrs Wallström, but is about the Council’s role.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us now focus on the actual implementation of the Fifth EAP. What will matter most are the implementation of, and compliance with, current environmental legislation, especially in the light of enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, in this debate, as many other speakers have said too, a number of key points still have to be defined. Indeed, although the Council has incorporated most of the amendments adopted by the European Parliament at first reading, the Sixth Framework Programme lacks specific working time frames and its strategic objectives need to be defined in more practical terms. We must not forget that this programme will have to operate over a decade or so, and so an approximate work schedule and poorly defined aims are completely unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the European Parliament’s latest amendments call for more decisive, tougher action against the danger of pesticides – this applies both to the present Member States and those waiting to join the Union – again, there must be a substantial effort to combat the greenhouse effect, the increasing sound pollution that pursues us all the time, wherever we go, the too frequent environmental disasters caused by human negligence, disasters for which it is becoming increasingly difficult to find out who is responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, once again, the European Parliament’s amendments seek to make some of the proposals already mentioned practical reality. I just want to summarise them under at least four basic headings, four areas which have been defined as priorities: climate change, biodiversity, the connection between the environment and human health, and waste disposal. These issues are so vitally important that anything less than total precision and total responsibility on our part would be absolutely unacceptable, and we cannot put off dealing with them to a later date as the Council seems to want to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I consider neither the Commission's proposal nor the report presented by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy to be worthless. I do not, therefore, quite understand the proposal by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and the Group of the Greens that the proposal and the common position should be rejected in their entirety. Another reason why I do not understand it is that, if I understand rightly, the Member States' environment ministers are not exclusively Christian Democrats but, rather, primarily Greens and also liberal Social Democrats and members of our family of parties. To be sure, we often have to criticise and improve what the Council submits to us but, in view of this political constellation, it is somewhat problematic to say that it is all nonsense. Despite our criticisms, we have to improve on the Council's proposal without completely rejecting it.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I would call upon us to produce some stringent wording concerning subsidies that have harmful effects on the environment. The Council's wording strikes me as too weak. I believe that, whenever it is said that the protection of the environment costs money, one has first to bear in mind that, of course, the destruction of the environment and its consequences cost money, and that it is even worse when the destruction of the environment is being subsidised – in other words, when money is being paid out for it. There are possibilities there for very effective savings. I therefore emphatically support the idea of reducing subsidies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee has now decided on 2005 as a deadline. A lot of people have problems with that, and not only in our group. That is why there are various proposals for compromise. I believe, though, that we must, whatever happens, agree on an amendment that is more stringent than what the Council has decided on. We should also not put other economic instruments, such as a fiscal reform, to one side, but should follow them through at a European level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, it is an exciting journey that is being undertaken with a proposal for a new Environment Action Programme. It has been extremely instructive. Clearly, a certain comfort has sometimes been found in the fact that you have, at all events, had kind and friendly things to say about both myself and the skilful rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Possibly we should have talked rather more about what was expected from the Sixth Environment Action Programme as early as when you questioned me. We perhaps should have straightened this out at an earlier stage, for I can see that this debate embraces many incompatible and rather contradictory desires.</p>
<p class="contents">We appreciate that a programme may be needed that extends over a longer period because environmental problems often arise after a certain number of years. We also need a longer planning period if the measures we take are to be the right ones. On the other hand, we should of course very much like to draw up practical measures and objectives because it is in that way that we can put pressure on the Member States. We cannot, however, just come up with credible objectives for a ten-year period. The programme states the overarching objectives, and it is of course extremely important for us to know that this is the direction in which we must be moving. At the same time, we are concerned here with a programme of action and of measures to be taken, and that is what we have aimed at. We must state how we intend to set about achieving the objectives, while the practical objectives and deadlines must be incorporated into, respectively, the thematic strategy and the various draft laws and other proposals we submit during this ten-year period. The idea behind the programme was not, then, just to continue with the same thing and add a long list of legislative proposals to those which were already in the Fifth Action Programme and which, moreover, as Mrs Jackson quite correctly said, fail very often to be implemented properly. That is something we must get to grips with.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, however, also important to emphasise what we in actual fact agree about, that is to say the overall structure and the priorities. It is a question of daring to say that these four issues are the most important. It is also a question of the underlying principles that are to govern environmental policy during this ten-tear period and of the need to consult widely and to have broad participation in decision-making on environmental issues. We agree on which issues are to be highlighted: climate change, the natural environment and bio-diversity, health and environmental measures, and the issues of how we use our natural resources and dispose of waste. We also agree that current legislation is to be fully implemented in practice, that environmental considerations are to be integrated into all other policy areas and that legislators, decision makers and the general public must have access to adequate information.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy for the next ten years is in actual fact based upon the Fifth Environment Action Programme, which has been developed by means of a description of how environmental policy and its challenges have altered. Current patterns of life and consumption, the way in which goods are produced and the way in which we live and operate as private individuals affect environmental problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The environmental action programme is challenging. I am aware of the fact and accept responsibility for it. Even though there has been some tough criticism, I believe it is right to dare to tackle something new and try to find a new structure. For me, it was important to design an environment action programme which everyone, and not only the experts, can follow and assess when new proposals are made and initiatives presented, as was the case for example with the recent climate package. That is why I do not of course agree with rejecting the Council’s common position. Now that we have carried out all this work, we ought surely to try to complete it and help each other as far as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy offers its unqualified support for the general approach to developing future environmental policy that forms part of the Council’s common position. Of relevance here too are the requirements that policy must be based upon participation and dialogue and upon the best possible scientific findings that are available. That means that we must be very thorough in analysing the problems we face, together with possible solutions, at the same time as studying current research and making use of indicators etc. In that way, we shall create policy through solid work, and that will be in accordance with the strategic orientation of this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">It also means, as I said, that it is meaningless to introduce objectives and guidelines into the programme more or less arbitrarily. At the same time, I want to avoid possible misunderstandings and explain clearly that I do of course support the use of clear objectives and deadlines. Moreover, our proposals will include these, and they must be discussed in both Parliament and the Council. The few overarching objectives the programme now contains are generally known, and so they should be.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also, of course, able to approve the additional objectives proposed by the Commission in its communication on sustainable development prior to the Gothenburg Summit, that is to say Amendments Nos 11, 15, 16 and 27. That is, however, on condition that they faithfully reflect our communication. I cannot approve the incorporation of other objectives into the programme, as has been done in Amendments Nos 17, 24, 25, 26, 34 and 42.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also gratifying that the committee supports the idea of, and proposal for, thematic strategies, together with the proposed content of these. The committee has added a proposal on the urban environment. This is to be found in Amendments Nos 32 and 33, which are acceptable overall. We thus have a stable platform for future work and cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that the proposal that the strategies should be ready to implement within three years is in conflict with the requirement for best scientific findings and for broadly based consultation and participation. We should also remember that we have seven thematic strategies to deal with. In the light, too, of Amendment No 12, requiring all thematic strategies to be subject to the co-decision procedure, this means that the Commission must present all the thematic strategies by no later than the end of the year so that there is time for the co-decision procedure. We can perhaps meet the deadline for some isolated thematic strategy, but scarcely for all of them. That is why I would call upon the European Parliament not to push this issue too hard. Give us an opportunity to develop the strategies and to put forward a package of measures that is best suited to the current problems. We cannot therefore approve Amendments Nos 12, 13 and 41, but I shall keep the European parliament informed of our work on the thematic strategies, and we shall submit oral reports each year in order to fulfil the requirement in Amendment No 14.</p>
<p class="contents">I must inform Parliament that I am opposed to most of the amendments concerning chemicals. The problem with these is that there is no agreed definition of the principle of indemnification. We should therefore examine this carefully before we make it legally binding. Naturally, I believe it has its part to play, but before we make it legally binding we must arrive at a definition which is tenable. Regarding the proposal that the REACH Register should include all existing substances and that all products, unlike substances and preparations, should be labelled, all I can say is that it would be practically impossible. We are nonetheless able in principle to approve Amendment No 31 on the coordination of the work involving chemicals and pesticides, even if there is already such coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the issue of voluntary commitments and agreements, we see these as part of an advantageous mix of various political tools including, for example, legal and financial tools. According to the OECD, there are more than 300 agreements in the Member States of the Community. They differ considerably from one another, depending upon how flexibly they are adapted to different situations and objectives. The Commission plans to submit a communication examining the potential of such tools. It is too early to determine what the agreements under the programme will look like, and we cannot therefore approve Amendments Nos 9 and 40.</p>
<p class="contents">There is general support from the Commission regarding quite a number of other issues, for example sustainable development and integration, measures affecting tax rates at Community level, environmental crimes etc. In addition to those I mentioned earlier, the Commission is able to support Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 18, 19, 21, 39 and 45, together with parts of Amendments Nos 43, 46 and 47. I cannot however accept the other amendments tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">We are close to reaching an agreement on the Environment Action Programme for the next ten years. Mrs Myller’s efforts as rapporteur at this second reading have been much appreciated. No repetition of the debate is required because her amendments have been carefully selected, something which bodes well for the next step in the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, on the basis of the amendments supported by the Commission, the Council will adopt a positive approach to Parliament's opinion so that those of us in the Commission, the Council and Parliament, in conjunction with other interested parties, can together continue with our work on conserving and improving our environment. Thank you for an interesting debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
