It is well over a year since the European Parliament adopted a decision on the existence of a global system for intercepting private and commercial communications – what is known as the Echelon interception system. The decision states that there is no longer any doubt about the existence of a worldwide system for intercepting communications. The decision was based upon a report from the Temporary Committee on the Echelon Interception System. The report drew attention to a number of arrangements for protecting private individuals and enterprises in the EU. In my view, this is a very comprehensive and commendable piece of work. The report has done a lot to contribute to there having been particular awareness of this area in the EU, the Member States and the national parliaments. As a Member of the European Parliament, I had the pleasure of participating in one of the hearings held by the Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The focus that there has been on the ability to intercept communications with a view to obtaining commercial advantages has also helped the people of Europe and European companies to appreciate the need to protect communications.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with Parliament’s reading of the report, the then Belgian Presidency’s contribution dealt with the basic principles that ought to apply to any interception system. In this context, the Presidency referred, for example, to the central principles for protecting privacy and the right to free communication, expressed in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 7 of the European Union’s Charter. </p>
<p class="contents">I should like to refer to what the then Belgian Presidency said about the matter. My approach will be a different one. In my capacity as representative of the Presidency of the Council, I want to focus on the protection of our communications. Unfortunately, we must of course take account of the fact that technological development has, to a much greater extent than previously, made it technically possible to intercept our communications. Unlawful interception of private communications or the surveillance of companies for the purpose of distorting competition is naturally unacceptable and a serious offence, and it is therefore important for the Member States, both individually and in a European context, to be aware of the possibility of this form of surveillance and to go on working to achieve the best possible protection of people’s and companies’ communications.</p>
<p class="contents">Work is already being done in an EU context to increase the security of communications for the individual. This has most recently found expression in the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector. It is the Presidency’s view that, over and above this, efforts should be made to obtain an increased use of encryption, just as there should be a focus upon IT security, both in the EU institutions and in the nation states.</p>
<p class="contents">IT security is a top priority in the common European action plan, ‘<span class="italic">e</span>Europe 2005’, which covers, for example, the development of secure communications used for the secure exchange of qualified public information within the Community. The action plan is also aimed at promoting a security culture in all areas in which work is done on developing and using information and communications systems. Finally, the action plan also includes the establishment of a Cyber Security Task Force which, in cooperation with the Member States and the private sector, is to operate as a catalyst for initiatives in the security area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danish Presidency believes it is important for the initiatives in the ‘<span class="italic">e</span>Europe 2005’ action plan to be put into practice. Allow me to note in conclusion that the Presidency would also like to work towards a Council resolution’s being adopted, aimed at establishing a common strategy for network and information security with a view to establishing a common European security culture. The proposal for a resolution calls, for example, upon the Member States to ensure that IT security becomes an essential feature of the individual countries’ rules, just as the Member States should adopt satisfactory measures to prevent and respond to events involving security.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the proposal calls upon the Member States to encourage partnership between the university world and companies, with a view to bringing about secure technology and maintenance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Madam President, little more than a year ago we gathered in this House to discuss the outcome of the proceedings of the Temporary Committee on Echelon. A few days later, on 11 September, the entire world was in shock.</p>
<p class="contents">The world changed. The role of network and information security proved to be crucial. We also found that European society was increasingly vulnerable to problems related to network and information security.</p>
<p class="contents">Before responding to the main concerns raised by the European Parliament, I would like stress, as I did last year, a strong and solid underlying principle: the European Union is founded on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, based on Article 6 of the Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important also to keep in mind that Member States remain responsible for the conduct and supervision of intelligence operations, unless the Council decides otherwise, as specified in Title V of the Treaty on the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With the rapid spread of information technology, economic growth, productivity, employment and social equity have come to depend increasingly on the smooth operation of ICTs.</p>
<p class="contents">In today’s debate, network and information security is about ensuring the availability of services and data, preventing the disruption and unauthorised interception of communications, securing the confidentiality of data and protecting information systems against unauthorised access.</p>
<p class="contents">Full security will never be achievable. There will always be weak points, attacks, incidents and failures that will generate damage. This is no different from other technologies or other aspects of daily life. Society as a whole, as well as individuals, has to learn how to manage the risks involved in the networks and information systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Security has therefore become a major policy concern. Governments have wider responsibilities towards society and are making efforts to improve security on their territory.</p>
<p class="contents">This was the underlying objective of the Commission Communication on Network and Information Security, which proposed a number of measures, such as awareness-raising actions and improved exchange of information mechanisms. One example of awareness raising is the benchmarking of national policies in support of secure e-business.</p>
<p class="contents">The newly adopted <span class="italic">e</span>Europe 2005 Action Plan aims to strengthen the exchange of information and good practice, to establish a European centre of competence, to create a culture of security and to establish a secure communication environment. We need to assign responsibilities to all the sectors involved in information and communication technologies in order to create a culture of security.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council resolution of 28 January 2002 on a common approach and specific actions in the area of network and information security also developed this concept further. It welcomes the intention of the Commission to make proposals for the establishment of a cyber security task force.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has dealt with the issue by preparing a report on the Commission’s policy proposal, which was adopted yesterday, calling for a strong European answer to the increasing information security problem.</p>
<p class="contents">With the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission advocating closer European coordination, the setting up of a ‘security entity’, as the most efficient way to achieve this objective, is now under consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal being considered at present suggests a number of issues, interests and concerns that are addressed by Parliament. Based on those concerns, the following measures may be suggested: a centre of expertise should be set up, bringing together competent people that will be trusted by public bodies and national and Community institutions, as well as by the private sector; will help to establish internationally recognised standards; and will be able to act efficiently and quickly. Sufficient human and financial resources will therefore be necessary to enable smooth and flexible operation, as will a coherent approach – including cross-pillar dimensions – since security also touches upon certain issues related to law enforcement and national security concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn now to data protection. Article 17 of the general data protection directive contains the principle of data security. The new directive on the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector was adopted last July. It will provide a high level of protection for processed personal data. It includes a provision that requires Member States to guarantee confidentiality of communications and to prohibit any form of interception. However, Member States can, according to the European Convention on Human Rights, take measures where this is necessary to safeguard national or public security interests or to investigate crime and prosecute criminal offences.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has launched initiatives to ensure compatibility between data protection and privacy rules on the one hand and law enforcement needs on the other. With this in view, an EU Forum on Cyber-Crime has been set up.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the interception of telecommunications for criminal investigation purposes is concerned, the Commission believes that the interception rules in the EU Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters constitute, at the current stage, a balanced approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The dual-use regulation, which includes export control provisions for information security products and services, in place since September 2000, guarantees the availability and free circulation of encryption products and technologies throughout the European Union. Its implementation has been successful, and the Commission is currently discussing the complex issue of export controls with candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the technology itself, support through the Community’s framework research programme, in particular the information society technologies programme, has improved the conditions for developing top-of-the-range encryption products. This brings me to the activities undertaken to improve our in-house information and communication systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the adoption of the regulation on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions, a wide-ranging security review took place. As a result, a Commission decision has been adopted containing security provisions and extensive rules on IT security. This decision substantially improves the protection of Commission documents which are not accessible to the general public. It further defines the various responsibilities of actors, including security clearance of personnel and security briefings.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, a Commission-wide technical auditing process has been carried out. Action to improve the situation is ongoing. As you see, we have achieved quite a lot already, but there is still a substantial amount of work to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">The recently adopted data protection directive, the report from the European Parliament on the proposed information security policy, the eEurope 2005 Action Plan and the plans to establish a European cyber security unit will further lay down the modalities for future work in the area of network and information security.</p>
<p class="contents">But enhanced cooperation is also needed globally. As an example of this cooperation, it is worth mentioning that the Commission was extensively involved in the drawing up of the recently adopted OECD guidelines on the security of information systems and networks.</p>
<p class="contents">These guidelines emphasise the importance of applying certain common principles for information security, underpin the work which is taking place at European level and are in line with the ‘culture of security’ principle as addressed in the <span class="italic">e</span>Europe 2005 Action Plan.</p>
<p class="contents">In December, the Telecommunication Council will debate and monitor the status of implementation of the common European strategy on network and information security, an issue the Danish presidency sees as a top priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Through these actions by the European institutions and Member States, we hope to sharpen the focus and step up efforts on network and information security as a vital measure to prevent illegal interception or economic espionage, underpinning the smooth functioning of our economies and societies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you know, a year ago the Echelon Committee tabled its final report. The work was also widely praised. Even when we were still drafting the report, however, it was already clear that the Commission was treating the matter like the famous three monkeys who, in the Buddhist tradition, are supposed to report on mankind at the Koshin festival in accordance with the dictum, ‘Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil’. One year on we might almost add, 'and do not do very much either', because so far the Commission has not acted to remedy very many of the shortcomings or implement many of the tasks described in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you will be aware of what we call on the Commission to do in items 27 to 44 of the report. The question that is still outstanding is: what have you done about informing the public and companies of the dangers posed by Echelon? What have you done to ensure that e-mails within the Commission are systematically encrypted? And what has been done about training Commission staff in new technologies and encryption? It is not enough to introduce new technologies; you have to provide further training for staff as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Your data protection directives, which are very important and very far-reaching, are actually only of limited interest here. There too the question is: what has happened within the Commission? You said that you had adopted a decision. Nevertheless, I see no evidence that the Commission has in the meantime carried out the security analysis that we requested, which actually also requires the development of a comprehensive system for classifying people and documents so as to protect secrets. That was clear from what you said. My question, then, is: who is responsible for this in the Commission? I remember very well the time that you sent Mr Perkins to see us. He was the head of the Commission's encryption service. He could certainly tell us how advanced the cryptographic hardware was, but could not tell us anything about general security standards in the Commission. Clearly there was nobody who was really responsible for this, and – at least this is my feeling – there is still nobody today either. Or, Commissioner, are you or one of the Directorates-General responsible for ensuring that documents are continuously classified? Do you intervene in personnel issues and classify people so as to guarantee security in the Commission?</p>
<p class="contents">Nowadays, every national institution has someone who is in charge of protecting secret information and does precisely these tasks. Do you now have such a person in your Commission, someone who is also responsible for raising awareness of possible attacks by the Echelon system? Or are you actually still working with a British fax encryption system, Commissioner? I almost fear that the answer is yes, because you did not say anything about this.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we are going to give you a helping hand by adopting a new resolution and, Commissioner, should progress on this continue to be as disappointing as it has been so far, and should our points continue to be almost ignored, then we would also have to reach an understanding on the basis of the forthcoming Commission discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">Our instructions to you will be on the table very shortly. I urge you to act on them!</p>

Parliament made a host of recommendations to the Commission and the Council to which we have never actually received a response. I assume that other Members will also be expanding on this point. I should like to focus on one aspect of last year's debate.</p>
<p class="contents">In the resolution we adopted last year on the worldwide interception of telecommunications, a great deal of attention was devoted to the political importance of international cooperation on the part of the intelligence services. An important point in that debate was that the vast majority of this Parliament is not opposed to interception <span class="italic">per se</span> and that intelligence services are necessary even in a democracy. In the report drawn up by the temporary committee, it was emphasised that effective intelligence services are necessary in our modern society. Not only in the fight against terrorism and international crime, but also as a key element in the development of our own European security policy. If we want to accomplish autonomous capacity in the area of defence and our own intervention force within the framework of the Petersberg tasks, then the ability and capacity to gather intelligence forms part of this. This is why the European Parliament has called for better European cooperation in this area and better democratic control over the functioning of intelligence services. According to our report, this aspect too leaves a great deal to be desired in a number of countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Under pressure from international terrorism and the events of last year, cooperation between the intelligence services seems to have improved, not only within the European Union but also with the United States. With regard to democratic control, however, little appears to have changed. European citizens are entitled to know that the privacy enshrined in their national legislation is also protected in the event of international cooperation between the intelligence services. European citizens and companies must be able to rely on the confidentiality of their communications being guaranteed in the same way across the EU. They must be given the guarantee that European intelligence services are not misused to steal company secrets but to fight criminal activities effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, we should like to thank Commissioner Liikanen for informing this House about the technical aspects of the worldwide interception of communications on behalf of the Commission. It is, however, regrettable, that Commissioner Patten is not here to inform us further about the international aspects I mentioned a moment ago. Without sufficient clarity on this score, EU policy is not only incomplete but also lacks credibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only does this technology make this possible, it is also being done, as was illustrated from our inquiry. I then ask myself what we are doing about this.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Liikanen mentioned the Charter of constitutional rights, but the Liberal group was quite firm in its belief that a legal framework is necessary in order to curb illegal tapping practices and to clearly define legal interception with effective control at European level. The Liberal group opted for a dual-track approach in this respect, namely the protection of the rights and privacy of the individual citizen on the one hand, and the safeguarding of the EU's economic interests by means of measures to prevent industrial espionage on the other. We also proposed specific measures. Instead, the Justice and Home Affairs Council is now talking about far-reaching competences of the Member States for data storage of both telecommunications and the Internet. Who actually protects our citizens against the authorities?</p>
<p class="contents">My next point is that we also asked for very specific measures to stimulate awareness among citizens and the business community. This includes the development of European encryption software and security analysis. I would now ask both the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner: what is actually being done about this, what has been accomplished so far and what is in the pipeline on this score? I do in fact have the feeling that little is being done about any of our recommendations, and I should like to draw your attention once again to Mrs Flesch’s remark directed at Commissioner Liikanen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After the work of the Echelon committee, the European Union finally acknowledged this interception system exists, and the subject of this debate – as Mrs Flesch rightly pointed out at the beginning of the debate – is Echelon. Nothing more, nothing less, so let us not beat about the bush.</p>
<p class="contents">I have nothing more to say, except that, having heard Mr von Boetticher and all the other Members speak, I associate myself with what they have said and agree with them, for they have already given a comprehensive picture of what was not done after that work had been carried out. We poured time and human resources into the issue but we have very little to show for it, for, until today, neither the Commission nor the Council have made any effort to protect the citizens. There is another dimension to the problem: companies and institutions, with all the human and material resources available to them, are quite able to protect themselves, but the real message of the Echelon committee was that the citizens and their privacy need to be protected, that there is a fundamental right to privacy. Well then, thus far, nothing has been done in Europe in this area and I feel that the failure of the institutions and Parliament itself to take any practical steps regarding Echelon and the matter of interception of communications damages their legitimacy. The legitimacy of our institutions is truly diminished by this.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may be so bold, it is my opinion that the Council and the Commission should, at least, consider drawing up a framework decision protecting the citizens from arbitrary interception of communications and giving them the right to plead their cause before a court, to appeal to a national court for prosecution of these types of interception. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People still do not feel adequately protected. The Council should adopt a framework decision which provides protection against the activities of intelligence services of other Member States or third countries. The very existence of systems for the indiscriminate interception of communications is a violation of Article 6 of the EU Treaty, as the Commissioner himself has recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also essential that an agreement should be negotiated and signed between the European Union and the United States, stipulating that each party should observe the provisions governing protection of the privacy of citizens and the confidentiality of business communications.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is strongly opposed to the actions taken by the Council with a view to bringing telecommunications interception capabilities into line with the new technologies. We particularly oppose the adoption of the directive under which Member States may, inter alia, adopt legislative measures providing for the retention of data for a limited period.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency needs to produce some sort of strategy to bring an end to the existence within the European Union of parallel data protection systems and the proliferation of monitoring authorities – for example Schengen, Europol or customs conventions. They work on the basis of differing protection standards and outside true democratic and legal scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the promotion of encryption cannot be a substitute for efforts to find political solutions – more strict legal guarantees and effective parliamentary control, for example. To say that encryption will solve our problems is an admission of failure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many experts were heard, many visits were made and countless documents were studied, culminating in the excellent report by Mr Gerhard Schmid, whose conclusions were approved by an enormous majority in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost all of our work was conducted in public, with a few rare exceptions in which the nature of the actions or the bodies being heard required this to take place behind closed doors. We concluded that an ‘Echelon’ network must exist, able to intercept and process communications, involving the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. We clearly stated our concern about the low level of protection given to our individual freedoms against this threat, about the security of communications sent and received by our businesses, and even about ‘fair trade’ in the international market.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in this plenary, we adopted 44 recommendations intended mainly for the Council, the Commission and the Member States. My feeling is that everyone has chosen to forget this report and its conclusions. I can, first of all, only deplore the decision by Parliament’s Bureau not to promote the publication of the report. And, returning to the Council and the Commission, it is time to state clearly that little activity has been seen this year. Our situation today vis-à-vis the citizens and our businesses is not substantially different to that of a year ago. We have even seen a trend that we must definitely combat – and on this matter I must highlight the intervention by Mr Haarder in the previous debate – which is to suggest that the fight against international crime and terrorism is necessarily undertaken at the cost of our freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">I must repeat and emphasise that security is a tool with which to protect our freedom, but when security requirements stifle freedoms we are betraying our fundamental values and fall into tyranny. I hope that, a year from now, we do not have to come once again before the Council, the Commission and the Member States, and repeat what we have said today: that little has been done and that almost everything is as it was before. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would just like to point out that, last year, the Italian Socialist Party delegation abstained in the vote on the Smith report because the report did not place sufficient emphasis on the fact that the indiscriminate interception of communications by Echelon are contrary to any human rights legislation. Indeed, interception is not subject to any restrictions, it is not authorised by a legal decision and the objectives are not stated. It is like casting a net and waiting for someone to say the word ‘bomb’ or ‘attack’. Since then, we have not expressed an opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">After 11 September, of course, all this was forgotten, and people said to each other: ‘You see how necessary the secret service is!’ It is necessary, but the objection could have been raised that, considering its failure to prevent terrorism thus far, it might not be very effective. In any case, before us today is a report which reveals that not a great deal has been done to comply with the requests, the 44 recommendations we had made. I, for one, feel that it is essential for the Commission’s report to be published so that the citizens receive some information. It is also essential to insist that legislation respecting the Charter of Fundamental Rights – both that devised by the Convention and that we adopted before Nice – be introduced in all the countries of the Union. This should be a condition for membership of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the problem then arises of democratic control of the secret services in the various States, which is, in effect, largely non-existent. Lastly, I would point out – without wishing to cause offence – that the United Kingdom is still a Member of Echelon and I believe continues to work together with the United States, in other words with the people masterminding all the anti-terrorist activities, who are explicitly violating human rights – consider Guantanamo, the bombings and such like. How can we be sure that these so-called allies of ours are not violating human rights through intercepting communications too? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I endorse all they have said thus far but I would like to add a specific point of my own.</p>
<p class="contents">We are continuing to focus, as Mr Vattimo did in his last speech, on the Anglo-American system of systematic, blanket interception of communications filtered by search engines, but we are continuing to ignore the fact – and we are all responsible for we all know what is going on – that these systems are also being used in European countries such as Germany, Holland and France. In actual fact, we have a situation where some Union Member States are intercepting the activities of the institutions, citizens and firms of other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">These indiscriminate systems of data and document interception and communication violate the fundamental right of respect for one’s private life which is enshrined in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As Commissioner Liikanen stated just now, these systems flagrantly violate the European citizens’ freedoms, and thus undermine the concept of free trade and the security of the Union too. We consider these violations to be unacceptable, and the Commissioner’s words, tossed as they were into the middle of the debate, will only be sufficient if they are borne out by subsequent action.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to remind the Commissioner and the Minister of item 9 of Parliament’s recommendations, calling for the adoption of a system of democratic control of the independent European intelligence services – to which we have received no response – and of other related intelligence activities at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, we cannot address such sensitive points relating to the interception of communications and the supervision of police and intelligence services without dealing with a key issue which is a source of discrimination – judicial and parliamentary control, or democratic control. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After a year's work, the Echelon Committee tabled recommendations and requests. It is only good parliamentary control if we enquire, one year on, what has become of them. Allow me to make a preliminary remark. A few days after the debate that we held last year, there was the horrific attack of 11 September on the United States of America. There were two reactions to this. Some said that this proved that the interception systems were useless and that they ought to be abolished, while others wanted to put the secret services and their activities out to public tender. Both reactions are wrong!</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of this House was convinced that strategic telecommunications controls could be a useful instrument for intelligence services, provided that legal safeguards and a proper system of checks and balances were in place. What happened on 11 September does not in any way change our demands for clear legal bases, for parliamentary control and for the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights to be complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the range of demands that we made, I should like to highlight the essential aspects for whose implementation the Commission is responsible, and will not therefore mention anything in the field of external policy or at international level. As Commissioner Liikanen stated, the Commission has done a considerable amount of work on IT security. If you take a closer look you discover that these are initiatives that would have been necessary in any case because of <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce and of the need to support the IT industry. Parliament had made precise demands, which – at least this is my impression, Commissioner – have not been implemented in full.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we wanted open source to be promoted as a basis for the encryption software so that we knew for sure what the software did. We wanted the Commission to help to distribute the open-source software so that we could be sure that no backdoors were being incorporated into the networks. The Commission is doing too little here. Incidentally, the Commission itself, to my disappointment, is not using open-source software either, and neither is Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as protecting confidential information in the Commission is concerned, which is something that we have of course also looked at, Mr Liikanen said that considerable changes had been made here. This is to be welcomed. When we took a look at this in the Commission last time, they were still using encryption faxes, with some of the ciphers being generated in Great Britain! It would be good, Commissioner, if the Commission could offer to convince a few Members of the old committee of its current security standards by inviting them to the Commission to see for themselves. I understand that you cannot reveal any details in a public debate, but it would be helpful to us to know what has actually happened in this respect in a little more detail.</p>

That is why many countries have wisely chosen to strengthen their intelligence services in the light of 11 September, and there is, of course, also cooperation between the individual nations’ intelligence services.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, however, obliged to say, ladies and gentlemen, that, as things are at the moment, this is a national concern, and the cooperation that takes place between the countries’ respective services is therefore an intergovernmental concern and not a matter for the Council. One might wish it otherwise, but that is how matters stand at the moment. I neither wish nor am able, therefore, to enter into a more detailed discussion of the individual requests in Parliament’s decision from last year.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the Belgian Presidency, I am obliged to bear in mind the fact that I am a representative of the Presidency of the Council, and I must focus my contribution and what I say upon those states of affairs that affect the Council or the EU institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is able, and would like, to help strengthen cooperation on the protection of our communications. That is what I concentrated on in my speech, in which I particularly emphasised encryption as a means of protecting communications.</p>
<p class="contents">I have naturally listened with great interest to the debate, just as I listened when, as a Member of this Parliament, I attended a hearing on Echelon, chaired by Mr Gerhard Schmid. At that time, I was a Member of the European Parliament. Now, I am a Member of, and spokesman for, the Council, and I am obliged to stick to what, for the time being, is the Council’s, and therefore my own, role. I appreciate that Parliament does not find the EU’s efforts in this field to be sufficient, and that is something of which I have taken note. It is something I naturally take on board, but I am not in a position in which I can tell my esteemed colleagues that, yes, we shall do this or that. I do not have a mandate for saying that, and that is something I think Mr Gerhard Schmid too knows even better than I do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Madam President I wish to reply to two comments, one by Mrs Flesch and one by Mr von Boetticher.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Flesch, I mentioned Echelon exactly as many times as it was mentioned in Parliament's resolution. It was mentioned only once in the resolution because the resolution concentrated specifically on the information network security measures.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the concrete measures, I have a bad habit of adhering to Parliament's time-limits and I used nine minutes fifty-seven seconds out of the allotted ten minutes. There are 70 measures. That means I would have 20 seconds for each. But as I have been asked, I will go through them all. I hope you will listen to what we have done.</p>
<p class="contents">On paragraph 27, the Commission's proposal for a cyber security task force will come in early December or in November, if we are lucky. This will create a network of experts in the field and also computer emergency response teams. This applies to both paragraphs 27 and 28.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 29 concerns research work on encryption technology. I have personally guaranteed that it will have higher priority in the IST programme under the Sixth Framework Programme. We have just given instructions to our committees. Open-source encryption software is a higher priority in FP6.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, on the promotion of open-source software, I personally organised an IDA – interchange of data between administrations – conference and Member States were invited to look at how open-source software can be used in public administrations. It was a great success.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one comment to make on open-source. Remember, if the source code is open for developers then it is also open for interceptors. So it does not solve all the problems, but I am very much in favour of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 31 concerns standardisation. You said that nothing has been done. You are wrong. I have tasked European standardisation organisations to work on this issue. Their working group on NIS was set up in June 2002. The aim is to determine the need for new security standards, to improve security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraphs 32 and 34 call for European institutions and the public administrations of the Member States systematically to encrypt e-mails. There are now a number of measures in the Commission's strategy which are based on preventing intrusion into the Commission's internal network, ensuring a good overall level of security. The sensitivity of the data called for special solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget in that area is still limited, only EUR 1 million. I hope the budgetary authority will be more helpful and increase the allocation.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 34 calls for particular attention to be paid to the position of the applicant countries. We have opened discussions with the specific aim of finding solutions for technology-neutral electronic signature. We have also initiated research programmes for the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraphs 36, 37 and 39 concern our internal decisions. As I said earlier, the Commission has conducted an internal audit to detect any flaws in the configuration of servers, primary domain controllers, personal computers and webservers. A new decision on the Commission's security provisions was taken in November 2001. Our security directorate has drafted a new information systems security programme.</p>
<p class="contents">A specific decision was recently taken on the external delegations, as a result of which we have modernised and extended the cypher system for secure data communications between headquarters and Commission delegations worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">In paragraph 40, you call on the Commission and Member States to invest in new technologies in the field of decryption and encryption techniques as part of the Sixth Framework Programme. That will be a major priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 42 calls on the Commission to put forward a proposal to establish a coordinated network of advisory centres. That is exactly what the cyber-security task force is proposing.</p>
<p class="contents">I am fully prepared to accept criticism, but if you say that nothing has happened, then I must be a very bad communicator. At any rate I will send Members of Parliament the information in writing.</p>
<p class="contents">We are working in an extremely difficult field. Mr Schmid, who was the rapporteur on this very complex subject, concentrated on general network and information security network issues, not just on Echelon. I have replied on those issues where you have given the Commission specific tasks. Many tasks have been assigned to Member States and, on those, Member States will reply directly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
