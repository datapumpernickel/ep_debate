<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Koukiadis (PSE)</span></span>  <span class="italic">, rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, I am particularly honoured to present the report on the first five years' implementation of the working time directive. Working times, like wages, have been one of the main subjects of employee claims throughout the history of industrial relations. These claims and success with them are down to the trade union movement, because the arrangements which it has brokered have restored workers' dignity, improved their standard of living, reduced risks to life and limb and, by deregulating working times, given them time for a political and social life.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that health and safety legislation forms the legal basis for the directive, we must not underestimate its other aspects. That is why the Member States must safeguard this <span class="italic">acquis </span>as the cornerstone of social cohesion. At the same time, it is also why I have the right to express my disappointment in a number of states for their unwillingness to transpose the directive into national law on time, despite their self-evident obligation to do so. I should also like to comment on the fact that the Member States have not provided detailed statements of national arrangements which allow the Commission to clearly assess if they are complying with the arrangements set out in the directive. For example, it is totally unclear if and to what extent it applies to all public-sector workers. Implementation so far has given rise to a series of disputes and/or straightforward infringements. One of these issues is the issue of doctors on duty, although this links up with the more general issue of equating readiness to work with working time and, in this sense, it also applies to other categories of workers. The ruling by the Court of Justice, whereby readiness to work requiring the worker to be present in the workplace and to have alert physical and mental faculties qualifies as regular paid working time, is in keeping with the traditional approach under labour legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue is the infringement of the right to leave where there is a limited contract of employment. Here too, the Court of Justice's ruling that the right to leave is a basic right to which even temporary employees on a limited contract of less than one year are entitled will help in the fight against infringements. A third point which deserves the Commission's attention is the woolly definition of maximum working time. It is strange there is still controversy over the exact meaning of a definition which has applied for decades.</p>
<p class="contents">The transposition of the directive in certain countries in the form of collective agreements is also a major issue. This is a matter of general interest. Without question this method, which promotes collective autonomy, must be encouraged. However, it must be used in a way which produces the same results as it would if the directive were transposed in a legislative act. This has not been the case in the past, either because sectoral collective agreements have been used, rather than a general cross-sector agreement covering all workers, or because there are no collective agreements which apply to all workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, again in connection with arrangements under traditional industrial relations, there is the problem of special arrangements for specific categories of particular types of workers such as women, mothers, persons with disabilities, children etc. Special care must be taken with arrangements for these categories of vulnerable workers and an initiative must be taken to improve them in the light of past experience so that they can be integrated into the European Union's policy of increasing the number of women in work and making it easier for persons with disabilities to access the job market.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to use the last part of my intervention to comment on what is to become of traditional arrangements following the emergence of new forms of work, where the principle of flexibility and traditional job security are being turned into employability. We need courageous innovations here if we are to guarantee the principle announced at Lisbon of combining flexibility with protection and this principle needs to be translated into industrial relations by taking specific measures to organise working times.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to replace traditional job security with employability, we need a new approach to working time arrangements because new problems are emerging, such as how to turn part-time employment into full-time employment, what to do about weekly rests and the ban on working on public holidays, how far to adjust working time arrangements where paid work is turned into self-employment, how to control the application of specific working time arrangements in the case of teleworking, what new balance must be struck between home life and work and, finally of course, how can we make time spent on lifelong learning count as working time.</p>
<p class="contents">In closing, I should like to add that the European trades unions rightly want to highlight all these issues relating to modern forms of work as immediate priorities in a widespread campaign which they are planning to start on 14 February to follow on from today's debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On his behalf and on my own, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur and say that I am pleased with the work he has done and with the positive attitude he has adopted towards the amendments which had been presented by Mr Pérez Álvarez.</p>
<p class="contents">Directive 93/104/EC is a continuation of Directive 89/391/EC, on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work, with the idea that the creation of the internal market must lead to an improvement in working and living conditions, by means of approximating legislations.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the Commission’s report is a general description of how the Member States have transposed and applied the aforementioned directive with results which clearly indicate that the method and result could be improved. It has been demonstrated that not only the temporary delay in compliance with the transposition period and, consequently, the non-application of the Directive within the time limit, but also that the exclusions and exceptions have been due to criteria which are not always clear. Therefore, transposition, by means of collective agreement, has not always been accompanied by the desired success for this instrument of social dialogue. The amendments presented by Mr Pérez Álvarez were aimed at highlighting and providing a remedy for these shortcomings and the amendments I am going to mention now have the same aim.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 1, because the confusion between the concepts of ‘exclusion’ and ‘exception’, which are always in the singular, must not become an opportunity to sidestep the mandatory nature of the directive. Amendment No 2, proposing an additional clarifier, which is not intended to replace, but to clarify and extend the content of the paragraph, also by means of concepts and definitions which guarantee the application of the Directive, faithful to the idea that things should be judged by what they are and not what they are called. We believe it is important to expressly highlight these two points for the sake of improving the living and working conditions of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this must done in accordance with Article 31 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, “Fair and just working conditions”. Firstly, that “Every worker has the right to working conditions which respect his or her health, safety and dignity”, and secondly, that “Every worker has the right to limitation of maximum working hours, to daily and weekly rest periods and to an annual period of paid leave”. Both aspects – health at work and working times – are clearly linked, and all of this is aimed at a more just society governed by the respect for the individual and collective rights of workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Koukiadis' report directly concerns only the first of what are now three directives on working time. He pinpoints variations in interpretation, types of derogation and manner of transposal as contributing to defects in its implementation. Such problems could be compounded by the fact that different rules apply to different sectors. For example, fish processors are covered by the first directive but those engaged in fishing as such by the second. It is difficult to predict the effects of this for two sectors that are so closely related to one another. Similarly, potential changes in the nature of aquaculture may mean that different rules are needed for the future from those that fit its character today. That is why we are asking the Commission to monitor these aspects of implementation in future reports. It may be that there are other sectors for which a similar approach would be helpful.</p>
<p class="contents">It is desirable that individual sectors are covered by rules that are genuinely appropriate to their own particular situations. However, many implementation problems might be avoided and quicker adaptation made to technological and other change if such rules could come out of agreements between the social partners. We point to the agreement between the European Community Shipowners' Association and the Federation of Transport Workers in the EU as an example of best practice in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with safety so much at stake, we hope that the rules will become accepted as setting minimum standards to improve upon, rather than maximum ones to adhere to simply because that is what the law demands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was indeed quite an urgent issue to be tackled, given the controversial discussions at the several sessions of the Court of Justice on this very matter. Before I speak on a number of matters to do with the working time directive, I must say that I am very pleased that a couple of Member States have already implemented a huge number of different legislative, administrative and collective agreements in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I also feel that the measures taken by the supranational decision-makers go in the right direction, since the Commission's new directives cover the areas excluded from the scope of the original directive. However, there is still a lot of work to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know – and the rapporteur did well to criticise it – that some Member States resort to the tactic of claiming that their existing legislation covers the provisions of the directive. I cannot understand, therefore, why they hesitate to implement a fairly flexible directive in the large amount of time available. I therefore agree with the report's encouragement of the Commission to investigate why the Member States refuse to comply with some of the directive's provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">We should insist as well on controls on the conditions of application of the directive to new working-time patterns, for example, precarious work, part-time work and fixed-time work. In addition to that I see a strong need to focus more intensively on the increasing number of homeworkers. The Commission itself has made strenuous efforts with regard to open and distance learning within the Leonardo da Vinci programme, for example. I feel obliged then to ask you: why do we not give stronger encouragement to the social partners to negotiate the relevant working-time issues?</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the report could have gone further into detail, as it unfortunately neglects so-called self-employed workers. I am convinced that the need to include this category within the directive is a matter we should all support and in doing so we should merely be adding further to a well-drafted report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This policy undermines workers' rights by applying flexible forms of work and working time arrangements and undermines full and stable employment by replacing it with part-time and temporary employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim, of course, is to increase the level of exploitation of the workforce and maximum the profits of big business. Which is why an attempt is being made to abolish the stable seven- or eight-hour working day and weekends off and why collective agreements are being ripped up and limited contracts are being extended. Workers must be on standby whenever and for however long their employers choose. In addition, making part-time employment the rule not only hits workers in their pay packets, it also makes it practically impossible for them to acquire pension rights. The result of the European Union's policy is an increase in under-employment which, in some countries, already stands at over 30%.</p>
<p class="contents">We support a different policy, a policy which extends workers' rights and fights against capitalist restructuring. We are fighting for the repeal of the legislative framework which imposes daily working time arrangements and flexible forms of employment. We support full and stable employment, eight hours a day, five days a week, more extensive social rights and pay rises commensurate with today's needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is expressed in the level of welfare experienced by them. Consequently, the protection of employee welfare in an economic climate which centres on productivity and efficiency deserves all our care and attention. Citizens’ welfare is therefore served by sound legislation on working hours and hours of rest.</p>
<p class="contents">As an extension of the rapporteur’s approach, I should like to draw your attention to Sunday’s being a collective day of rest. In my view, the rapporteur gives too little attention to the importance of this in his approach.</p>
<p class="contents">It is one of the tasks of the Member States, in line with customs and traditions in the Member State in question, to designate a day of rest. I am delighted to note that in 9 of the 15 Member States, Sunday has been officially designated a day of rest. These Member States have taken the order from Parliament in 1996 seriously and realise that a day of collective rest is of great importance to families, extended families and other social networks.</p>
<p class="contents">Research in the Netherlands has this week shown that consumers have little or no interest in shopping on a Sunday. It is therefore of major importance that allowance be made in social legislation for the fact that Sundays are to be maintained as days of rest within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">To Christians, Sunday has the specific significance of a day of rest designated by God, which goes back to the day of Christ’s resurrection. As such, this day of rest is deeply engrained in European culture. After all, there is more to life than production and consumption.</p>

It will bring a great deal of work in its train in the Member States. The rapporteur has taken a great deal of trouble about the analysis, and for that I am very grateful to him.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive strikes me, though, as something of a patchwork rug. There are too many loopholes with national regulations crocheted in elsewhere, making individual interpretations possible and the whole thing impenetrable. What is most fundamentally at issue is the protection of workers, a cause which we have taken up.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Commission and the Member States, therefore, have to be urged not merely to adopt the definition and interpretation of particular concepts, but to check precisely on potential deviations from specific legal provisions, in order not to cause any confusion which might, at the end of the day, result in the opposite of what was actually intended.</p>
<p class="contents">Most uncertainty in the Member States concerns the maximum permitted working time, although clear limitations are laid down in Article 6, Article 18, and in the final provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The possibility of also using collective contracts or agreements between the social partners to transpose the directive should be seen in a fundamentally positive light. All that is needed is for this to actually happen, and when it does, it must be completely in the spirit of the directive, without a back door or the possibility of evading its provisions at a halfway stage.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also urgently necessary to reach a clearer definition of the concept of ‘standby duties’, and, above all in view of the judgment of the European Court of Justice, to implement it completely along those lines. The judgment in Luxembourg clearly brought out this directive's weaknesses, and it is regrettable that the Commission has to lag behind on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">The Koukiadis report will be a great help in the work in hand. I hope we will actually find the points listed by Parliament still in the directive when the time comes to transpose it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Koukiadis on his excellent report on the implementation of the working time directive and agree with the last speaker, who pointed out that there are loopholes in the working time directive, although these are being closed as time goes by. I should like to remind the House that there have been significant developments over the last two years in connection with doctors' working times and in connection with working times in the fisheries industry, not to mention the recent directive on workers in haulage companies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission report on the implementation of the working time directive contains a general review of how the Member States implement the directive. The Commission is not obliged to publish this report but we felt, politically speaking, that it was conducive to greater transparency and openness. This means, as Mr Koukiadis rightly pointed out, that the transposition of the directive varies hugely from one Member State to another. Here too, we must to admit to the need to reconcile economies and societies with very different customs and practices, which is why the agreed framework is flexible and does not insist on uniform, inflexible solutions which it would be impossible to put into practice and which would make it hard to even agree on a framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States have been given considerable room for manoeuvre in transposing the directive. The directive allows a number of exceptions based on legislation or collective agreements, thereby giving the national authorities the flexibility I have already mentioned. The Commission is happy with this multi-faceted approach and has no ambitions to push for uniform solutions in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should like to comment on a number of specific recommendations made to the Commission. The report calls at various points for the Commission to monitor transposition and take the necessary steps if the directive is not transposed correctly. We are in agreement here and the proceedings available to us when Community directives are infringed have already been instituted or are due to be instituted in the cases referred to.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the definition of working time and the implications of the ruling by the Court of Justice in the Simap case, which found that the time spent on duty by medical staff in first aid teams counted as full working time, the Commission is examining the implications of this case and has already held a meeting between the national authorities and the Commission services and is planning to schedule a study of the legal situation and the implications of this ruling on health systems and other sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament report also calls on the Commission to clarify where exceptions are justified on the basis of industrial agreements. There is a clear reference to the specific term in Article 18(1) allowing the Member States to deviate from the upper limit of 48 hours, provided that the worker is happy to work the extra hours. Here too, I should point out that there are safety valves to avoid measures and implications which are unacceptable to the worker. The only country to have made use of this exception is the United Kingdom. The same directive stipulates that the Council must review this provision at the Commission's proposal, accompanied by an evaluation report. And I can assure you that the Commission will be submitting the evaluation report in question.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to stress that the national authorities in every Member State will be filing national reports in 2002, analysing the practical implementation of the directive in question. The Commission will use these national reports to draft a summary report on the implementation of the directive in the Member States, which will give us a clearer picture.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close with a few comments on new work models. Obviously it is hard to apply traditional working time to new forms of work and the debate on lifelong learning and time compression is a major issue. What I can say here is that social dialogue is already playing an important part and will play an even more important part in the future. The social partners and their discussions and agreements on the role of lifelong learning and the principles of teleworking and the agreements already reached in specific sectors demonstrate that, in the initial stages, individual agreements at European level can create the right conditions for moving forward, if necessary, to a legislative framework. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
