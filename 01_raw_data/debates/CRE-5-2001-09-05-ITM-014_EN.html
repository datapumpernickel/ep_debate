<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ries (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank all those Members who took part in the debates on my report in committee, and in particular the shadow rapporteurs of the various political groups, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, Mr Bowe, Mrs Schörling and Mr Sjöstedt. We have before us the proposal for a directive amending for the 24th time the 1976 dangerous substances directive, which proposes restrictions on the marketing and use of pentabromodiphenyl ether.</p>
<p class="contents">What exactly is at issue here? Pentabromodiphenyl ether is a flame retardant, 95% of which is used in the manufacture of flexible polyurethane foam for furniture and in particular upholstery. It is found, for example, in car head-rests and in the protective foam used for packing items of electrical and electronic equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">Starting with pentaBDE and its harmful effect on our environment and on our health, the picture is very clear indeed. A preliminary study carried out in 1998 by the Swedish authorities indicates a high concentration of this substance in breast milk. Two opinions of the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment<span class="bold"> </span>from February and June 2000 highlight the damage that could be caused by pentaBDE in relation to discharging this substance into the environment and its being a persistent and bioaccumulative substance. There is therefore a risk to the environment and to human health. There is a unanimity of opinions on this. It was therefore totally logical for the Commission to propose in January of this year a total ban on the marketing and use of pentaBDE. And I would say that it was also logical for our Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy to vote to confirm this ban.</p>
<p class="contents">A second substance, octabromodiphenyl ether, is also directly affected by the directive in view of the percentage of pentaBDE residues that it contains when it is sold. OctaBDE is used mainly here as a flame retardant in furniture made of plastic and in office equipment. In this case, the Commission preferred to accept the final conclusions of the risk assessment study still being carried out for this substance. It therefore restricted itself to limiting the percentage of pentaBDE residues authorised in octaBDE to 5%. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy does not share this view. In fact it seems to us to be totally contradictory to ban pentaBDE while permitting the presence of what we regard as significant quantities of pentaBDE in other chemical products, in other substances. Furthermore, I would say that the initial results of the current risk assessment, of which I am aware, are negative and tend to prove the harmful effect of this product not only on the environment but also on public health. These two areas have been assessed by British and French experts respectively, and I have consulted those experts in detail. In view of these different factors, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has tabled an amendment which would extend the marketing ban to octabromodiphenyl ether also, thus strictly applying the precautionary principle. I think I do not need to remind you that the precautionary principle does not mean waiting until there is absolute proof, which in this case would mean waiting for the final result of the risk assessment, when there is sufficiently serious and tangible evidence to demonstrate that a substance could have harmful effects on public health and on the environment. That is exactly the case with octaBDE.</p>
<p class="contents">Third and last, and things always seem to go in threes, there is decabromodiphenyl ether, another flame retardant in the same family, which in practice accounts for 80% of this family of brominated substances and has a great many applications, not just in electrical and electronic equipment but also and above all in insulating and building products and in textiles. DecaBDE is the only one of these three substances not to be mentioned at all in the Commission document. Yet I regard it as being difficult, nay, impossible, and I will come back to this point in a few moments, to exclude decaBDE, which is why in Amendment No 4 in my report I call for a method for the evaluation of risks by family of chemical products, and no longer on an individual substance by substance basis. In order to ensure coherence, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has extended the scope of this directive to cover all the polybromodiphenyl ethers. This is totally in line with this House’s recent vote on the electrical and electronic equipment directive. While waiting for precise information to emerge from the risk assessment in relation to decaBDE which is also currently in progress, Amendment No 16, which I have tabled in conjunction with the PPE Group and the Socialist Group, essentially proposes a ban on decaBDE with effect from 1 January 2006, unless the risk assessment in some way exonerates this substance and concludes that decaBDE does not pose any problems. So this is a sort of reversibility clause.</p>
<p class="contents">While I am on the subject of amendments, I would like to mention that I oppose Amendment No 9, which aims to change the title of the proposal so as to extend the immediate ban to the marketing of decaBDE. I do not really have any fundamental philosophical objection to Amendments Nos 12, 13 and 14, but I prefer the Commission’s original text. With regard to the other amendment tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I believe that my report already takes account of the criticisms contained in Amendment No 11 regarding the extremely cumbersome nature of the risk assessment and control procedures for existing substances. I mentioned that just now.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the Council Working Party on Dangerous Substances, which will be meeting in a week’s time, will determine the broad guidelines to be adopted by the Internal Market Council on 27 September. I hope that they will make it possible to narrow the gap between the positions of Parliament and the Commission. I also hope, indeed I think, that it will be quite possible at second reading to finalise the adoption of this proposal for a directive amending the dangerous substances directive for the 24th time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are talking today about the limitations of introducing on the market and using certain hazardous substances and preparations, especially flame retardant agents such as pentabromodiphenyl ether.</p>
<p class="contents">Risk assessments have shown, as Mrs Ries has just said, that the use of pentabromodiphenyl ether carries risks for the environment and public health, because this bromide-based, flame retardant agent is used in the production of furniture and upholstery. So for this reason, in the interests of public health and the environment, the marketing and use of pentaBDE and all articles containing pentaBDE must be prohibited.</p>
<p class="contents">As alternative flame retardants are available, fire and environmental risks will not increase as a result of this ban. Besides penta, two other bromide-based flame retardants are available on the market, namely decaBDE and octaBDE. Octa is mainly used in plastic office equipment and in components of household appliances. In dealing with the directive on the limitation of the use of certain hazardous substances in electric and electronic equipment, this House has already come out in favour of a gradual ban on all PDBEs in specific uses by January 2006. The possible risks of octa and decaBDE are being evaluated at present and the results of this study will be submitted to the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to decaBDE, on which there are as yet no negative conclusions, the ban must, in the view of the PPE-DE Group, be revocable, hence dependent on the results of the risk assessment which will be available before the end of the year. For octaBDE, however, I share the opinion of Mrs Ries that the use of this substance must be banned forthwith, even though the assessment of the risks is not yet concluded. The first known results of the risk assessments for octaBDE, which are at present being carried out in the United Kingdom as regards the impact of the environment and in France as regards the consequences for public health, show that with this substance there are clear risks for human health and the environment. The precautionary principle, therefore, prescribes that we do not wait to impose a ban on this substance until the final results of the investigation are known.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in the interests of health, the protection of European citizens, the protection of the environment and the maintenance of the internal market, on the basis of results so far known of the risk assessments of bromide-based flame retardants and on the basis of the principle of prevention, there should be a ban on penta- and octaBDE and also on decaBDE if the risk assessment expected before the end of the year shows that decaBDE gives cause for concern. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bowe (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for the report which has been a difficult one in terms of reaching a balance between the interests of what is clearly the very important – and very immediate – issue of fire safety and the more difficult, but more long-term problem of future harm to public health and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The substances which are the subject of this report have clear and demonstrated beneficial properties as flame retardants in materials and products such as foam-filled furniture. However, they also have important negative properties. They are toxic. They are bioaccumulative in animals and in the general environment and they have even been found, as has been said already, in human breast milk.</p>
<p class="contents">Action on these substances in the opinion of many Members of this Parliament has been long delayed due to the slow progress of the risk assessments undertaken under the existing substance regulations of 1993. The final results and publications of the risk assessments of certain of these substances are still awaited. I hope the Commission notes that.</p>
<p class="contents">The general conclusions are clear. These substances which have a potential for harm to the environment must be strictly controlled. One cannot ignore however their very real and positive benefits in terms of reducing substantially the annual human death toll due to accidental fires. Accordingly, I would welcome the report. I give my support to the amendments to that report which enable the continued use of the most stable isomer, that is decaBDE, until such time as this substance has a complete risk assessment and its real uses and risks are assessed and we have some conclusions on it. I commend the report to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are of course aware that pentaBDEs, octaBDEs and also decaBDEs are resistant, toxic and also bioaccumulative, since highly brominated flame retardants have been found high up in the food chain. It is within the field of Swedish environmental research that it has been established that decaBDEs too are bioaccumulative. The whole group must therefore be banned. The precautionary principle requires that we act <span class="italic">now</span> and not wait for the results of the current risk assessment, as proposed in the case of decaBDEs in Amendment 16, for decaBDEs account for 80 per cent of the use of brominated flame retardants. If we were to wait for a ban in 2006, this would mean tons of high-risk chemicals being released into the environment, something which would clearly contravene the precautionary principle. I therefore applaud the amendment by the Group of the Greens, designed to place an immediate ban on the entire group of brominated flame retardants right now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Everyone has already said that this is a very difficult matter since various interests backed by large lobbies are involved, but also fire safety and the long-term protection and future of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">It will probably be a very technical debate. Pentabromodiphenyl ether. What’s in a name? This concerns bromide-based flame retardants, but also a socially very relevant theme. The previous speakers have clearly shown the problems this creates for the environment and public health. OctaBDE and decaBDE are, as a result of a Regulation on risk analysis, which is now seven years old, the first to have been placed on the first list of priority substances for risk analysis. The evaluations have not yet been concluded. Since those substances are known to be dangerous for the environment, waiting for the conclusions of that slow risk analysis would unnecessarily delay better protection of human beings and the environment. Although I should have preferred to see an immediate ban on bromide-based flame retardants – as my fellow MEPs are aware – I completely support the compromise, since it is also acceptable. It provides for an immediate ban on penta- and octaBDE and the banning in 2006 of decaBDE, unless – and this is important – it is proved to be harmless.</p>
<p class="contents">It also immediately indicates that in this matter we are balanced between policy based on risk analysis and the new chemical policy that we are dealing with at present and that is designed to facilitate faster analyses, but also above all that responsibility for this no longer lies with the Commission and the Member States but with the manufacturers.</p>
<p class="contents">This matter shows yet again that the current chemical policy with a substance-by-substance analysis takes years and that as a result the authorities are in a very weak position for protecting human beings and the environment. Therefore, in the strongest possible terms, we are calling for an urgent revision of the policy, as we are at present doing with the White Paper on Chemical Policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">PentaBDE is a flame retardant used in the production of polyurethane foam for furniture and upholstery. It poses a risk to the environment, is bioaccumulating and has been found in human breast milk. In response to the findings of a risk assessment under the regulation on the evaluation and control of existing substances, the Commission proposed, in January of this year, a directive banning the marketing and use of pentaBDE.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposed directive covers all uses of pentaBDE, and articles containing pentaBDE. It is an application of the precautionary principle, given concern about the presence of pentaBDE in breast milk from unidentified sources.</p>
<p class="contents">The costs and benefits of the proposed ban have been carefully analysed. Suitable alternatives, both in technical and economic terms, are available. I would stress that the proposal will not result in greater risks from fires or greater risks to the environment. I believe it is a proportionate measure.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed directive provides not only for the protection of the environment, of consumers’ and workers’ health but would also preserve the Internal Market. It would introduce harmonised rules in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is unable to accept those amendments of the Parliament which would extend the scope of the proposed directive to include bans also on other substances i.e. octaBDE and decaBDE (Amendments No 1, second part of No 2, Nos 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15). These other substances could be the subject of a subsequent proposal of the Commission when risk assessments have been completed and the availability of safe substitutes analysed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also unable to accept the amendments that would introduce bans on octaBDE and decaBDE taking effect from 1 January 2006 if the risk assessments do not conclude that the substances cause no reasons for concern (Amendments Nos 8 and 16). Accordingly, these substances would be totally banned from 2006 if the assessments show concern or they would be left totally unregulated if the assessments show no concern.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission favours a more nuanced approach which would mean that measures could take effect much earlier than 2006. The completion of the risk assessments and analyses of availability of safe substitutes would allow the uses of concern to be identified and appropriate measures to be quickly taken. If necessary, the precautionary principle could be applied to ban such uses. As the assessments are expected to be completed in the autumn of 2001, the chosen measures could be effective well before 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor is the Commission able to accept the amendment on procedures for risk assessment under Regulation 793/93 (Amendment No 4). This amendment goes beyond the present proposal to restrict the marketing and use of pentaBDE.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept in principle to delete the derogation on pentaBDE in concentrations of less than 5% in technical grade octaBDE from the ban (first part of Amendment No 2 and Amendment No 5 of the Environment Committee) as new information from producers indicates that octaBDE can be produced without pentaBDE.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise our position, the Commission can accept Amendment No 5. The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1 to 4 and 6 to 16. However, the Commission can, in principle, support the first part of Amendment No 2.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to carry on the dialogue with Parliament and I am convinced we can reach a constructive solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
