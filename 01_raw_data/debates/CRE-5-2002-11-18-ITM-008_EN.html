Their quality is certainly not in keeping with the legal traditions of Europe and its Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The two reports focus in particular on the approximation of laws on the confiscation of crime-related proceeds, instrumentalities and property. They specifically concern the possibility of extensive powers of confiscation, in other words the confiscation not so much and not only of the proceeds of the crime itself but also of all the other property in the possession of a person sentenced to a very long prison sentence who cannot prove that the property is of lawful origin.</p>
<p class="contents">This part of the report, Commissioner Vitorino, was deleted by the committee, and what remains is therefore the possibility of confiscating crime-related proceeds. However, a framework decision is not necessary to achieve this result in the European Community, for the legislation of almost all the European countries provides for the compulsory confiscation of crime-related proceeds or, at least, makes this possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Precisely in order to overcome the committee’s difficulties in accepting the inversion of the onus of proof – Amendment No 11, amending Article 3(1) – I suggested, by means of an amendment which is very reminiscent of the Italian legislation on the subject, the possibility of confiscating additional property – the property subject precisely to extended powers of confiscation – only where the prosecution has proved that the property possessed is disproportionate to the activity pursued or, in any case, exceeds the person’s income as declared for tax purposes. The person convicted would then have the chance to prove the lawful origin of the property. The provisions were<span class="bold"> </span>therefore toned down but the onus of proof not actually inverted. The committee was disconcerted, surprised, confused by this, and therefore rejected my amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call upon the House to adopt this amendment, for this is the only way to include in the legislation extensive powers of confiscation, which is one of the goals of the proposal and, in my opinion, also a useful tool for combating organised crime. It is based on a dual principle. The prosecution has to prove that the person’s property is disproportionate: in other words, it has to prove that the value of the property exceeds the person’s real<span class="bold"> </span>activities and their income as declared for tax purposes, while the person convicted has the option to prove that this property is of lawful origin.</p>
<p class="contents">If, however, the report remains in the form adopted by the committee, it will be absolutely useless, for – I stress – the European countries already have similar legislation in place and do not need a European Parliament framework decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an appeal, a valuable reminder precisely for all the Member States, which are called to harmonise their legislation or, in any case, cooperate in the field of justice, in this very sensitive area – the confiscation of crime-related proceeds, instrumentalities and property – too.</p>
<p class="contents">It is without a doubt an important instrument because, as we know from daily experience, it is that instrument which will strike at the financial sources supporting organised crime, particularly crime organised on an international scale. At the centre of this fight is the fight against what is known as money laundering between the international organisations, which now know no bounds either in Europe or worldwide. I want to tell you something which the unforgettable Italian judge, Giovanni Falcone, said, which is relevant to this aspect of the matter. As you will remember, he was subsequently assassinated by the Mafia. At a hearing, ten years ago now, he said: the Mafia have not waited for the completion of the internal market to internationalise their activity. That is why it is important to provide an international response to this internationalisation of crime from those in charge of the legal systems in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be said that, in this, we have been preceded by both the United Nations and the Council of Europe, which have produced conventions which are a valuable point of reference for the subject we are debating too. It must also be said, however, that the proper legislative basis is the action plan endorsed by the Amsterdam European Council of June 1997 and drawn on by the Vienna European Council of December 1998. These action plans specify the procedures for implementing international confiscation measures, which are, clearly, intended to supplement the various national measures. The Council stresses the importance of each Member State– and I quote from the Council text – ‘having well-developed and wide ranging legislation in the field of confiscation of the proceeds from crime’ and of ‘introducing special procedures for tracing, seizure and confiscation of proceeds from crime’.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the debate on Mr Di Lello’s report in committee, we tabled a number of amendments which were all adopted by the committee. Our rapporteur is of the opinion that these amendments impair the original text but we, of course, feel that they enhance it. I will mention just one in particular – the amendment seeking to invert the onus of proof and transfer it from the defendant to the prosecution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The most effective and consistent method, in most of the matters that this involves, is the Community initiative, which we hope will be, following the work of the Convention, the prime working method, precisely because only the Commission is in a position to defend and promote the balance of values and principles that are not depleted by the construction of Europe’s security, which is drifting away from the Europeans’ deep-rooted component of rights and freedoms. The history of the construction of the area of freedom, security and justice is still made up much more of isolated initiatives by the Members States, which make specific contributions concerning security as they see fit, given the concerns of their citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, we are seeing the dissipation of Commission initiatives to approximate legislation, in which efforts to prosecute crime are tempered by the protection of individual values. This is not the Commission’s fault, but a result of differences between the various Member States. Furthermore, although there is no proof that the national area is the best suited to combating international organised crime, nor will it ever be proven that freedoms are best protected within the strict framework of national borders. Take for example the motives for requests for accession and the examples of Spain and Portugal, which quickly became part of the European framework, and consequently, stable and deep-seated democracies.</p>
<p class="contents">This initiative and this report by Mr Di Lello, which adopt similar mechanisms for the freezing of property and evidence that I myself covered in this Parliament and to which the Council has still not given its agreement, deserve a better fate than the one befalling my report.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, regardless of the method and some points of relative disagreement, we are voting in favour of this initiative and this report as a sign that Parliament is pursuing its efforts to support the Tampere Council and the Commission’s sensible and genuinely European interpretation of the promises made at the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Because, Madam President, the electors do not want crime to go unpunished, specifically international crime, for the sake of the judicial sovereignty of each Member State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The seizure or confiscation of the proceeds of crime is indeed, as has been pointed out by the rapporteur too, a genuinely effective tool for combating organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that the confiscation of goods is also a valuable way of building up compensation funds for the victims of organised crime, victims of heinous crimes which can be linked to terrorism, child abuse, the trafficking of human beings or the trafficking of arms or drugs, victims who – it is worth pointing out – are often victims twice over, firstly because, through no fault of their own, they are the victims of a crime, and secondly because they do not subsequently receive sufficient, timely compensation for the damages suffered. Approximation of the rules and procedures governing the matter is therefore urgent and essential, especially where cross-border criminal activities are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Kingdom of Denmark’s proposal, I agree with the rapporteur that its scope should be restricted to organised crime offences,<span class="bold"> </span>and I also support his proposal to place the onus to prove the unlawful origin of property upon the prosecution rather than the defendant.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, although I feel it is essential for it to be possible to confiscate crime-related proceeds, where these have been fictitiously transferred to the spouse or cohabitee or to another legal person, the prosecution must prove that the property of the spouse, cohabitee or other legal person does genuinely belong to the convicted person and that the other persons therefore only have fictitious title or access to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, I shall address the framework decision on the confiscation of crime-related proceeds, instrumentalities and property.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur said, it is essential that all Member States adopt rules providing for confiscation in general. The added value of this initiative, however, is that it addresses extended powers to confiscate the property of a person convicted of a serious crime, especially when the convicted person was involved in organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems that this initiative raises, as the rapporteur has said, are mainly concerned with the idea of extended powers of confiscation which consist essentially of extending confiscation measures to property which is not linked to the crime for which the person has been convicted, permitting confiscation of property belonging to a convicted person if the person cannot prove that he obtained the property through legitimate means, and permitting confiscation of property belonging to the spouse of the convicted person.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, it should be possible to break the link between the offence for which the person has been convicted and the property to be confiscated, especially if that property is itself of illegal origin. However, the scope of application should be limited to serious offences linked to organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it is not the relationship between the convicted person and the third party which is important, but the fact that illegally obtained property was transferred to a third person.</p>
<p class="contents">So, like the rapporteur, I agree with the general approach adopted by the Danish Presidency. I also support most of the amendments by the rapporteur, in particular the amendment which introduced the notion of proportionality, so that confiscation does not result in a loss of property disproportionate to the offence committed; and the amendment which limits the scope of application of extended powers of confiscation to organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">I have some doubts about the amendment the rapporteur has just mentioned, which demands that Member States avoid a reversal of the burden of proof in their legislation. I sincerely do not see the need to include such a provision in this specific instrument on confiscation as this could be interpreted as conflicting with the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danish initiative envisages a certain flexibility concerning the burden of proof. In this area, as Mr Di Lello Finuoli mentioned, we have to find the correct balance between combating organised crime on the one hand and on the other respecting the fundamental rights of the accused. It is not necessary, therefore, to reverse the burden of proof. However, we should consider the fact that the person convicted in connection with organised crime who cannot justify his lifestyle should face the prospect of confiscation of property unless this person demonstrates that he obtained the property by legitimate means.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the second Danish initiative for a framework decision on the execution in the European Union of confiscation orders, this second initiative deals, as Mr Marinho has just said, with the mutual recognition and execution of confiscation orders in the European Union. It is closely connected with the initiative that has been presented on the freezing and confiscation of property, for which Mr Marinho was the rapporteur, and the Commission intends to maintain the overall coherence between the two initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the issues raised by the second initiative are now under negotiation in the Council, with regard also to the framework decision concerning the mutual recognition of financial penalties. We are therefore pleased that the rapporteur shares the positive view of the Commission on this framework decision. Most of your amendments seek to ensure that decisions are recognised only when issued by judges. We agree that it is important to be clear about the status of the issuing authority. The initial text as you have mentioned confused judicial authorities, courts and judges. This needs to be ratified.</p>
<p class="contents">We support your view that it is not appropriate for orders issued by investigating magistrates and prosecutors to fall within the scope of these instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur also suggests that the issuing state should be prohibited from imposing a custodial sentence as an alternative to confiscation. Although we agree with the objective of this amendment, it seems to us that this issue might be better addressed in the first framework decision on the approximation of national rules on confiscation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would conclude by thanking the rapporteur and also the House for its patience during this late-night debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
