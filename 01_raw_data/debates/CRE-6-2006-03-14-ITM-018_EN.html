<p class="contents">While last week I was told that my question on the maintenance or modification of the decision to reduce the number of Spanish translators in the European Commission was going to be the third question to be replied to during this Question Time, last night I received a communication indicating that the President of Parliament had judged my question to be inadmissible.</p>
<p class="contents">I have received a letter today from Mr Harald Rømer, the Deputy Secretary-General, in which he explains to me that this decision has been made because an oral reply was given to a similar question from me in February.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rømer has surely only read the title of my question, which is the same, but has not read the text. The text of my question in February and that of my question this month are entirely different. Could anybody tell me, for example, when the Commission has said whether it is going to reduce the number of translators in the Spanish service to 67 by the end of the year or how it is going to sustain such a decision at the next European Union-Latin America Summit, which will take place in Vienna.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not accept the statement that my question is inadmissible. I believe that it infringes my rights as a Member of Parliament, and I demand that my question receive a reply, if not during this sitting, then next month. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall pass that on to Mr Rømer at the Secretariat, where the decision was taken. At the same time, however, I should like to draw your attention once more to our Rules of Procedure, namely to Annex II(3), concerning the conduct of Question Time under Rule 109. This states that a question shall be inadmissible if an identical or similar question has been put down and answered during the preceding three months. This is evidently the basis for decision; that much I can tell you now, but I shall in any case pass on your comments.</p>

<p class="contents">In addition, there is another different programme, again financed by the Commission, which specifically applies to all the Member States, including, therefore, the new Member States, and covers precisely the collection of statistical data and information on five types of serious offence: corruption, fraud, illegal trafficking in cultural assets, counterfeiting, piracy and the sexual exploitation of children and pornography.

<p class="contents">On behalf of the Commission, I must say that monetary policy – and therefore decisions on interest rate changes – is the sole responsibility of the European Central Bank. Its independence is enshrined in the Treaty. It is the European Central Bank’s primary objective to maintain price stability in the euro area by ensuring that medium- to long-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. The European Central Bank supports economic growth and job creation in the euro area. The current level of interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum remains low by historical standards, both in nominal and real terms.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the last part of the question on the economic outlook, in its last interim forecast the Commission expected economic growth in 2006 to accelerate to between 1.9% and 2% in the euro area, which is close to estimates of the area’s potential growth rate. However, the Commission is cautious about commenting on the policies of the European Central Bank, as that is the Bank’s sole responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As you know, the proposal on education and the new generation of programmes in the field of lifelong learning, youth and culture were adopted in 2004 for the period 2007-2013. We are preparing for this, the programmes are still not fully adopted, but they will replace existing programmes and will also contribute to clearer and simpler conditions for users. The new programmes, once fully established, will enable individuals to benefit more from a true common European area of mobility. Hopefully, appropriate funding will be available. These programmes will allow institutions in the fields of education, training and culture to improve the way they operate together. In this context, the simplification of administrative and financial procedures is a key issue. Successive evaluations and large-scale public consultation exercises have demonstrated that the current programmes would indeed benefit from simplification. That, however, requires efforts at different stages, at the level of the administrative arrangements for the programmes themselves and at the level of the Financial Regulation and its implementing rules.</p>
<p class="contents">At programme level, it is proposed to reduce the number of programmes in the area of education and training by putting Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci, Comenius and Grundtvig under the same umbrella: an integrated lifelong learning programme. The design of the new programmes – especially in the youth, culture and citizenship area – is intended to simplify access for the potential beneficiaries. For example, in the new Culture 2007 programme we have created a more open and accessible programme in terms of its very structure, with three main objectives compared to the former eight. It is thus easier to grasp its essence, specifically because it takes a non-sectoral approach, where any player can feel welcome, and is explicitly aimed at the diversity of beneficiaries.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission aims to simplify the application and the reporting systems involved and, of course, to accelerate the selection procedure. We have included provisions to that effect in the draft decision. During the ongoing codecision procedure for adoption of the programme decisions, both Parliament and the Council have supported the Commission’s aim to achieve maximum simplification, not only in the form of the programme actions but also in their administrative and financial requirements, and to find the right balance between flexibility and ease of use on the one hand and clarity of purpose and appropriate financial and procedural safeguards on the other hand.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Financial Regulation, the Commission has proposed a series of amendments which are currently under examination by Parliament. These amendments will, inter alia, introduce the principle of proportionality, which means that the administrative and accounting requirements should be proportional to the size of the grant. As to the implementing rules, progress has already been made because in July 2005 the Commission amended the detailed rules for the implementation of Financial Regulation No 1, which led, among others, to the following improvements in terms of simplified procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the requirement for external audit in support of payments is now obligatory only for intermediate payments or payments for the balance where the grant exceeds EUR 750 000 for actions and EUR 100 000 for operating grants. The second amendment is that the limit on flat-rate amounts has been increased from EUR 5000 to EUR 10 000. In addition, several flat-rate amounts are now possible in one grant and the Commission can authorise the use of flat-rate amounts even if they are not specified in the basic act. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think this is the proper attitude for a Head of State and European citizen who believes that through education and mobility we can achieve much more in the economic, social, cultural and political fields. I therefore strongly believe that the new programmes for voluntary groups and young people in the field of education, as well as culture, should be enhanced in quantitative and qualitative terms, as they are of such importance both to individuals and to the Community as a whole. The situation is now chiefly in the hands of the partners discussing the financial perspective, but I believe that we are passing a very timely message to the country holding the presidency, to Parliament, to the Commission and to the entire enlarged European Union.

An integrated, free, democratic Europe can be based only on integrated, free, democratic societies. Member States, their governments, public authorities in the broader sense and European institutions are thus invited to support such tools.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the programmes are already being used to that end. The European Youth Pact, adopted last year, is one of the special tools for integration and provides some answers for the youth of Europe, young people who have many difficulties or are in vulnerable situations in individual countries. Social inclusion is one of the most important parts of social policy. I do not want to speak on behalf of my colleagues, but these issues are taken into account and promoted via different programmes which we have in our remit.</p>
<p class="contents">More can be done on the basis of coherent policies at European and national levels. This is an ongoing issue, to be dealt with not only via education but also via sport, culture and intercultural dialogue. These are very useful and efficient tools for promoting social inclusion and integration and for combating problems such as violence, hooliganism, racism and xenophobia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe he was right to mention it because it is probably the most famous and popular programme. There have been 1.4 million Erasmus alumni since 1987. They are very influential programmes for individuals and societies. People get a lot from those programmes. They are asked for more and more. I have expressed gratitude for the support in Parliament for these programmes because they have impact. The future of Europe without those programmes would be more in question.</p>
<p class="contents">The programmes have an impact on other areas: Erasmus was the driving force for the Bologna Process, which is very influential for any student, any professor and any university in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I mentioned some of the proposals that are already in the implementation rules adopted by the Commission. The Commission has proposed more than 100 amendments to the Financial Regulation. It is now your turn to decide, and to improve it. As of January 2006, we have established a new executive agency that deals with all individual cases and individual projects and works closely with national agencies. This centralised system for the operation of our programmes is a reasonable tool. National agencies operate in Member States in concrete national languages. They are much closer to citizens, which helps to provide the best service for the users of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps we can go into more detail in future, when we discuss the Financial Regulation itself. There are some concrete measures and proposals on how to simplify life for the user of small grants, in contrast to the millions used for infrastructure or research projects.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want to put more money, for example, into Erasmus or lifelong learning programmes because we believe the EUR 125 per head, per month, is not very substantial European support when we look into the real costs of daily life in our countries. So ‘more’ also means more in the social dimension. This money is often decisive for those who need European grants to study abroad. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Plan for fostering entrepreneurship via education</span></p>
<p class="contents">I should like to refer to the Commission’s plan to foster entrepreneurship via education, from primary school to university. In its plan, the Commission refers to the need for increased economic growth and more entrepreneurship in order to keep the European social model going at a satisfactory level. I fully agree that these are needed. I am concerned, however, about the risk of education playing second fiddle to the logic of competition and the market. I believe it is vital for the European social model and for individual advancement that education should aim to ensure that citizens are free, independent and discerning.</p>
<p class="contents">There are several examples of good practice from which we can no doubt learn a lot – such as increasing the amount of work experience schemes – and I do not wish to detract from business-related studies, but a North-American-style education with too much focus on business cannot be our reference model.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission not think that, in the interests of the future of education as a pillar of citizenship, we should be focusing our efforts on revising educational curricula in the Member States in order to improve education in all areas, including culture and the humanities? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Under the Action Plan five strategic policy areas were established for the European Agenda for Entrepreneurship during the current years. The first of these areas deals with stimulating entrepreneurial thinking among young people. Recently, on 13 February, the European Commission adopted, as part of the Action Plan, a communication called Fostering Entrepreneurial Mindsets through Education and Learning. In the communication, the Commission outlined a set of recommendations for the Member States, since the European Union does not have any formal power or competence in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea is to strengthen the role of education in shaping an enhanced entrepreneurial culture in Europe and European companies. Education should stimulate the entrepreneurial spirit in young people and open up new possibilities for their future, along with the means for developing basic entrepreneurial skills. One of the objectives of the communication is to improve the way that young people are being prepared for their future lives, future occupations and jobs. The Commission believes that the benefits of entrepreneurship and education in the field of entrepreneurship should not be measured merely by the number of new companies or innovative enterprises and new jobs. Entrepreneurship is first and foremost a key competence for all, as it helps young people to be more creative and enterprising, to have more self-confidence, and to work and take decisions in a more socially-responsible manner regardless of the activity in which they may be engaged.</p>
<p class="contents">Viewed in this light and against the broader scope of competences being advanced under the 2010 Education and Professional Training Programme, entrepreneurship is one of the elements in the reference framework of eight key and basic competences for lifelong education. We consider these key competences to be crucial for self-fulfilment, social inclusion, active citizenship and employability. They also include a civic, cultural and educational dimension. According to the communication, the Commission considers the fostering of entrepreneurial mindsets through education and professional training to be fully consistent and compatible with the aims we have set ourselves and with those formulated by MEPs, including even the author of this question, Mrs Maria Badia i Cutchet, within the context of improving general education in all areas and ensuring that in the future European citizens shall remain free and independent, with better conditions for development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Turkish lira coin</span></p>
<p class="contents">For one year, Turkey has issued a one-lira coin (worth EUR 0.60) that bears an incredible similarity to the two-euro coin. For example, the portrait of Kemal Atatürk displayed on the one-lira coin can easily by mistaken for King Albert II. Owners of vending machines in the EU have suffered considerable losses on account of the technical similarities between the coins in terms of weight and thickness. There are also problems concerning sorting machines in banks, not to mention ordinary citizens, who may not even be aware of the risk of confusion.</p>

Of course the Commission shares the concern of the honourable Member of Parliament about this issue. That sort of thing should not happen. The right to issue coins is one of the most fundamental sovereign rights of a country. However, informal consultations are recommended. There is a network called the Coin Registration Office, established by the International Mint Directors Conference. Member mints are assumed to have consulted the Coin Registration Office when preparing a new coin, so that similarities can be avoided. Obviously that was not done properly in this case, so coins have appeared which are similar to euro coins.</p>
<p class="contents">That was not the first time such a thing has occurred. In 2000, in some countries, some coins were very similar to euro coins. Even in my own country, when I was in charge of that area, we issued coins which were similar to Deutschmarks and we therefore had to change our production.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is working with the Turkish authorities and they have promised to modify their coins slightly. The production of coins is very expensive and a large exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is no panic and the risks are very limited. The vending machines – which are the main issue – can be adjusted. Our estimation is that there are some old models of vending machines that are more difficult to adjust, but the majority of new ones can be properly adjusted so that they can take the correct coins. Visibly they are quite different. If these coins are handled in the retail trade, they can easily be distinguished. So the risks are limited.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also worked with manufacturers of the coin mechanisms to keep them informed that mechanisms must be adjusted to this problem. We are working with the Turkish authorities to ensure that the new production of coins will be slightly modified so that they will not be so similar to euro coins. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the options submitted to the Board of Governors is to transfer the Woluwé Italian- and Dutch-language sections and the Ixelles German-language section to Laeken.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission realise that children from the Woluwé and Ixelles catchment areas will be sitting in school buses for a total of between three and four hours a day if they are transferred to Laeken?</p>
<p class="contents">What alternatives has the Commission considered to the enforced transfer of sections, and how would they be put into practice, or is it relying on the experience the Secretary-General and Board of Governors have had with such removals, which, because of the way in which they were carried out when the Ixelles school was opened, brought about an intolerable state of affairs?</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission prepared to disclose, and explain, the voting instructions given to its representative on the Board of Governors? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I must begin by saying that the European Schools constitute one of the most complicated issues in my area of responsibility, and there are a lot of problems. The system is very independent and complicated. Governance of the system does not fall to the Commission, and in fact the Commission is just one member of the Board of Governors, which consists of 29 members.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapid enlargement of the European Union has brought a lot of people to our locations – not only to Brussels – and we have a lot of problems regarding the lack of places needed for children in schools and other facilities. One solution, which is extremely necessary, would be to open a fourth Brussels school in Laeken in 2009. Why Laeken? That decision was taken by the Belgian Government. Belgium is the host country and makes quite a significant contribution to the school infrastructure. All the infrastructure is provided by the host country. I have been in touch with the Belgian Government and ministers. President Barroso has taken this issue up with the Belgian Government to speed up this process, and 2009 is earlier than originally envisaged.</p>
<p class="contents">Now it is a matter of deciding the school’s internal arrangements for the language sections: which language sections will be opened and which will be transferred. First, it is too early to say that anything has been decided. It is still under discussion and the Commission is only one part, and definitely not the dominant part, of these discussions. The Board of Governors will take the decisions. Of course, the Commission tries to provide input based on its experience and knowledge, and to participate in this process and secure the interests of parents of the European institutions as well as to ensure transparency and fair process.</p>
<p class="contents">At its meeting on 25 and 26 October, the Board of Governors adopted a list of criteria on how to deal with the language sections. A working group, the <span class="italic">‘Groupe de suivi Bruxelles IV’</span>, was established and the Secretary-General of the European School presented a preliminary document to this group. Again, the Commission is actively participating in this group, but we are only one partner. Finally, that <span class="italic">‘Groupe de suivi Bruxelles IV’ </span>must take all considerations into account and come up with a proper solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Some preliminary solutions – options A and B – were discussed, but it is really too early to say that one solution is preferable to the other. That group is now discussing intermediate options which adopt the best parts of both solutions, which include one principle – supported by the Commission – that the children currently enrolled in one of the existing schools in any section should not be obliged to move to Laeken. That is probably a good idea for parents whose children already go to those schools. It is very difficult to imagine that the definitive solution will satisfy everybody, but we must find a solution which ensures that the pupils will get the best education.</p>
<p class="contents">We are working with the Board of Governors and with the Dutch Government, which is presiding over the Board, about the reform of the European schools, because there are a lot of problems, including structural problems, and, obviously, this system must be modified.</p>
<p class="contents">This is my conceptual answer and I cannot say today that we have prepared any hidden agendas or solution. We work with the <span class="italic">‘Groupe de suivi Bruxelles IV’</span> very seriously and I can assure you that we take these issues very seriously, but it is a very difficult area and a lot of problems have accumulated, and now we have to find final, long-term solutions. We will work hard with the Belgian Government and the Brussels authorities to find some transitional solutions to solve short-term problems and shortages in all our facilities.</p>

In that regard, option B is not the best one.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to option B, which foresees having almost every section everywhere, there will be much fragmentation, with small groups and small classes, in which case we will be faced with the problem of ensuring good quality teaching and good quality education. Therefore, option B is not the best one. Yes, it is also much more expensive, but we in the Commission do not regard the cost issue as the first and most important issue. The most important issue involves securing the efficient functioning of the system of European Schools, and there are also many problems concerning the future quality of education. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The whole process has been transparent for all parties and those options have been there. If you like, the Commission will be taking the greater initiative in preparing those options. Logically, however, a final consensus must be reached that involves the parents’ organisations, the schools themselves and the teaching staff. The Commission is providing its input and is most definitely considering all possible options put forward by other parties. We are trying to play a part in finding a final solution that is more or less acceptable to everybody.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been transparent throughout this process and we are now thinking about some kind of compromise solution, an intermediate option between options A and B.

As part of the legislative reforms in preparation for acceding to the Union, and with the support of the European Parliament over the years, Romania recently adopted new legislation on child protection.</p>
<p class="contents">According to this legislation, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, international adoption is a last resort, if a suitable in-country solution, ranging from smaller homes to foster care, cannot be found. Through this law, Romania has aligned itself with the legal provisions of the European Union in this area, as also embodied in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The application of these provisions must be seen within the context of former abusive practices relating to international adoptions in Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the more precise legal aspects, it should furthermore be noted that there is currently no Community legislation in the field of international adoption. In fact, Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003, which provides for mutual recognition of judgments on parental responsibility, explicitly excludes adoption from its scope.</p>
<p class="contents">This means basically that the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> in the area of child protection has been implemented in Romania and Bulgaria. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is taken as a foundation in both Romania and Bulgaria. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child does not distinguish between the internal and external borders of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, in addition to a general evaluation of child protection and the situation of the disabled and mental healthcare system in Romania, we have organised a peer review on mental health in order to assess the situation on the ground. The expert report resulting from this peer review is awaited. We are conducting a total of 15 expert reviews, or peer reviews, both in Bulgaria and Romania, on a number of critical issues, and this is one of the essential areas in which we are conducting this peer review, which is done by both Commission officials and the best Member State experts in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning care for disabled people, the main focus is now on developing an inclusive strategy that aims at closing and restructuring large residential institutions by developing alternative community-based services, support for families and smaller residential units. We provide, for instance, up to EUR 15 million. Moreover, a public awareness campaign is ongoing in Romania in order to raise awareness on rights of people with disabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Although reform in this sector is still very much in its early stage, from the point of view of the Commission we estimate that the country is now on the right track in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the persistent problem of ill treatment in psychiatric hospitals in Romania needs to be addressed immediately. This was stressed in our comprehensive monitoring report of October, and the significant deficits in living and care conditions in some establishments need to be tackled.</p>
<p class="contents">We have strongly advised the Romanian authorities to make mental health a priority area and devote sufficient resources for this purpose. The Romanian authorities are strongly encouraged to take advantage of the current PHARE assistance and draft a strategy and action plan for the mental health reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the key is implementation. The feasibility of the practical arrangements made should be demonstrated, for instance through allocating sufficient financial resources. This is what the peer review will look at and this will be part of the progress report in May 2006. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
