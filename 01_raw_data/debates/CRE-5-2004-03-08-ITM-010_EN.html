<p class="contents">The Commission proposal for a framework decision forms part of an overall strategy to fight drugs, based on a balanced approach between measures for reducing supply and demand and action against trafficking. The conclusions of the Tampere European Council indicated the need for supplementary legislation against drugs trafficking to be adopted at European level. In the action plan for combating drugs in the European Union 2000-2004, the Commission was expressly asked to propose measures laying down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of drug trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">Adopting this Council proposal for a framework decision, would clearly demonstrate the European Union’s will to combat drug trafficking and this is important. Drug trafficking is a threat to our citizens’ health, security and quality of life. I hope that the Irish Presidency is able to adopt this text that we are discussing here today, so that before the end of this parliamentary term, we can conclude the legislative process linked to this framework decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is good that we have it, however: we both agree on that. We are all familiar with the history of the issue: it is now the third time that we have discussed it. The first time, things went rather wrong as a result of a few flaws in the recitals, which we then remedied. The second time, this assembly agreed on the text, and now it is back from the Council. The Council has tinkered with it an enormous amount, after the work we did on it, and it shows. We could be very unhappy about this, but I think that the Commissioner’s reasoning shows that he, like us, has a fairly pragmatic attitude towards this subject. The important thing is that, whatever happens, we now have a Framework Decision. I think that we, as Parliament, should support this pragmatic approach. Besides, the debates in this House have very often concentrated on issues other than the key issue of the report. The key issue was a very slight harmonisation of penalties, which I, being more of a mathematical bent, had originally thought insignificant, but legally it is of quite some significance. This Parliament has preferred to discuss the legalisation of soft drugs, and the Council and Coreper, too, have been very actively engaged in this. The Netherlands, in particular, has obviously obstructed this Framework Decision a great deal, because it considers protection of its coffee shops a jewel in the crown of national sovereignty. That is a significant Dutch conception whose importance – positive importance, in particular – is overestimated by some. However, the policy of the Dutch Government is now geared towards reducing this phenomenon somewhat, and, in particular, combating the local authorities that open coffee shops on the border, where customs houses now stand empty, so that Germans, Belgians and French from outside the municipality can avail themselves of this facility. Fortunately, this practice is falling into disuse, and, in fact, I think it absolutely disgraceful in principle that something like that happened in the first place and that a number of local authorities planned it. It is a good thing, therefore, that something of what Parliament had said about the scope and the sanctions remains, because the discussions in the Council have clearly revealed the same thing we had already found here: that we must concern ourselves with large-scale international trafficking; and this can now clearly be seen in the Framework Decision. Regarding penalties, too, something of the sliding scale from soft to hard drugs remains, because it is related to the severity of punishments.</p>
<p class="contents">I had actually hoped that there would not be any amendments, but there was a single one tabled by Mrs Buitenweg. I should like to say to her that what she is aiming at in her amendment in connection with the scope – large-scale international drug trafficking on the one hand and personal consumption on the other – is already implicit in the text.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 2(2) concerns the definition of ‘criminal act’. Our thoughts on the matter are very clear, and so are those of the Council. Article 2 concerns attempts to offer drugs to others: this includes coffee shop policy, in particular; and Article 4(2) concerns sanctions: there, too, it is very clear that large-scale international trafficking is involved. I would actually like to advise Mrs Buitenweg to withdraw her amendment, therefore, as it is much more important to be able to say, even during this plenary sitting, that everything is actually stated in there explicitly already. I think that it is a good thing, therefore, that we are now continuing work on the matter. There are a number of things missing, of course, for example a mention of aggravating circumstances, which we had included previously. Although something about this is included in the Framework Decision, it has merely legal significance and not the moral significance that we had wanted to lend it, particularly with regard to penalising the enticing of young people into using these repugnant substances. Anyway, I join the Commissioner in saying that this Framework Decision must now be adopted as a small but clear step, and it is clear that Europe is willing to deal with this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very important. Everyone recognises the significance of the EU Member States working together to combat the trade in drugs and to counter the damage done to lives, people and whole communities by the work and the trade of the traffickers.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is a very complex area. It is very important that we recognise regional differences. What works in one country in the EU may not work in another. What is appropriate in one European city may be totally inappropriate for another city in another country, because there are so many different attitudes, reactions and ways of life. As the rapporteur said, the Member States will not be obliged to change their internal laws. We are looking at the harmonisation of criminal provisions. The definitions of what amounts are involved and how serious these issues are will be very difficult and will doubtless be debated in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">However, tonight we should recognise that this report – however difficult it has been – is just one piece in a very complex jigsaw in terms of countering drug trafficking and how we deal with those responsible in the future. I welcome this report and hope that it is used to move forward. However flawed it may be, we should welcome the progress we are making and continue the work in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many politicians appear to have given up on the so-called soft drugs. I wonder what Mr Evans really meant. Many of our fellow MEPs in this House peddle a treacherous policy which, in my opinion, will only lead to more drug misusers, increased crime and greater scope for the huge drugs syndicates. A clear and consistent policy is the only thing that will help. Misusers must be given treatment, but use must be punished. It is a chimera to believe that a bit of liberalism on drugs will keep young people away from harder drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, this directive may be said to be a step in the right direction but, at the same time, we must bear in mind that the Fourteen have arranged for significant concessions to be made to the Netherlands where, as Mr Oostlander says, coffee shops can continue to proliferate. Drug tourism to Amsterdam is allowed to continue, and the Netherlands can go on exporting drug misuse to other countries. That is unacceptable. Of course we must have freedom of movement, but it must not be used for drugs and crime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The framework decision has been negotiated over a long period, and it is welcome and important. It has also made clear the political, cultural and legal differences that characterise the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt a need sometimes to be satisfied with less extensive measures, but I share Mr Schmidt’s perspective on this issue. The view in certain countries when it comes to personal drug use is rather difficult for us to understand. The scope of the compromise is such as not to include personal consumption. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the Member States are, thank goodness, still able to penalise such use. There is no requirement to do so, but it is acceptable, and that is how it should be. There is thus no threat to any national legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Swedish legislation prohibits drug use. That is good, and that is how it should remain. No proposals from the Greens or others must come along and regulate Swedish drugs policy. That is how the overwhelming majority of Swedes view the Green idea of permitting drugs in certain quantities. That would quite simply be the wrong route to go down. It would amount to giving up.

Mr Oostlander's report is part of this approach at EU level and is to be welcomed. Mr Oostlander has been one of the great contributors to this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Drugs are a commodity and are being traded on the open market in our towns and cities. The facts are inescapable. Since the fall of the Taliban, drug production has increased tenfold, bringing misery and addiction to many and huge profits for the pushers. The Taliban and al-Qa'ida have turned to drug revenues to pay for their insurgency and terror. Drugs are the hard currency for weapons and are funding terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">On a recent visit to Iran I learnt that almost 5 000 Iranian soldiers have been killed by Afghan drug smugglers. It is a great credit to these soldiers and to the Iranian Government that they have tried to stem the flow of heroin destined for the streets of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Each year, more people die as a result of heroin addiction in Ireland than die in car accidents. Afghanistan's vast opium fields are feeding a multi-million dollar drugs business. Three quarters of the world's opium was produced in Afghanistan last year. The opium trade is now said to provide work for 7% of the Afghan population. The UN believes that last year USD 2.3 billion were generated by the drug trade in the major opium-growing areas in Afghanistan. Opium farmers are earning ten times as much as the policemen or soldiers whose task it is to enforce the law against growing opium.</p>
<p class="contents">UN drugs officials in Afghanistan are calling for balanced measures that encourage farmers to find alternative income and increase the legal risk to anyone involved in the trade. Drug cartels in Colombia and Afghanistan are in contact. This new development must be stopped and the proceeds of their crimes tracked down and confiscated.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome Mr Oostlander's report and hope that this House will take seriously the need to be ruthless in tracking down the members of these drug cartels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Netherlands has proved uncooperative not only in Parliament, but also within the Council. The Netherlands blocked the decision for two years, fearing that its system of tolerance would be at issue. As far as I am concerned, it would actually be a good thing if Dutch policy, an international anomaly, came under pressure from European countries to make a U-turn.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have a compromise text before us that has unfortunately diluted the original Commission text. For example, legal cooperation and extradition to other Member States will not be obligatory, and the text is worded such that the subsidiarity principle applies to Dutch policy. Although the minimum penalty is being increased considerably, from one month to one year, the Netherlands is not obliged to impose this penalty. Despite these marginal notes, I am pleased that there is now a common framework for combating drugs trafficking, which destroys so many lives. I hope that the Member States, the Netherlands included, will take some serious action in this regard. Their citizens deserve it.</p>

We are unhappy about an issue of method, because the European Parliament’s key requests were not taken into consideration, and we are unhappy due to an issue of substance because this decision contains no guarantee that the application will be limited to international trafficking. It talks about production and it talks about sales. There is no problem if it refers to international trafficking because this is banned in all countries of the European Union. The Commission’s demand to apply judicial cooperation instruments is a demand that introduces virtual harmonisation, not just as regards trafficking, but also as regards, for example, the definition of categories of banned drugs, which therefore prevents the possibility of national reforms on drugs within national legislation. What, for example, is self-cultivation, that is to say, the cultivation of plants? It is production and can thus fall under this decision, since there is no type of guarantee that the aim is to combat trafficking, which is already amply punished in all of our laws. Another issue is that this has disastrous and catastrophic consequences in Afghanistan and elsewhere, such as the financing of terrorism that these laws allow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Parliament is being consulted a second time, now that the Council has finally reached agreement, following two years of negotiations. The rapporteur, Mr Oostlander, proposes that no amendments should be tabled because, since it has taken the Council such a long time to reach agreement, it would be preferable if we adopted the text as proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with this opinion; the fact that an agreement has been concluded on this matter is useful in itself. At least we have taken one step forwards, albeit a small one – a step that is crucial because it could provide an incentive for the European Union to achieve judicial cooperation in criminal matters. I know that my own country, Portugal, welcomes this draft framework decision, which does not raise specific difficulties as regards our own legal system. The definitions used in the framework decision are based on already-existing UN Conventions on the fight against drug trafficking, and cannot be described as particularly tough; they constitute the lowest achievable common denominator. All types of trafficking, production and sale will now be punished. Furthermore, the sanctions envisaged by the Member States must be effective, proportionate and act as a deterrent, and should include custodial sentences. To conclude, the level of sanctions will increase in line with the quantity and nature of the drugs that are trafficked, and according to whether the offences are committed by a criminal organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we must attempt to dissuade the phenomenon of drug tourism, and we can only welcome the news given by the Dutch Justice Minister that his government is seeking to do just this, by tightening up legislation to restrict sales in ‘coffee shops’ to residents. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
