<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Halonen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council. – (FI)</span> Madam President, Members of the European Parliament, the last month of the Finnish presidential term began today. During the past five months I have addressed Parliament on several occasions and have been able to meet you in various contexts. For me, the debates have been a rewarding and thought-provoking experience.</p>
<p class="contents">In just over a week’s time the heads of our governments and states will be arriving in Helsinki for the last European Council of this millennium. For my own part, and on behalf of my government, I would like to bid you welcome, Madam President, as representative of the European Parliament, to my home city in December. I look forward to your address and the ensuing debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The main topic of the forthcoming European Council will be enlargement. In Helsinki, the Union will embark in earnest on preparations for the time when it will truly live up to its name: a pan-European, stable, effective and transparent Union. The talks we have had on enlargement thus far during our presidential term have progressed according to plan. In the negotiations with the leading applicant countries, the Union has opened seven new negotiation chapters, and we hope to be able to open talks also in respect of the eighth chapter, which deals with the environment and has proved to be particularly difficult. So far the outcome is in line with our set objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the future is concerned, the Member States all agree that at Helsinki we can decide on initiating negotiations with Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania and Malta. Although there are great differences in political and economic development among these countries, we are now justified in inviting them to the negotiating table.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement is very much a process of adjustment. Both the applicant countries and the Union itself will have to adjust to a Europe whose main driving force will be a European Union of 25, perhaps even 30 Member States. Access to the negotiating table will give the applicant countries the support they need en route to democracy, rule of law and a healthy economy. Conducting parallel negotiations with twelve countries will be difficult. It will be very important to insist that the criteria for membership agreed at the European Council in Copenhagen are honoured. The talks must be conducted in such a way that each applicant is given the opportunity to progress according to its own degree of readiness.</p>
<p class="contents">For enlargement to proceed on a sound basis, we must also have the courage to be open and honest, both with each other and with the applicant countries and their people. The Union cannot yet promise one country seeking membership a date when it will become a member of the Union. Even to lay down a timetable in this connection would be very ambitious. But what the Union can do is to establish targets for itself and, at the same time, make it clear to others under what conditions and when it would be ready to expand.</p>
<p class="contents">A particularly thorny question, and one that has been cause for most debate beforehand, is that of Turkey. The Finnish Presidency has strengthened relations between the Union and Turkey. I am very pleased that relations between Turkey and Greece have improved, and that both these countries are in favour of UN talks on Cyprus. As representative of the country to hold the presidency, I hope that the European Council will find it possible to recognise Turkey’s status as a candidate member of the Union. It is clear to all that Turkey still has a long and arduous path ahead before it can meet the Copenhagen criteria. Obviously, the primary responsibility for this lies with Turkey. But it is also very much a question of how the Union might best further positive development and strengthen the forces of democracy in that country. The Turkish Court of Appeal’s decision to uphold the death sentence pronounced on the Kurdish leader, Abdullah Öçalan, was worrying, although expected. I expressed the Finnish Presidency’s position on the decision as soon as it had been announced. I reiterated our position that the Union does not approve of the death penalty. I appealed to the Turks not to enforce the sentence and to await the decision of the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg. In other words, I called on Turkey to adhere to the position it has thus far adopted on a practical moratorium in respect of the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment we are putting the finishing touches to the Finnish Presidency’s report to the European Council on the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference. The report consists of two parts, the first of which concerns the items most likely to be on the IGC agenda. In accordance with the mandate we were given at Cologne, our preparations have focused on the composition of the Commission, the reweighting of votes in the Council, increasing qualified majority decisions and certain other institutional matters closely connected with these issues. The other part of the report deals with issues that one or more Member States would like to see added to the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The other issues related to the three main areas have been the subject of heated debate. In various connections the following issues have been raised: the development of the work of the EU Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors, the distribution of seats in the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, the responsibilities of the Members of the Commission and external economic relations. These questions are closely connected with the work of the institutions in an expanding Union and, for that reason, their inclusion on the agenda in the next IGC is justified. Regarding issues outside the Cologne mandate but which have been taken up, for example in Parliament, I would mention the issues of defence and flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Finland have an old saying that a job well conceived is a job half done. In our report we are trying to prepare the ground for Portugal to be able to launch the IGC process as quickly as possible, perhaps even by February 2000, and for the conference to be able to be closed at the end of the same year. However, the Intergovernmental Conference is not the only route towards enhancing and reforming the work of the Union. I would like to remind everyone that reforms can also be made without amending the Treaties. During the autumn, we had discussions among the Member States and also partly put into effect the recommendations contained in the <span class="italic">Trumpf-Piris</span> report to improve the functional capabilities of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As the country to hold the presidency, we have also aspired to concrete action to promote transparency. On our own initiative we have, among other things, posted Council and working party agendas and timetables on the Internet. I am pleased to be able to tell you today that most of these reforms are now permanent. The General Affairs Council is to adopt the decision made on this issue on our initiative. Accordingly, in future, the Council will render public agendas of working groups, committees and Council sessions, with appropriate references to documents in respect of legislation. We also await with interest the Commission’s proposal to implement the rule on transparency in the Treaty of Amsterdam: Article 255. Finland would have liked to commence that work during its presidential term, but obviously the most important consideration is that we have a well-drafted proposal by the start of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cologne European Council clearly restricted the development of a common security and defence policy to crisis management. A common defence policy is thus not being discussed. In order to develop the European Union’s crisis management capability, in Helsinki we will focus on evaluating target levels and the resources they will require in all areas of crisis management. We will also be preparing to make proposals regarding the institutions in order to make the decision-making process in the European Union relating to crisis management more effective. Similarly, we must ponder our relations with those countries outside the European Union that desire, and are able, to participate in joint operations.</p>
<p class="contents">One special strength of the European Union, when compared to military organisations such as NATO or the WEU, is its sheer size and coverage. The European Union will have at its disposal all the tools of crisis management – the political, economic and humanitarian means and, in the future, a military capability. This, it is believed, will increase the union’s scope for preventing crises.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision will probably be made at the Helsinki European Council to strengthen the compatibility of civil crisis management resources among the Member States, the Union and NGOs and speed up the readiness to use them. At the same time we shall stress the need to avoid overlap. We must try to develop the EU’s own contribution to the work of other organisations such as the UN, the OSCE and the Council of Europe. We must ensure smooth cooperation in the field. Furthermore, we are looking into ways of establishing a common data base and coordination system. Similarly, the EU’s capability for independent action should be strengthened. We consider it a matter of urgency to improve the civil police’s involvement in crisis management. It is hoped that the conclusions drawn at Helsinki will speed up developments in EU civil crisis management in the same way as the Cologne Council gave a boost to developments in military crisis management. Before I go on to speak about military crisis management, I would like to emphasise separately, that, although civil and military crisis management are two separate areas, they have to be made to fit together perfectly.</p>
<p class="contents">Improving resources will also be a major issue in the conclusions drawn at Helsinki on military crisis management. The Member States would now seem to be prepared to approve common target levels. Talks are still continuing on how clearly these targets should be defined and what their level should be. However, the aim is to be able to implement the whole spectrum of the Petersberg Tasks. The European Union is thus reorganising the resources and structures it has at its disposal for military crisis management. The preparations for the Helsinki European Council include discussions for target levels that are in practice the equivalent of the current operations in Bosnia and Kosovo in terms of requirements and size. There are approximately 50 000 military personnel from EU Member States involved in these operations. It has been proposed that troops should be ready to be deployed within 60 days and be able to serve in a crisis region for two years at a time. The proposed timetable for the implementation of these targets is 2002 – 2003. The actual development work would focus on the operational capability of troops through training and improving equipment. What problems are there, then? They concern the areas of intelligence, systems of leadership and air transport in particular. Europe is still a long way from being self-sufficient in these areas. Decisions are also to be taken at the Helsinki European Council on the new institutions relating to crisis management that will be needed, including a Standing Political and Security Committee, a Military Committee, a body to coordinate civil crisis management, and a military staff to carry out analytical work.</p>
<p class="contents">At Cologne there was an aim to replace the WEU with the EU’s own operation and direct cooperation between the EU and NATO in military operations relating to the Petersberg Tasks. With this in mind, it was decided to create arrangements for the six European NATO countries outside the EU to participate on as broad a basis as possible. Arrangements should likewise be made for cooperation in respect of the other EU European partners. At Helsinki, we may at last agree on some general guidelines for such arrangements. The intention is to create an arrangement for cooperation in communications relating to general crisis management and preceding decisions on operations. I would nevertheless like to remind everyone that during the preparations we have considered it self-evident that the EU should always itself take a decision to embark on a military operation. Such a decision must be unanimous. In addition, Member States would obviously decide on their own involvement. </p>
<p class="contents">I have consciously made reference to the future in my descriptions of events, as representatives of Member States are still negotiating on these issues, and the last General Affairs Council is to sit next week on 6 December. But this is what the situation looks like at present.</p>
<p class="contents">In my speech I have only addressed some of the core issues to be discussed at the European Council. Along with them, Helsinki will also deal with questions relating to economic policy and employment. The employment guidelines adopted at the meeting for the year 2000 will require the Member States to invest substantially in policies to improve employment. In addition to employment matters, we will also be debating the coordination of economic policy, the workings of the single market and the information society. But Parliament is probably already aware of this. </p>
<p class="contents">This brief survey – which lasted too long, I fear – concentrated on the main subject areas of the meeting, and I would like to just mention briefly one matter in finishing. On the first day of the meeting we want the European Union as a whole to adopt the Millennium Declaration. In this brief and clear declaration we should be able to explain why we need the Union, what we have achieved up till now, what challenges lie ahead of us and how we will respond to them. And that will be no easy task. </p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union’s Heads of State and Government will shortly be gathering in Helsinki with a very busy agenda in front of them. First of all, I would like to congratulate the Finnish Presidency on all the hard work and careful planning it has put into preparing this European Council. Thanks to these efforts, the Summit will, I am sure, be a great success. </p>
<p class="contents">One of the main items on the agenda at Helsinki will, of course, be enlargement. In the composite paper issued last month, the Commission argued strongly for the need to maintain the momentum of reform in the candidate countries. These countries have already made considerable efforts in order to meet, with time, the Copenhagen criteria. Our task is now to reward their great efforts in such a way as to encourage further progress while dispelling complacency. If we fail to give our recognition, some of these countries may become disillusioned and turn their backs on us: their economies would start to diverge, progress towards democracy and respect for human rights may mark time and an historic opportunity will have been lost, perhaps forever. This is why we need a swift but surefooted accession process, and I certainly hope the Helsinki Summit will adopt the accession strategy we recommended in October and will decide, provided the necessary conditions are met, to start accession negotiations next year with Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania and Slovakia. </p>
<p class="contents">What I am hoping to see emerge from Helsinki, therefore, is a fully flexible, multi-speed accession process under which negotiations with each of the twelve candidate countries proceed in parallel with its political and economic progress. This system, which has been compared to a regatta, allows each country to move at its own pace, be assessed on its own merits and join when it is finally able to meet all the obligations of membership. </p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the European Council will grant Turkey the official status of a candidate country. Clearly, accession negotiations cannot be opened with Turkey until it meets the Copenhagen political criteria, with their clear emphasis on human rights, respect for minorities and complete religious freedom. I, too, in this respect, would remind you of what the Finnish Minister for Foreign Affairs said about the serious Öçalan case. However, by granting it candidate status, we would be giving Turkey a definite incentive to continue moving in the right direction. </p>
<p class="contents">Another important item on the agenda at Helsinki will, of course, be the Intergovernmental Conference which must carry out the institutional reforms needed to prepare the EU for enlargement. I hope the Summit will agree to launch this conference very soon, because the enlargement process will be beginning in about three years' time and it will continue, uninterrupted, for a good few years after that. In practice, this means the necessary reforms must be in place by the end of 2002 if we are to be ready on schedule. Therefore, since a long time is needed for ratification, our time is short.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the necessary institutional reforms? The major ones were outlined in the conclusions of the Cologne Summit and discussions on their scope began with the report I commissioned from Mr Dehaene, Mr Von Weizsäcker and Lord Simon. Parliament has tabled contributions, as has the Commission in the document we issued on 10 November The Presidency is due to report its findings to the European Council. I believe there is a growing agreement among us on the question of which reforms are needed. First, there are the issues specifically referred to at Amsterdam, namely the number of Commissioners, the representation of Member States in the Council and the extension of qualified majority voting. These three issues are, in any case, interrelated. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there are matters arising from those issues. For example, enlargement will have an impact on all the other European institutions and bodies, such as the Court of Justice and, indeed, this House which, as new Member States join, will have to make room for up to 700 representatives, and not more than 700. Furthermore, the codecision procedure will have to be extended to legislation for which qualified majority voting itself has already been extended.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there are matters for which preparatory work is to be done outside the IGC but which might, towards the end of the conference, be included in the Treaty or affect it in one way or another. I am thinking, for example, of specific issues: firstly, discussions on security and defence. The European Council will adopt important decisions in this field and on the management of the non-military aspects of international crises. The Commission has been closely involved in the policy-making process, as a result of which new operational structures will be set up. They will enable us to travel further along the route towards integration, already traced in Cologne.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome these important developments and I undertake to do all I can at Helsinki to help bring them about and to ensure that they are consistent with the EU's institutional framework. The Commission intends to commit itself to fully implementing the decisions adopted by the Heads of State and Government, particularly the decisions on procedures for providing assistance during international crises. Implementation will involve not only providing financial assistance, which must be guaranteed, but also sending experts to carry out emergency work on the ground. This will call for our services to put a lot of effort into its organisation and management. These are certainly issues that cannot be ignored. More generally, I would like to point out that a common foreign and security policy requires the creation of a European defence industry that can compete efficiently in both technological and financial terms. The Commission intends to promote this by using all the instruments at its disposal relating to the internal market, commercial and competition policies. I am in favour of the changes that are now taking place.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the work begun at Tampere on drafting a Charter of Fundamental Rights and the possible restructuring of the Treaty, separating its basic, essential texts from its implementing provisions. This would make the essential texts simpler to read and allow the less essential ones to be amended via a less cumbersome procedure. I do not underestimate the difficulties, both technical and political. As a first step, the Commission will ask academic experts to carry out a detailed feasibility study on this project. In this respect, I intend to ask the European University Institute of Florence – which has specialists in this subject from all European countries – to study this matter. Once this has been done we shall have to carefully consider how to proceed with this idea. </p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, all these issues must be tackled if our institutions are to function effectively in an enlarged European Union. Above all, it is essential that we scale down the number of decisions that still have to be taken unanimously. Maintaining unanimous voting will result either in complete paralysis or in everything being reduced to the lowest common denominator, a luxury we cannot afford in today’s world, where immediate action is called for in areas of vital importance to the European Union’s future. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, one more example: trade talks are beginning in Seattle, and the EU must punch its full weight in these negotiations. In the wake of the Tampere Summit, the Heads of State and Government are including justice and home affairs as a priority area. The European tax package is now in great difficulty. Yet it is not only an important initiative to combat harmful tax competition but also an essential aspect of our employment strategy. If we continue to burden our jobs with taxes, as we have done until now, our employment policy will certainly be contradictory. On all these three fronts, Europe is handicapped by the unanimity requirement. It is like a soldier trying to march with a ball and chain around one leg. I hope that Helsinki, by launching the reform process, will clearly show we have the ambition and the political will to rid ourselves of this encumbrance and to tackle the other crucial issues before us.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament will, of course, be fully involved in the IGC. The European Union exists for its citizens, whom you represent, and the reforms we are planning must serve their interests. That is why I look forward to seeing this House play a key role in the reform process and in building the enlarged Europe of tomorrow. </p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, the Helsinki Summit on 10 and 11 December is highly significant for Europe in the 21st century in general and for the European Union in particular. Madam President-in-Office of the Council, we wholeheartedly welcome the decision to start negotiations with Latvia and Lithuania and with Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania and Malta. I hope that it will become clear when we embark on discussions with the three Baltic states that the security of these three states is in good hands in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I have held discussions with representatives from these three countries over the past few days. They are most concerned at Russia’s behaviour in Chechnya and by opening negotiations with Latvia and Lithuania, rather than just Estonia, as we did at the beginning, we are sending out the right signal and the Baltic states will know that they belong to our Community and will soon enjoy the security which membership of the European Union brings.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We in the PPE-DE group take Turkey seriously and we make no secret of the fact. We always were, and continue to be, Turkey’s friend. We were the group in the European Parliament which pressed, before anyone else, for Customs Union. But, there is also a strong minority in our group which does not share the majority view. The majority of the group takes the view that, if Turkey becomes a member of the European Union, and we must be clear on this, then the European Union will take on a different political, economic and cultural quality. I know, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that you have been highly committed in the past to monitoring and discussing the Kurdish problem and you know full well to what I refer.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge the other groups, if we are to subscribe to this compromise text as a European defence policy, to accept a motion for a long-overdue debate on the geographical enlargement of the European Union. We are waiting for the Council of Ministers to nail its colours to the mast and tell us exactly what the geographical enlargement of the European Union will look like. That will give us plenty to debate over coming weeks and months.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the Intergovernmental Conference: Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I have every confidence that you will succeed in making it clear in Helsinki that we do not intend to confine ourselves to the three Amsterdam leftovers. Obviously, the extension of majority voting is crucial. But it is also crucial for the European Parliament to be given codecision powers on all matters decided by majority vote in the Council of Ministers. If we, as a European Union, want a place in the global economy and on the increasingly globalised political scene, then we must make up our minds to give the European Union a legal capacity so that representatives of the European Union can act on behalf of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment the European Union is a non-starter. It cannot even buy a house. These are the facts and this is the root of the problem. There are numerous other issues too. What worries me is this, and I would ask you to take this very seriously in the Council of Ministers and in the Commission: the European Union can only be enlarged subject to certain conditions. I am a passionate advocate of enlargement because, having shaken off Communism, the countries of Central Europe have a right to join our community of values. However, and I am equally resolute on this point, if there is a danger that enlargement will lead to the break up or the dilution of the European Union in the sense that, in the end, we will merely be an economic and financial institution and not a political union, if this is the danger which enlargement holds, then we should say no to enlargement. What I mean is that we need to make reforms first. I can only urge the Council of Ministers to make every effort to give this Intergovernmental Conference a comprehensive mandate and to ensure that the European Parliament’s two representatives are allowed to attend the conference on equal terms.</p>
<p class="contents">We are debating defence policy, an issue which we have supported here in Parliament for decades. We need European defence. But when we talk of European defence, we also mean practical measures. For example, I am most worried by the cuts in defence spending in my country. In other words, we will not achieve what we say we want to achieve and that really would be a pity. Talking about European defence and including European defence in the Treaties makes no sense if we put no flesh on the bones, which is why it is important to put flesh on the bones, to create the capacities, but without standing in opposition to our American partners and our allies in the USA. We do not want to oppose America, we want to stand on an equal footing and we want to act in partnership. If we take this approach, the western alliance also stands to gain.</p>

I am saying this because I missed some of her thoughts on certain points which are absolutely vital in our opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">We are certainly now facing an historic challenge in terms of advancing and consolidating the Union and reorganising it in order to cope with enlargement. My colleague, Mr Hänsch, will talk specifically about enlargement in detail. I will restrict myself to the over-enlargement caused by our relationship with Turkey. I can say that the Socialist Group is unanimous on this. We do believe it is advisable to adopt a positive position with regard to Turkey. However, firstly, Turkey must show willing. It cannot just expect and it is therefore vital how it acts in the Öçalan case. Secondly, a plan of action must be prepared.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to the very balanced position of this House on the Intergovernmental Conference, the Council must not adopt a low-key approach to this issue. Enlargement is a major political ambition and we have to know how to respond to this. We cannot simply say that there are some reforms to be made on a few remaining points or that this is an issue to be resolved only in terms of costs. We have to be capable of providing the major political impetus needed for this process.</p>
<p class="contents">I also place great importance on something which has hardly been mentioned. We are carrying out a parallel exercise of constitutionalising the Treaties, by preparing a Charter of Fundamental Rights, at the same time as planning the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">We have an obligation to our fellow citizens – and note that the President-in-Office of the Council comes from a Nordic country which is always boasting about transparency – to achieve a transparent process in which this House is duly represented. I would like Mrs Halonen to reject the view expressed that the Council Presidency is opposed to full representation of the European Parliament, with two representatives, at the Intergovernmental Conference. We must also explain to our political forces, to our national MPs and to our people, why we are holding the IGC, why we want a Charter of Fundamental Rights, why we want enlargement and why we have the responsibility of ensuring that the Community operates as a community.</p>
<p class="contents">On defence there is one point about which I am very pleased. The President-in-Office of the Council, who comes from a tradition of neutrality, has become an expert on security and defence. She is to be congratulated on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must refer to the absolutely fundamental issue of growth, stability and employment. This is an issue on which the line taken in Luxembourg, and then in Cardiff, Cologne and Helsinki, must be consolidated at the next Summit under the Portuguese Presidency. We realise that, to have a prosperous future in the Union, we must be capable of being more competitive and generating more economic growth, but with the emphasis on employment and social cohesion which are, and must be, our first priorities. These are the challenges which my group wants the Helsinki Summit to respond to in a positive manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This rather reinforces the press reports, which give cause for concern, that the European Council has chosen a narrow agenda for the IGC and a merely voluntary charter.</p>
<p class="contents">If that is so, it says a lot about the way the Union is squaring up for the challenge of enlargement. An IGC that failed to amend the way the treaties can be revised in future and in policy sectors to soften them would be an IGC that threatened to paralyse the Union when it tries to modernise itself following the accession of new Member States. An IGC that failed to grant the citizen improved access to the European Court means a charter will be more of a public relations exercise than a powerful re-definition of European citizenship. And a Union that is frightened to reinforce its liberal and parliamentary character will be an unattractive Union for the acceding Member States and an unreliable player upon the world stage. Where Europe stops should not be a question of geography but of liberal values and democratic practices, clearly defined and brightly illuminated so that the candidate countries know where the European journey will bring them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must now take a definite step forward on this issue, as we know how difficult it has been to put a stop to negative developments with regard to the environment, and we are expecting determination and concrete results from you in the areas of business, industry and agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the economy in general, the current struggle to harmonise indirect taxation is certainly an illustrative example of how we will not make any headway in this area if we insist on unanimity. I have followed Mrs Halonen’s battle with the City of London bankers, and I believe that there will be no end to this struggle until we can decide the issue of taxation by means of a qualified majority. This will therefore be an important task for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference. Otherwise we will be leaving questions of taxation for the markets to decide, and that is something we surely do not want.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject that will surely live on after the Helsinki Summit is, however, concrete decisions on a common security arrangement. I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council specifically as you very laudably raised the point that civil and military crisis management complement one another and they should be examined and decided on together. The European Union does indeed have such an advantage, compared, for example, with NATO. The European Union is, after all, a civil organisation, and if it now develops a military crisis management capacity, we can also trust it to consider the wisdom that says it is always better to prevent crises rather than try to calm things down through the use of force. We can resort to that when all else has failed.</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned that for civil crisis management we need the police: I would like to add that other ordinary professional groups, such as psychologists and social workers, as well as plumbers and builders, can be needed in non-military crisis management. Our group was most satisfied when it heard recently that High Representative Xavier Solana had started to look into a parliamentary initiative for the establishment of civil crisis management troops.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President-in-Office of the Council, you mentioned a Millennium Declaration: it seems the Council has also been bitten by the millennium bug. You have spoken in favour of transparency, but this is surely one of the most closely guarded state secrets there is. So perhaps you could give us a tiny hint about what kind of tracks we will be leaving at the millennium celebrations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some aspects of it are appealing and sound, some are threatening. Mr Prodi was not in the least convincing when it came to the following question: is political unification the price for the new strategy? We are particularly worried about this. We are worried that this strategy will somehow lead to a twin-track Europe – i.e. the 15 versus the rest – and that many aspects of unification are being sidelined. </p>
<p class="contents">The second reason this worries us is on account of the Intergovernmental Conference: there is an air of vagueness and stubbornness about it and its narrow agenda only addresses procedural issues. What about the political issues, what we might call the intergovernmental economic management of EMU, Mr President; in other words, what about political intervention? What about the common policy on unemployment, or on employment for that matter? Are these not issues which are relevant to unification, issues which concern the very people from whom the Union is apparently distancing itself? </p>
<p class="contents">The third issue is Turkey. Do the Council and the Commission know exactly what Turkey wants? We are convinced by numerous declarations that some people in Turkey just want ‘symbolic recognition’, purely for internal reasons, and do not take their future in Europe seriously. That is no good to anyone, either in Europe or in Turkey.<span class="italic"> </span>If we want to make ourselves clear and if we want to stop bandying words and leading Turkey up the garden path, then we should send it a signal which says that, of course, Turkey will not be discriminated against, that goes without saying; however, we need to be clear as to what Turkey’s future within Europe will actually entail. We need a material policy which Turkey can verify and which allows it to head along the right path: the path towards the rule of law, good neighbourliness and peaceful coexistence, as well as towards a withdrawal from military operations everywhere, especially in Cyprus and on the Kurdish question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is not the case for all countries in Europe at this time and that is why I welcome the efforts of the Finnish Government to pursue the adoption of a strategy on the Western Balkans at the forthcoming Helsinki Summit. A permanent stabilisation of the region is in the interests of the European Union as a whole. The European Union and the Member States together constitute the most important donors in the region and besides humanitarian aid, the region has received this year EU aid amounting to EUR 2,100 m. We support democratic change in Yugoslavia and the European Union has rightly started to implement pilot projects based on the energy-for-democracy initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">EU enlargement will be another central theme at the Helsinki Summit. During the Finnish Presidency, accession negotiations have been opened in respect of seven more chapters of talks. These concern EMU, social policy and employment, the free movement of capital, the free movement of services, taxation, energy, transport, all of which are very demanding social and economic sectors. I am particularly pleased to see that the chapter dealing with energy has now commenced. I say this because the safety of nuclear plants in Eastern and Central Europe has been a cause for great concern in recent years, and will continue to be. The Union cannot hide from the naked fact that the EU itself, together with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, will have to play a key role in terms of financial contributions and technical support to make safe all these nuclear reactors sooner rather than later.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that the enlargement process cannot take place unless there is some internal reform in the decision-making processes within the EU. The Presidency is independently preparing a comprehensive report on questions to be examined at the IGC and on the various options for resolving them. The deadline being set down for the next IGC is very ambitious indeed. I support working towards reaching agreement by the end of next year, but equally we must not, and should not, hurry possible fundamental reforms to existing EU treaties without due consideration and evaluation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We understand that the Council is disgracefully preparing to exclude the European Parliament from the Intergovernmental Conference and, above all, that it is preparing to ensure that the conference will only tackle three items related to the improvement of the functioning of the institutions, thereby leaving that incomprehensible house of cards known as the Treaty of the Union entirely intact.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen of the Council and the Commission, today the Union is an institution which does not respect the minimum parameters of democracy and the Rule of Law, and for us Radicals, European federalists, advocates of the United States of Europe as envisaged by Altiero Spinelli, it is difficult to consider the minor – and they really are minor – reforms on the agenda as real progress. Of course, we are utopians and you are realists, such realists that the Berlin Wall has been down for ten years, and ten years on we are still unable to enlarge eastwards, just as we were unable to intervene to stop the genocide, first in Bosnia and then in Kosovo. This is because the European Union’s strength is increasingly bureaucratic power, a pervasive bureaucracy that desires to take control of everything, under the ideological illusion that the law and the parliamentary process are obstacles that needlessly slow down reform. I believe that Parliament should not be satisfied with just asking to participate in proceedings at the conference, such as the work on drafting a Charter of Fundamental Rights, but that it should demand the right to be able to act as a real parliament and it should demand that its right to decide independently on its own seat be restored at the Intergovernmental Conference so that it is not forced to work with its secretariat spread between three different locations. This could be a first tangible step towards allowing Parliament to be a real parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will be planning the Intergovernmental Conference with a view to the enlargement of the European Union. A drastic extension to the Union’s powers is on the agenda. These are the crucial building blocks for a United States of the European Union, that is to say for a real federal State. There is one significant point I want to concentrate on in my speech, namely the Commission’s remark in its contribution for the Summit to the effect that, if the political will is sufficiently strong, it will be possible to conclude the planned Intergovernmental Conference successfully before the end of the year 2000. One wonders whose political will are we talking about? Earlier, I heard one speaker say that we must be careful not to lose our citizens. Yes, but is that not putting the cart before the horse? Is it not our citizens who govern our society, or is it ourselves, sitting here and fashioning democracy? What kind of absurdity is this? If the people of Europe were to be asked whether they wanted the kind of empire-building that is on the agenda, extremely different answers would be obtained. We have asked this question in Denmark, for example. On the few occasions we did ask the people – and we also asked the French people in 1992 – we received an answer indicating very serious public reservations about such a development. But our citizens are not being asked, and my advice to this Intergovernmental Conference, before the empire-building gets too well under way, is: ask the people of Europe whether they want developments to take this course. I personally am sure of the answer. This is something they do not want. We have already lost our citizens, as may be very clearly seen from the results and the turnout at the last elections to this Parliament.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am certain that all these issues will be resolved in the medium or long term. But one problem calls for immediate resolution. I refer to the closure of high-risk nuclear reactors. An accident would affect the whole of Europe and the longer these reactors are working the greater the likelihood of total meltdown. It is therefore imperative that binding arrangements for the decommissioning of high risk reactors be agreed before accession negotiations begin.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to give you just one example of the nuclear policy of an applicant country: Slovakia’s technocrats and bureaucrats promised under the Communist regime to decommission Bohunice in the year 2000. Obviously they recognised the risk. Now, no-one knows anything about any such promise. Just as past promises have not been honoured, there is a danger, if guaranteed decommissioning is not demanded in advance, that they will once again be forgotten. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will surprise the Finnish representatives of the country to hold the presidency by saying that the Finnish Presidency can already now be termed, in the positive sense, historic. At the Summit conference in Tampere, we included internal and police affairs among Community issues in an attempt to increase citizens’ security. The fight against organised crime, above all against the spread of drugs, will become more effective as the decisions are implemented. At Tampere, we decided to draft a Charter of Fundamental Rights, in which the European Parliament will also be fully involved. </p>
<p class="contents">The meeting at Helsinki will deal with joint crisis management and the resources to be allocated to it, along with a timetable for this joint action. According to a new opinion poll, this enjoys the support of a clear majority in my country. This step towards a common foreign and defence policy, in close cooperation with NATO, is an important part of civil, economic and political crisis management. The Intergovernmental Conference, at which next year will be decided the institutional changes that are required within the Community as a condition for enlargement, will have its roots in, and receive its agenda from, Helsinki. At Helsinki, the status of the new applicant countries will also be decided, which means that the artificial division in Eastern and Central Europe into better and poorer candidates will end.</p>
<p class="contents">But is our own house in order at present, and what must the people of those countries trying to join the Community think about this patent protectionism, which undermines the basic work of the Community in the economic sector? What measures might be imposed in time on their relatively low-income citizens and on their companies competing in the Community? For example, Spain still holds back from the all-important creation of the European limited company, the United Kingdom safeguards City jobs by refusing to accept the harmonisation of taxation even as regards the taxation of capital, France would rather go to the Community court than liberalise its electricity market as required by Union legislation, the German Chancellor breaks all the rules of the market economy and rescues a construction company on the brink of bankruptcy in order to gain political kudos in his home country, and the beef war against England continues far beyond the requirements of health. How can we be contemplating enlargement if we are still fighting in the current EU area in a manner that goes against the rules of the Single Market? European competitiveness is not strong now either, the markets in the Community are not functioning correctly and the process whereby differences in consumer goods prices in the EMU area would be evened out has ground to a halt.</p>
<p class="contents">My examples in no way mean that I exclude the possibility of the rules being broken in my country as well. I only wish to say that the future aims in Helsinki are good ones, but our own European house must also be put in order in accordance with the rules of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The individual negotiations which we want to conduct with 12 applicant countries should not become mere routine. The last Intergovernmental Conference of the century marks the end of a millennium of European wars and you must ensure, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that the foundations are laid so that there will never again be another millennium of wars in Europe. That is the aim of enlargement, to unite the whole of Europe in a European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Halonen, we support what you have said regarding the negotiations and how they are to be conducted and are also in agreement with what Mr Prodi has said on the matter. We find that all well and good, but what you have said about the preparation of accession, about the so-called Amsterdam <span class="italic">leftovers</span>, that is not enough for us. We want comprehensive reform of the European Union. If we are to open the doors of the European house, of our European Union, in order to take in another 12 lodgers in addition to the 15 already living here, then one visit from the cleaner is not enough, we need to convert the whole house. That is something I have heard too little about, not only from you, but also from the other governments of the European Union. I know what you are thinking and perhaps what your intentions are: let us just begin with a few minor reforms at this Intergovernmental Conference and then, after next year’s Intergovernmental Conference, there will be another Intergovernmental Conference and so on and so forth.</p>
<p class="contents">I put it to you that the people of the European Union are tired of seeing the EU stumble from one Intergovernmental Conference to the next, taking so many tiny steps that they no longer know which direction they are going in. We must show them once and for all what our image of the European Union and of the future of Europe is, instead of watching the EU constantly stumbling from one conference to the next.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the common defence policy, we welcome the statement which you have made today, but there must be more to European summits than statements and papers. We want you to take the decisions needed in Helsinki so that concrete initiatives can be introduced into both military and non-military aspects of the common defence policy and to stipulate the operational capacities needed and the institutions in which the decisions are to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we want, on the day after Helsinki, on 12 December, to be able to talk about a real European Summit, a Summit from which we can look out into the new millennium and not just a mole-hill without a view. You have the responsibility and the opportunity to ensure that the Finnish Presidency at the end of this century goes down in history as a great presidency!</p>

As we adopted the broad resolution on the IGC in the previous part-session at Strasbourg, we should have focused this time mainly on Union enlargement. Unfortunately, the joint resolution drafted by the groups only contains a few paragraphs on enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">The group of the European Liberal Democrats has tabled some amendments that would complement and improve the jointly prepared draft. We hope that the Commission and the Council will draft an overall strategy, in which enlargement of the Union and its future reforms might be linked to a broader pan-European scenario. In our opinion, we should consider various models of differentiated integration and try to achieve an ever-developing, concentrically conceived Union, in which there would be a federal core and a less integrated outer perimeter. We furthermore propose that the Union should use the European Council and the OSCE as forums for pan-European cooperation.

However, a minimalist agenda appears to have been set for this IGC, basically limited to the three points left open by the Treaty of Amsterdam: composition of the Commission, weighting of votes in Council and a further extension of qualified majority voting.</p>
<p class="contents">This agenda will not in any way help to solve the EU’s problems in terms of enlargement which is therefore likely to be undertaken under the worst institutional conditions. </p>
<p class="contents">We certainly understand the Council’s dislike of the shameless attempts by the Commission in recent months to force through, along the lines of the Dehaene report, the idea of another major federalist leap forward.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the Council is now accepting the inclusion on the agenda of a proposal of the same type, namely the extension of qualified majority voting. This was not even envisaged by the Amsterdam Protocol on the institutions, and appeared only in an annexed statement of three Member States. This proposal, inspired by the idea of a standardised and standardising Europe, is by no means the solution which will allow Europe to operate with 27 members or more.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, if the Council really wants to carry out innovative work, it should ditch the Commission’s proposals and ignore the Amsterdam leftovers. It should put just one subject on the negotiating table, namely decision making in an enlarged Union. This one subject would mean having to jointly consider three consequences which are logically linked. These are qualified majority voting in certain cases, the enshrinement of the Luxembourg compromise in all cases and increased flexibility in cooperation according to a differentiated scale.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, we would have to consider what really brings us together, without blindly accepting the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> as a taboo area, and how the common institutions will operate in a Union which uses this differentiated scale. If we do not make this effort to change, if we hold on to rigid ideas like limpets to a rock, either enlargement will fail or the Union will be swept away.

The European Union must ensure that the enlargement process is not slowed down because institutional reforms have not taken place within the Union. The European Commission’s transparency concerning candidate countries should be adopted by the European Summit. </p>
<p class="contents">What will a Union comprising more than 25 Members actually look like? Moreover, Turkey requires special treatment in the accession strategy.

<p class="contents">The agenda for the IGC in 2000 must list more items than the three leftovers from Amsterdam. The attitude regarding the accession process displayed by people within candidate countries remains worrying. In this respect, it is important to develop a clear information strategy. In fact, the same applies just as much to public opinion within the EU Member States. Otherwise, the value of an enlarged Union will remain vague to the average European citizen. </p>

<p class="contents">Also, I could not agree more with the reason given in this respect. We used exactly the same reason for promoting the so-called "Regatta model" which did a great deal more justice to the own merits and efforts of the countries that wanted to join the European Union. Indeed, if we say to the most developed of the candidate countries: you are already in really, then they will sit back and no longer put in the same effort. We witnessed this in the case of the Czech Republic: policy stagnated. Other less developed countries, such as Bulgaria and Romania, will be discouraged and will lose the backing of the people for hard-line measures. Thankfully, this bizarre division into two groups is also being rescinded. I highly commend the Council, in anticipation that is, for the fact that it is going to implement these changes and this strategy in accordance with the original Parliament position. </p>
<p class="contents">It is extremely important that the European Parliament puts its own house in order too. We need a swift victory during the Intergovernmental Conference in 2000. We need to start reforming our institutions ourselves, to democratise ourselves. We require candidate countries to develop their institutions and ensure that they operate democratically. Imagine if we did not need to meet these requirements ourselves. I am, therefore, extremely taken aback by what Mr Van den Berg, from the [Dutch] Labour Party, wrote in a letter published recently which stated, in so many words, that the Union’s reform should no longer be a prerequisite for enlargement. How can it not be? I am extremely pleased that the leaders in the socialist group here do not subscribe to this view. Indeed, only if one does not operate with the best of intentions for the European Union can one say that we do not need to put our own house in order. We could easily offer the new Member States a house which will turn into a heap of rubble. They are entitled to more. They are entitled to democratically functioning institutions within the EU, of which they want to become members and which can take effective decisions. We should not offer them anything less. </p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who wants to focus only on the EU’s achievements as a free trade zone should just continue making this type of proposal. The reproach implicit in his letter that the Union actually regulates far too much at national, regional and local level, is also striking. Only hardened supporters of Mrs Thatcher talk in this way about decentralisation of Union policy. It is genuinely not the case that we rob national, regional and local governments of duties which belong there. Quite the opposite, in fact; subsidiarity is held in very high esteem here. Anyone who denies this is making a mockery of our work. </p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, all Member States should make a proper and sound contribution to the public debate on the European Union and we can bring this about, for example, by ensuring that insignificant issues which take us away from the real issues dealt with by the European Union are abandoned, the type of issues raised by the entire delegation brought by Mr Van den Berg.</p>
<p class="contents">I applaud the fact that we are going to develop a European Security and Defence Policy without weakening transatlantic relations and the link with NATO. I am extremely happy that we both, that is Mr Hänsch and I, also clearly agreed on this point, highlighting nevertheless that the European Union really prefers non-military means. This is simply a fact. But we also know that non-military means and diplomatic means often only really work if a credible, military threat is present in the background. I think that as far as this is concerned, we have learnt our lesson. The European Union has been dangerous because it was unable to split sovereign power in terms of security and defence policy. This is now changing, fortunately. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I herewith wish the Council the best of luck with the proposals we are submitting and I hope that the Council will, in good time, listen to the European Parliament regarding these other issues as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The development that began with the turning point in autumn 1989 has reached a stage of controlled progress, thanks to the determined policies of the European Union. We have laid down clear guidelines for Europe’s development, but there is work still to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">The Intergovernmental Conference, the reality of a common foreign and security policy and the controlled realisation of enlargement are matters that have to be thoroughly prepared for, both in the applicant countries and in the European Union. These areas form an important whole on the agenda of the Helsinki European Council and, as has been said here, this whole is so dynamic that if everything succeeds, the Helsinki meeting will be an historic event. The importance of these matters means that it is vital that Parliament also debates the issue thoroughly. We are now in a situation where, for the first time, full consideration must be given to the Treaty of Amsterdam in a meeting of the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The President-in-Office of the Council’s excellent speech fully covered the questions and challenges of a common security and defence policy for the Union. We should point out that the Helsinki Summit will focus on the European Union’s policy on the northern dimension and hence bring about more solid tools of stability and security for the northern part of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">When we speak of security, peace and stability in Europe, we should not forget, however, the factors that have an impact on internal security in society. A respect for fundamental rights and aspirations towards social equality are the best defence policy for ensuring social stability. The European employment policy and the guidelines on employment for the year 2000 to be discussed at Helsinki as a part of that policy still belong at the top of the Union’s agenda. The defence of democracy and the prevention of extremism are the basis of social justice, which means, among other things, combating unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to express my sincere congratulations to the country to hold the presidency for having succeeded, with no amendments to regulations, this has not yet been possible, in clearly increasing transparency in the decision-making process in the European Union and especially, in the European Council. Hopefully, future countries to hold the presidency will carry on the good work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Members of the House may not be aware of an ill-judged intervention into national politics by the Secretary-General of NATO today. Lord Robertson just recently attacked as isolationist the Scottish National Party’s policy concerning NATO membership. That policy, I should tell you, is equivalent in effect to the stance of Austria, Finland and Sweden, and also Ireland, though the occasion of Lord Robertson's intervention was Ireland's accession to the Partnership for Peace Programme. I hope that the President-in-Office of the Council would deplore, as I do, a party political intervention by the Secretary-General of NATO, the logical implication of which is an attack on the defence policy of Finland and other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">For the record, I should like to make it clear that, in common with all our colleagues in the Green European Free Alliance, we in the SNP are committed to the idea of collective security in Europe and welcome developments the Council will pursue to this end. But we are rootedly opposed to the maintenance of nuclear weapons in Scottish coastal waters, or coastal waters anywhere in Europe, or the land of Europe. This is a determining factor for defence policy as far as we are concerned, and I do not for a moment imagine that Ireland is in the process of developing a policy aimed at giving hospitality to nuclear weapons in their waters. Indeed, Mr Collins assured me that this has nothing to do with NATO membership.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that in developing our crisis management policy, we in Europe will think carefully as to where, if anywhere, nuclear weapons belong in it. I do not think they belong at all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Parliament has expressed a very clear position. It has voiced the hope that some major institutional reforms will be unalterably implemented before enlargement takes place if we do not want Europe to turn into a large area of free trade and nothing more, where regulations and internal rules that are now obsolete leave it distinctly incapable of making decisions; it has also stated that decisions on majority voting and membership of the committees are not sufficient to give fresh impetus and new strength to Europe, but that some other avenues should be taken, such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights and certain other elements that should have united the whole of the great European movement: all this, of course, must be in full respect for the nations, their feelings, their history and their traditions, which I consider to be extremely important. However, what I think I have understood – since we are not blind – is that at the forthcoming conference, caution and realism are likely to prevail over audacity and courage. But at an historic time such as this, when we either have the courage to take a giant step forwards or else risk being condemned to a lengthy period of impotency, I think that audacity and courage count for more than realism. I therefore extend an invitation to all those who believe in these goals, in these objectives, to be firm and determined, and we have here with us President Prodi who has declared this several times, and I know he believes it. I also invite the European Parliament to meet immediately after Helsinki – if, as I fear, the conclusion will be progress, but too limited – and with a very open mind and great courage to take responsibility for all of its decisions, saying and thinking, as at other times in European history, that Parliament has great possibilities and a significant role to play. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first concerns the Intergovernmental Conference. It seems clear from what the Minister has said that the Cologne conclusions will not be the only three items on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference. In my opinion, it is only right that issues relating to common foreign policy, defence and the economy should be discussed. However, it would be wrong just to stick to these few issues and ignore matters relating to the future structure and legal identity of the European Union, or social and cultural issues. I should like, at this juncture, to point out that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is of the utmost importance, and we should ensure that it evolves into a binding text and does not just remain a simple declaration of intent.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment concerns the position of Turkey. We must tread very carefully on this issue at the Helsinki Summit, because this ties in closely with the fact that Turkey has yet to demonstrate in its policies that it has understood that close relations with Europe depend on its fulfilling certain conditions, as laid down in EU texts and decisions. The question which arises here concerns the extension of the borders of Europe, especially with enlargement in the offing, and of whether or not the borders are to be extended to include Turkey. These are, in my view, important issues which we must bear in mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, although this vision, which is held both by the Council and the Commission on the issue of enlargement, may be ambitious, the same cannot be said about the content of the forthcoming IGC. In fact, what we have on the table now is merely a continuation of what could not be achieved in Amsterdam. I would say there is “plenty of ambition for enlargement and yet very little ambition for a revision of the Treaty of the Union itself”. There is even greater cause for concern when what we want to revise, that is the famous institutional triangle, is defended on the basis of an argument for efficiency and not on the basis of an overall vision of the European project. I do not think that anyone will be happy if the Intergovernmental Conference at the end of 2000 results in the Commission or the Council taking decisions in two hours which they previously took in five, six or seven. The project of European construction does not rest on the criterion of efficiency but on the criterion of cohesion and what we all hope is that, in Helsinki, a political agenda is set, and not a technical agenda with complicated political consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would like to welcome the Portuguese Presidency’s willingness to grant the European Parliament’s representatives at this IGC the same status that will be given to the Commission as far as the personal representatives of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs are concerned. It also appears important that we take advantage of the Portuguese Presidency’s willingness to have the IGC start not in March but, if possible, as early as January. </p>
<p class="contents">As for the Charter of Fundamental Rights, it is important that it is able not only to extend the rights that are already laid down in Charters and Treaties but also that it recognises rights in the social and economic spheres and, above all, that it is able to be innovative and creative in the area of new rights concerning environmental issues and the protection of consumer rights. </p>
<p class="contents">I shall now address a third point to which President Barón Crespo has already referred, concerning employment issues. The Union cannot only attempt to deal with employment issues when we are going through periods of economic slowdown. Our policies should be active, not reactive. We must take advantage of the current economic cycle and of the declaration that the Finnish Presidency will be making on the Millennium and the new information society, so that we find a creative way of recording sustained growth and so that the goal of full employment is actually achieved and does not remain a rhetorical phrase. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I also support you in your intention to have the strategic lines that were laid down in the Tampere Council conclusions approved, specifically in the fight against drug trafficking, and I hope that the Portuguese Presidency will be willing to adopt its own action plan in the next six-monthly term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I also regret that our joint motion for a resolution does not mention the problems linked to Eurodac, even though the Council has just announced, contrary to the Treaties, that this body should remain purely intergovernmental. This would, of course, exclude the European Parliament and the Court of Justice from any control in this area. Similarly, faced with the multiplication of information systems such as Europol and Eurodac, this House should have repeated its demand for an independent commission on data processing and the protection of privacy in order to preserve our individual freedoms, in addition to democratic and judicial control.</p>

It is a cornerstone of the negotiations on the Charter of Fundamental Rights and also on the constitutionalisation of the Union.

<p class="contents">To conclude, we must realise that such a pale and insipid text cannot satisfy the people of Europe.

<p class="contents">I completely agree with Mrs Halonen’s assessment that it is absolutely essential to reaffirm the international presence of the European Union. This is particularly true in the fields of security and defence to which the Finnish Presidency – and this can be said with legitimate pride – has given a decisive boost with this historic meeting of Defence and Foreign Ministers. This is the first time that this has occurred in the history of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we must stress the need to consolidate the achievements made at the Tampere Summit, referred to by the previous speaker, on an area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">As mentioned by the President-in-Office of the Council, it is essential that we confirm and prepare the work of the Portuguese Presidency with regard to employment. We are at an all-time low in the short history of the euro so the Helsinki European Council should devote some time to the issue of the external representation of the euro zone.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Halonen, you referred to the need for us to promote a more open, democratic and transparent European integration project. I noted with satisfaction the comment made by the President of the Commission on the presence of the European Parliament at the Intergovernmental Conference, but I would like you to say this as well. We cannot achieve a more open, transparent and democratic Europe if the European Parliament is not fully involved in the work of the IGC.</p>

They are serious and justified proposals, not escapist flights of fancy or vain utopian desires. I do not think it is right to take this attitude towards an important stance adopted by Parliament. We already know everything about the three leftovers from Amsterdam: all that remains is to make the choices that were not made during the previous conference. We should take a year just to do this. May I say that it is ridiculous to uphold this. Take heed: if the Council, if the governments do not open up the agenda of the Helsinki Summit to essential institutional issues that are now more than ready to be addressed, the debate on enlargement will lack credibility and we will show ourselves incapable of having a far-sighted view of the development of all aspects of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">President Prodi, I do not understand what the preparatory work outside the Intergovernmental Conference you spoke of should be. You seemed to be entrusting to this strange forum some of the issues that were put forward here by the Commission on 10 November. I hope that you will keep all those Commission proposals on the agenda and the conference approach unchanged, and will contribute in this way to a positive outcome of the Helsinki Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament had already been stressing for some time the inadequacy of the approach adopted by the Commission and the Council on enlargement. I think it was a question of a strategic and political error, the consequences of which were fortunately limited by the Commission’s change of mind, even though, I must say, it is sad to think that perhaps it was only the war which we experienced on our doorstep that pushed them towards this new strategy. It is right to begin negotiations with all the applicant states, but there is no doubt that we must differentiate between these countries, given that the levels of adaptation to Europe vary greatly between them. Of course, it seems difficult to talk about accession dates, even if it would be useful, very useful, in order to facilitate public opinion in the countries concerned, given that it is increasingly obvious that it is a risk: negotiations that are too lengthy may cool enthusiasm, both in Member States as well as applicant states, as shown by the recent opinion polls carried out in Poland and as I personally saw in this country from where I returned yesterday. We would therefore lose an historic opportunity, to quote President Prodi again. I am absolutely convinced that the accession of a new Member State must be the result of a broad consensus between political groups but, above all, the majority of the populations concerned should be in agreement. Therefore, we need – and this is my invitation to Parliament – to draw particular attention to the information campaigns which keep support for the European option in these countries at a high level. In this respect, I think that the PHARE programme may be the appropriate instrument, and I therefore think that it must be consolidated precisely in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not only Poland; other countries, such as the Czech Republic, also keep their enthusiasm for the European Union in check. I should like to point out that the Commission’s progress report on the Czech Republic refers to a medium-sized town in the Czechia where a fence has been built down a street to separate the Czechs from the Romas. That is hardly progress. I have been there twice, I have spoken to the mayor, I said the fence must go and what happened? The tabloid press of Europe is calling this fence a wall, as if it were not only the Berlin wall but the great wall of China. It has been so blown up that the people there are, understandably, extremely angry because they assume that there is sauce for the goose and sauce for the gander in the European Union. We have one set of rules for ourselves, and we are far from whiter than white, and we have another set of rules for applicant countries and we expect everything of them which we ourselves fail to deliver.</p>
<p class="contents">When we in the European Union take a look around us, at ethnic conflicts and terrorist attacks, I think that, if the boot were on the other foot, for example, if the Czech Republic were already in the Union, then it would say to a certain Member State: friend, if you do not get your house in order, then you must wait another twenty years before you become a Member State. I simply mean we should make sure that the people are not put off. The point is, we do not need to get on with the politicians in the applicant countries, but with the people. That is all that counts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to thank you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, for enabling the EU’s foreign and security policy, including its military capability, to be discussed so thoroughly today. </p>
<p class="contents">The EU can now, within the framework of the Amsterdam Treaty, increase its credibility where commitment to freedom and peace in Europe are concerned. The Helsinki Summit is, in that respect, a test for Europe’s present leadership. Is there the will and the courage to get together to formulate, and give depth to, a policy which enables the people of Europe to see that there is force and not only words behind the desire to prevent human catastrophes such as that in Kosovo? </p>
<p class="contents">Just as important a test of leadership is that involved in guaranteeing that the enlargement of the European Union can be carried out with the first new Member States acceding to the Union during the present term of office. In Helsinki, the preliminary values are being laid down for the Intergovernmental Conference which is to solve any remaining questions of power. We must have a European Union with the power to take decisions. Wishes for the future ought not, however, to be allowed to outstrip the historic task of taking advantage now of the historical opportunity to unify the whole of Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">The Finnish Presidency and the Summit must hand over the baton to Portugal with one unequivocal goal: to conclude the Intergovernmental Conference in Paris with a view to making an open, cooperative Europe, united in a common purpose, into a reality and one which will make place great demands upon leadership, the capacity for change and the willingness to quarrel less over national and short-term interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As always, it will be a compromise resolution. There is nothing wrong with that, it is the nature of the beast. But, in this case, I fear that the willingness of the joint authors of this resolution to reach a compromise has gone too far. I am not referring so much to what is said, although I do have, to a greater or lesser extent, some difficulty with that, such as on the subject of Turkey. My criticism applies mainly to what is not said in the resolution. We set too much store by the principle of hope and too little on hard facts as far as enlargement is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission refers again and again in its status reports on the level of adaptation to the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> to the fact that candidate countries, and this includes both the first wave and the second wave, are very slow in transposing and adapting to the <span class="italic">acquis</span> in numerous areas, such as social affairs, the environment and energy, as well as in human rights and living democracy. That is not enough. We should not be content to hope that a death sentence in Turkey will perhaps not be carried through. We should not be content to hope that sometime, somewhere, what are clearly unsafe nuclear power stations will perhaps be closed. We should not pretend that the extremely long transition periods which, in the 1980s, did not cause any real problems, may not cause any problems to the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Do we really want to accept transition periods of fifteen years or more for basic freedoms in the movement of people and in the service sector and still keep our borders open? We are in favour of enlargement; it is the answer to the question of the future of Europe, which is precisely why we must speak a clear language, even in compromise resolutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, my first ever speech in this Chamber was back in July when I commended the Finnish Presidency on giving priority to information society and its work programme. Tonight, as we draw towards the close of that presidency, I want to commend the Finnish Presidency for working on this, but also to express some disappointment that it has not made more of the opportunities. Mrs Halonen only just managed to fit in a mention of information society – I think right in the last sentence of her speech – and yet, according to a paper that I received from the Commission last week, we are to have an e-Europe initiative presented at Helsinki, a paper entitled “Information Society for All”. So far, we have not seen that. “All” clearly still does not include Members of the European Parliament, so not many people know about it. Indeed it barely rated a mention in your speech, but I hope that the Council is going to spend some time on this vital topic.</p>
<p class="contents">Could I also say on the broader topic of completing the internal market that, during the Finnish Presidency, we have had some very important strategy papers and they actually require a much higher priority than they are receiving in the Community at the moment. Indeed, the motion for a resolution I saw this morning contained no mention of any internal market or information society initiatives at all, despite the work that has been going on under your Presidency. I tabled an addendum in the name of my group this morning to include those items and I hope very much it will receive the support of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I also hope that the Finnish Presidency will remind Member governments at the Helsinki Council that creating a single market requires that cross-border takeovers and the restructuring of key industries must be allowed to proceed without political interference by Member governments. I am sure that Members of this House will know that there is a crucial takeover battle under way at the moment in the telecommunications sector. I have to say I am disappointed to see that some of the comments by senior politicians, and even Members of the Commission, suggest that the whole philosophy of an internal market has still to be fully accepted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Halonen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council. – (FI)</span> Mr President, first I will admit that when we tried to meet both the demands of time and adhere to priorities we chose as the basis of talks certain of those issues which we knew would be the most important topics at Helsinki. Thus, I have touched less in my speech on certain other matters, attention to which has been drawn here quite justifiably. However, I can reassure and console the Members of the European Parliament and say that these issues have not been forgotten. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, as regards the question of employment, we regard this as very important, and we have made preparations, as I said in my speech, to ensure that history’s first Summit conference on employment is a real success during Portugal’s presidential term. The special theme in matters of employment during the Finnish Presidency has been, <span class="italic">inter alia, </span>the status of the aged. There was an informal meeting of the Employment and Social Affairs Council on this subject, and we have also had a conference at ministerial level specifically on the topic of equality. In addition, we have raised the issue of the information society in the area of employment. A Council resolution was adopted on 29 November regarding employment in the information society and the social dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">I will give my replies in a slightly different order from the speakers, but as Mr Harbour seems to be here still, I will say to him too that the Commission is presenting its extensive information society initiative to the European Council in Helsinki. The document will only be published on December 8. The issue is to be debated properly at the special Summit meeting in Portugal. The main focus of information society matters at Helsinki will be the consultation between the information society and competitiveness. This is an angle that has achieved prominence during the Finnish Presidency and will probably now be discussed in connection with issues to do with the economy, employment and competitiveness. Thus, there is also an intention in the conclusions to speed up the development of a regulated environment for electronic commerce. During the Finnish presidential term we have made progress in major projects for regulation, but the finishing touches will be undertaken during the next presidential term. So the results are somewhat better, or I might even venture to say, substantially better than was perhaps evident from my speech.</p>
<p class="contents">Then I would like to answer one separate question, which is linked to the subject of enlargement. With regard to the question of the Roma people, which was raised here, I would like to say for my own part that I think it is right to focus attention on human rights, both generally and, in particular, regarding the rights of minorities, both in the European Union, but especially in those countries seeking membership. We have had experience of applicant countries during the Finnish presidential term, particularly with regard to the poor treatment of the Roma people, to the extent that large numbers of them have left those countries to apply for asylum. There are already nearly one thousand of them in Finland, if memory serves. The country to hold the presidency has not wished to draw the conclusion that the cause of this might only be found in Slovakia, Romania or in some other individual country. This is a common problem, and, for that reason, we intend to raise the issue, not in connection with enlargement, but as a general part of the Summit conference agenda, that Member States and applicant countries must improve the implementation of the rights of minorities. The country to hold the presidency is also offering to cooperate in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Then I will turn to what are actually the main issues. Firstly, I will say in all honesty, regarding the Intergovernmental Conference, that we are unanimous on the issues omitted from the Treaty of Amsterdam. Many of us here have tried to suggest that it would take just a little effort to try and solve these problems. Members of Parliament, they were not omitted from the Treaty of Amsterdam because they would have been minor issues. They were left out because they were very difficult questions and they have not got any easier in the meantime. However, a clear definition of the task will give us the chance now to succeed, as will the pressure to ensure the matter is put right. </p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I clearly listed for you those issues that are closely connected with these subject areas, and that can possibly be added to the agenda. The third group is those issues that one or more Member States have raised. I venture to say that, although Finland is still a young Member State, I am at present one of the oldest foreign ministers in terms of years in office. There are only a couple of us ministers left who were at the previous Intergovernmental Conference. At that IGC we gained the support of 12, 13 or 14 Member States in quite a number of areas. But we did not receive support from the full 15, which would have been required for example for these majority decisions. In this connection, I am not at all sceptical, but I am realistic with regard to the fact that, if we want to get certain issues through quickly, we have to concentrate on those that are to some extent ready. Then there is this other process, whereby the big, longer-term plans are addressed. We can make progress just as soon as we are unanimous on them, but they are not vital with regard to enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the participation of the European Parliament, I still cannot say what the solution will be at the Helsinki Summit, but I have said it already once before, and I will say so again, that our experience of their involvement on the previous occasion was a positive one. This is therefore the position of the country to hold the presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to enlargement, that will be the topic of debate in the last General Affairs Council to be held on 6 December. At this Council meeting I shall try to put together those elements concerning Turkey that at least will enable us to believe we can make progress. I have had on-going discussions on this matter with my colleagues. I am not quite sure whether we will yet be able to achieve unanimity on the subject at the General Affairs Council. Should there be sufficient unanimity to make a joint decision, the country to hold the presidency can still use the days it has left before the Helsinki Summit to put the finishing touches to the issue. Our common desire seems to be that the issue should be solved somehow through consensus before the Helsinki Summit and, as the representatives of the country to hold the presidency, we will work hard to achieve a positive solution.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful for all the comments made regarding the speed of enlargement, the Copenhagen criteria and everything else. Most of them reflected our opinion very closely when we were preparing the paperwork in the Council of Ministers. There were fewer remarks about foreign and security policy, but I would like to perhaps comment on one point. I have not mentioned the northern dimension issue at all this time. A meeting at ministerial level was held in Helsinki on the issue of the northern dimension, as we promised. Attendance was poor on the part of the foreign ministers of the other EU Member States – I was the only one there – but certain other ministers were present as well as all those ministers who are involved in the issue of the northern dimension. The response was very encouraging. The Commission promised to move things one step further and make an action plan, and thus we achieved what was perceived as the goal relating to the Portuguese presidential term. I agree with those who have spoken here that, if we increase stability, that, in its own way, increases security in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard once more to enlargement, we have endeavoured to remind the applicant countries, just as has been said here, that we are not accepting new governments as members: we are accepting new countries. It is very important to say to the governments of applicant countries that they must also involve the opposition and the whole population in their plans, just as has been asked of them. I have said that the European Union cannot just accept young, well educated males living in cities, but we are taking everyone, including the elderly, those who live in rural areas, the less well-educated and women. The plans must thus also take account of that. Hopefully, we shall also be able to speak with them about social cohesion, nuclear safety and security, as well as many other things. I have tried to convince the applicant countries of these matters by saying that although not all these points will be dealt with at the negotiations, it might just be that they will attract so much attention in the parliaments of Member States that the applicant countries would be assured of swift acceptance if they began to attend to these matters right away, matters that will, in any case, be very important when they eventually become members.</p>
<p class="contents">A final word about the IGC: if we acquired a legal character for the European Union at the next IGC many issues would be resolved. A legal personality, which is a matter that has been raised here in many speeches, was one of the questions that the majority supported but, where, unfortunately, consensus was not forthcoming. This was just another example of that problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not agree at all. It is an extraordinarily important Summit that we – Parliament, Commission and Council Presidency – have prepared very carefully and vigorously, and the challenge of enlargement is an historic challenge of decisive importance. At Helsinki, enlargement will take root, get going and completely change Europe’s appearance. I agree with what many of you have said, that we must proceed towards enlargement with gusto and energy, a process which will look at each country’s case closely but seek to prevent them losing faith in us. Our programme for enlargement is therefore not at all minimalist. The theory of the ‘regatta’, the image of each country running and improving as it does so, is the concept we have favoured. </p>
<p class="contents">Along with this, it is clear that we want to see an effective Intergovernmental Conference. We therefore believe – as Mr Seguro just said – that we must start as soon as possible. I think that we can and must start in January because there are many areas to be addressed: Amsterdam, issues arising from Amsterdam, cohesion, codecision, the issue of security and defence, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and also the reform of the Treaty. It is not a minimalist agenda. Mr Napolitano, I would also like to reassure you regarding the proposal to carry out accompanying preparatory work, and I stress the word accompanying: since the reform of the Treaties involves extremely detailed and special technical aspects, we cannot let ourselves be accused of not having carried out a thorough study and a complete analysis of these aspects. This is not a postponement: accompanying means that we will start work ourselves and that technical work will be carried out at the same time. This technical work is indispensable in order to avoid any delay in this area that could reduce the effectiveness of our action. </p>
<p class="contents">We are starting by closely following the document tabled previously, with firm proposals and also a sense that, after enlargement, we shall be faced with the real issue that must be carefully and attentively defined, with a very far-ranging debate – the nature and borders of Europe. Many of you have mentioned this, and I have already asked Parliament several times and I am repeating it again now: I think that, alongside the implementation of enlargement – which will definitely take place, since the enlargement process I hope we will decide on in Helsinki will have no room for doubts, problems or hesitation – we will have to open a debate on the nature and shape of Europe, since we are the ones who will have to shape these borders and decide on the nature of Europe. We cannot simply meet the requests of countries asking to join Europe, however legitimate. Where would these requests end? Why should countries in Asia, for example, not apply? We will nevertheless be the ones who decide. I could give you a whole list of countries which, basically, would be interested and eager to join Europe, thereby changing its very nature. Europe is not a customs agreement; it is not an area of free trade. Europe is a Union of countries, and indeed we have called it the European Union. It is clear, then, that together we must undertake major institutional reform so that we can make positive decisions, while pressing ahead with this debate on the borders and nature of Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would just like to add, in relation to the nuclear power stations, the efforts regarding the Balkans and the social and cultural questions that have been raised here, that we really have studied and analysed these matters thoroughly. Agreements are in place that lead should to a strategy being developed to close these plants, which will make things safe, while, at the same time, giving these countries the realistic chance to leave their problems behind together. This is what we are doing and we are therefore setting off for the Summit with a huge challenge and a complex agenda before us. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Parliament for the way that, in recent months, the Commission and Parliament have been able to act in unison as regards these issues. What we said on the first day we met still stands: our challenge is not one with zero gain but, by cooperation, both Parliament and the Commission will gain from it. Indeed, I believe that it is our responsibility to bring continuity to Europe’s development, the development of Europe in the long term, not just on a day by day basis. For this, I think that, apart from these areas, we will have to undertake a debate on tomorrow’s Europe, its borders and its nature, subjects which I have mentioned many times because I believe that this is a great task that we must perform together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since then, the Prime Minister of the country to hold the presidency has toured, and continues to tour, the Member States to ask for opinions with regard to this matter, prior to the Summit in Helsinki. Currently, opinions appear to differ. Some think this development should go further while others would keep the situation more or less as it is.
