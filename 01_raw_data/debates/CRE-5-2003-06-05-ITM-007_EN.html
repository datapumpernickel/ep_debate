<p class="contents">Indonesia is a world of many peoples, and, in geographical terms alone, it far exceeds any of our European dimensions. In that part of the world one cannot measure everything by the same yardstick. We have the problem that Aceh is an ancient historic Sultanate, which has had a significant cultural influence on the region. Aceh was a great seafaring nation. Aceh has also had a religious influence on the area. It was from there that Islam spread so extensively throughout Asia, and the island has developed a very strong and healthy sense of identity. In the colonial period, Aceh, like many other nations in this region, was simply brought into line with all the others and then, after decolonialisation, it became a part of the new artificial State of Indonesia.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we certainly do not want to call into question the integrity of this State of Indonesia, which, on economic and strategic grounds alone, is one of our most important and valuable partners. On the other hand, we have to look at the reality of the situation, and the reality is that in Indonesia they have made the mistake of trying to solve the problem of the over-populated islands of Bali, Java and Sumatra by coming up with what is known as the Transmigration Policy, in other words they have tried to resettle people from these islands on other islands with a different cultural and historical make-up, and to outvote other population groups, which has led to a whole range of ethnic and religious conflicts. These conflicts are not, as in the Moluccas, simply conflicts between Muslims and Christians, but in Aceh they are also between Muslims and Muslims, or between different ethnic groups.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason we must approach this subject with great caution. On the one hand we must demand, very clearly, an end to the use of force in Aceh and an end to the terrorist activities taking place in the region. On the other hand, however, we must also demand that the Government of Indonesia, which is our partner, meets its obligations, and that means fully implementing the autonomy arrangements for Aceh and ensuring that democracy and the rule of law prevail there, and that, above all, humanitarian organisations, international observers and the international media have access to the region. Indonesia should have nothing to hide; it is our partner. However, the way in which Indonesia deals with the self-aware Aceh province and its freedom is also an important criterion.</p>

People who wanted to stay together were split up because the areas they lived in were divided up between colonial occupiers. Conversely, people who would have liked to have had an independent state were allotted to large, powerful neighbours who wanted to conquer the areas they lived in. It is becoming difficult to change the way countries are divided up in a peaceful manner, particularly if oil or metals have been found in the ground in such areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Indonesia is a product of more than three centuries of Dutch colonialism. Five large islands and innumerable small ones were brought together under one administration in order to supply what the nineteenth century author Multatuli called a North Sea robber state with cheap raw materials and commodities. The two areas in which the Indonesian army is now trying to destroy separatist movements, Aceh on Northern Sumatra and West Papua, were the last to be added to the Dutch colonial empire. They were occupied by the Dutch colonial army as late as 1900, and this was preceded by a bloody war in Aceh.</p>
<p class="contents">The Netherlands had very little interest in the island of New Guinea, which was initially divided between the Netherlands, Germany and Great Britain and which was inhabited by Papuans whose way of life had not changed since ancient times, until Indonesia broke away from the Netherlands in the War of Independence. This was the last colonial foothold in Asia at the time. The Netherlands had to cede this territory 40 years ago under pressure from America, which was looking to establish good relations with Indonesia. The promised referendum for the residents about whether or not to join Indonesia never materialised.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1945 the Netherlands once again tried to divide Indonesia into an independent, densely-populated Java and a number of satellite states in the region linked to the Netherlands. Many Indonesians, and certainly their rulers and their military, still regard the fact that they made this split impossible as a great success. The powerful role of the Indonesian army, which has been guarding minerals and suppressing ethnic minorities for many years, can be explained by this, as can the long-standing occupation of the former Portuguese Timor and an earlier attempt to annex the former British Malaysia.</p>
<p class="contents">Indonesia’s current problems were caused by Europe and America. It is therefore a good thing that the European Parliament is concerning itself with these wrongs. Unlike in the past, this must not be done through military intervention from outside but through diplomatic, and, if necessary, economic pressure. In order to enable the Indonesian peoples to achieve democracy and self-determination, we must always take these causes and sensitivities on board. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proverbial Emerald Belt is threatening to crumble in its easternmost region, Papua, and in the west in Aceh. The countermeasures coming from Jakarta, particularly the military ones, are still producing a reverse effect. They are undermining the central authority’s promises of autonomy, both in Papua and in Aceh. This is encouraging dangerous radicalisation. Any escalation of the long-standing conflict between Jakarta and GAM rebels could create a new hotbed of international Islamic terrorism, particularly in Aceh, which has always been very passionate about its independence, as the Dutch know to their cost. This terrifying prospect should encourage Jakarta to act tactfully. The involvement of the outside world, the Commission and Council, is an absolute must. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Indonesia is one of the world’s largest countries, and has the unique feature of suffering not only from the problems arising from its geography and history and, in particular, from the process of decolonisation – to which Mr Meijer referred, and in which lies the root of the problems of the former sultanate of Aceh – but also from the problems posed by Indonesia’s brutal repression and dictatorship and by its expansionist approach, which led to the annexation of Irian Jaya and the military takeover of East Timor.</p>
<p class="contents">These two latter facts help us to understand the gravity and complexity of the situation facing that country today. The decolonisation of East Timor, which followed the fall of the Suharto dictatorship, represented an historic step in reversing both this internal expansionist intent, which was typical of Indonesia, and the attitude of the western world which had, by commission and by omission, supported the takeover of this small South-East Asian nation, which had only recently come into being.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, this was not a peaceful action and could only succeed because external military force was used, after the United Nations proved unable to deal with Indonesia’s armed response on its own. Having said this, and whilst acknowledging that we should not always declare ourselves against any armed action, all the evidence suggests, as indicated in our joint resolution, that we must do everything possible to bring this armed conflict to an end and to ensure that dialogue reopens between the Indonesian Government and the separatist movements in Aceh, as well as the representatives of Irian Jaya.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and above accepting responsibility for all measures necessary to re-establishing the ceasefire in Aceh and dialogue in Irian Jaya, we must also establish an external policy for Indonesia, based on respect for human rights, for minorities and for inter-ethnic and inter-religious dialogue. These principles must furthermore take precedence over geopolitical or economic considerations, which are always poor counsellors in these situations and which have provided such poor results in the past. These principles must also take precedence over determinist considerations such as territorial integrity or the right to self-determination, which are sometimes difficult to define at the outset. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That was the case under Dutch colonial rule, and that has actually never changed. For geographic, ethnic, religious and in particular economic reasons. Revenues from natural gas are an ongoing source of tension. Should this go to the Indonesian Government or to the military, the rebels or the inhabitants themselves? The population has been terrorised, both by the Indonesian military and by the GAM rebels, since 1976. From my own experience I know how dangerous it is just to travel from one place to another in this territory. Over the years, negotiations between the GAM and the Indonesian military have never delivered anything significant. The actual reason for this could well be that both parties have an interest in allowing this anarchistic situation to continue because they both earn well from it.</p>
<p class="contents">After the last negotiations failed, the Indonesian Government proceeded to launch a large-scale military offensive which could easily degenerate into terrible excesses on both sides. The Jakarta Government has sworn that it would respect human rights, but who is able to observe that in this mountainous jungle terrain? It is therefore of the utmost importance that international observers go to the area that is adequately protected by the military. The European Union must exert all possible pressure on both the Indonesian Government and on the GAM and urge them to arrive at a peaceful settlement with fair arrangements concerning the distribution of minerals. Military solutions have never lasted in Aceh.</p>
<p class="contents">It is particularly regrettable that Papua’s Special Autonomy Act has been withdrawn and has been replaced by a new law that divides the territory into three provinces. It finally seemed as if a solution had been reached which would make everybody happy and would guarantee stability. But Mrs Megawati has paid too much attention to the military and does not have the political courage to implement her own will. The Papuans no longer want to belong either as a result of this policy, and that cannot have been the intention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The war which is still continuing and which has been going on for the past 27 years in Aceh shows that the consequences of the colonial era are still having an impact today. We must convince the Indonesians that political solutions are the only way to settle these political conflicts. A concrete and clear weapons embargo on the Indonesian Government would be an initial step, but we must also be able to convince the Indonesian Government that a country with 150 million inhabitants and so many thousands of islands should not be governed as a unitary entity.</p>
<p class="contents">If there is a will for self-determination and autonomy, both in Aceh and amongst the Papuans, this must be taken into consideration. 12 000 victims in Aceh, cruelty on a daily basis, infringements of citizens’ rights, rapes, attacks on villages; this must be stopped and a political solution must be found. In Papua too, they must return to the solution that offers the prospect of autonomy. We are not in favour of separate states coming into being everywhere, but we cannot allow a disastrous centralism imposed against the will of the people and by military means to be the ultimate solution. This political issue must be resolved in a fair way, so that peace can prevail and so that the natural wealth that is present in such massive quantities can be extracted for the benefit of the entire population and with the participation of those who have been living there for centuries.</p>
<p class="contents">The West must not make itself an accessory to Indonesia’s military solutions, but must continue to press consistently for a political solution that offers the prospect of autonomy, even if it is within the framework of an Indonesian state. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The conflict has its origin in the fact that although the Sultanate of Aceh was never technically incorporated into the Dutch East Indies it was one of the territories handed over by Holland to Indonesia in 1949, following the UN-sponsored talks between Indonesia and the former colonial power. The Acehnese, although fellow Muslims, almost immediately began fighting for independence, and the province was given special status. The unrest is exacerbated by the Indonesian Government's exploitation of the province's gas and petroleum resources as well as the policy of transmigration which has seen many Javanese come to live and work in the province's coastal and industrial belts.</p>
<p class="contents">The earlier cease-fire, which was aimed in part, from the EU's point of view, at ensuring Indonesian support for the worldwide fight against terrorism, whilst protecting the human rights of the Acehnese, is clearly now defunct. President Megawati understandably wishes to prevent Indonesia falling apart. The army appears to have persuaded her, unwisely, that a military solution is possible. It is highly unlikely that the military option is the only one that will work in the long term. A political solution now needs to be found quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It must make clear to the security forces that any violations will not be tolerated and that perpetrators will be brought to justice. Both sides have to adhere to international human rights and humanitarian law – and be seen to adhere to them.</p>

<p class="contents">As far as Aceh is concerned, the Commission, together with the presidency, is one of the four co-Chairs of the Tokyo Conference (Japan, United States, European Union, World Bank). This Conference encouraged the signature of a cease-fire between the Indonesian Government and the Aceh rebels based – and I must stress this – on the territorial integrity of Indonesia.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cessation of Hostilities Agreement is the most comprehensive endeavour undertaken to resolve a conflict that has been going on for 26 years in which 12 000 have lost their lives, the majority of them innocent civilians.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, by way of its Rapid Reaction Mechanism, contributed EUR 2.3 million to the deployment of 50 international observers in the province of Aceh. Unfortunately, the situation on the ground has meanwhile changed dramatically.</p>
<p class="contents">On 17 and 18 May in Tokyo, the Commission, with the other co-Chairs, participated in extensive talks lasting 11 hours between the Indonesian Government and the GAM (Free Aceh Movement) in order to save the cease-fire, which was in a precarious situation. Unfortunately, the talks failed, which resulted in the Indonesian president imposing martial law and launching a widespread military operation.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, the Commission must confirm what the Members have said. The situation is very grave, the information we are receiving is more and more worrying and the human rights violations are extremely serious. We are also very concerned about the request to international and non-governmental aid organisations to leave the province and about the military censorship imposed on the press bodies covering the situation on the ground or reporting the events taking place in the province.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Commission is concerned, a military operation will not produce sustainable peace in Aceh, even if supposedly implemented with the best of intentions. We are therefore firmly convinced that the key to peace resides in good governance, justice, respect for human rights, the democratic process and development.</p>
<p class="contents">We take note of the statement by the Coordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs, Mr Yudhoyono, according to which his government will respect the Geneva Convention and humanitarian law in the province of Aceh. The international community will, however, have to call on the Indonesian Government to guarantee access to the province for NGOs and international humanitarian bodies and to guarantee their safety, as this is a vital precondition for the rapid and transparent provision of assistance, needed desperately by the citizens and the populations most affected.</p>
<p class="contents">We are convinced that the only possible option is to renew dialogue around a negotiating table. The statement by the Indonesian Government, in which it stresses that it is still open to talks, confirms our opinion. We therefore encourage the government and the GAM to propose as soon as possible a framework allowing for the resumption of these negotiations. Like the other advocates of this initiative, the Commission will always be available to facilitate this process by any means possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I am now coming to the second aspect of the parliamentary questions, namely the situation in Papua. You are no doubt aware that the Papuan Special Autonomy Law was passed by the Indonesian Parliament in 2001. In 2002, following the conclusions of a study carried out jointly by Indonesian and European experts, the Commission mobilised funds from its Rapid Reaction Mechanism to support the implementation of this law by the Indonesian authorities, making available to them an expert on decentralisation issues and Indonesia. I strongly support the fact that this initiative was based on the European Union’s strict respect for the territorial integrity of Indonesia and that it had received the full support and collaboration of the Indonesian authorities. Halfway through 2003, the Commission proposed technical assistance for the Provincial Government of Papua and the implementation of the Special Autonomy Law. The launch of this programme has not yet been approved by the Indonesian Government. The Commission hopes that this delay is due solely to technical reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of the Presidential Decree of 27 January 2003 creating three new provinces in Papua and the fact that the Indonesian Parliament, which must confirm the creation of these provinces, has not yet had its say on the matter. We are no less concerned about the consequences application of this decree could have on the implementation of the Special Autonomy Law for Papua. We are convinced that the path opened by the Special Law should be taken by the Indonesian authorities. The Commission calls on the Indonesian Government to implement the Special Law and maintains its offer of assistance in this framework. Similarly, the Commission reiterates its support for the territorial integrity of Indonesia and is mindful of respect for human rights in this province, as in all the other provinces of Indonesia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
