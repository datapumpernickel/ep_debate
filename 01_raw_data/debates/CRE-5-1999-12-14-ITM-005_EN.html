<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Siimes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council. </span>–<span class="italic"> (FI) </span>Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, it is a great pleasure and honour for me to present to you today the outcome of the second reading by the Council of the draft budget for 2000, which takes account of the amendments by the European Parliament. I would also like to take this opportunity to explain to you in more detail the Council’s proposal for financing aid to Kosovo in 2000. We know some of you still think that the financial perspectives for the period 2000 – 2006 are too tight and that the ceiling for category 4 is too low. We think, however, that the maximum figure is right for the year 2000, which is what we now have to decide on. For those unprecedented needs, which Kosovo has brought with it, the Council believes we can use an instrument of flexibility for the time being. We understand very well the concern Parliament feels about this year’s budgetary procedure. I believe, however, that our common goal is to give the people of Kosovo the aid they urgently require without any undue delay. Our common goal at the same time is to preserve aid for other recipients, above all the poorest countries in the world. For that reason, we have been inclined to refer to our original position to a large extent.</p>
<p class="contents">One benefit of the new interinstitutional agreement is the opportunity it gives for an extended conciliation procedure, as a result of which Parliament has had many opportunities to set forth its views and, correspondingly, hear the views of others. We were often in touch with MEPs, especially Mr Wynn, Mr Bourlanges and Mr Colom i Naval in order to find a balanced solution to the issue of conciliation, which would make it possible for us to enjoy a stable economic policy in 2000, one which will help to preserve a good spirit of interinstitutional cooperation in the years to come as well. Now that these contacts have been established the Council is ready to fully adopt a flexibility clause. It is precisely in this way that an interinstitutional agreement offers the opportunity to adapt the financial perspectives in unexpected circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is also prepared to adopt the recitals and statements, which are an essential part of the conciliation package and which leave scope for negotiation, which we will be entering into next year regarding category 4 financing, such as that which affects the Western Balkans. We do not think, however, that the ceiling for category 4 would need to be amended permanently, but rather by means of a flexibility instrument. The main reason for that is that Kosovo, which has fewer than two million inhabitants, can accept and use only a limited amount of aid properly, which is a lot less than what was originally anticipated.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council agrees with the European Parliament that appropriations, which are to be granted to Kosovo for the year 2000, are much less than what the Commission originally asked for. However, as the total needed for 2000 is relatively small, i.e. considerably less than the EUR 400 million from the budget, which in itself is worth a good EUR 90 billion or more, and because it has not yet been possible for the Commission to determine the requirements for every year after 2000, there is clearly no technical need at the moment for permanently amending the financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also believes that the institutions of the European Union require a certain amount of stability and seriousness to maintain their credibility. Any breach of the agreement we sign or any adjustment made to it would immediately cause irrevocable damage to the Community’s external image and its reputation. We must show that we leaders of the European Union are engaged in serious work, that we take prudent decisions after they have been carefully planned and discussed, and that we keep to these decisions and our agreements afterwards.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to explain to you in slightly more detail what the Council’s proposal regarding category 4 contains and why it meets the demands of the European Parliament in terms of financing. The first benefit of the package the Council is proposing is that it offers ways and means to finance aid to Kosovo and East Timor in concrete terms, without it being at the expense of any other recipient of aid. I know that it goes against all the rules of rhetoric to mention figures, but at this stage I also have to do just that. We have proceeded in such a way as to establish the budget for 2000, and, unfortunately, the budget is simply about figures.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament and the Council agree that EUR 360 million in aid should go to Kosovo in 2000. The Commission has told us that we could transfer EUR 60 million out of the budget funds for 1999, for use in 2000. This means that we have EUR 300 million in aid to Kosovo to charge to the 2000 budget. EUR 60 million from the Obnova programme and EUR 20 million from the ECHO programme was already included in your first reading, however, and that would be used for Kosovo in any case. We accept that EUR 40 million can in addition be used from transfers in 2000. We also know that the European Parliament wishes to grant EUR 20 million in aid to East Timor. 180 and 20 make 200. This is precisely the sum the Council proposed should be spent in connection with the flexibility instrument in addition to the ceiling allowed for category 4 in the financial perspectives. In other words the Council is proposing to pay for all these new funds itself, funds that are needed in their entirety for vital aid to Kosovo and East Timor in 2000, as far as exceeding the current ceiling in the financial perspectives is concerned. In this way, there would not be any need for the retargeting of appropriations or cuts in aid to other recipients. This was one of the wishes of the European Parliament, and the Council is proposing to fulfil this wish in its entirety.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the current aim is just to draft the budget for 2000, the Commission has already said in a statement published in the Official Journal of the European Communities regarding next year that it intends to propose an aid programme by April 2000 for the Western Balkans for the period 2000 – 2006 in connection with a proposal for an amendment to the financial perspectives. The European Parliament and the Council agree in another statement that such a multiannual programme should be drafted. At present such a programme has not been proposed, however. For that reason, we can for now only deal with the programme for 2000, which is urgent, and examine the Commission’s proposals next year, when they are known.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has repeatedly said it considers cooperation with the European Parliament to be very important when the budget is being drafted. This has not been just an empty declaration, but it has also had practical consequences. The Council adopted, for example, almost all the European Parliament’s amendments relating to administrative expenditure, many of which concerned internal policies, which we know are of special interest to you. We likewise approved the sums that Parliament added to such programmes as Socrates, Leonardo, equality between women and men, Altener, Synergy, Life and all the action programmes in the areas of health and research, and many others. The Council also adopted the new policy for clearly determining the administrative costs of action programmes and monitoring offices concerned with technical assistance. This was also one of the priority aims of the European Parliament this year. The Council furthermore approved the increase of EUR 50 million in appropriations for food safety that Parliament held to be important.</p>
<p class="contents">Then I would like to mention OLAF, the European Fraud Prevention Office, as an example of where interinstitutional cooperation can lead. The regulations and the whole legal framework in general for establishing OLAF, despite the complexity of the operation, became, thanks to the close cooperation between the Parliament and the Council, the first codecision procedure to reach a decision on one reading, and, in addition, in a record time of five months. In addition to this – also thanks to close cooperation between Parliament and the Council – additional budgets 4 and 5 were promptly adopted in 1999, and the letter of amendment 2 for the 2000 budget is now about to be adopted. All this will allow us to almost double the OLAF staff within a year. Finally, the European Parliament and the Council seem to have reached agreement today on a new OLAF director, as a result of which OLAF will become fully capable of fulfilling its functions.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that the path of solitude, and the apparent freedom it offers, might seem more alluring sometimes than the obligations that cooperation imposes. However, we believe that through strategies of cooperation we can usually achieve better results for the Community as a whole and that they are more beneficial to each party involved than aggressive strategies. The Council is thus offering its cooperation as a means of financing aid to Kosovo and East Timor in 2000. This will mean the urgently needed substantial sums will go to Kosovo and East Timor without any unwarranted delays. This proposal means these needs will be financed entirely by means of the flexibility instrument as far as exceeding the current ceiling in the financial perspectives is concerned, without taking funds away from any other areas. The Council is also prepared for a solution where payment appropriations may be cut by EUR 2 billion by combining compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure. The Council has thus shown it is willing to accept the wishes of Parliament by adopting the new amendments, which are important to you, and by making this proposition concerning Kosovo and East Timor, in which we have tried very hard to take account of your concerns. The Council therefore hopes that the European Parliament will make its decision on the budget on the basis of the Council’s proposal.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We voted on the first reading three months ago. We negotiated assiduously in the various fora. The Commission produced its rectifying letter, the Council voted for the budget at its second reading and the Committee on Budgets last week adopted its own second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">All the discussions should have been completed. We were supposed to proceed to the vote on Thursday but, apparently, now that everything is ready to go ahead, the Council is continually determining its position. I say “determining its position” but this is really just an expression, as in fact it is changing it imperceptibly. This is in the domain of what Jean Paulhan, the noted French writer, used to call “Progress in Love on the Slow Side”, the title of a very interesting book which I recommend. Progress in these matters is on the slow side, apparently, and still remains to be completed. We are waiting for progress with an impatience which is becoming truly alarming, for we do not understand why the Council has, for weeks, been incapable of saying clearly exactly what it is prepared to accept or not. </p>
<p class="contents">We see this prevarication as the evidence of the increasing worrying paralysis of this institution, witness the report I made last year on the operational problems of the Council. We experienced this in some conciliation meetings which were considered highly traumatic by the majority of my fellow Members, less seasoned in battle than Mr Wynn, myself or Mr Colom i Naval, who are familiar with this type of thing and who know it is never very easy. The fact is, the conciliation procedure has been extremely tough and, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, you yourself adopted some overly rash positions.</p>
<p class="contents">So, what is the position? I have no idea! This evening a three-way dialogue is to take place. Will you be making proposals to us? I do not see how you can make proposals today if you were unable to make them yesterday, or last Wednesday, or a fortnight ago, but perhaps you possess the secret of modifying the views of your members?</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, what is the position of Parliament? What are we looking to achieve through the compromise? Well, we are after five things. Firstly, the second reading vote should be as close as possible to the first reading vote in Parliament. Our vote reflected our political orientation. What is the state of play? The various scenarios in this regard are satisfactory. In the initial phase of the procedure, we received a proposal for a reduction of approximately EUR 500 million from category 4 in relation to the preliminary draft budget. In the compromise we voted on, we have a reduction of only EUR 150 million, not in relation to the PDB but in relation to our vote at first reading. As far as the remainder is concerned, i.e. categories 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7, nothing has been changed. One might safely say that Parliament has been satisfied on this point, subject of course to resolution of the Kosovo issue, which I shall return to.</p>
<p class="contents">As the President-in-Office of the Council mentioned, the major commitments which we had, regarding the Fisheries Agreement, Timor and Turkey, have also been taken into consideration, which, again, is satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second objective was to have Kosovo financed at a level above the ceiling of heading 4. As it happens, after a difficult beginning, we consider that the proposal to use the flexibility clause, although not the most suitable instrument, intended to provide financial aid for Kosovo of EUR 200 million above the category is satisfactory in itself, and indeed enables us, if we are in agreement as to the remainder, to have a satisfactory approach to providing financial aid for Kosovo for the year concerned. I note, moreover, that the final proposal is even higher than the initial proposals of the Commission, which it should be aware of.</p>
<p class="contents">Our third objective was the review of the financial perspectives beyond the financial year 2000. Our success in this respect has been much more limited and, in my opinion, extremely uncertain. We have here a commitment which has two negative aspects in relation to what we actually wanted: firstly, the review is to concern just the Balkans as a whole, whereas we consider that it is the Kosovo issue which justifies it and, secondly, this commitment is a conditional one. The amounts of the appropriations allocated to the Balkans, resulting from the estimates made by the Commission and accepted by the Council, should be markedly higher than those in existing programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">I am afraid that in fact, in the mind of the Council, review of the financial perspectives might be centred on the disappearance of Comrade Milosevic. I find this point of view worrying for, when I see what has happened to Saddam Hussein, I think that dictators sometimes have a longer lifetime than might be desirable. So, the question remains.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, our fourth objective: we wanted the measures undertaken on behalf of the Balkans to be based on a serious, multiannual and binding estimate of needs. In that respect, we are far short of the target. It was indeed sufficient to hear the speech of the President-in-Office of the Council just now. She had a fear and dread of quoting figures and was speaking a language which seemed to have gone through some double translation process, ensuring that no one could understand a word in the end.</p>
<p class="contents">But in any case, this dancing around the figures spoke volumes and indicated that we are in fact building on a rather unsatisfactory foundation. The estimates are not serious ones. We have gone from EUR 500 million, a figure adopted chiefly for the number of zeros in it and its ease of pronunciation. Next, everyone, except ourselves, started making estimates, saying: let us take away EUR 140 million, put humanitarian aid to one side, add the accounts, etc, and suddenly coming up with the figures required. The fact is there has been no serious estimate of needs founded on a clear distinction between the measures necessary for the repair of war damage, for the modernisation of the country and for the modernisation of its society. </p>
<p class="contents">We were awaiting serious commitments, multiannual commitments, binding commitments. In this respect, the compromise is not satisfactory, in my opinion, if not in the opinion of all the members of the Committee on Budgets. Finally, the terms of the compromise were for a moderate reduction of payment appropriations. If we had had recourse to Article 272, then we should have had to make savings of 2.8 billion from the non-compulsory expenditure. Obviously, this was the reason we rejected this prospect, so as not to make cuts as extensive as this.</p>
<p class="contents">Such were the terms of the compromise. To assess the results, we are satisfied on two counts. We are only partly satisfied as to the review, not satisfied at all regarding the estimate of needs in Kosovo, and may or may not be satisfied regarding the reduction of payment appropriations, a matter on which I hope you will change position.</p>
<p class="contents">What are we going to do now? What is our scenario? In my opinion, the compromise is not acceptable, chiefly due to the inadequate estimates for Kosovo, which mean that we are acting irresponsibly, squandering taxpayers’ money. This is why, as far as I am concerned, whatever the decision of the Committee on Budgets, if we were to go once again to a compromise, then I should abstain on this budget. As far as my fellow committee members are concerned, the main thing is to reduce payment appropriations. Will it be done? Will you do it? I have no idea. We shall see what you are prepared to say shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">What we voted on within the Committee on Budgets, and what we have proposed to you, is simple. Firstly, we shall not resort to Article 272, to prevent our strangulation on the matter of payment. Secondly, we shall take category 4 up to the maximum limit. Without financing Kosovo, except in the amount of EUR 115 million, by adding the accounts which are presented, i.e. with Mr Mingasson and Mrs Schreyer acting as treasurer, on a monthly basis. We are acting as treasurer for Kosovo, on a monthly basis we are giving them the means to pay for the things they have to have done and we are awaiting a serious, overall estimate of needs in Kosovo and in the Balkans. And then we reconvene together with the Council and the Commission to finally discuss the key issues, i.e. a satisfactory estimate for Kosovo, an overall estimate for the Balkans and then a review of the financial perspectives, a satisfactory estimate for the Balkans. This is what we are doing. It is not a war plan, it is a plan for cooperation. We need another three months to be able to get estimates which are satisfactory onto the table, and then we shall reconvene. </p>
<p class="contents">This is the scenario we envisage. Madam, do not take it as a declaration of war, but if you respond to our vote in the same way that the Marquise de Merteuil responded to the Vicomte de Valmont in “Dangerous Liaisons”, well then, this war is not one that we would wish but it is one that we would see through. In that case we would have recourse to Article 272 on reasonable grounds regarding 2001. But this is not the scenario we envisage. We are offering you a scenario of cooperation with an agreement which has been postponed for a few months, and in any case with the certainty, for the Commission, that Kosovo will receive the necessary financial aid. Thank you, Mr President, for your indulgence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Virrankoski (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>–<span class="italic"> (FI)</span> Mr President, the budget for the year 2000 is, for the institutions other than the Commission, very simple. The Council has adopted all of Parliament’s amendments. It has also given its approval to Parliament’s own budget through a gentlemen’s agreement, which means they have not interfered in it at all. I would like to express my sincerest thanks for that.</p>
<p class="contents">In the reading of next year’s budget, however, a position has to be taken on the change which was not in the original estimate. I refer to the situation which was caused by the fact that the Court of First Instance approved the TDI group as a parliamentary political group. According to parliamentary rules, this group has the right to a staff of 14. The Secretary-General obtained the staffing resources by reallocating twelve of the fourteen staff necessary. To make good the difference the Council of Presidents finally proposed two new temporary C5 posts and one A6 post. So that this issue would be debated according to Parliament’s agenda, the Committee on Budgets called for compliance with Article 183. The President sent a preliminary draft for the budget, which the Committee debated yesterday and adopted by virtue of the report on the proposal. This report is now being debated in connection with next year’s budget, and we intend to vote on it tomorrow, Wednesday, when it is hoped the Commission will also present its preliminary letter of amendment in accordance with practice. In this way the Council could debate and approve these matters on Wednesday, so that the issue might be dealt with in connection with the rest of the budget on Thursday 16 December.</p>
<p class="contents">What has happened does not mean that more money is being asked for next year’s budget, but only to create posts. However, it shows how ponderous and cumbersome our administrative procedures are. There is a total of 1700 different C posts in the European Parliament. Of these, some are vacant and some are to become so. For that reason, it is urgent that we make the current administrative rules in Parliament more flexible, as they hamper the smooth and proper flow of administration. The European Parliament is now adding new posts in connection with the budget now being discussed, which is not consistent with disciplined financial administration – not, at least, if we compare the additions to those in the previous five years. We cannot nor must not, however, leave disciplined budgetary policy to the responsibility of the Committee on Budgets: it is naturally the Council of Presidents and the chairmen of the political groups that bear the greatest responsibility, especially where Parliament is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I would like to say a few words in general about budgetary procedure. The biggest problem this year was category 4: external action. During the debate new items of expenditure were added to it. First there was the EUR 500 million proposed by the European Union Summit conference for Kosovo. Then, later, we had the fisheries agreement with Morocco; and then Turkey and other headings totalling 190 million euros or nearly EUR 700 million altogether, which represents 15% of the financial perspectives. As the budget for 1999 had already very nearly reached its ceiling, it was really quite difficult to suppose that such great degrees of flexibility might be found in other areas of expenditure. Among the members of the Council there had been no desire to alter the financial perspectives, at least up till now, and then not even now, not even by means of transfers between categories. Furthermore, as a counterweight to the use of the flexibility instrument, immense reductions in other areas of expenditure were being and are being asked for. Thus, the task of the Committee on Budgets was a very simple one: to adapt the budget to the financial perspectives. As a result, only EUR 100 million were allocated to Kosovo in the budget at this stage. The Council dropped its earlier estimate of EUR 500 million to 360 million. From this we may draw at least two conclusions. Before aid is promised in the name of the European Union, it would perhaps be in order to check whether the promises can be kept. Such promises, which mean making corresponding cuts elsewhere, have clearly to be considered carefully. The same also goes for long-term programmes. If the EU means to spend EUR 5.5 billion on the reconstruction of the whole Balkans area over the next six or seven years, which is to say EUR 800 – 900 million a year, it would be useful to know how the promise is going to be backed in terms of finance. In this respect, the report by the Committee on Budgets now under discussion is relevant, as it emphasises the need to be realistic.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Union has two budgetary authorities, Parliament being one of them. Parliament has not accepted this duty and these obligations: the Member States have imposed them. As Parliament is one of the budgetary authorities, it also bears a responsibility, and this is a fact that cannot be ignored in the workings of the EU. During the last few days and weeks, the negotiations have been – at least in my view – talk about very minor matters, as nearly each one of the finance ministers of the Member States and even their state secretaries handle certainly much larger sums on their own. In so saying, I do not want to criticise the country holding the presidency, which has certainly done everything necessary to achieve harmony. We need a budget for next year, and it must be achieved. If we do not get agreement we will have to continue the talks in January.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to congratulate the main rapporteur, Jean-Louis Bourlanges, for his excellent work, which is obviously still continuing, and thank him and the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Terence Wynn, for their good and constructive cooperation and the diverse range of support they gave. Likewise, I wish to thank the group’s coordinators, especially Mr Böge of the PPE-DE Group and Mr Walter of the PSE Group for their good cooperation, and all the members of the committee. My special thanks go to Suvi-Anne Siimes, for her role as person responsible for the Council’s budget, and who has really got to grips with her job and applied herself to it conscientiously. I would like to especially thank Heikki Joustie, who was involved as official representative, and who made his own splendid contribution in circumstances that were unusually awkward as far as the international situation was concerned.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Madam Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the results of the Helsinki Summit were presented and debated this morning. The decisions to come out of Helsinki have far-reaching consequences for the future of the Union, namely the resolutions on the enlargement strategy, on the intergovernmental conference and on the common foreign and security policy. The Finnish Presidency dealt with a huge agenda; the Summit was a success, a good conclusion to 1999 and, with the Millennium Declaration, a good start for the future. It would be therefore be a great pity if we were unable to announce a satisfactory conclusion to the budgetary procedure. The new budget for 2000 will serve as a clear basis for sound policies. The budgetary procedure has involved difficult negotiations but I have no intention of reviewing the entire process. We have now reached the point where there is fundamental agreement on fundamental points. The Council and Parliament have agreed, as Minister Siimes has just explained, that the entire flexibility reserve may be used for financing expenditure on Kosovo. Most importantly, it has been agreed – and this was particularly important to Parliament, quite rightly, in my view – that an important political statement is being made, namely that the tasks of the European Union in Kosovo and in the Balkans are tasks which extend over several years and that, in order to honour these tasks financially, we may need to increase expenditure on foreign policy in comparison with the expenditure forecast at the beginning of this year, when we based our assessment on a somewhat different political situation. In order to be able to finance these additional requirements over coming years and, above all, in order to remain within the overall framework decided in Berlin for coming years, the financial perspective may need to be changed or reviewed. It is precisely the combination of new priorities, together with budgetary discipline, which may mean that we need to change the financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">At present the Commission – and this has been stressed here – is unable to submit the exact financing requirements for the Balkans as a whole. The Commission, my colleague Mr Patten in particular, and the administration are still hard at work on this. However, the World Bank and the Commission have produced a very accurate study of reconstruction in Kosovo, which shows that a total of 2.3 billion dollars or euros will be needed in external aid over the next few years to repair not only war damage but the cumulative damage which has arisen as a result of the fact that the political situation in Kosovo over recent years has led to a disaster in human terms. There is an immediate need for a large sum of money, because we cannot in fact say that rebuilding houses or restoring schools and the power supply is a task for tomorrow. No, it is a task for today. There is an urgent need, and I hope that we are still able to find a solution which does not put these needs off until tomorrow but tackles them today.</p>
<p class="contents">Agreement has been reached on entering EUR 300 million under the budget for the year 2000, in addition to the EUR 60 million redeployed from this year, and on considering the EUR 140 million granted at the donor conference as part of the funds promised for the year 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">Important decisions were also taken at Helsinki on the enlargement of the European Union. Negotiations with the six candidate States are continuing and negotiations with six new candidate States have commenced. The budget includes pre-accession aid which will rise from EUR 1.3 billion this year to EUR 3.1 billion next year. New programmes are being funded in agriculture, infrastructure aid and transport and the environment, thereby paving the way for the candidate countries to join the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The deployment of these appropriations will be very closely observed by my services in the form of financial control. The financial control system forms a separate chapter in the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to be able to estimate expenditure which may accrue for enlargement – the Berlin financial framework includes expenditure from 2000 onwards –, I shall suggest to the Commission that there be permanent screening of the economic situation and the enlargement expenditure needed as a result. The peoples of the Member States must also be clear that enlargement is not a financial roller coaster.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget 2000 includes EUR 32 billion in commitments to support structural policy in the Member States. The new programming period for 2000 to 2006 can therefore start being funded and it is starting with a new programme which emphasises that aid from the structural funds should, at the same time, help to improve gender equality, environmental protection and the employment situation. I can assure you that we shall remind Member States quite clearly of their duty to deploy the appropriations so that these objectives can be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget 2000 includes EUR 41 billion for agricultural policy. I should like to draw attention to the appropriations deployed for the second pillar of agricultural policy, namely for programmes to promote rural development. The European Parliament fought intensively for this second pillar of the agricultural policy. I shall do my very best to ensure that the programmes in this area get off to a good start.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to mention that the number of posts at the anti-fraud office will be increased under budget 2000 – this has already been mentioned – so that the OLAF is equipped to carry out its task.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to stress – and the credit here goes in particular to the rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges – that the Commission is to examine its entire system for outsourcing activities to Technical Assistance Offices. More importantly, Mr Bourlanges has proposed that a new administrative unit be set up which is similar in structure to the agencies. The Commission has agreed on a timetable for reforming the system used hitherto.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like at this point to extend my warmest thanks to the rapporteurs, Messrs Bourlanges, Virrankoski and Colom i Naval – even if your report has not been tabled for discussion today – and, above all, to the chairman and members of the Committee on Budgets for their intensive work over recent months.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to thank the Council and to congratulate you, Minister Siimes, on your Finnish Presidency of the Council. I understand that you proposed a solution to the final differences between the Council and the European Parliament in the overall process, namely that payment appropriations be reduced by EUR 2 billion. I think that this should be stressed here once again.</p>
<p class="contents">The strength of the European institutions lies in finding compromises and in forging compromises. The negotiations were long, but we are now at the point at which agreement can be reached. It is now a question of seizing the opportunity to get the budget 2000 and the new year off to a good start and I urge Parliament to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At this moment I can only give two cheers for her statement because I do not understand what she said as regards Heading 4. She said that the Council does not want the ceiling for Heading 4 to be amended permanently. Does that mean therefore that we will continue to operate Heading 4 on an ad hoc basis, that we will use a flexibility clause every year and therefore have a pretence that we have no change to the financial perspective when the reality is of course different? I would advise caution in this case because, as Mr Bourlanges has said, we are dealing with an unpredictable situation in the Balkans, not only in relation to Mr Milosevic but also the death of Mr Tudjman. These events raise questions about the long-term feasibility of the course we are pursuing at the moment. I would like some clarification on that point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But let us not forget why the Commission was forced to resign: fraud and mismanagement, those were the main points. That is why this year's budget really had to reflect the need to tighten up procedures for budget control; and as the rapporteur for the 2000 budget, and on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I would like to welcome once again the establishment of the new body to fight fraud and the new OLAF posts reflected in this year's budget. The process of appointing the OLAF director is now well advanced. The Committee on Budgetary Control held hearings with the candidates and produced a shortlist of three people, and I understand that tonight there will be a meeting to try to thrash out a decision between the representatives of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that the technical assistance offices were also a big problem in the forced resignation of the Commission. The Commission's strategic issues paper adopted on 10 December concluded that core public service tasks should not be outsourced and that the Commission should have at its disposal a much more flexible set of arrangements for non-core public service tasks. That is something with which I wholeheartedly agree. The Commission now performs such a wide variety of diverse functions that non-core public service tasks could be carried out in very many different ways. There is no point in having a one-size-fits-all model for carrying out such tasks. What we need to do is to reform the Staff Regulations so we can have flexibility in hiring contractual staff to service these offices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must say that the budget which has now been tabled is indeed a social budget because this time, with our corrections, it takes clear account of employment policy measures. This means that anyone who wants action in favour of families, anyone who wants young trainees to be able to gain experience abroad and anyone who really wants to combat social exclusion will vote in favour of our proposed amendments the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who wants the European employment strategy to be paid more than lip service and to be more than an item on Summit agendas but who wants the European employment strategy to be anchored at local level will vote, I am sure, in favour of our new employment policy initiatives. A social Europe also has strong trade union and employer associations in permanent dialogue with each other. It is never too early to start exporting this model of success to Central and Eastern Europe. Which is why we have reversed the Council’s cutbacks here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As someone who was responsible for the budget on behalf of the Committee on Environment for the first time, I found him very helpful and very considerate of the points I made – not agreeing with everything but nevertheless being very fair-minded.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to welcome the decisions taken by the Council and the Commission. The decision with regard to the money for Kosovo is helpful and their other agreements have, generally speaking, made the Committee on the Environment relatively happy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad Mrs Schreyer mentioned earlier the additional monies for the Veterinary Office which are particularly important if we want them to deal with the problems that have arisen because of the BSE crisis, the dioxin crisis in Belgium and of course the continued work in Portugal. That money is necessary and we are very pleased that you agreed to it.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of health, we have had some very small and moderate improvements. The budget headings for the Committee on the Environment generally concern very small amounts but they have enabled us to start the preparatory research that will help us develop the issue of health competence under the Amsterdam Treaty. The sum involved is small but it is important.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards consumers, there we are pleased to see that the agreement reached on the Whitehead report and the conciliation on the Whitehead report last year has been honoured and the money will come through. We are looking forward to that bringing general benefits in the coming year.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the area of the environment, the most important outstanding measure of course is the Lienemann report and the conciliation on LIFE and we are optimistic that we will get a reasonable result there.</p>
<p class="contents">I would however make one final plea. The question of the money for the drugs agency is urgent now that we will approve the orphan drugs regulation in February. Something must be done quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, we would highlight their attempt to restore the cuts in the INTERREG programme by some EUR 33 million in the payments, restoring that heading to the budget. Thirdly, we would thank them for their efforts to restore the unacceptable cuts in the transport safety heading; we welcome the progress made there. Fourthly and finally, we welcome progress in restoring the cuts in the environmentally sustainable transport heading. We endorse all their efforts so far and would also add our backing to their insistence that 20% of the payment appropriations go into reserve for the Community INTERREG and URBAN initiatives, pending the satisfactory adoption of the guidelines.</p>

I have time to make only two points. One is regularly made: culture and education are important for Europe, not just for the past but for the future of our continent. We neglect them at our peril and, by continuing year after year to spend less on our cultural and educational programmes than we spend on growing tobacco, we are not just neglecting them, we are turning our priorities completely upside down. With so little to spend, it is important that we spend it efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, are you aware that today, 14 December 1999, the European Youth Orchestra, the European Youth Parliament, the Yehudi Menuhin Foundation, to name just three, are yet to receive the subsidies that we voted for them for this year? They are told the cheques are in the post. I am afraid their bank managers are not so ready to accept that excuse. Much is promised but, sadly, not a lot of it is delivered. This is a comment that I think applies just a shade too often where Europe is concerned. I urge the Commissioner never to let this happen again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It makes it possible to release EUR 115 million to finance Kosovo, while waiting for a realistic evaluation of requirements, covered, if necessary, by the vote on a SAB next spring, and this is no bad thing.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also had to effect savings of EUR 150 million, i.e. further budget cuts to the lines of heading 4 in order to finance new priorities: Timor, Turkey and the Fisheries Agreement with Morocco, which are not in the exclusive domain of external action of the Union, but which we have accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be pointed out that these are heavy sacrifices, especially since this proposal envisages taking EUR 35 million out of ECHO appropriations, a deduction which is presented as a loan, one whose repayment seems highly uncertain. Nonetheless we shall be fighting for that.</p>
<p class="contents">So, of course I support your proposal but, as you will understand, I support it without enthusiasm. I simply wish to express, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, my concern regarding this budget 2000 which, if the financial perspectives are not reviewed, places the burden of all the sacrifices on the poorest countries.</p>
