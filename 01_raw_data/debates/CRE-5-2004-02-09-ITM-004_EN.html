<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Katiforis (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, the report I have the honour of presenting is an own-initiative report on credit rating agencies, which are business organisations of good standing in the markets. However, their reputation has been shaken somewhat by the recent spate of financial scandals, starting with Enron and ending with Parmalat. The Parmalat fraud is especially relevant as it concerns bondholders: precisely the section of the market that rating agencies are supposed to protect. Until a few days before the crash of these companies, they were unable to do anything about protecting the public. These failures have prompted debates in the United States, investigations in the US Congress, the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the International Organization of Securities Commission and other international fora.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a specific European angle on this matter. Rating agencies that are one hundred years old in the United States are relative newcomers in Europe. In some cases they have given indications of not understanding European business mentality. They have created friction, especially in Germany. The other point of special European interest is the inevitable remark that whatever the nature of the regulation of the agencies – however mild and indirect – it has its seat exclusively in the United States, in the form of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The fact that nothing similar exists in Europe makes for an unbalanced transatlantic relationship which might become troublesome if it is not redressed in time.</p>
<p class="contents">These considerations prompted the original proposal of the report in favour of the formation of a European registration authority to be considered by the Commission, an authority to which agencies would report on their activities and with which they could establish a regulatory dialogue, a dialogue of equals based on the European Security Ratings Committee, on topics of mutual interest – excluding, of course, any intervention in the substance of the opinions issued by the agencies. It is interesting that the Securities and Exchange Commission has recently expressed interest in making contact with the CSR on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs found this proposal too <span class="italic">avant-garde</span> and recommended re-examining the whole area of operations of rating agencies without including in their recommendation anything as specific as the creation of a European registration authority. With all due respect for the majority opinion of my colleagues, I beg to differ for two reasons. Firstly, because a regulatory authority operates in the United States and, secondly, because – as I have already said – the lack of a corresponding authority in Europe creates a potentially harmful imbalance.</p>
<p class="contents">I have therefore asked my political group to help me out by resubmitting the proposal for a European registration agency in the form of an amendment, and I urge all colleagues who originally may have differed on this point to think again. This is not a party political issue, but it is certainly a political issue because it involves the interests of Europe as a whole. The alternative is that the agencies will eventually – such is the strength of feeling in favour of some regulation of their activities – be forced to report to 15 or 25 national financial authorities in Europe, something the agencies themselves must view with horror.</p>
<p class="contents">Rating agencies must continue to do good work. We have proposed no heavy-handed regulation, but, without a European registration agency, we will be failing to attain what is obviously our main objective. While thanking my colleagues for supporting various other useful proposals, I urge them to think again about this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the European Commission welcomes the European Parliament's decision to draw up a report on the role and methods of rating agencies. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his initiative, which is timely.</p>
<p class="contents">As you all know, the role of rating agencies is increasing nowadays. In the past, credit ratings focused mainly on sovereign debt. However, in the last decade, the role of credit ratings has become ever more crucial, with the growth of corporate bond issuances and the inclusion of references to credit ratings in several pieces of financial legislation, including banking legislation. Besides, as everybody knows, recent major scandals have raised questions on the role of rating agencies in general: we cannot forget the Enron case in 2001, or the recent Parmalat case, among others. Therefore, it is clear that it is now time to take action, as Mr Katiforis rightly pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">There are at least four issues to be resolved regarding credit rating agencies. First, the legal treatment of the question of access by rating agencies to inside information from issuers is currently unclear in Europe. There is no harmonised European legislation, nor even any regulation at national level. If rating agencies are to have access to inside information from issuers, we should ensure that the same information is available to all rating agencies. I think Mr Katiforis’ report reflects this. Another solution would be to prohibit rating agencies from access to inside information from issuers, as is done in the case of financial analysts.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue regarding credit rating agencies in the context of Enron and Parmalat concerns the level of skill of agency staff, as well as the transparency of their methodology. It would be sensible to think about measures to tackle this issue and we clearly agree with Mr Katiforis on this. With this is mind, a directive adopted by the Commission last December, implementing the Market Abuse Directive as regards fair presentation of investment recommendations, could be a good starting point.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue commonly raised is the lack of competition among credit rating agencies. In practice, the worldwide industry is nearly an oligopoly. We therefore welcome Mr Katiforis' call to promote more competition in Europe. The establishment of objective criteria for entrance or development of other players in the industry might help.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth and last issue, probably the most debated, regards conflicts of interest for credit rating agencies and these take two different forms. On the one hand, there is a suspicion that the provision of advisory services by rating agencies to companies they rate might influence the outcome of the rating process. Therefore, such advisory services should be disclosed along with the rating. Once again, the directive adopted by the Commission last December, implementing the Market Abuse Directive as regards disclosure of conflicts of interest, could be a good starting point to tackle this question. The second conflict of interest, and the most controversial, relates to the remuneration of rating agencies by the companies they rate. If the rating agency is paid by an issuer, rather than by subscribers, it casts doubts regarding the possibility of 'downgrade rigidity' when ratings are updated. This question is not new but now needs to be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to take action fast on these four issues. The European Commission committed itself to that at the Oviedo European Council in April 2002. We have to respect our commitment before new scandals occur. The European Commission will thus be able to take a position on the subject by the summer or autumn of 2004 at the latest. Among other contributions, Mr Katiforis’ report will be an important element to guide us.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the question remains of what the United States is going to do on this matter. We must be realistic. The top two worldwide rating agencies are American. It would be reasonable to take this into account, as Mr Katiforis rightly stressed. For the moment, however, the American Securities and Exchange Commission is silent on the subject, despite calls for changes from Congress. If the United States wants to achieve convergence with us before we adopt a position, we would appreciate having a clear view from its side on this crucial topic quickly. We will keep you informed in due course. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Radwan (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, and Mr Katiforis, whom, for a start, I warmly thank for the report on the future assessment of rating agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">What is this actually about? It is a fact that rating agencies have, in the capital market, a very great deal of power and influence over enterprises. Upgrading or – in particular – downgrading is significant for an enterprise, in that it makes for major problems with the raising of capital, financial problems, and that does of course have indirect effects on jobs. Rating agencies, though, also assess countries; in Germany, for example, they assess the Federal states. It follows that the upgrading and downgrading of German federal states has effects on the taxpayer. I am not making this point by way of criticism, but only as an observation. There are three rating agencies in the market; even though I am a defender of competition and would very much welcome it if they were to be joined by more, I think that an administrative, public solution would be the wrong one. If anything, the creation of any more rating agencies, or at any rate, of a European one, should be in response to the market, but all attempts to do so to date have been unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="contents">If we take into account the power that the rating agencies have, and our tendency, in legislating on financial markets, towards ever more regulation and supervision, then we have to give some thought to how we are to handle them in future. It is for this reason that I regard Mr Katiforis’ report as very important, in that it is the first in Europe to give attention to this topic. It is also important that Europe should do so. I would describe all three of the existing rating agencies as being predominantly Anglo-Saxon. Not that there is anything intrinsically wrong with that; but there are, after all, different financial structures within the European Union and around the world, with different rules, and not every rule that works on one side of the Atlantic must likewise be applicable<span class="italic"> </span>on the other. That is why I see it as highly significant that we should make the attempt at the European level. In so doing, we should not give so much attention to what the Americans are doing in this field, for – after all – rating agencies also want to do business in this part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">All this we have to consider in the context of Basel II, in which rating – whether internal or external – will increasingly apply in the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises. It will become normal, and the quintessential difference between external and internal rating will be that internal rating will, in the Member States, be subject to financial supervision, whereas external rating will not. What is at issue is whether we can carry on in future with only internal rating being supervised, while external rating is not. My main reason for raising this point is that I am told, by people in industry and in the financial sector, that businesses themselves find it very difficult to get the relevant information about their own rating, so one can scarcely speak in terms of a normal customer relationship between enterprises and rating firms.</p>
<p class="contents">This makes it important that we should now demand that the Commission should analyse this issue, do some work on it, say precisely how things currently stand, and make proposals. That is why I very largely share Mr Katiforis’ concerns. The outcome should, however, be left open; we should not already be calling for registration and supervision, which can be left to the end of the process. We can, though, aim to get the rating agencies to give an undertaking, which would include a commitment to transparency, and which the Commission should take as a basis for its work. This process could well involve the rating agencies making their own proposals. I regard it as a matter of urgency – as does the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – that we should get this process underway now, that we should monitor it with a critical eye, and that the Commission should submit its proposals in the middle of next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that it comes at an important time.</p>
<p class="contents">Whenever people try to take on board that ‘macro’ thinking of ours which we defend point by point, in particular in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, one thing that occasionally strikes them is the gap that sometimes exists – and which I am grateful for your having to some extent highlighted, Commissioner – between, on the one hand, the social model we claim to embody and, on the other hand, the standards we employ and the specific work we are involved in.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to talk about rating agencies and if we are to be delighted with our rapporteur’s initiative, it is because the market is blind and because, in this blindness, rating agencies have obtained, or are obtaining, an altogether essential decision-making power that will have far-reaching consequences for the future of enterprises and, therefore, of jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this, I would like to make three remarks. The first is that what we say here cannot be seen as separate from the global debate on corporate governance. What type of corporate governance do we want for our social model in Europe? What division of roles between capital and labour do we want? What role should redistribution have? These are the questions that we should answer by way of the solutions that we envisage for the operation of these agencies in particular, but not only for these agencies. I remember the debates that we had on the issue of accounting standards, and we are seeing the wayward effects of the so-called autonomy of the IASB. I do not want the same thing to happen to us where rating agencies are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">My second remark is that if, in Europe, we want the improvement in the operation of rating agencies to contribute to protecting our social model, then we cannot leave aside the issue of corporate social responsibility. In this area too, agencies are now coming into being. They are European initiatives. I am thinking, in particular, of Mrs Nicole Notat’s agency in France, Vigeo. These are complementary developments that we should reflect upon.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my third remark, Commissioner, is an expression of regret at not having heard your opinion on the amendment, proposed by our rapporteur and to be fully supported both by myself and my group, in favour of establishing European registering and regulatory agencies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is topical and Mr Katiforis has brought great insight into this issue. I am particularly grateful that he has taken on a number of the concerns I expressed in my amendments. I hope that a deal may be reached between the PPE-DE Group and the rapporteur. That has not proved possible – so far – but I am sure there is a great deal in his report that we very much support.</p>
<p class="contents">In a slightly shock reversal of the normal roles within the PPE-DE Group, I found that the rest of my Group were more cautious about the idea of further regulation than I was: usually I am the one in my Group arguing for a more deregulatory approach. What is very important – and it was stated clearly by Mr Radwan, the shadow rapporteur – is that yes, this is an important issue; yes, questions need to be answered about how ratings agencies work and yes, questions need to be asked about whether we should have a registration scheme for ratings agencies. The conclusion the Group came to was that we should not prejudge the outcome of this process.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that Members of Parliament and committees look carefully at the issues raised by Mr Katiforis in his report, but we do not want to prejudge the outcome and say at this point that yes, we should have a European registration authority. We in this Group are wary of the cost of regulation. We are concerned about what a significant step it would be to bring rating agencies within a regulatory framework or a registration scheme, and we must be cautious in our response to recent financial scandals.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a tendency among some financial commentators to assume that we must have further regulation following Parmalat, and the organisations that are most squarely in the frame for further regulation and registration are rating agencies. We should look objectively and calmly at what happened at Parmalat and see what response is necessary so as to avoid any hasty or knee-jerk reactions, because it is difficult to see how changing the scheme or regulation for rating agencies could have prevented the Parmalat scandal.</p>
<p class="contents">There will always be people who are prepared to break the law, as they were at Parmalat, and no matter how wide-ranging and effective the scheme of regulation, whether it be for hedge funds or rating agencies or whatever else, we are not going to prevent that kind of criminal conduct. We can try and make it happen less often, but it is impossible to prevent. Questions have to be asked about rating agencies and how they function, but it is premature to reach the conclusion that further regulation or a registration scheme are necessarily needed at this stage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is unfortunate that the work done by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has left us with little of the original draft report – little, that is, that would demand greater transparency of the rating agencies, and require that they be monitored more closely. Now, in the aftermath of global financial scandals ranging from WorldCom to Parmalat<span class="italic">,</span> is surely the time for rating agencies to be registered and their practices monitored. In view of Basel II’s recognition of external rating, and of the consequences resulting from it, the message we are giving now to the Commission is not a matter for indifference.</p>
<p class="contents">This report takes a tolerant view of an oligopoly that is almost impossible to monitor, one that is quite contrary to all the practices of the internal market. Of the hundred largest enterprises in the European Union, 80 are monitored by only three agencies, which should, therefore, be able to do a better job of rating them. The information used to produce an assessment is also important when deciding where to invest. This is where we cannot lag behind current developments in the USA, where, only recently, serious problems resulted in the existing system of rating agency supervision, which is in the hands of the Securities and Exchange Commission, being substantially tightened up.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry to have to tell Mr Katiforis that the signal this own-initiative report sends to the Commission is too moderate and gives us too little cause to hope that we will end up with a trustworthy instrument. I will nonetheless conclude by endorsing his appeal that, in view of the many current uncertainties, we should explore every avenue whereby a European Registration Authority may be established. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Previous speakers have already shown you how the rating agencies have gained twofold significance – on the one hand as a result of notorious scandals, and on the other as a result of the consumer credit directive or the development of Basel II.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be frank, and admit that every customer of a bank, and certainly anyone taking out a loan, is the subject of some form of rating process. Above all, rating agencies assess companies and countries. These evaluations lead to debates on the level of interest rates, the amount of equity capital and the stock exchange prices; they also have an effect on customers’ confidence in the business and country in question. It also, of course, follows that we have to bear in mind that the whole philosophy behind rating agencies is largely of Anglo-Saxon origin and that there are three large firms in this field that carry out ratings – major and significant ones – in Europe too. That being so, we also have to consider the fact that all these rating agencies possess a quality mark – an American one awarded by the<span class="italic"> </span>Securities and Exchange Commission. If, then, we are to talk in terms of more competition, we need not only European agencies, but also a quality mark, for some kind of quality mark has the natural effect of building confidence and enhancing the agency’s value in the market.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore want to put the case for Europe’s rating agencies to be promoted and for them to respond specifically to the characteristics and needs of small and medium-sized enterprises. We want to advocate the introduction of a European quality mark, or, best of all, a global one, to accompany Basel II, and we want a debate on internal and external rating. We favour freedom of opinion and the agencies’ independence, and we want greater transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I regard it as intolerable that there should be no licensing procedure whatever for rating agencies. It may be that starting with financial market supervision, and with equal treatment for internal and external ratings so that agencies can be registered, that is to say, authorised, is a good approach that we should adopt, instead of creating new authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an excellent initiative and I, like most Members of this House who have spoken, hope that we will be able, in the course of proceedings, specifically in plenary, to make Mr Katiforis’s original philosophy a reality. As Mr Katiforis stated, the crux of the issue at stake today, regarding this own-initiative report, is whether or not the activities of the rating agencies should be regulated and if so, whether such regulation should take place at national or European level. As the rapporteur suggested in his explanatory statement, this is clearly a political decision, and this debate clearly bears out this view. However, the rapporteur was initially unquestionably in favour of regulation, and regulation at European level, even though voices closely associated with the sector have been raised against such a move.</p>
<p class="contents">Representatives of the sector appreciate that their activities form part of the sphere of economic information and that what is at stake, therefore, is to guarantee complete freedom for such economic information. The need for information is obviously not incompatible with the needs and interests of regulation and while it has to be admitted that rating agencies have, by and large, performed respectably under the current system, it is also clear that we face new problems today – and there have been some spectacular examples of these, as Members who spoke before me have already mentioned – that require new solutions and probably a new system.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, there is no doubt that the rapporteur’s options are in line with the legislative approach adopted by the EU within the framework of financial services. To my mind, it is therefore in the public interest to establish bodies to regulate credit rating, especially because, as we all know, the outcome of this activity already has a decisive impact on the legitimacy and eligibility of certain financial assets for certain types of application used by the general public.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I feel that the rapporteur’s first initiative, which was not accepted in its entirety by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, must be endorsed and supported by plenary. It is extremely bold, yet completely justified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Members discussed many questions.

Then there is the interesting issue of an independent authority, what kind of entity that would be and whether we should agree to establish it at European level. Another major issue is the registration of these companies and whether they have to be registered at European or at national level.</p>
