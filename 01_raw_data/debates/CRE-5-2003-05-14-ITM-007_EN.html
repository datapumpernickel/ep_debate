We therefore have good reasons for working to ensure that prosperity and democracy also have a chance in those countries where that was impossible under Soviet dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents">With enlargement, we are pushing the boundary of prosperity and democracy further eastwards, so that the question once again arises, this time in the case of our new neighbours, of how we can live alongside them, and the Commission is to be congratulated on the way it has racked its brains to find solutions. I support all the activities described by the Commissioner down to the last detail – with one exception, where I am opposed. That is your suggestion, Mr Verheugen, that you can manage all this without making a statement about possible decisions on accession. On that particular point I think you are wrong. I think it is essential, while we are in the process of enlargement – a process that will keep us busy for a long time in fact – that we should spell out who is to be a neighbour in the future and who is to be a future Member State of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now absolutely imperative for us to address the issue of the borders of the European Union – and I do not just mean its geographical borders. The Treaty itself obliges us to address this issue, because, as the Commission communication correctly mentions, European states may apply for membership of the European Union. However, we need to consider how far the political union that we consider desirable can be extended, what the limits to integration are, what the shape of our future structures will be, and what the nature of the European Union must be. That is not something we can or should try to resolve conclusively today, but it is very much under discussion in the Convention. We do not need to resolve the conflict about whether the European Union is a federal state or some other kind of animal. In such cases we lawyers tend to talk about something being <span class="italic">sui generis</span>. However, we do need to make a decision about who in future will be neighbours and who will be Member States, because on the one hand we owe the citizens of the European Union some clarity on this issue, as they want to know how far the European project now extends, but on the other hand we also owe clarity to our neighbours, whose hopes we should not raise if they cannot be fulfilled. That is one of the problems that we have with Turkey, which is an important partner and ally. The question of how to deal with Turkey has been left unresolved for too long.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of ‘political union’ also has its limits. The process of enlargement has now essentially reached a stage where there may still be some scope for ‘rounding off’, but any further accession that would jeopardise the Union's capacity for integration and totally undermine the balance between these 25 states has to be ruled out. Enlargement has reached a stage where to shape a common view by reconciling varying positions and conflicting standpoints would take so much energy that there would be no scope for effective external action.</p>
<p class="contents">That is indeed one of the lessons of the Iraq war, where divergent viewpoints within the European Union condemned us to inaction. Who can seriously believe that the accession of countries ranging from the Mediterranean area through Turkey to Russia could possibly make the Union stronger and more effective? That is why we need to resolve the question of the borders of the European Union now, and only then can we try to act as good neighbours. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Napoletano (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would like to start by telling the Commission how timely and appropriate the communication on the Wider Europe and on relations with its new neighbours to the east and south is, not least in that it makes it possible to structure the debate to exclude improvisation or extemporisation, which have the effect of raising easily-raised or vain hopes in a situation which is extremely complex and in a state of constant flux. Indeed, there could not be a worse moment to raise false hopes regarding new dimensions of enlargement than that when we have to successfully carry the integration of ten countries through to a conclusion and to assess the effectiveness of the reforms decided on by the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference. This, however, does not mean that the Union must become inward-looking. Thus, the Commission is right to produce a wider integration strategy involving countries and geographical areas located to the east and south of the enlarged Union at the very time when the accession treaties for the ten new Member States are being signed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, however, right, as the Commission communication states, to avoid making a misleading parallel between neighbour countries and countries which will never become part of the European Union, and, at the same time, to avoid accession to the European institutions being the only instrument which can be proposed for a closer cooperation policy addressing common problems and interests. In other words, we need to ensure that the strategy and enlargement are relatively independent of each other. For precisely this reason, in the initial debate which took place in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, the need emerged to provide a single framework for a broad strategy which is also practical enough to propose policies for today, not for an unspecified time in the future which we are unable to foresee at this present moment but for which we can and must pave the way.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, the initial ideas which have emerged during the debate are along these lines. To complete the geopolitical framework, considering the countries of the Caucasus too. To look, including in the context of the Mediterranean, beyond the countries of the current partnership. Not to exclude from this strategy, Commissioner, countries which are already about to join the Union, not in order to cause confusion but because these countries too will need to be able to interact with the areas on their borders. If borders are considered to be more than just physical borders, it is extremely important that, between now and when they join the Union, the Balkans, for example, are able to interact in a Mediterranean context. This does not mean that we are to iron out or fail to preserve the differences between the instruments, from the preaccession agreements to the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership: quite the opposite, we must strengthen them through the proposal the Commission puts forward on the cross-border dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">The strength of this strategy lies precisely in the fact that common objectives are established for a geographical area which, because of its history, culture and adjacency to the Union, can be described as a pan-European and Mediterranean region – the arc stretching from Russia to Morocco – as President Prodi maintains. What can the countries of such a diverse area have in common? I want to say to the Commission and the Council that we insist on one thing: politics, first and foremost. We want to share, first and foremost, values, democracy, the rule of law and freedom and to develop new as well as existing instruments and policies in this framework. I therefore believe that Parliament can – and will – contribute to this framework, for we are delighted with the spirit of openness already displayed in the speeches of the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to highlight a fundamental aspect of the Union’s cooperation with our neighbours, that of cross-border cooperation. Cross-border cooperation has played a key role in European integration. It should also play a key role in our relations with our new neighbours following enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to be hoped that the new European Constitution will give cross-border cooperation the place it deserves.</p>
<p class="contents">Our new neighbours can be divided into three different groups. There are the countries of Eastern Europe and the countries of the Mediterranean basin. The Balkan States must be borne in mind too, although further accessions may take place in the future in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">Cross-border cooperation may not be sufficient to facilitate perfect collaboration with neighbouring countries. We can and must however take advantage of its benefits. It allows us to get to know neighbouring countries, and to understand and trust them. If we know, understand and trust each other, we can work together and improve our relationship. We will be able to export well-being and stability, to quote the Commissioner. These two elements are crucial to the future of both the European Union and of our neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to draw your attention to the particular case of Kaliningrad, in Northern Europe. This area will become an island surrounded by Member States of the European Union. We therefore need to establish a special system of cooperation with Kaliningrad. As Mr Yegorov, the current governor of the area has said on many occasions, there needs to be a system of cross-border cooperation with both Lithuania and Poland. In my opinion, relations with neighbouring countries from the Mediterranean to northern Russia pose a significant challenge to the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is urgent. The logic of force is persisting after the war. By helping itself to the resources and monopolising all of the levers of power, the Bush administration is continuing to both impose the <span class="italic">fait accompli</span> against the interests of the Iraqi people and disregard the UN and thus respect for international law.</p>
<p class="contents">To line up another view of the world against this veritable doctrine, the European Union now needs political courage, initiative and dialogue. In my view, forging new relations with our future neighbours could be a first decisive step, particularly as regards the Arab Muslim world. The virtually constant condemnation and humiliation it is suffering, combined with the economic and social gap, can only serve to fuel religious fundamentalism and the use of terrorism by increasingly dangerous groups, as a result of which the extreme right here hopes to prosper.</p>
<p class="contents">To combat all of these perils effectively, I feel that priority should be given to objectives and means other than those set out in the Commission communication. There is no doubt that, in theory, as regards the idea of new momentum, for example, there is the goal of closer relations. However, there will be no common area without common construction. We are far from that, listening to Romano Prodi talk about political <span class="italic">rapprochement</span> and gradual integration into the European Union’s economic and social structures.</p>
<p class="contents">Would the word ‘neighbours’ then be replaced with the word ‘partnership’? Does the composition of the enlarged meeting of 40 European countries, held in Athens on 17 April, which you have discussed, prefigure a type of multi-speed integration, with second-zone countries, the so-called Wider Europe, and others in a third zone, the southern Mediterranean countries? Above all, however, mere alignment with the market approach that governs the current process of European integration does little to meet our needs or achieve any effectiveness in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">A genuine cooperation policy cannot equate to the sacrosanct transposition of the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span>, because that is what we are talking about, especially when no equivalent is mentioned as regards aid. The initiative of launching specific action programmes may be interesting given the rigidity, for example, of the overall Barcelona process. Nevertheless, while the negotiations conducted with the candidate countries have left a bitter taste in the mouth and resulted in a great deal of frustration, as we are quite aware, the Commission has not proposed any review of the matter. What is worse, a bonus is offered for the best reform students.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the conflicts, and I am ending now, the Commission has spent very little time on this aspect although a common area can only be built on the principle of international law and on a much more active role for the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the fact that the entire Commission document focuses almost exclusively on the security aspect of relations…</p>

We do not want the hallmarks of the European Union to become borders protected by barbed wire and infrared cameras in the east and the south; we want the EU to be associated with partnership and closer bonds.</p>
<p class="contents">The border regions in the east and the south were historically meeting places between people of different cultures, religions and lifestyles, and we should endeavour to recreate those regions. In political terms, the Commission communication may be right, but the measures proposed are not. Our greatest criticism is reserved for the way the Barcelona process, the EU partnership with Russia as a regional power and relations with neighbouring states who have indicated a desire for integration have all been thrown into the same pot. In this way, the real substance of the existing processes has been watered down, and existing concerns and objectives are recycled without a fresh assessment of achievements and developments to date. This is not the significant added value that we need for a new qualitative concept of ‘neighbour’. No solutions are offered for the real problems that will arise for people in eastern border regions in particular if Schengen is implemented, nor have suitable instruments been formulated with sufficient clarity. This represents an enormous shortcoming in the communication.</p>
<p class="contents">We need the various problems to be dealt with individually, so that a solution can be found for the combination of regional communities, business life and family relations for which the new Schengen border will pose great difficulties in the east, by easing restrictions on a regional basis in border areas. In addition, an adequate budget must be provided to facilitate the preparations necessary. There should also be a financial instrument directly compatible with this and administered in a decentralised way. Last but not least, the eastern and southern border regions share a need for a humanitarian refugee policy that is both in line with the Geneva Convention and provides for burden sharing with our neighbours. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The geographical, political and cultural upheavals experienced by the European continent and the Mediterranean Basin during the twentieth century have certainly not helped in the recent past to bring Europe closer to Russia, the new independent states and the countries of the southern Mediterranean, which are now our neighbours. They have suffered very diverse, tragic situations, and that is why it is still important today to find common ground and points of active cooperation between us.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the primary objectives of the new reunified Europe, with its 25 Member States, will have to be the achievement of a preferential relationship with these neighbouring countries of both Eastern Europe, Russia and Asia, such as Kazakhstan, and those which make up the Middle East region and lie on the Mediterranean Basin.</p>
<p class="contents">The political Europe born of the work of the Convention and the new institutional treaty which the IGC will submit to the people of the Union will have a duty not just to strengthen economic alliances, which will facilitate the improvement of communications structures too, in order to encourage mutually beneficial trade between citizens and companies, but also and above all to promote all those political, social, cultural and scientific initiatives which will increase the citizens’ involvement in the development of democratic, secular governments with due regard for all the national, cultural and religious traditions which, in any case, uphold man’s dignity and safeguard his physical integrity.</p>
<p class="contents">If, however, this dialogue is to proceed with equal intensity where all the Union’s neighbouring countries are concerned, we believe that political measures in the immediate term to facilitate peace in the Middle East and restore economic stability to the Mediterranean Basin are a priority. Indeed, in our opinion, full recognition of the state of Israel and its citizens’ right to a life free of terrorism and full recognition of the Palestinian people’s right to an autonomous, independent state which is committed to combating all forms of terrorism and to monitoring whether the funds appropriated by the European Union are genuinely used to help the Palestinian people, to educate young people, to develop production activities and to build houses and infrastructure, are a primary objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Another primary objective is preventing a mass exodus from the poorest countries, which would lead to uncontrolled migration, both impoverishing the countries from which the migrants are emigrating and throwing into disorder the structures of the countries of reception, which cannot deal with mass irregular immigration, particularly when, mixed in with the migrants seeking better conditions, there are numerous members of criminal or terrorist organisations dealing in drugs, arms and, worst of all, human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">There is therefore a clear need for a political and economic Union undertaking to encourage ongoing, harmonious development in these countries, so that people find in their native countries not just the means of subsistence but the means of social and cultural progress too. Only in this way can it be ensured that the people emigrating will be doing so on the basis of a reasoned decision and in accordance with the rules, not out of desperation or illegally.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we must, moreover, all remember the need to call upon all the European institutions to mount, by means of appropriate agreements with the governments of neighbouring states, an intense, relentless fight against child abuse, the exploitation, especially sexual exploitation, of women and children, and all practices which violate the physical integrity of the individual. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At this stage, however, four questions come to mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the content of the neighbourhood agreements has at times been defined by the expression ‘everything except the institutions’, which may be mistakenly interpreted as meaning ‘everything except decision-making power’. This ambiguity must be clarified.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, once again with regard to the content, there has also been talk of giving priority to extending the single market’s four freedoms of movement. Is it not very rash to make this commitment in advance? It is all too clear that other objectives are much more pressing, for instance security.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the new proximity policy seems to have to be limited to non-candidate neighbouring countries. Turkey is not included in this list, but it is difficult to know why that is the case as its accession has not yet been officially approved.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, in this proximity policy, the European Union is not starting from scratch. It is not starting from square one as the current Members already have relations with their neighbours, particularly those with which they share borders. How is the European policy going to work in relation to the existing national policies? Should the Member countries which are the immediate neighbours of these countries not be given a decisive role or a special right of consultation as regards the new European policy? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It paints a very dramatic picture, mapped out by a French institute, of the dangers threatening Europe. Populations are falling, economic growth is stagnating, and the institute takes the view that the situation will be long-term. The innovative strength of the European Union lags far behind that of the United States. Doom and gloom. The remedy that the French institute prescribes is to open our eyes, see the bigger picture and look further than the Commission does at this moment. That was what it boiled down to. Whether this is the remedy, I do not know. In any case we must always keep the United States at the back of our minds, since that country is an important neighbour of ours.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the course of events in Europe and in our neighbour states on this continent are concerned, however, I am bound to say that I had a sense of <span class="italic">déjà vu</span> when I read the Commission’s statement. The Commission is familiar with the whole field of expansion, and with the attendant process. Reading the document one has the strong feeling that we are embarking on a new round of expansions. It is made very clear that this is not the case. The only prospect being offered to the surrounding countries is participation in the internal market, not participation in the Union and its decision-making process. But we find that matters relating to environmental policy, public order, security, fighting crime, quality of government administration, the rule of law, are all open to consideration for a joint approach – in short, virtually the whole spectrum of topics also discussed on the admission of the candidate countries. The development of neighbouring countries, the statement continues, in all these sectors can then be discussed annually in progress reports. It looks remarkably like the expansion process. In addition there is talk of benchmarks – there are a number of internationally recognised benchmarks, by which the neighbouring countries will be measured, and these are consequently mentioned in concrete terms.</p>
<p class="contents">I just wonder whether we are dealing here with a ‘Department of Public Works’ effect. The Department of Public Works is a very efficient agency in the Netherlands that is continually creating polders and dikes. Once they have completed the construction of a new polder, they suddenly find that a dike is much too low and they immediately have to set to work on it. This may be something of a tongue-in-cheek comment, but I could well imagine that that effect might play a part. Those involved in hands-on work see further ahead than the rest of us.</p>
<p class="contents">The theme of a <span class="italic">Wider Europe</span> therefore, if I have understood correctly, in fact concerns the affiliation of neighbouring countries to the European Union but without their participation in its decision-making. This will in fact turn them into virtual satellites, also removing them, for instance, from existing cooperative agreements in which they are involved; Russia from the GOS, and perhaps also the North African countries from their own federation of Arab states. It also presupposes that our current Member States fully meet the benchmarks and criteria mentioned in the statement. Naturally I warmly welcome the latter news. That every new candidate must be carefully judged by the same standard, is a conviction we all share.</p>
<p class="contents">How are we to deal in that respect, however, with countries to which we definitely cannot or do not wish to offer the prospect of membership? Will they accept such assessment and such an annual investigation? It seems to me that a <span class="italic">Wider Europe </span>might be a space for countries whose traditions make it impossible to opt for the European democratic model. I can imagine that there are such countries. It is actually difficult to deny admission to countries that <span class="italic">do </span>opt for the model. What moral basis is there for telling such countries, when they ask for a date, that they can not join? My feeling is that such issues will have to be discussed in great detail in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why it is important to cultivate a policy that strengthens democracy and prosperity in the Union’s neighbouring regions.</p>
<p class="contents">When Finland joined the European Union the Union suddenly had Russia as its neighbour, sharing a border with that country which is almost 1 300 kilometres long. That border still represents one of the world’s widest gulfs between standards of living. Despite development, Russia still has much hard work to do in the creation of democratic social structures. The strengthening of democracy and civil society also remains a fundamental aim of cooperation between the EU and Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement means that, in addition to the border between Finland and Russia, the Union will be getting 10 new Interreg-TACIS borders.</p>
<p class="contents">It will no longer be possible to maintain the current system of cooperation, but the experience we have had up till now of cooperation should be put to careful use. The new Member States will bring with them Belarus, Ukraine and Moldava as neighbours. Each of them has significant political and economic problems. If they get worse they could increase instability in Europe. The situation is worst in Belarus, where the political situation has hindered EU cooperation with the country. Hopefully preparations for the elections in 2004 will clear the way for what would at least be the first openings for cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication quite rightly stresses the importance of cross-border and regional cooperation with our new neighbours. A new financial instrument must be developed for cooperation. It should, in my opinion, be based on the Interreg principles and be flexible enough to meet the needs of each border region. The key principles are that it should be multiannual, that there should be power of decision in the regions, and that it should be organised as efficiently as possible with regard to its administration and making payments. It is also important that expertise and cultural know-how in the new Member States of the EU should be swiftly harnessed in the planning and implementation of policy towards our neighbours. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We do of course have to consider how the enlarged Union of the future will arrange its relations with neighbouring states. The external borders of the Union will shift to Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus. We need to construct as strong a partnership as possible with Ukraine in particular, and we also need to adopt a positive approach under Article 4 of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. This involves working towards a free trade area, greater use of twinning projects and using the European Conference as a forum for neighbourhood policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The borders of the Union will also shift to Croatia, which we hope will participate in the next enlargement round alongside Romania and Bulgaria. It is therefore absolutely right that a debate should be taking place about the outermost geographical borders of the Union, a debate in which the new Member States should be able to participate. There should also be a clear alternative to membership of the European Union, an alternative leaving open the option of a European Economic Area with stronger relations and increased assistance. Although I understand the EU strategy of striking a balance between a neighbourhood policy for continental Europe and a Mediterranean strategy, it seems to me that we should be setting priorities for a future European neighbourhood policy, as otherwise our ability to implement and finance it could be undermined.</p>
<p class="contents">It must of course also be our objective for countries that will be joining the European Union in the medium or long term – or never – to be guided by the political criteria of the European Union. Democratisation of society, the rule of law and respect for human rights and minorities need to be implemented by means of practical policies not just because membership of the European Union is on the horizon, but also because they are in the best interests of the peoples concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a matter of interest to Europe, for the Caucasus has been part of Europe during many periods of history.</p>
<p class="contents">Armenia and Georgia are two of the oldest Christian countries. In the Middle Ages, Armenia was considered to be a major European power. At the end of the nineteenth century, nobody would have denied that Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, was a powerful centre among the pioneers of the oil industry, even in European terms. Today, moreover, Azerbaijan is the principal supplier of crude oil to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">After the First World War and before the collapse of the Soviet Union, the national governments of the three countries, despite their diversity, turned to European values. The Conference of Versailles gave a number of European powers the task of assisting the birth of the new democracies.</p>
<p class="contents">The three Republics participated in the 1972-1975 Pan-European Helsinki Conference as part of the Soviet delegation, and all three are part of the Council of Europe. They are therefore not foreign to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU-Southern Caucasus Parliamentary Cooperation Committee has visited these countries on a number of occasions, and the solution for finding a way out of the crisis put forward by the three governments lay, each time, in establishing closer relations with Europe as quickly as possible. It is hoped that even the potentially extremely dangerous crises such as the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh can be resolved in a European context.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States and Russia are involved in the region for economic reasons. The national governments, with different emphases, of course, therefore have to carry out balancing operations. Nevertheless, they would prefer another protagonist such as the European Union to be more involved.</p>

The question we have to address politically speaking, and which we are currently examining in the Convention, is how far European integration can go. What is the bond that links us together politically and encourages us to take joint political action? Geography is another issue that we need to discuss. What are the geographical limits to a Europe that is willing to cooperate within this political union? And that leads on to this question: how are we to work with our neighbours beyond this closely cooperating Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">I would accordingly like to thank the Commission and the Council for having addressed in their paper and in today's debate something that Europe urgently needs: a wide-ranging public debate on this very issue, the geographical expansion of Europe, not of the continent of Europe, but of close political cooperation within the European Union. We will also have to stop thinking in black and white terms, as if relations can only take two forms – non-membership or full membership. It would be the worst possible mistake if that were the signal we were sending out. Europe has at its disposal a broad panoply of individual forms of cooperation. I myself come from a constituency that will continue to border on a non-Member State, namely Switzerland. In this case we have found a variety of solutions, including legal solutions based on agreements and cooperation arrangements through integration and specific European programmes. This is a perfect example of how the interests of a particular country – Switzerland – and of the EU can be reconciled without simply saying, ‘you either remain on the outside or you become a full member’. So we should focus once again on achieving this broad panoply of means of cooperating with our neighbours without constantly having discussions about ever more countries joining the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to ask ourselves what the limits are to Europe's capacity for integration. If we are to discuss the question of political boundaries, of political responsibility, then we also need to consider who can tread this path alongside us. A European Union that ultimately degenerates into an enormous free trade area is not the model I am committed to, and I think that my fellow Members feel the same way.</p>
<p class="contents">I also expect these debates to be held in public and not in the Council, essentially at the meetings of Heads of State and Government, which discussed Turkey's accession in less than three minutes. That is no way to deal with issues of this kind. We need to listen to people here, and that must be the signal that goes out from Strasbourg today. We must take the public with us, and if they are ready to go down this road with us, we should work together politically to make it happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A debate on the new environment is both useful and necessary. From this point of view, the position of Commission President Prodi, that the European Union must look on all new neighbours as friends and associates is absolutely correct. This position must become the position of all of us, peoples and governments alike of both the 25 and the 27, and that is because, in certain cases, sometimes overt and sometimes concealed, opposition is being expressed on the basis of historical atavism or by reviving past antagonisms and/or enmities. In all events, we do not need divisions, we do not need new iron curtains, we do not need new cold war fronts. We must look on many of our new neighbours as potential candidates for integration into the European Union or, in any event, as associates and friends. Any perspective must, however, express the free democratic will of each nation.</p>
<p class="contents">On the borders of Europe, following enlargement, interesting tasks are under way, tasks that are often of wider geopolitical and strategic interest, including for countries which are not located in this area, which means that they intervene in developments. From the Ukraine, Belarus, Moldavia, Russia, the western Balkans, the Caucasus, the Middle East, the other side of the Mediterranean, peoples expect a great deal of the European Union, of us. We must respond positively to these expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">Now as regards the boundaries of Europe, I should like to add to what Mr Volcic said about the Caucasus, that right back in antiquity, in the ancient Greek tragedy of Prometheus Bound, it says that this is where the gods tied up Prometheus in order to punish him for giving man fire, that is to say the first elements of modern civilisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are already aware of our requirements, which will continue to be based on the Copenhagen criteria, although they will no doubt be better clarified by the constitution proposals we are awaiting from the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I highlighted the importance of this during this morning’s debate, but I would like to relay to you the moving account of one of these countries, which, in its own words, is currently waiting in the kindergarten of the Council of Europe until it is one day allowed into the older children’s playground of the European Parliament. This was in Mostar, where, as you know, the rivalry and fear between Catholic Croats and Muslim Bosnians are still far too intense, in spite of the efforts of the European Community. In Mostar, the Croatian mayor of the town told me that the only thing that Catholic Croats and Muslim Bosnians have in common is the sentiment and the belief that they must be Europeans together.</p>
<p class="contents">So that is the situation of those who are waiting. However, although I am paying all due attention to the reflections of our rapporteur, Mrs Napoletano, I am not the only person to ask if we can use this report to send a very strong signal to all those who have neither the desire nor the intention to seek their accession, and I am thinking in particular of our neighbours in the southern Mediterranean. There are many in that region who fear that the efforts made with regard to Central and Eastern Europe may result in a slackening of the links with their own countries that are already too little institutionalised. In the emotion following the 11 September attacks, we decided quite unanimously, for example, to give fresh impetus to the Barcelona process and, to this end, decided to create a Euro-Mediterranean Forum, which, I am sad to say, is not functioning today due to the war in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it not time, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to reinvigorate this initiative without delay? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It began with six and could easily have begun with seven or eight. Even today, Article 3 of the draft constitution states that ‘the Union shall be open to all European states whose peoples share the same values’, but it refrains from specifying what a European state is at all. Yet it is never a good thing not to let people know where the borders are as this is more worrying for them than reassuring.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, each person has their borders in mind. For some people, including myself, they stop at the North African countries, which are our neighbours and friends; it is therefore appropriate to envisage optimum partnerships with them. The borders also stop at Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine as these countries form part of a whole, just as Russia does. They are also neighbours and friends.</p>
<p class="contents">For many, the borders do not include Turkey or the Caucasus. We made this promise of integration 40 years ago, but it is by no means certain that the people agree with us. In fact, in this case, our neighbours would be Iran, Iraq and Syria. I believe that optimum associations must be proposed to this group.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, in order to ensure a successful future for Europe, we must set a limit to its expansion. You know the proverb: ‘Do not bite off more than you can chew’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The challenges are not over yet, however. Our horizons are widening, our borders are expanding and the arrival of new Member States will spur the Union on further to consolidate relations with its new neighbours, such that – as I see it – in the coming years, the Union’s ability to provide its citizens with security, stability and sustainable development will depend on its desire and ability to step up and develop cooperation and dialogue with the new neighbouring countries. In this regard, the Wider Europe initiative draws our attention to the European Union’s new proximity policy, seeking to define a strategic framework for relations with the new neighbouring countries during the coming decade.</p>
<p class="contents">Poland is one of the countries which have now reached the eve of their <span class="italic">de facto</span> accession to the European Union, and I am the rapporteur for Poland. As such, I particularly welcome the important role that this major border country will be able to play in developing neighbourly relations with countries such as Ukraine, Belarus and, above all, Russia, as President Kwasniewski said only today.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I had to mention the southern Mediterranean, which is of particular interest to a country such as Italy, almost all of whose territory borders on the Mediterranean Sea and which is thus a natural bridge linking the European Union and the countries of the southern Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I hope that the Council and the Commission, together with the European Parliament, especially given the impending start of the Italian Presidency, will create better geopolitical conditions for carrying through the project for a renewed Europe, a Europe which is not just politically wider but which has grown in economic and social terms too, so that countries which are different but which have common interests make up a healthy whole, despite the differences in their history and individual experiences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I confess that I was initially somewhat surprised that this paper bracketed together countries like Libya and Belarus in a single communication. These two countries, like the other countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean or in eastern and south-eastern Europe, have precious little in common apart from their relative geographical proximity to the European Union. That is why I am pleased that each country is to be dealt with individually. The Presidency has made an announcement to that effect and the Commissioner talked about action plans. As something has therefore been said about practically all our neighbours, for the sake of completeness a sentence could have been added about Norway and Switzerland, as an example, at least in the case of Norway, of just what can be done without signing up to actual membership.</p>
<p class="contents">I find wording such as the heading ‘Different countries, common interests’ somewhat unfocussed. Their agendas really are too different. It has been said that there are countries that have membership prospects and others that do not. If we want to, we can demand a lot more from neighbours who also belong to the Council of Europe: for example, in return for granting trade preferences, we can make demands in the area of human rights. However, we should not make offers that we cannot honour. We cannot offer all neighbouring states the four freedoms as the Commission does in Section 3 of its communication, and I quote: ‘the prospect of a stake in the EU’s Internal Market and further integration and liberalisation to promote the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital’. Fortunately, the Commissioner did not repeat that quotation from the communication as such. However, the communication almost gives the impression that we are offering an ‘à la carte’ Europe. I have to say that I cannot identify any political consensus for granting North Africa and Russia, for example, freedom of movement in any foreseeable political future. I therefore call on the Commission to draw up pragmatic and realistic action plans that neither raise false hopes nor over-commit the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In return for concrete progress, Russia and countries of the Western NIS and the Southern Mediterranean should be offered the prospect of a stake in the EU's internal market and participation in the so-called four freedoms - in effect, everything bar participation in the Institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union allows any European state the opportunity of joining the Union, which is why accession has already been ruled out for the non-European Mediterranean partners. Russia and Belarus do not wish to join the European Union, being content with the PCA Agreement, and the Maghreb is planning to be part of an African Union. However, better engagement and cooperation with Belarus in areas of common interest is essential to encourage reform in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of Article 49, there is still a serious danger that Moldova and Ukraine will see the process as insufficiently differentiated and as a way of distancing the EU from their just membership aspirations. In addition, the suggestion that there should be additional freedom of movement of persons for all neighbouring countries would undermine the existing attempts to limit large-scale immigration into the EU. The movement of skilled and educated people to nearby countries would also create a serious brain-drain that would damage the economies of countries such as Moldova and Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the EU is looking at ways of facilitating the crossing of external borders for <span class="italic">bona fide</span> third country nationals; after all, good fences make for good neighbours in my opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I propose that Phare and other successful pre-accession financial instruments, which have benefited acceding countries so much, be extended, along with the remit of the EIB to the Western NIS countries, which would replace the current limited Tacis Programme and approach, which carries no private sector economic investments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This proposal is based on an overall view of the place of the new Europe in its surroundings, but from an individual viewpoint for each country, without affecting the European aspirations of these countries. That should be clear.</p>
<p class="contents">This area of new neighbours should be built on compliance with shared values, which we must continue to establish. That way, the EU strategy with regard to the southern border, in terms of democratisation and human development, cannot be limited to the democratic clause. The United States are currently implementing a global strategy on this subject with increased budgetary resources and the European Union cannot lose sight of the overwhelming need to foster democratisation along its closest cultural and strategic border. This should take place gradually and realistically, but with strict requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should provide what our Mediterranean partners are always asking for: an area of shared prosperity. This, however, should also be an area of shared responsibility, above all with regard to the subject of immigration, which is of particular concern to this House. In order to accomplish this, the Commission’s proposals on the free movement of persons should be studied carefully and debated in depth, and Parliament must be heard.</p>
<p class="contents">The global and regional strategy represented by this initiative for new neighbours must act as a spur for regional integration and strengthen cross-border cooperation between the southern and eastern Mediterranean countries, which is currently almost non-existent. It must also break down, once and for all, the walls that make many borders between Mediterranean countries impenetrable.</p>
<p class="contents">The initiative we are discussing today must be credible and offer tangible results. This will require sufficient budgetary resources and certain proposals will need to be reviewed, such as the Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we must also explore the possibility of a ‘conference of neighbours’ involving the Heads of State and Government of these countries to address matters of common interest, including the Middle East, in the presence of the two parties and two members of the Quartet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This plan will be differentiated and tailored to the needs of each country, so there is no danger, for example, that Libya will be offered freedom of movement. Instead, the instruments available will be examined to see to which countries they are best suited, and how we can take advantage of existing potential for cooperation. Our intention is that at some point next year there will then be an overarching strategy for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this plan includes those countries that do not have any prospect of membership. I think I made that clear, so I cannot understand why several Members of this House have suggested that preparations are being made for a covert further round of enlargement. It is precisely because these countries have no prospect of membership that they are included in this programme. All the other countries we have been discussing here do have membership prospects, that is to say, the Balkan states, Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey. The countries in the European Economic Area and Switzerland in any case have a special treaty relationship with the European Union, which has already been pushed to its limits. The only further step possible for these countries is full membership; there are no other options open to them. It is, though, for these countries themselves to decide if that is what they want.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the last point that I would like to clarify. It is a shame that Mr Ferber is no longer here to listen to what I have to say, although I asked him to stay to hear me out. I really must defend the EU Heads of State and Government against the accusation that they dealt with Turkey's application in just three minutes. That was not the case in either Helsinki or Copenhagen. In both cases hours of detailed discussion were devoted to this subject. Perhaps Mr Ferber was referring to the fact that it only took three minutes in Copenhagen to decide which Cyprus protocol should be adopted, Protocol A or Protocol B, which confirmed that the two sides could not agree on a political solution in Copenhagen either. But I would like to spell out that the subject of Turkey is always discussed with the greatest care in the Council and that a very great deal of time has been devoted to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
