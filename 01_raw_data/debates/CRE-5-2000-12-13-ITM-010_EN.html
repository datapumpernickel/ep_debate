<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gill (PSE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – President, I welcome this initiative from the Commission. This proposal reflects the goal of the Lisbon Summit by aiming to stimulate the development and the use of digital content. In doing so I trust that Europe's position in the knowledge-based global economy will be consolidated.</p>
<p class="contents">Owing to the fast-changing nature of this sector, the EU needs to take immediate and concrete measures since the new communication technologies are already generating demand for content, products and services as well as having considerable social impact. If we do not act and tackle the barriers that undermine the potential of European industry, then the European citizen will pay the price not only in terms of slower economic growth and lower employment opportunities, but also in terms of cultural and social influence.</p>
<p class="contents">If I can say briefly what is important in my report and what I believe is the key priority for this Parliament, it is the issue of linguistic diversity. We in Europe are lagging behind the US because at present the EU market is fragmented as a result of linguistic and cultural diversity. What we need to do is to rectify this situation by fostering and encouraging multilingual content, as this is absolutely crucial to the success of the European content industry. Multilingual content should be incorporated wherever possible at the embryonic stage of electronic communication. As a result the market position of European companies will be enhanced and at the same time it will prove to be less costly to them. That is the reason why I propose the amount of budget earmarked for this sector. In my view we must adopt an inclusive approach in relation to languages and a pledge to commit more funding to this area, precisely because European SMEs are dissuaded from setting up websites in different languages by the burdensome cost that they incur.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot under-estimate the importance of customising our content. By ensuring that it is conveyed to each and every corner of the EU we underwrite our goal of a fully integrated and functional information society. It should not be necessary to master the English language in order to find interesting content on the Internet. The presence of content in different languages will promote citizens' equal access to the information society and therefore prevent the creation of an information underclass.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I believe that the initial proposal of five years is far too long and should be curtailed to four years, especially because of the rapid evolution of the e-content sector. Therefore it is necessary to shorten the implementation of the programme and it also enables this programme to have a much greater impact owing to the commitment of more money in shorter timescales. Furthermore, I call on the Commission to conceive more efficient and faster implementation procedures in the field of calling in proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">In changing priorities from public sector information to multilingual content, my intention is not to diminish the importance of public sector information. My reasoning is that I believe there is a greater potential for public/private partnerships as there is a huge commercial value to be exploited on the market in the interest both of companies and citizens. More importantly we need to also resolve the issues of copyright and intellectual property. These issues have to be addressed so that all parties are fully aware of the implications.</p>
<p class="contents">Another key area that Parliament is keen to develop further is how we lend additional support to market enablers, recognising that in recent months the sector has experienced a particularly volatile period. It is essential that we sell to them the potential gains and opportunities of investing in companies that are taking on board linguistic diversity and exploitation of public sector information. The lack of financing for enterprises that want to operate in the digital content sector has to be eliminated. The problem I am mainly concerned with is that small enterprises do not always have sufficient guarantees and a proven business track record to offer investors. However, if we could make use of expertise already available in terms of business experience by encouraging the establishment of a mentoring service through which successful business people would introduce new entrants to the sources of financing available, we could give Europeans in business the head start they need.</p>
<p class="contents">It is up to us now not to squander this opportunity. Seeing that the Americans are not yet out of our sight, Europe can meet this challenge by focusing on this sector: Let us not forget the potential for job creation and economic growth in such a huge and rapidly developing sector, provided we create the right environment for growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should also like us to remember, when devising this e-content programme, that we are concerned not only with information but also with knowledge and, moreover, with knowledge which favours integration and prevents social division. That is why I have proposed a lot of amendments to emphasise the importance of access for all. As has been said, information ought of course to be available to businesses, but it ought also to be accessible to everyone. I therefore want us to emphasise the possible democratic aspect of digital content or e-content.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to point out to the Commission that it chose not to define the term ‘digital content’ and that this gives me grounds for concern. I should like to know what will be included under the heading of ‘content’. If we include only content useful to businesses, particularly meteorological and geographical content (as is extremely desirable), it must not of course be forgotten that, where content intended for citizens is concerned, it is a much more complicated matter than of simply taking information useful to businesses. Citizens are involved because content relating to the arts, education, sport, tourism and so on, seems to me to be just as important. In implementing the programme, I therefore want us to have a requirement for a definition of what may constitute digital content.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in fact necessary to show concern for everyone. This means that digital content offers an opportunity to all those who have not had access to schooling, be it lifelong training or because they are handicapped, and I want digital content to make a better approach to such people possible.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, why deprive ourselves of digital content? Cultural and linguistic diversity is served by the e-content economic project, and I am pleased to know that we shall be able to support linguistic diversity thanks to digital content. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In order successfully to complete the ambitious development of this European e-content programme, the procedures envisaged need to be simplified and made secure. The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has studied this subject in terms of two specific aspects of the report: on the one hand, public access to documents and the commercial exploitation of information originating in the public sector; and on the other hand, the exchange of intellectual property rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Public sector information plays an important role when it comes to citizens’ participation and the expression of their freedoms, but it also represents an important potential resource for the European information market. The dual use, public and private, of this information justifies introducing a Community regulation which must respect the specific obligations of the public authorities as well, of course, as the confidentiality of personal data.</p>
<p class="contents">Cost must not act as a filter for access to the information from which commercial suppliers ought also to benefit. A common basis for billing and a common legal framework governing the right of access must therefore be defined, and this effectively means defining the very nature of this information to see whether or not it can be protected by copyright.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of exchanging intellectual property rights is to permit the realisation of digital content involving more than one format (video, music and text), with the payment of fees administered through a single European system. The goal is to stimulate the creation of digital content while protecting intellectual property rights in such a way as to ensure respect for beneficiaries and for consumers legally accessing the content.</p>
<p class="contents">Actions taken will have to take account of the future legal framework at present under discussion, designed in particular to define the exclusive rights of descendant beneficiaries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Information is the raw material of the content industry, and, in addition, multimedia fully exploits the opportunities afforded by the entertainment and leisure industry in order to increase production. There are no restrictions, as there were previously, to the supply of digital information. Digital content, which is more quantity than quality, standardises and prunes cultural and social diversity. Seventy per cent of the content of the Internet is in English, but Europe’s challenge is the greater utilisation of our rich linguistic heritage. Although linguistic differences might mean extra costs, multilingual content is an important precondition of democracy in the EU. To overcome problems we need a language industry which concentrates on customised linguistic services and diversifies the language infrastructure of digital content. Similarly, we need localisation of content production, which is a means of adapting products according to linguistic and cultural needs and the liking of consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Maximising quantity in the content industry might happen at the expense of the existence of linguistic as well as culturally and socially valuable content. For that reason, the objective behind public subsidies for the EU’s content industry must also be the achievement of high levels of education and culture in all its diversity. Nowadays it is not enough that people can read: new media reading skills will be actually just as important in the new millennium as traditional literacy. In the Committee on Budgets we have focused attention on the importance of content production and the utilisation of public information, and we consider that the resources set aside in the budget for the purpose have been very meagre. Nevertheless, we think it is a good start. At the same time, we would like to thank Mrs Gill for the enthusiasm and energy she has shown in formulating Parliament’s position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We shall be investing many millions of euros in the Net infrastructure; by the year 2003 it is expected that there will be more than a billion mobile phones in the world, and 85% of the European population will be using the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">The sums that will be invested here naturally bear no relation to the total investment in software, in digital content. So there is a huge gap that we must close as soon as possible, because we shall not only create jobs by installing transmitters, by the way we link them together and by the way we develop software; we shall also have to become prolific producers of digital content.</p>
<p class="contents">What do we have to do to encourage such production? First of all – and my thanks are due to Mr Seppänen for this – we took the same view in the Committee on Budgets as has been expressed here and now in the chamber and by the Committee on Industry External Trade, Research and Energy, namely that we need a massive injection of new funding for digital content. The PPE-DE Group will endorse Mrs Gill's suggestions, for which I thank her, and we too shall vote for an increased contribution, and I hope that our agreement with the Liberals and the other groups will be honoured and that we shall make a really massive effort to ensure that these budgetary priorities actually receive the volume of additional funding that we have proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point, which seems just as crucial to me, is that we must think about small and medium-sized enterprises, about business start-ups. I believe that many young university graduates and well-qualified young people from schools, colleges and companies are well able to start up new businesses in the domain of digital content and that this domain offers us new opportunities, including opportunities for cross-border cooperation with the countries applying for EU membership, because in countries where there are already numerous experts, training standards are quite high. We should actively seek such cooperation and develop joint strategies with the applicant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We also face a huge problem in connection with the conversion of analogue content into digital content. We must lend unstinting support to the transfer from analogue to digital. It is imperative that we offer our assistance here as a matter of urgency; we must develop career profiles, so that the education system can produce suitably qualified people, we must press ahead with the development of 'learning entertainment', and in the field of health care, we must try to offer structures that will guarantee us good health into our old age. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we want Europe to be a knowledge society, then we need to use the European digital content programme as our central reference point and as the main platform on which we base our design of this knowledge and information society. The European digital content is not wishful thinking or pie in the sky, which is why numerous suitors are currently wooing this dark object of their desire. The conflict between the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport over the acceptance of this report bears witness to the truth of what I say.</p>
<p class="contents">Why has this happened? Is it perhaps just a typical clash of powers? Certainly, to a degree; however, beneath it lies the nub of a serious problem. The problem, in my view, takes the form of a clash waiting to erupt. On the one hand, we have the content and its traditional producers, whose ambition is to bring their platform into the digital age, without their content losing its importance or independence, i.e. without their losing ownership of their production, which they naturally wish to renovate and extend.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we have the communications networks which need a constant supply of content in order to fill their web pages and which see nothing wrong in subordinating the content, in ransoming it and using it without paying any particular attention to the rules of production. The networks have cast themselves in the role of protagonist and are using the content without any discretion and often without any respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament must handle this clash very carefully. It is not in the European Union's interests to destroy the traditional structures and rules governing the production of the content. On the contrary, these structures and rules need to be upgraded, they need a renewed digital profile if they are to be put to better use and distributed more widely. It is important that we promote content in this direction. Cultural content in particular is in danger of waking up in a new environment in which literally nothing of the old environment remains. Music and the publication of books, for example, obey certain production and distribution rules. If we fail to renovate them, we shall end up in a cannibalistic situation in which authors and their works are the victims. A Europe of knowledge must not excite competition with the United States and thereby destroy the important structures of its symbolic capital, because this is what differentiates it, this is where its wealth, quality and pluralism lie. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For all the communication problems between the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Industry, our aim was ultimately the same, namely to secure a speedy, smooth and efficient decision. The much-vaunted cultural and linguistic diversity of Europe is indeed a frequent barrier, especially in the context of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">But if we make a virtue out of necessity and change the minuses into plus signs, if we consider our languages as bridges rather than obstacles, if we recognise and exploit the benefits they offer, they can form the foundations of a European market and lend us a certain independence. The oft-invoked closeness to the people can be put into practice to some extent through the use of language. The stumbling blocks of modern technology and the possible need to communicate in a foreign language can now be more easily overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The big questions now are how efficiently all interested parties will cooperate with each other and whether we shall be able to ensure not only that content is produced in sufficient volume but, more crucially, that it is also of a sufficiently high quality. The content providers, the creative element, the people who are ultimately responsible for the production of content, the very people who are targeted by the e-content programme should therefore be involved in the consultation process. The Greens are in favour of the report as adopted in committee.</p>

First of all, digital technology reminds us that it is high time we dug up a treasure that lies buried within all of us and made use of it in this digital age. I refer to the cultural diversity of Europe, and we have the opportunity to safeguard it for future generations with the aid of new technology. Digital content demonstrates that Europe is not only an economic community; it is also bound by common values, and it is our desire and our duty to use this programme to preserve our common treasure for future generations in a highly competitive world.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme therefore presents us with two opportunities: firstly it can help us to secure existing jobs and to create new ones, and secondly it offers us a unique opportunity to exploit to the full that cultural diversity which our language barriers have always prevented us from sharing and to ensure that it benefits everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn now to a second aspect of the programme. This programme relies to an unprecedented extent on public-private partnerships. In the cultural sphere, it is particularly important that we devise new forms of cooperation between the public and private sectors. That is why I am campaigning very vigorously for Parliament and its committees – the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport – to undertake a thorough analysis of the potential effects of this new form of cooperation between public and private funding bodies on the preservation of cultural diversity in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">May I conclude by thanking all those whose support has helped to ensure that the programme provides for the reallocation of funds in favour of linguistic and cultural measures.</p>

The programme and the report are therefore very important and, in connection with these, I want to thank the Commission and Commissioner Liikanen, as well as Mrs Gill.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not go back and discuss all the objectives of this programme which consist in creating conditions favourable to the sale, distribution and use of digital content in such a way as to encourage economic activity, broaden the scope of employment and encourage exploitation of the potential of European digital content over and against that of digital content from the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to emphasise the importance of the objective of promoting multilingualism in digital content on the world networks, particularly for European languages. I also want to say how important it is for citizens of the European Union to be able to develop professionally, socially and culturally and how important it is to avoid, in this area, the creation of that digital divide to which we refer so often in our debates.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore concerned here with a programme and a report which are very important both from economic and employment points of view and, once Parliament has voted on it, I want to see the programme quickly adopted by the Telecommunications Council which, I believe, is due to meet on 22 December.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I conclude, allow me to raise a final important point, a final question addressed to the Commission. If, on this issue of a digital divide, everyone is aware of the risk of seeing rifts open up between citizens, the Commission’s proposals are, in my view, not enough to prevent this from happening. That is why I support the amendments calling for specific steps to be taken in the field of new technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">In as much as I too am the rapporteur for one of the reports on the Telecom package, I think it is important for Europe to make arrangements and propose to us programmes for….</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Members of Parliament for their support for the Commission proposal. This wide participation of parliamentarians in this late debate is further proof of the interest shown in this important proposal. Promotion of European digital content is evidently and rightly a subject of interest to many parliamentary committees. The rapporteur, Mrs Gill, has succeeded in bringing together the different opinions in a balanced manner, with an important contribution from Mrs Fraisse and the Committee on Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me first say a few words on why we launched this initiative. The key role of content first. In order to exploit the strong European position in mobile telephony and digital TV it is key for a new range of services to emerge. European firms are in the best position to localise services geographically and tailor them culturally and linguistically to users' needs. We have to ensure that there is an environment conducive to these changes in Europe. Secondly, the Internet is going mobile. This means the appearance of personalised and localised services that respond to what consumers want, where they want, but the consumers are probably only willing to pay for this content if it is available in a culturally customised format and in their own language. Thus having the right conditions in place for European multilingual digital content production is becoming increasingly important.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to this challenge, the Commission has proposed a five-year programme with the aim of accelerating the process of transformation and filling the gap open in the mobile services: three specific lines with the help of strategic studies and input from market actors who are identified in the areas where impact at European level can be maximised, namely, stimulating the exploitation of public sector information, enhancing linguistic and cultural customisation, and supporting market enablers. The budget proposed by the Commission is EUR 150 m over five years. This programme has ambitious objectives and has to have appropriate means to achieve them. I would like to thank Parliament for its strong support for the budget of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me comment on some of the amendments proposed by Parliament. First, on the social and cultural function of digital content, the Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament emphasises the social and cultural dimension of digital content. The Commission supports these amendments which bring out this dimension even more clearly than in its original formulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, on economic dimension content. The idea of e-content is to marry the social and cultural dimension content with its economic value in order to maximise its expected value. In this respect the report stresses the need to invest in the linguistic and cultural customisation part of the proposal. We welcome these elements.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, on the simplification of procedures and payment delays. This is an important point and I agree whole-heartedly with the rapporteur. We have to have put in place fast and simplified procedures for the execution of programmes. In this connection it is worthwhile to notice that as part of the administrative reform, the Commission has recently adopted a communication on the simplification of its decision-making procedures. We intend to make maximum use of these measures and reduce as much as possible the time between the presentation of a project proposal and a decision on its financing.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, out of 49 amendments voted by the committee, let me say that the Commission can support 23 as they are, and 15 are acceptable in principle subject to reformulation. The remaining 11 are not directly compatible with the objectives of this specific programme, or would stretch its mandate beyond what can be achieved with the financial means associated with it. Some of them are indeed very valuable in themselves but are better placed in other instruments than in the present decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me thank you once again for the report. At this stage it is expected that the Telecoms Council of 22 December will reach a political agreement on the proposal. This is necessary in order to start the action early in 2001.</p>
