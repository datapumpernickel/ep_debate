<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schörling (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, I am very pleased that I have been entrusted with being rapporteur for the second reading of the SEA Directive which I believe is an important step towards a new form of behaviour in environmental policy. I want to thank all my fellow MEPs in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, together with the Commission and, in particular, the Portuguese Presidency for the excellent way in which they have cooperated.</p>
<p class="contents">This draft directive concerns strategic environmental assessments which, in brief, involve a systematic process for identifying, analysing and assessing the influence and likely effects of plans and programmes upon the environment. The assessments are to be carried out at as early a stage as possible in the planning process, partly so that alternative solutions might be found before the decision-making process is taken any further. Environmental reports are to be written and made available to the environmental authorities, the public and environmental organisations, which are also to be given sufficient time within which to respond to the reports.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very important directive for the whole of the Community’s environmental policy if a tool is to be obtained which makes it easier to comply with the commitments to sustainable development and compliance with the precautionary principle which have been made in the Treaty and in other agreements. A modern environmental policy worthy of the name must do everything to ensure that damage to the environment does not occur and that effects upon the environment are minimised. What often happens nowadays is that attempts are made to identify and repair damage once it has occurred. As early as at the planning stage, we must learn to use policy areas, plans and programmes to avoid and reduce the negative effects and influence upon the environment. The SEA Directive constitutes a very important step towards an approach of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, this draft directive makes no mention of policy areas, in spite of the fact that they figure in the Commission’s original draft from 1991 and in spite of the fact that all researchers in this area actually take it for granted that policy areas too must be included in a strategic environmental assessment. It was not possible to achieve this in the Council, but the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy considered that policy areas too must be included in the review to be carried out in five years’ time. This has been discussed in Amendments 2 and 21.</p>
<p class="contents">A crucial argument when the Commission finally tabled this proposal in 1996 was that the assessment at project level enters the decision-making process much too late. In actual fact, this is one of the main points in the directive – that an environmental assessment should be made early on in the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">At first reading, the European Parliament had quite a lot of points of view. The proposal was thought to be heading in the right direction but in many areas, it did not go far enough. Parliament tabled 29 amendments, of which 15 are more or less to be found in the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">If the SEA is to be a genuinely useful tool, the directive must be sufficiently broad in scope and the environmental report and the assessments must naturally be of very high quality. In the common position, the Council has now made the text worse in a number of areas, specifically when it comes, for example, to the scope of the directive and the definition of what it is to cover. The Commission too was very, very critical of the common position because it was far too limited in relation to the original text.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has tried to restore something of the balance, for example by means of Amendments 6 and 7 which broaden the scope of the directive by not limiting it only to plans and programmes linked to EIA projects. We do not permit whole categories of plans and programmes to be exempt. Nor can we accept that financial plans and the whole of the defence sector are exempt from strategic environmental assessments. This is discussed in Amendment 10, which also proposes that structural funds must also of course be covered by strategic environmental assessments next time around. Other amendments which improve the directive concern greater transparency and openness to inspection and the need also to cooperate and consult with countries outside the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally am very surprised at Amendment 26 from Mr Nassauer and 29 other MEPs who want to reject the common position. This possibility was not mentioned at all in the Committee’s discussion. Clearly, they are fully entitled to make this proposal, but do they really think that the EU’s environmental policy is something extraneous which is not in any way binding? Should the European Parliament just not bother about the text of the Treaty, the Cardiff Agreement, the Fifth Environmental Programme and so on? I really do not think that the proposal is a genuinely serious one.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments 11 and 31 also worry me a little. Amendment 11, in particular, says that the Member States should define at what level SEAs are to be carried out if plans and programmes are part of a hierarchical system. In this way, the whole idea of arranging an SEA is called into question, so I hope these amendments do not go through. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bowis (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, this is a small but significant measure to extend the duties of Member States to carry out strategic environmental assessments on the planning framework as well as on the actual plans where the implementation would or could have a significant impact on the environment. All Member States voted for the common position, but some made it clear that they would go very little further than that. Our task is to clarify and to amend responsibly and on behalf of the PPE-DE Group I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Schörling, on the work she has done and the consultation she has had with us. We will however be rejecting some of her amendments, notably those that seek to extend the system to all financial plans, to defence and civil defence, to consultation beyond what is reasonable and to the general policies she has just mentioned, which become more of a wish-list than firm proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we agree that it makes no sense to exclude projects financed wholly or partially by the European Union, especially structural funds, and we certainly agree that it makes sense to talk to neighbouring states outside the European Union. We agree that there should be adequate reporting back, not only on the environmental risks identified by the assessment, but on the action it is proposed to take to mitigate or remove them. We also of course have to consider Amendment No 26, in the name of some of our German colleagues, which rejects the common position. I understand the concerns of colleagues from Germany and some parts of Italy. These result from the way in which some governments and regional governments have chosen to implement the assessments. These governments are giving environmental assessment and Europe a bad name for what are entirely excesses of their own making and they need to look carefully at their domestic policies.</p>
<p class="contents">But this is a subsidiarity measure which leaves the details to Member States. It is not the big hand of Europe extending control to local planning matters. It does, however, ensure that particularly at our respective borders our planning takes account of the environment quality within and across our borders when planning frameworks are being agreed. We believe that to be a good thing and my PPE-DE Group will therefore not be supporting Amendment No 26 and will vote for the common position. We shall then vote for the amendments we supported in committee and for one further clarifying amendment which has been submitted since, but we shall oppose the amendments which we believe are a step too far in terms of what is desirable, practical and acceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The obligation to carry out an environmental impact assessment at an extremely early stage of town and country planning activities does, in fact, make it possible to incorporate environmental concerns fully right from the conception of town and country planning plans and programmes. The Union has at last realised that we can no longer restrict ourselves to merely picking up the pieces following damage caused by short-sighted planning, but that the damage must be averted as early on as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment substantially improve the Council's common position.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it was upheld that, in order to exert any real influence over national customs, the scope of the directive must be as wide as possible. In this context, I feel that plans and projects financed from the Structural Funds must without exception be governed by the directive, seeing that, in practice, they represent all the programmes implemented, particularly in regions whose development is lagging behind.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the principle of consultation and provision of information to the public and the organisations concerned throughout the assessment process, in compliance with the Aarhus Convention, has been reestablished.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel that this is a sound text overall. I understand the concerns of the Members coming from countries organised according to a Federal State model, who fear that the local authorities will be overloaded with work, but I feel that the amendments, particularly Amendments Nos 19, 29 and 31, are sufficient to avoid an overlap between the two directives and still ensure respect for the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last Sunday, I was listening to a Swedish radio programme which said that, in central Sweden, people would have to adjust to the fact that rainfall would increase by 50 per cent over the next few years. In one way or another, environmental questions are always the subject of public opinion nowadays. They must therefore feature in a better way in political work, too. I therefore want to congratulate Mrs Schörling on a very good report which proposes that environmental aspects must be taken into consideration at an early stage. In principle, environmental issues must permeate all activities, economic activity above all perhaps.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to plans, building projects etc, it is of course important, as proposed in this report, to take account of environmental aspects as early as possible so that mistakes and increased costs can be avoided and the right solution found as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is extremely important and commendable that Mrs Schörling should propose that the scope of the directive should be broadened. It is a matter of urgency that economic activity should be included in the environmental assessment. It is transparently obvious to the EU, which invests a very large part of its budget in the agricultural sphere, in regional policy and in the structural funds, that these areas should be examined from an environmental point of view. We cannot go in and do this directly but should do so as quickly as possible whenever new plans come out. It is unreasonable to do what is at present done with EU funds and to support such activities within these sectors as are opposed from an environmental point of view in other contexts.</p>
<p class="contents">We must try to create a system in which we think in environmental terms from the very beginning, even when it comes to economic problems. This is a major and important issue. I realise that large sections of this House do not agree with me, but my group and I completely support Mrs Schörling in this connection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are basically in favour of the proposal of the Environment Committee and its rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the inclusion of some of the sectors in the directive, in particular the extractive industry and the defence industry, we believe that they should not be left out. Provided, of course, that the necessary precautions are taken.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress the importance of the inclusion of the management of water resources. An ambitious government plan will be presented soon in Spain, the National Hydrological Plan, which will have a clear impact on the places where it is put into practice. We feel it is essential that these assessment studies should be carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">Also very important to us is the role of the public, i.e. transparency. There is a directive on the right to information, No 313, which has been repeatedly ignored by the Member States and by local and regional authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Likewise, we must include the quality of the studies and the issue of health amongst the significant sectors affected. High environmental standards and good health are very closely related. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is of course a cost factor in environmental management, but equally an economic return, which not easily quantified but exists none the less.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed directive, which requires an environmental assessment before the adoption of a regional or county plan, makes good environmental and economic sense. Far too often in the past we have seen costly development plans collapse because of environmental considerations that were not addressed at the initial planning stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would appeal to professional planners to use their common sense by taking account of the views of public representatives and community groups. A textbook approach of the kind seen far too often has not always served to meet citizens' requirements in this important area. Planning must not become the sole preserve of those who have an academic qualification. Elected Members must exercise greater care and concern when drawing up development policies that will ultimately affect Union citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this way, we can ensure that environmental concerns form a more integral part of the economy. Indeed, decisions at macro-economic level too should be accompanied by a preliminary strategic environmental impact assessment. It is therefore important for public administrations to be very aware of the usefulness of this exercise in order to prevent environmental damage as far as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">It is equally important for us to clearly outline which plans require environmental impact assessments and which do not. The Council has dealt with this extensively. I am in favour of submitting policy proposals, including environmental impact assessments, to public administrations. In that case, a public administration may decide to scrap a plan, programme or proposal, call these off in good time or replace them by environmentally-friendly alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, there is a substantial risk of too many plans and programmes being subjected to environmental impact assessments. If extensive studies are carried out of plans and programmes whose impact on the environment is negligible, then this is a waste of energy. What is more, the instrument as such is being weakened. So in this light, including all financial plans, as proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection would therefore be going too far. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this way we will avoid the problems we have at the moment with regard to harmonisation of the use of land, financial activity, and the expectations of the public. There is in existence a strategic evaluation of the impact on the environment that applies not only to town planning but also agricultural, transport, travel and energy sector programmes, among others. In order for us to be able to harmonise all these important aspects and proceed in an environmentally and socially sustainable way we need plans that are sufficiently long-term in nature: long-term inasmuch as they act as genuine guidelines for separate and independent measures. In this connection I have to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite natural that Structural Funds programmes, plans and measures should be included in any examination of this issue. It is also important that we take the proper course of action at different levels, and not act in too complicated or bureaucratic a manner, but take account of the new information we get all the time. In this respect there has perhaps been too much anxiety about overlap, but I hope that, after this debate, this report will be as successful as possible as far as this is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a delicate flower and we all want it to be a success. I also want it to be well received by my electorate back home. Hence I sometimes ask myself the questions that they ask themselves. When I look at the Council’s proposal, I assume that people will ask themselves this: how can the EU introduce an assessment regime that excludes the plans and projects financed by the European Union itself? This is completely unacceptable, and that is precisely how I see it. The scope of application must be extended to include areas that are financed by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the people of Germany, in particular, may well ask themselves why the assessments are to be carried out at state level, national level, regional administration level, and at local level, which will drag the procedures out. This is indefensible in my view. It is the real issues that count, not having the same thing assessed at every level. Therefore we must make it clear that a duplication of effort must be avoided. Accordingly, Guido Sacconi’s Amendment No 31 has my unequivocal support.</p>
<p class="contents">A third question the people may ask themselves is this: why is nothing happening now that an assessment has taken place which may have raised certain issues? Therefore we must make it clear that the regulation is binding. We certainly cannot have a situation where an assessment is carried out and the findings are then filed away, never to be seen again. We need a binding commitment to the effect that any findings will be acted on. Therefore, I emphatically support Amendments Nos 17 and 18, which provide for us to make the transposition of environmental protection measures following assessment a little more binding in nature. With this in mind, I wish Mrs Schörling’s report every success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to highlight the quality of the report which we are debating today and I would like to talk about what I see as the most significant problems raised in the various amendments that have been tabled and the interventions of the various Members. My sincere thanks for all your comments and points of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the key questions, I would firstly like to mention those amendments which involve broadening the scope of the future directive. The joint position clearly distinguishes the plans for which the strategic environmental assessment is obligatory from those for which it is necessary to make a selection, a screening. The Commission is inclined towards this approach, provided that the joint position is improved, because we believe that otherwise it would be insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there must be a balance between the plans for which the strategic environmental assessment is obligatory and those for which we have to make a selection.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the scope of the directive must, in any event, be sufficiently broad and systematically include those plans which have a significant impact on the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the Commission enthusiastically supports some of Parliament’s amendments which broaden the scope of this directive and do so in a balanced fashion, such as, for example, the second and fifth sections of Amendment No 5, which have been mentioned by the rapporteur and also by some other speakers, such as Mrs González, which proposes also including extractive activities. We also support Amendment No 6.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we believe that some amendments go too far and propose the strategic environmental assessment for plans which will not probably have a significant impact on the environment. For example, section 4 of Amendment No 5 would make these assessments obligatory for all the plans for the sectors listed in the directive. The third section of Amendment No 10 would mean an unnecessary burden for the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Some amendments limit the directive’s scope even further and actually contradict what I have just said. Certain amendments would reduce the scope, such as Amendment No 3, which limits the scope to the plans financed by the EU, or Amendments Nos 11 and 31, which allow States to choose the level or levels of planning with which these strategic environmental assessments will be carried out. This would exclude many plans which have an impact on the environment. Now, if Parliament were to adopt these amendments together with those which broaden the scope to plans with no significant impact, it seems to me that we would end up with a text which is inconsistent with itself.</p>
<p class="contents">These amendments seem to be inspired by the fear of the assessment being duplicated. In my view, this fear is not sufficiently justified. Planning is usually carried out at various levels and each one has its own specific characteristics. The carrying out of assessments at various levels of planning is not a duplication of the assessment, especially given the safeguards contained in Articles 4, 5 and 10 of the joint position which are intended to prevent just the kind of duplication which Mr Lange, for example, referred to.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would point out the amendments which establish the procedures for planning and programming the screening and the definition of the scope of the assessment – Amendments Nos 7, 8 and 13 – and which require the screening to be carried out on a case by case basis, with the participation of the public in all cases. I believe that the objective of the screening and the definition of the scope of the assessment is to determine, quickly and efficiently, which plans and which environmental problems are the most relevant. Establishing the best way to deal with these issues will require practical experience. We therefore believe it is too soon to establish that all circumstances justify a screening and a broad scope. We therefore believe that, by incorporating the provisions on the screening and the definition of the scope into their national legislation, Member States would be liable to exceed the requirements of the directive and, for that reason, we will not accept these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor will we accept the amendment which implies a rejection of the joint text – Amendment No 26 – which contradicts the other approaches. I do not believe it is necessary to point out that this directive on the strategic environmental assessment is a key instrument for integrating the environment into policies and for promoting sustainable development in the European Union. I believe that a rejection of the joint position would deal a serious blow to these principles which are at the heart of the Treaties and which must inspire all our policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that this may seem insufficient to some of you, but we must appreciate that sometimes it is not always best to seek perfection. I believe that we should seek something acceptable, which would be a step forward, rather than reach a deadlock. Mr President, having carefully examined all the amendments, I can tell you that the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 5 (sections 2 and 5), 6, 12, 28 (section 1) and 29. Amendments Nos 9 (the part which refers to the requirement to justify that the strategic environmental assessment is not necessary), 10 (sections 1 and 2), 15, 17, 18, 20, 23, 24 and 25 are acceptable in principle, providing that there is some rewording of its content. The Commission cannot, however, under any circumstances, accept Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 5 (sections 1, 3 and 4), 7, 8, 9 (in the part on the requirement to justify the need for a strategic environmental assessment), 10 (section 3), 11, 13, 14, 16, 19, 21, 22, 26, 27, 28 (section 2), 30 and 31. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
