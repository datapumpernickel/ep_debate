<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catherine Ashton, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span><span class="bold">−</span> Mr President, as we already touched upon in Question Hour, the issue of the Iranian nuclear programme is of great concern for all of the European Union and for the international community as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Colleagues have already mentioned that, at the Foreign Affairs Council on 23 January, we discussed the issue in the context of agreeing new sanctions. As I indicate on all occasions, we are committed to maintaining this pressure on the Iranian authorities to comply with their international obligations, and it is a key element of the twin-track approach along with the E3+3 process which, as you are aware, I lead.</p>
<p class="contents">We have several UN Security Council resolutions but in spite of them Iran continues to violate its obligations. It does not cooperate fully with the IAEA and it accelerates the expansion of its nuclear programme. In early January it started operations to enrich uranium to a level of near 20% at the underground facility at Qom, a site controlled by the military.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members know that for a number of years serious concerns have been expressed concerning the lack of cooperation from Iran in resolving these outstanding issues, including those that point to the military dimension of its nuclear programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The IAEA report of November 2011 presented findings on its activities relating to developments of military nuclear technology. On that basis, the Board of Governors adopted by overwhelming majority a resolution that expressed increasing concern on the Iranian nuclear programme. I hope that the work that we do demonstrates our commitment to efforts aimed at achieving a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear issue, the second part of the twin track.</p>
<p class="contents">I have written to Dr Jalili, my counterpart, setting out proposals which would allow Iran to gain benefits in the nuclear, political and economic field but, despite reminders, I have so far received no response to proposals to enter into a confidence-building process based on reciprocity and a step-by-step approach. We have always expressed our readiness to address, in the framework of confidence-building, other issues of concern which may be of interest for Iran, for example cooperation in the area of counter-narcotics.</p>
<p class="contents">I take every opportunity to reiterate this message to the Iranian side, most recently in my discussions with Foreign Minister Salehi and in parallel by using my contacts with third countries, particularly Turkey, to pass the message to Iran that the door remains open for negotiations through this confidence-building process which could be launched as soon as Iran demonstrates its readiness to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is against the background of that approach that the Council adopted further measures. It was an important step. It showed EU unity and EU leadership. These measures are designed to specifically and significantly affect Iran’s financial capacity to pursue that nuclear programme by curtailing its revenue from crude oil exports. The sanctions on oil are of particular significance because of their effect on the revenue of the Iranian Government. Oil exports count for about 80% percent of Iran’s exports and 70% of government revenues. The EU imports amount to 20% of Iran’s oil exports. So by specifically targeting this important source of revenue we are strongly increasing the pressure on the Iranian Government, whilst avoiding as far as we possibly can negative effects on the Iranian population.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not stand alone in this. UN sanctions continue to be in force. On 31 December 2011 the United States decided to strengthen further its sanctions against Iran, targeting in particular the Iranian financial system and revenues from different sources including from oil exports. We now need to convince as many like-minded countries as we can, in particular those who import Iranian oil, to take similar steps and consider reducing their import of that oil. This will maximise the effect of the sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">The prohibition is taking place in a phased manner, allowing us to adjust to the new situation, and a review has been built in to take stock of the effect of the measure in the course of the coming months and address any problems that may arise. By doing so we have ensured that the EU and Member States will be able to have the time and means to adjust and ensure the continuity of their energy supplies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I just want to mention that we also continue to have grave concerns about the human rights situation in Iran. This relates in particular to ongoing oppression of the political opposition, but also to the increasing use and excessive application of the death penalty. In reaction to the repression and the dramatic increase in executions there has been since April 2011 an EU sanctions regime against Iran addressing the human rights situation. It targets specifically those people complicit in or responsible for these grave human rights violations and, since it was strengthened in October, it now includes 61 people. A prohibition on the supply of equipment that could be used for oppression is also part of our sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">So I believe that our approach is the right one – continuing our pressure on Iran, continuing to push for negotiations – and I look forward very much to hearing from honourable Members on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This Parliament will support the Council conclusions in the resolution we will vote on tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">As you have just explained, it was difficult because it required sacrifices by several Member States, and it was consistent because it is in keeping with the positions we have defended so far. Both the President of France and the Prime Ministers of France and the United Kingdom have said that they will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as well as being consistent, these measures need to be effective in order to promote the path of dialogue, bring Iran back to the negotiating table, ensure its full cooperation with the inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and also, Baroness Ashton, to silence the drums of war that can be heard. Israel has said that all options are being considered, and one Republican candidate in the United States has said that swift action should be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, some Iranian ministers have said that these sanctions will be ineffective, because the EU needs Iranian crude oil more that Iran needs the EU’s resources. What is more, the threat to close the Strait of Hormuz and the risk of escalating tension in the region could have serious repercussions for oil prices and further complicate the difficult economic situation we are going through.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, Baroness Ashton, I would like to say to you that, beyond the internal dimension and the consistency that were shown in the Council decisions of 23 January, it is also important to take action with our allies at this stage as regards our external scope and influence. You just told us that you visited India; the stance taken by India, Japan and other countries is vital to ensure that the measures adopted can have the effect that many of us are hoping for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will continue to play its destabilising role both globally and regionally, based on a lack of transparency as regards its nuclear programme and its position as the world’s third largest exporter of crude oil.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the fact that it is the world’s third largest oil exporter means that the oil industry, as you said, represents 80% of Iran’s income, and that could make our sanctions more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Baroness Ashton, although Israel and the Republican Party in the United States have reached a level of tension that is unacceptable to us, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament totally and expressly rules out the military option. We support the European twin-track approach that you mentioned, and we support proportionate sanctions aimed at companies, political leaders and economic agents, thereby minimising their impact on the general population. However, Baroness Ashton, the EU should reactivate the second part of that twin track, namely, diplomacy. We should stay focused on the rigorous inspections carried out by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and on Iran’s acceptance of all the safety measures the IAEA imposes in exchange for the production of enriched uranium for civil use, as permitted by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">The point is not to limit ourselves – as you did in the letter you addressed to the Iranian negotiator in October – to demanding that Iran relinquish its capacity to enrich uranium as a precondition for dialogue. The IAEA should take every available measure to monitor Iran’s uranium production, and in turn we should create trust-building conditions and measures, with a broader and more ambitious agenda in our relations with Iran. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU is strong when it stands united and leads, as the Vice-President/High Representative has said. Let us see more of it.</p>
<p class="contents">However, isolating Iran is not a success or goal as such. The ALDE Group would urge the Vice-President/High Representative to work with Turkey and other partners, to do everything possible, to use all diplomatic means available to encourage Iranian officials to engage in meaningful negotiations over the nuclear issue. This also means looking into different ways in which Iran might be persuaded, and not just at sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU should also look at having a permanent representation in Iran and eventually open an EU representation on the ground, to relay more directly our joint concerns over human rights violations, besides our vital role in the E3+3 negotiations. May I remind some Members on the conservative side of this House especially, that sanctions are an ultimate means and not a goal in and of themselves. I am proud and glad that the EU has always clearly distinguished between seeking to impact individuals with responsibilities for either the nuclear programme or human rights violations, but not the Iranian population. They, after all, feel largely unrepresented by their political, military or religious leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore even more important that the EU acts independently of the United States, especially in an election year. The US has consistently chosen different sanctions packages to the EU, but the US sanctions also impact EU businesses by imposing not only direct but also indirect sanctions. I believe food and medicine should always be able to reach the Iranian people.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point that is of particular importance for the people in Iran, especially the young generation, and that is the role that technologies can play in either enhancing or threatening human rights. I believe the EU should take its responsibility in ensuring, at least, that no repressive technologies are exported to such repressive regimes, and this we can do now without controversy.</p>

Many of us, however, are also very concerned at the possible negative effects on the Iranian population. Parliament’s opinion has always been that there cannot be a military solution to a nuclear conflict with Iran. We should not leave any ambiguity about this question and the Greens have proposed an amendment to this effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has a dual-track approach to sanctions and negotiations. Sanctions have been enforced. Now it is time for negotiations. The question is: how can we open up for negotiations? The Iranians have said they are willing, and I think one of the things the EU has to accept is that the Iranians will not suspend all uranium enrichment as a precondition for sanctions. We strongly urge all parties to negotiate seriously and without preconditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Iran and the West have taken turns in rejecting each other’s offers for compromise, and several opportunities have been missed because the phases of goodwill between E3+3 and Iran were not synchronised. I hope this will not be the case in the future. We would also like to see Turkey and Brazil involved in the negotiations. They were proposing compromises in this respect and would be good partners to have included. If we manage to continue negotiations, this could then open a new historical window to the nuclear-weapon-free Middle East. The EU should support actively this UN conference and be helpful in setting a road map for this process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greens think that the EU should also set a good example and give up nuclear energy, as Germany has decided. The example of Iran clearly shows there is no way to clearly separate nuclear activities for civilian uses and the use of the same technologies for military aims.</p>
<p class="contents">As a goodwill gesture showing the EU’s readiness for dialogue, we should finally open an EU representation in Tehran and Iran should receive security guarantees, as it is very difficult to bring a country to the negotiating table under a permanent threat of war. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They also pose a potential risk to peace in the Middle East, with an existential threat to the State of Israel in particular. They are also likely to lead to a regional arms race, with neighbouring Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia also wishing to acquire such nuclear weapons if Iran is allowed to possess one in breach of its NPT international legal obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">We must now all hope that measures agreed by the European Union, even with political support from countries like Greece, Spain and Italy, which are large importers of Iranian oil, will put economic pressure on the regime and make it much harder for the leadership to move money around the world and will force Tehran to come back to the negotiating table. It shows that when there is a clear and urgent need for action the EU does not always dither and dodge the issue. This is Europe speaking as one voice for once on the most serious global threat and I would encourage Iran to start listening.</p>
<p class="contents">Traditionally Iran should also showcase the legacy of its glorious Persian culture. Instead it is sadly one of the most brutal, theocratic dictatorships in the world, having suppressed all opposition to the last flawed presidential elections, and a country which carries out shocking public executions of homosexuals, those guilty of so-called sexual misdemeanours, including minors, as well as exporting terrorism via its proxies, such as Hezbollah, to neighbouring countries. It also regularly interferes in neighbouring countries, from Bahrain to militarily propping up the Syrian Ba’athist dictatorship. All the more reason, therefore, why it must never become a nuclear power. Contrary to what some have said, no future or further options to prevent this should be excluded from the negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is, however, that there is currently no evidence for the existence of Iran’s nuclear weapons programme.

A current US study also talks of limited opportunities for uranium enrichment for military purposes.</p>

I, too, am of the opinion that the sanctions need to be stepped up and that they must be imposed in such a way that they are not counterproductive and they do not result in solidarity between the population and the regime, but rather have the opposite effect.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we should make it clear that this regime, which is a true dictatorship, is not complying with the conditions of non-proliferation and that, for that reason, measures in accordance with the UN resolutions, in other words like those now being taken by the European Union, have to be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I also believe that the regime should be warned against attempting to take action in the Strait of Hormuz, because that is not in the interests of the regime. After all, with our proposals and with these sanctions, which are also directed at a larger section of the population, particularly that consisting of the undertakings of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, we want to try to make it clear that the European Union is seeking an approach that will not require any military action and that, if these sanctions are not intended to take effect until 1 July, there is also still time to prevent this from happening if the message is properly understood.</p>
<p class="contents">Baroness Ashton, I would like to thank you for saying that these messages will be conveyed through our decisions and discussions and through partners like Turkey, but I hope they will also be conveyed to a greater extent by countries like Russia and China, which need to accept their responsibility in this regard so that a clear message is sent out from the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, on this basis, we should be able not only to stabilise a regime, but also to ensure that the world does not become less safe and that this sort of regime does not become equipped with rockets and nuclear weapons. No one has anything against a peaceful nuclear model, and I believe that, for that reason, this regime should at long last be prepared to cooperate with the international community so that no one has any reason to take military action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We say that we are strengthening sanctions, but are we sending strong enough warnings to all European agents that sanctions are not to be circumvented this time? This is a very dangerous year, with US elections on the horizon and intense sabre rattling in some quarters in the US, Israel, and even in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU should rule out a military solution which can only spell disaster for the region and beyond, notably Israel. Instead, in our dual-track approach, we should consider exploring a broader settlement by all diplomatic means. We could do this by recognising Iran as a regional power and establishing a diplomatic mission in Tehran and by shifting the non-proliferation focus to an internationally controlled fuel bank which Iran could access. We could create a weapons-of-mass-destruction-free Middle East by working for regional security and economic arrangements, which would include Saudi Arabia and possibly Israel, thus guaranteeing inviolability of current borders and economic progress for the region. And we could send clear support and solidarity to the Iranian people, namely those fighting for basic human rights, making clear that sanctions will not target the people and produce counterproductive effects that would only fuel the opportunistic propaganda of the regime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I consider this to be the sensible and right thing to do and I am amazed to hear many fellow Members saying that there is no proof of military intent or that it is not possible to distinguish between civil and military use. We only need to look at the facts. Iran has 5 000 kg of uranium that is enriched to 3%. That is what is needed for energy production. However, it already has 75 kg that is enriched to 20%, and the only explanation for that is that it is planning to use it for military purposes. The enrichment needs to be pushed to 90%. That is technically complex, but by no means impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">All of the facts, including the most recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), indicate that military use is intended here. In other words, we have a predictable period here in which the whole scenario will enfold, and it is therefore right for the European Parliament to now increase the pressure. The same applies with regard to the delivery systems, commonly known as missiles. The Iranians are obviously working on medium- and long-range missiles. This brings the urgency of the situation even more clearly into focus. It would have been better if the oil embargo had been put into effect immediately – although I fully understand the need of some Member States to find means of diversification. However, that will also give Iran the opportunity to find ways round this.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the joint parliamentary resolution received broad support. I am also pleased about the particularly constructive role of the IAEA, in particular since Yukiya Amano took over the position of Director General. That is extremely helpful, and I am also pleased to see the positive and constructive role that Turkey has been playing recently with regard to this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Civil use of nuclear energy is impossible to control. We therefore need to do everything we can to ensure that there is a worldwide move away from nuclear power and towards global nuclear disarmament, and specifically in this case towards a nuclear weapon-free zone in the Middle East – and we must do so in a peaceful way.</p>
<p class="contents">Until then, the current treaties will apply. As worthy of criticism as the regime in Iran is, it should be noted that, unlike India, Israel, North Korea and Pakistan, Iran has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. It therefore exercises the right to the civil use of nuclear energy guaranteed to all states that have signed this Treaty. That is dangerous – just as it is dangerous in other countries. No one thinks – quite rightly – of taking military action against all the states that have nuclear power plants, or penalising them with sanctions. Neither the secret services nor the most recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency provide solid evidence that Iran is building, preparing or planning nuclear weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet blatant threats of war have been made against Iran for many years on precisely this pretext. In addition, there is an increasingly aggressive economic war being waged with the intention of destabilising the country. This policy, ladies and gentlemen, is a serious danger to world peace and limits the opportunities for progressive opposition in Iran. As is so often the case, it seems very much as though peace and human rights are to fall victim to the global interests of the United States and the EU.</p>

In other words, the oil boycott would not achieve the desired effect and the EU would be placed at an even greater disadvantage in geostrategic terms.</p>

It concerns the toughest sanctions imposed on the Tehran regime so far. After freezing the assets of a long list of companies and individuals in Iran and restricting exports of sensitive products and investments in the field of hydrocarbons in Iran, the next logical step was to sanction oil resources, which have a strategic importance for this country.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of sanctions is never something that is made lightly. In the case of Iran, these measures are all the more necessary as the risk of nuclear proliferation linked to the Iranian programme causes increasing concern. I believe, therefore, that it is very important that the EU has shown decisiveness, in the absence of a clear answer from Iran to the proposal of resuming the negotiations. Toughening the sanctions and our firm tone are a clear indication for the Iranians that we will not accept the continuation of the nuclear programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, for those who argue that sanctions are ineffective or even counterproductive, I would like to point out two aspects that I believe to be important: sanctions so far have actually hindered the Iranian nuclear programme and have prevented Iran from obtaining the nuclear bomb. On the other hand, Iran started to show signs that these measures have an effect on its economy. Sanctions are therefore the key to resolving the nuclear crisis and can bring Iran back to the negotiation table.</p>

I believe that the intransigence of the Iranian regime – and that is clearly a serious understatement – leaves no other option than the imposition of strong sanctions, although I admit that I do also have some mixed feelings.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know – you are the expert, and we undoubtedly have other experts – whether there are many known examples of cases where sanctions have also effectively led to regime change. It is a tool that always attracts the necessary criticism. That is all well and good, but we need to get behind it.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been a couple of important comments in the extensive debate that we have had here. I, along with my whole group, take the view that these sanctions must not represent a stepping stone to military interventions or to an armed conflict in the region and in Iran. I believe that that must be clear and I do not believe that we need the military threat in order to be able to bear our teeth. I believe that a military conflict would be bad for the region, bad for Iran and also for Europe, and that it is therefore not an option.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in a broader context – and I am very pleased, Baroness Ashton, that you also made reference to this – I still have a great many concerns about the situation of the Iranian populace and human rights. In this area, too, there are things we can improve in our own back yard. There are still businesses in the European Union whose technology is sold and used to oppress people in Iran, for example via communications technologies, whether communications technologies used to listen in or spy on people or, for example, to deny them free access to the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, too, Baroness Ashton, I think that we need to make sure that we get our own house in order. I hope that you and the Commission will do what is necessary to ensure that that is the case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not certain that Western diplomacy is the right approach to Iran. They are entitled to respect and their history, which goes back 4000 years, needs to be taken into consideration. I should like to make three points. The first has to do with the fine line we need to tread when we impose sanctions, in terms of who is most affected by them, the elite in government or the people. I fear that it is the people who will pay in this case and that the result will be the opposite of what we are trying to achieve. The second has to do with energy sanctions. Energy includes multiannual, 40 to 50-year contracts, large infrastructures and increased prices for consumer goods throughout the entire planet. How is it possible to disregard all this and to set a procedure in motion which may create huge economic problems not only in Europe, but throughout the entire world?

As many colleagues have said, this is a brittle regime not concerned with the human rights of its citizens, and one which has posed a constant threat to the State of Israel and contributes to the tinder box situation in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore quite right that appropriate sanctions are put in place in order to encourage Iran to enter into negotiations. A further escalation of the nuclear programme, which is undoubtedly about developing nuclear weapons, or attempts at acts such as closing the Strait of Hormuz, would be entirely unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the resolution of the international community in this matter. The decision by the UK, the US and French Governments in sending warships and the aircraft carrier through the waters of the Strait of Hormuz sent the right signal. It is important that we have one voice and the resolve to stand together to protect the safety of our citizens, but these must not only be about dialogue and diplomacy: we need to retain the threat that actually we will take action if this continues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report by the International Atomic Energy Agency confirms that Iran has the knowledge and the desire to develop nuclear weapons. Iran has repeatedly tried to keep hidden from the IAEA the truth of its actions and to impede the work of the IAEA inspectors – as it is doing now.</p>
<p class="contents">Internationally Iran has threatened to take military action against our allies and to block the Strait of Hormuz. Internally we see more and more repression of democratic movements, and that really concerns us. There is no hope that the March elections in the country will bring about any change in those policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore the European Union has no choice but to act, and it was right to impose sanctions. The current threats from Iran make it clear that we can no longer support this undemocratic regime by buying their oil. Right now we have to put pressure on Iran to engage fully in negotiations. These negotiations cannot be just a talking shop or a sham to play for more time but must seek to halt and clarify the nuclear programme. Baroness Ashton, you should not accept anything other than straight talk and a real exchange of opinions. We can begin to talk about renewed imports of Iranian resources only when Iran applies the United Nations resolution and the suggestions of the International Atomic Energy Agency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The imposition of new sanctions against Teheran was absolutely necessary; however, it is equally necessary that we try to exhaust every possibility of bringing Iran back to the negotiating table.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision by the European Union to impose sanctions may have been necessary but it will not be easy, because it will increase oil prices and because it will, at the same time, cause problems with the energy reserves of numerous countries.</p>
<p class="contents">They will also come at a high economic cost, especially for the countries in the South and especially if the financial crisis is taken into account. On the other hand, we must not forget that Iran is able to channel its oil to other, non-European markets.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is a more important point, because we must ensure that sanctions are properly targeted and that their effect on the Iranian people is kept to a minimum.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider, Baroness Ashton, that you should exhaust all means of persuading Iran to cooperate constructively on the nuclear issue, although that should not be the only issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community and Europe appear to have forgotten the terrible human rights situation in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that you should remind Teheran and draw their attention once again to that issue. In any event, armed conflict must be avoided at all costs. Conflict in the already heavily-burdened Arab world is in no one’s interest. I worry that the red line drawn by the United States in connection with attempts to close the Strait of Hormuz is dangerously escalating the situation. Of course Iran must duly persuade the West that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes and of its intention to cooperate. We all know that that is not self-evident. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Iran’s nuclear programme is I think without any question a source of potential danger for the wider West Asian region, but we should not allow ourselves to be mesmerised by the nuclear issue because that way we run the risk of missing several other strategic developments. For one, Iran is a major power in conventional military terms; indeed militarily it hardly needs nuclear weapons. Secondly, Iran has the potential to block the Strait of Hormuz. This has already been mentioned. This would affect oil exports from the entire Gulf region – I want to stress that – and it would involve around a fifth of the world’s oil consumption. Then, with Iraq gradually evolving into an Iranian satellite, Tehran’s power has increased markedly. The uprising in Syria, another of Iran’s allies, directly affects Iran’s interest, hence the support extended to the Assad regime.</p>
<p class="contents">In all it is not hard to see the ultimate objective of Iran’s strategy: control of the Gulf, the neutralisation of Saudi Arabia and the exclusion of the United States from the region. The nuclear question is only a part of these strategic issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Decisions are being made here which will determine whether we have a peaceful future and a great deal is currently at stake. The current regime in Iran is doing everything it can to worsen the situation, including playing its game with nuclear weapons, threatening the existence of Israel and supporting terrorist activities in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community and the European Union have repeatedly warned Iran about this. The Iranian Government turned a deaf ear to these warnings and derided everyone who was working towards a diplomatic solution. Therefore, the EU sanctions are a logical next step. They are comprehensible and coherent, but we do need to continue our policy of bringing Iran to the negotiating table.</p>
<p class="contents">This could be called a ‘carrot and stick’ policy. Obviously, it is the stick which is currently being used. However, we should be thinking already about making the carrot more visible. Most importantly, this would strengthen the opposition in Iran and put the regime under pressure from within.</p>
<p class="contents">Against the background of a coherent, ongoing European policy, it is important for us to do everything we can to prevent the dispute from building up into a military conflict. There are enough historical examples of this happening on this continent. A war would have devastating consequences for the population of Iran, for the region and for Israel in particular. It would set the region back decades.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, we must do everything possible to ensure that we do not become involved in a military conflict, because war is not the answer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is important to note that the EU, as a block, is Iran’s second largest customer, taking about a quarter of Iranian exports. The latest set of EU and US sanctions goes beyond targeting the persons and institutions involved in the nuclear programme. Hopefully those sanctions will achieve their aim, but more important is that the EU Member States are perfectly aware of the possible consequences and that the respective governments are prepared to deal with them.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament, in its resolution, makes a strong statement in support of the EU’s dual-track approach for the negotiations with Iran, which offers both rewards and punishments. What is clear is that we are far away from trusting the current Iranian regime and, at the same time, we would wish Iran to become a country like Japan, which has the capability to become a nuclear power quickly if need be, but which has rejected taking the final steps to possessing nuclear weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in this context, what could give negotiations and diplomacy a chance is the ever-changing situation in Iran and in the region, including the move towards democracy in the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An Iranian nuclear weapon would mean practically an additional threat to peace in this area and a way of exercising control over neighbouring countries. I therefore agree that it is necessary to clarify the intentions of this country. However, we must ask ourselves whether or not a general sanction on Iranian oil will give the expected results.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we cannot punish the whole society for the mistakes made by the ruling class and, therefore, sanctions should be aimed at those who hold the power. I would like to draw your attention, Baroness Ashton, to the need for ongoing assessment of the effects of these new sanctions. At the same time, the European Union must constantly encourage dialogue with the Iranian side and, as you have already mentioned, use the relationship this country has with Turkey. However, dialogue must not be limited to the nuclear problem, but also include the human rights situation, as many of my colleagues have already said.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to this last aspect, the European Union should impose restrictions on EU companies to suspend exports of goods, particularly electronic goods, that are actually used for the oppression of Iranian citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out that the only solution to the tense relations with Iran is a peaceful one. Military intervention would be a major mistake, with disastrous consequences. The European Union, through its High Representative, must declare firmly that it is against military intervention and must express that it is open to dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not we, but the International Atomic Energy Agency which has serious fears over the possible military aspects of the Iranian nuclear programme, and as the evidence shows, Iran is working on the creation of a nuclear explosion device. We did not force Iran to become a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, in relation to which Iran itself has renounced attempts to obtain nuclear weapons and is legally obliged to report all the nuclear activities which it conducts. It is not we, but Iran which still is not meeting its obligations under the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, including the latest of these, resolution 1929, and is not complying with the requirements of the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency. It is not we, but the policy of the Iranian Government in some areas which is creating a threat to stability and peace in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">In this nuclear atmosphere, I would like you to remember, Baroness Ashton, about other problems related to Iran, which, after all, you have spoken about yourself: respect for human rights, and the situation in Camp Ashraf, which continues to be uncertain and unsafe. Members also asked about this during Question Hour. I should add that we must do everything possible to work together to resolve these problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am surprised that the opposition to these sanctions, here in the European Parliament for example, has been so great. I expected unanimous support. Iran’s sabre-rattling is not a sign of failure, but rather it is a sign that the sanctions entail consequences. I do not understand those who are opposed to these sanctions. Who in the Iranian opposition have they actually spoken to? I have met with and spoken to members of the opposition and they welcome the fact that we are getting tough with Iran. No one want to punish the Iranian people, but the actions of the regime have consequences. Unreasonable behaviour that goes against the united view of the international community must have consequences. There is a cost, and there must be a cost, which is what we are demonstrating with our sanctions. This is welcome, therefore. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the first serious signal to the Iranian Government. The Iranian regime’s oral statements that theirs is a peaceful nuclear programme are unsubstantiated and unconvincing. Meanwhile EU policy continues to be a dual approach, so it is entirely up to the Iranian authorities whether there will be even greater restrictions on the country’s economic development. The goal of sanctions is above all to ensure the removal of a substantial risk to global security and regional stability in the Middle East. It is disappointing that certain countries with global ambitions are unable to eschew narrow national interests and stand on the side of global security – I am talking about Russia and China.

These measures will send oil prices and the multinationals’ profits through the roof and will exacerbate the capitalist crisis in the European Union. The European Union has again appointed itself as the global guardian, as required by its imperialist values and interests and by competition with other forces in the Persian Gulf and Central Asia. The coercion being attempted by the nuclear powers on the pretext of Iran’s nuclear programme is insulting. Those same forces back Israel’s policy of aggression and nuclear weapons, the innumerable nuclear weapons in Europe and the dissemination of nuclear plants in India and Pakistan. I am certain that the workers will condemn this provocative action. Joint exercises between Israel and other countries and the war against the people of Iran need to be stopped. There is an urgent need today to break free of the European Union and to return power to the people, so that the people do not pay for imperialist wars with their blood.</p>

This will affect Italy, Spain and Greece, which are the countries already hardest hit by the debt crisis. Equally, if Iran blocks the Strait of Hormuz, the world’s most important oil route, we will have a real oil crisis on our hands.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that weapons of mass destruction have already been used as a pretext for preventive military action which had a questionable basis in international law. Even though the threat of military intervention seems to have been averted with the move from a nuclear dispute to an oil dispute, it must be obvious to all of us that a military strike against Iran could have devastating consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must, of course, oppose the secret construction of nuclear weapons in the same way as we oppose preventive military strikes in contravention of international law. All of us, including the countries of Europe, must ask ourselves how we can guarantee security, for example for Israel, under these circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will just try to bring together some of the themes that have been expressed in the House and to take them forward as part of our thinking about how to deal effectively with this extremely important issue of the nuclear aspirations of Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of colleagues, beginning with Mr Salafranca in his first contribution, talked about the need to work with others to ensure that we are collaborating with our allies, who of course include those that we call the E3+3 – Russia, China and the United States plus the UK, France and Germany – the six countries which, when we do find ourselves in dialogue with Iran, sit behind me as the E3+3 designated by the Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we are not only talking with those countries. I saw Dai Bingguo, the State Councillor of China, when I was in India the week before last. We are constantly talking with Russia – the political director is there currently – as well as with other countries like Japan and Korea, with the ambition of ensuring that the gap created by EU sanctions is not filled in ways that mean that there would not be an effect on the regime.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of colleagues have mentioned the role of Turkey. I keep in close contact with Foreign Minister Davutoğlu on this issue. Turkey has provided a conduit of information and dialogue to Iran, being the reinforcer of messages, and also hosted the last round of talks. I pay tribute to the way in which that country has worked with us on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I will be going to Brazil this weekend for a number of discussions. One of these will be on what we are doing on Iran and why. I take very much the points that have been made about strengthening and broadening the understanding of what the EU is doing, the reasons behind our actions and the need for the international community to stand together to seek a satisfactory resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">So in all our discussions across the world we are keeping this on the agenda. We keep making the point that the sanctions are important and that their purpose is to try to persuade Iran to come to negotiations. It is a twin-track approach, specifically designed to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area I wanted to touch on is the effect on the people of Iran. We are very clear that what we are seeking to do is to persuade the regime that it needs to come to the talks. I am very worried about Iran’s economic capacity. It is a country that should have been able to grow economically. I keep watch over what we are doing, to try to ensure that the effects on the people of Iran are minimal but that they also understand what it is that we are doing. As has been said, there are many people in Iran who share the aspiration that we have to see Iran turn away from its current path.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also true that we are looking, with the Member States, at the effect on the European Union of all our work on sanctions. It is vital that we ensure that we understand what we are doing and that we look at the effect that it has. National legal systems are responsible for ensuring there is no circumvention, but the EU as a whole is working together in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Colleagues also mentioned the fact that Camp Ashraf has an Iranian population. I have already mentioned a couple of times, in our Question Hour, the importance that we attach to trying to find a satisfactory solution for the people of Camp Ashraf. My concern is straightforward. It is to try to find a way in which we can keep them completely safe and give them a future. Members of the UN are in discussion with Member States where there are issues of citizenship, and members of the High Commission for Refugees are engaged with this, as is Martin Kobler who, as I have indicated already, will be here tomorrow. We are working closely with the US and with the international community, and we will keep this on the agenda in our discussions with Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we move forward and that the people find a future, not that we simply keep them there because we do not have a plan. There does seem to be, if not a perfect plan, then a compromise solution under which, if we do things properly, there is potential for a future for these people that will keep them safe which, as I have said, is our final objective.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns something that Mr Tannock said about the glorious Persian culture. Absolutely. We are clear in this House, and right across the European Union, that our quarrel on this issue is not with the people of Iran. We wish them well. We wish to see this glorious Persian history and culture rise and be part of the region and part of the international community, but we have obligations as countries and as the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Those obligations are that, when people sign up to treaties and say they will not move toward nuclear proliferation, they are taking on obligations that they have to respect, and if they do not respect them then we have to do something about it. It is all done within the Security Council. These issues go back to the Security Council, and it is the Security Council which gives me my mandate and with whom the European Union works. I do hope that we will have the support to make sure that these sanctions are seen as being an important contribution to getting the other track moving and through that medium, as I do in any other, I am asking the Iranians to respond to my letter, to pick up what I left on the table or to come forward with their own ideas and come back to the talks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are serious doubts about the real objectives of the Iranian nuclear programme, which has now become a global threat. Given the authoritarian character of the Iranian regime, I also believe that the EU should do more in supporting the Iranian opposition in Iraq. After the brutal attacks last year, Iraq has imposed a deadline to close Camp Ashraf. Yesterday the inhabitants were urged by the UN’s envoy Martin Kobler to move to a new location near Baghdad which, according to the Council of Europe statement last week, seems more like a prison, with a very limited living area and a heavy police presence. The HR’s Special Adviser has been refused a visa to enter Iraq to take part in the negotiations. How come this diplomatic insult has been kept quiet by our services while we continue to pay a fortune to help Iraq for development? Should not our HR take a more active role by trying to organise even video-link interviews with the inhabitants in Ashraf to help quickly bring out those with families in Europe? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The country has disregarded her commitment to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as well as a number of United Nations resolutions. Iran constitutes a serious threat in the region and the implications of such a strained situation will have their reflection at a global level. I endorse all possible sanctions against Iran as well as other diplomatic measures that can be taken in order to make Tehran see that we are serious and that we do not hesitate to ‘put our money where our mouth is’. However, I must caution against reacting to any provocations or engaging in any military action. The region is a barrel of gunpowder and I am deeply concerned that when it goes off we will not be able to keep it under control. Therefore, let us be alert, yet not neurotic.

I was nonetheless hoping that, in this sensitive issue, our esteemed Council would not follow its usual path when measures do not work, which is to apply the same measures but only in greater quantities. The Council hopes that sanctions will bring Iran to the negotiating table, but experience to date shows that these and similar measures have only contributed towards a deepening of mutual distrust and an assertion of the political and economic interests of the various superpowers. After the deterioration in international relations over the recent situation in the Gulf of Hormuz, it can now be expected, moreover, that the negative impacts of sanctions on the Iranian people will strengthen the position of the current regime even more. Unfortunately, I cannot rid myself of the impression that some countries are not out to prevent military intervention or even war in Iran, but, on the contrary, are encouraging it for various reasons. We cannot allow this to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">I would venture to say, therefore, that the EU should stop focusing only on the Iranian nuclear programme, and abandon the current path of sanctions and yet more sanctions. On the contrary, dialogue must be held, with a view to future cooperation at several levels, for example regional stability, foreign affairs, human rights and mutual assistance. A positive situation at one of these levels might then help when negotiations are stagnating. Boosting mutual confidence and respect is the only route that does not lead to imminent armed conflict. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its rapid development, and the threats being issued by Iran against the countries of the region and against Israel, are the cause of increasing anxiety. Unfortunately, looking at the EU’s options today and at Iran’s strategic position, it is clear that Iran’s military forces have the capability to paralyse the supply of crude oil through the Strait of Hormuz, and also to destabilise Central Asia and North Africa by conducting asymmetric activity through a network of terrorist groups. Action of this kind would appear to be more dangerous than Tehran’s nuclear programme itself. Therefore, pressure should be maintained for more frequent inspections to be carried out on Iranian nuclear installations. In addition to this, it is also important to support the Iranian opposition. We do not have accurate information, but it seems that Tehran’s activities are a kind of domestic ploy before the forthcoming elections, in which President Ahmadinejad’s position is under serious threat. The threat that the supply of crude oil might be cut off also shows that the European Union must provide more funds for the support of projects intended to diversify fuel supplies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a decision that has contributed dangerously to escalating a conflict that, as is clear, has nothing to do with seeking peaceful solutions and diplomatic negotiations. In the current context, a potential military conflict would not just represent an attack on the Iranian people’s sovereignty and right to live in peace, but would have extremely negative economic consequences for several countries. It is also important not to forget that these unilateral sanctions are being imposed hypocritically by nuclear powers like the US, France and the UK, and that the European Union has continued its close economic and military cooperation with Israel, a country that acts completely outside the most basic principles of international law. We need to genuinely, and without hypocrisy, advocate peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
