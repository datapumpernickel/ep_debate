The resolution we have here speaks for itself. In addition, this morning we have again spoken extensively about the situation in Kosovo, and about all the things we want to do there to ensure that the country is rebuilt as quickly as possible. Of course there are now all kinds of problems that need to be resolved as a matter of urgency and to which immediate attention must be given. The resolution goes into this as well. I am referring here to the several thousand Kosovars being held captive by the Serbian authorities. Most of them were arrested during the military operation against Kosovo, when a state of emergency was declared throughout Yugoslavia. The conflict has been over for a few months now, but the people are still in captivity. It is true that there is an agreement, on the basis of which the conflict was brought to an end, but it would appear that when this agreement was concluded, the group of people in captivity was forgotten about. No agreements were drawn up about this. We believe that all those people who were taken captive after 24 March, that is after the state of emergency was declared, must be released as soon as possible. Pressure must be brought to bear on the Serbian government as a matter of urgency in order to achieve this, and today’s debate also serves to underline how urgent this is. I hope that the Council and the Commission will do all that can be done to help secure the release of these people and their return to their homes as soon as possible, just as all the other refugees who were outside Kosovo have been able to return to their homes.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are now discussing a matter, in which little can be changed unless there is some goodwill on the part of the powers-that-be in Belgrade. Unfortunately, neither the Kumanovo Agreement between Nato and the Yugoslavian government nor the UN Resolution which gave the mandate for the international presence in Kosovo made any mention of the situation of the Albanian prisoners in Belgrade and the missing persons.</p>
<p class="contents">Here too we should have learnt from our experience in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Today, three years after Dayton, we still do not know where many of the missing people are. On a weekly basis I receive queries from families who are still looking for missing persons, and who have not received any details.</p>
<p class="contents">What sort of people are these who detain thousands of their fellow men for years in inhumane conditions for no good reason, leaving the family members of these prisoners, the wives, mothers and children, in ignorance as to their fate?</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps we should appeal to them less as politicians and authorities in this region than as the father or sons they also are. Unfortunately we cannot compel them. The Serbian regime leaves us no formal means to do this. But its conduct goes against any conception of legality, never mind humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore call on the UN Administrator, Kouchner, and also the OSCE, to seek a way to ensure their release. We place our hopes in a sub-committee for problems of prisoners and exiles of the Kosovo Transitional Council.</p>
<p class="contents">But we expect all states in the international community not to lift any of the sanctions against Serbia until, among other things, these prisoners are released.</p>
<p class="contents">It is possible to have peaceful co-existence between Serbs and Albanians, and between Croats, Muslims and Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina, only if, among other things, the matter of prisoners and deportees is clarified.</p>

Yes, you heard correctly, I am talking about Kosova and not Kosovo, and I do this out of respect for the Albanians whose true homeland is Kosova and who make up 80 to 90% of the population there. They speak Albanian, and Kosova is the Albanian word for Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I have been to Kosova. I devoted part of my holiday to this trip. I have spoken to most of the Albanian political leaders and they included Mr Rugova of the LDK, the LBD, the Christian Democrats, the Social Democrats, and also representatives of the KLA. I have to say, everyone is hugely grateful for the international presence. People are very grateful that UNMIC and KFOR are there but fear a sort of “over-colonisation” taking place. People are scared that the international bodies will not take enough account of the Kosovan people’s strength.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course some of this frustration can be put down to the fate endured by the Kosovan prisoners, who are sitting in Serbian prisons as we speak. After the Serbian reign of terror, with all the murder, fire, and ethnic cleansing that entailed, these people are now left with the fear as to what has become of what are literally many thousands of missing persons and prisoners. That is why I give my full support to the appeal made both by Mr Wiersma and Mrs Pack, and to the compromise resolution before us. We must adopt this resolution and we must endeavour to reach a solution for these prisoners using all the decisiveness and vigour this Parliament can muster.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the image we have of the Kosovars is perhaps one we have acquired from the international press, namely that the Kosovars, the Albanians that is, have taken over where the Serbians left off and it is now they who are oppressing the Serbians and the gypsies. I have been to Kosova and do not believe this to be the case. Personal acts of revenge are indeed being carried out and we must condemn these. They can never be defended but, ladies and gentlemen, let us not equate such acts of revenge with the ethnic cleansing, the systematic terrorisation there has been over the last ten years. Let us ponder that for a moment.</p>

It is obvious that the international community made a serious mistake by not including the question of Kosovar prisoners in the agreements reached with the authorities in Belgrade. We must now correct this mistake. I agree entirely with our colleague Doris Pack when she says that this must be a precondition for any lifting of sanctions. I agree rather less, though, on the ability of the European Union and the international authorities to intervene in this matter. The issue of Kosovar prisoners is a humanitarian issue. The European Union is still providing humanitarian aid to Serbia. This is the only channel for aid still open. </p>
<p class="contents">I think, and the Commission is in a prime position to intervene at this level, that as the issue of the Kosovar prisoners is a humanitarian one, the European Union could be less zealous in its supply of aid to the Serbian authorities until they have released all Kosovar prisoners. I feel that there is something we can do straight away, which is to send a clear message to the authorities in Belgrade, and I ask the Commission to let us know the results of its steps as quickly as possible.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, we are asking the Council to confirm and strengthen its common position on sanctions. This is the request made by my group and the other groups which have subscribed to the motion for a resolution that we are discussing today. Unfortunately, no positive developments have been reported in Burma, but we are witnessing a worsening of the repression, as the resolution says. Over the last few weeks there have again been dozens of arrests of Burmese citizens and foreigners who continue to fight for democracy and human rights in this country. At this time, we must reconfirm our complete and total solidarity with, and give our sympathy to Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, President of the League for Democracy which obtained the majority of votes in the 1990 elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the limitations imposed on her freedom of movement and expression, this courageous woman is continuing her tenacious opposition to the regime, and we cannot fail to remember the inhuman way she was treated by the regime on the death of her husband. This has already been condemned by this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution also asks the Burmese Government to put an immediate stop to the loathsome practice of forced labour which much of the civilian population is forced to do and which particularly affects children and women from ethnic minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We also denounce, as does the International Labour Office, these practices as a crime against humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must consider the situation in Burma to be one of the key areas for its international action in the defence of human rights and democracy. We must hold our battle up as an example to all the other similar regimes in the world, but we must also succeed in transforming it increasingly into a coherent, efficient and practical policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States must also join the fight to tackle the Burma question in accordance with the common position of the Council, with the same intensity in all the international bodies: from the UN to the regional organisations which unite the Asian countries. Only the isolation of the military dictatorship through sanctions and dialogue with the opposition groups and the ethnic minorities can contribute to establishing democracy in Burma.</p>

There are now 150,000 refugees in camps, mainly in Thailand but also in Malaysia and India. Then there are a further 100,000 illegal refugees in the surrounding countries, in Australia, Europe and the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">This summer I attended a conference in Bangkok held by an international organisation that concerns itself with Burma. I got to know many representatives of the refugees again. They feel that Europe will gradually start to forget about them and that people no longer really take the situation that has now been going on in Burma for ten years very seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi has now been under house arrest for ten years and that with 80% of the Burmese people’s votes, she is the chosen president. We are aware that Burma’s Parliament was disbanded, that dozens of Members of Parliament have been killed, are in prison or under house arrest, or are among the refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the situation is growing more serious: the Burmese government is stepping up the repression in the shadow of the events in Indonesia. In fact almost nothing is being done at the moment. Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi has appealed to the western democracies to give her more help. I want to appeal to the European Union to follow suit. A delegation of diplomats went to Burma just before the summer but came back with nothing to show for its pains.</p>
<p class="contents">The sanctions already in force for Burma are to be extended in October and my group believes that it would be better if they were strengthened. The United States has already added an investment freeze to these sanctions. Let Europe at last show a united front for once and do the same. I notice Commissioner Kinnock is nodding. I sincerely hope that he will convey this message and our resolution to the European Council of Ministers, and that measures will at last be taken which will help to bring down the regime in Rangoon and which will enable Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi to truly feel that her actions, which are peaceful ones, are being supported.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And this is happening in a country which, unfortunately, was the first to benefit from our programme of preferential treatment, which should have had a better future.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must continue to act under the Finnish Presidency so that relations with Burma can be re-established as soon as possible, but on the basis of the respect for human rights, the results of the elections and the liberation of the British prisoners who were arrested for defending democracy. We must put pressure on the military Junta and not allow them to find ways of circumventing democratic legitimacy, which will make a mockery of it. We must find the best way of working out a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that the European Union, neither now – with Finland – nor later, allows such a mockery to take place. And I hope that all of you – and Mr Kinnock in particular – will also condemn the behaviour of those companies which take advantage of human exploitation in a country which is under a dictatorial system and regime.</p>

They were sentenced to death and were hanged.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, thirteen Jews and several Muslims from Isfahan, Shiraz and Tehran have been arrested and face the same fate. Little is known about them. The accused, one of whom is sixteen years old, come from humble backgrounds: a cemetery caretaker, a shoemaker, a ritual performer of circumcisions, a teacher of Hebrew. It is hard to believe that these unfortunate people are really endangering Iran’s democracy. </p>
<p class="contents">Since their arrest, there has been no news of them. When we start hearing about Jews being arrested and espionage trials, this is a very worrying sign. We are worried because we know what conditions of detention in Iran are like. This is worrying because no evidence, no specific charge has so far been made public and there has been no due hearing of the case. We are worried because the accused do not have the right to mount a defence.</p>
<p class="contents">We are worried, Mr President and also sad, because we were delighted at the prospective rapprochement between Iran and the European Union. It is now obvious that this business compromises the rapprochement and until we have obtained guarantees that the rights of these prisoners are being respected, we cannot even consider it. </p>

These fears are backed up by the hanging last year of a 60 year old man. </p>
<p class="contents">There has consequently been great consensus on the motion for a resolution which will be submitted shortly for Parliament’s approval. Its aim is to demonstrate Parliament’s indignation at the procedures which have been applied, and to demand that the basic rights to a defence be respected. It asks that international observers be authorised to follow the whole trial in court. And finally, it is restating our desire to maintain dialogue, only to the extent that it would allow for progress in the area of human rights in that country, particularly in order to have these death sentences revoked. </p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I feel that the amendment tabled by our colleagues in the Greens Group is even clearer than the initial common resolution, and I would like to say that, personally, I am in favour of it.</p>

The shock was that much greater because many of us were delighted at the election of President Chatami and at the signals of openness, reforms and respect for human rights which he was giving out. The Iranian people could at last begin to hope for a new future and for a time when the period of killing and violence would be behind them. </p>
<p class="contents">Following the student demonstrations in the summer, President Chatami promised open and just trials for those involved. It is therefore incomprehensible and deeply worrying that the legal process was held in secret and that the death sentences against four people were published almost <span class="italic">en passant </span>in a newspaper interview. The light and hope which were kindled among the Iranians following the election is now at risk of going out, and the improved relations between the EU and Iran are at risk of cooling. I nonetheless hope that the President can draw strength from the massive support he obtained from the voters in the election and that he will act to ensure that the revolutionary court repeals the death sentences so that Iran might continue along the road to reforms and the development of a civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">This Chamber strongly condemns the death penalty wherever it is practised and will continue to do so. Offences against human rights can never be merely a matter of a country’s internal affairs. I hope that this message will also be conveyed by the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fortunately, critical Iranian newspapers and some Iranian members of government are brave enough today to speak out about these very principles. The same applies both to the students under arrest and to the Iranian Jews accused of espionage. The extent to which they are prepared to stick their necks out is apparent from the sombre and also dispassionate reports by Iranian political analysts. Quote: “As long as the generally-held view in Iran is one which defines dissidents as people of another faith and which derives the right to decide on whether people should live or die, or the right to take the fate of the country into their own hands, from religion, the country’s political climate will continue to be poisoned and politically-motivated violence is to be expected”. Unquote.</p>
<p class="contents">There has certainly been no lack of this type of violence in the Islamic Republic of Iran since it was first founded in 1979. The murders that took place last autumn of four independently minded souls are still fresh in the memory, and of course we must not forget the extraordinarily brutal treatment meted out by the henchmen from the conservative camp of the supreme lawyer Khamenei. The latter and his immediate entourage attempted to conceal their involvement in the grim liquidations of 1998 with utterly vile lies about a Jewish-American plot against the fatherland. The international community, and therefore likewise the European institutions, must rally around the indigenous voices calling for open and just trials for the students and Jews held in captivity. And so it goes without saying that we support the joint draft resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A West African economic community on the model of the European Union is beginning to take shape. But one of the main impediments to further regional integration is the non-operation of democratic institutions, particularly of the Parliament in Togo. The Group of the European People’s Party therefore welcomes the serious endeavours of practically all political forces in Togo to make the development towards democracy irrevocable and to prepare within the next few months for elections to the National Assembly which will be indisputably democratic and free of pressure from the army and the State President and his entourage.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in favour of peaceful transition to a fully functioning democracy. We also accept that State President Eyadema will continue his period of office until the year 2003, even though the counting procedures of the last presidential election showed rather more than cosmetic flaws. We also call, however, upon the State President and his administration, to agree, in collaboration with all political forces in the country, upon an election procedure which gives the same chances to every political grouping which complies with democratic rules. We acknowledge the very constructive role played in this by our former colleague, the French ombudsman, Bernard Stasi, and his two colleagues from Germany and Austria, as mediators. In this regard, it is essential that the elections are faultlessly prepared, carried out in a non-partisan way and result in a government freely and democratically elected by the people of Togo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The absence of an independent electoral commission, the absence of fair access to the media, the absence of any guarantee of the right to campaign, have all led the opposition, which is in the majority, to boycott next spring’s legislative elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if we take the agreement recently signed with the opposition to be a step forward, it is still inadequate, and risks being a meaningless scrap of paper unless it provides a number of guarantees. We must bring an immediate end to the impunity enjoyed by those who commit such abuses, and we must also ensure that the authorities do in fact respect human rights. The parliament must not only be dissolved, but we must also demand Mr Eyadema’s resignation, before the end of his term of office, so that genuinely free and fair elections can be organised. </p>
<p class="contents">These conditions must be met if the European Union is to resume co-operation with Togo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kinnock, Neil, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Commission</span><span class="bold">.</span> – Mr President, I must say that, as I listened to these very high-quality debates in the course of this afternoon, I reflected again on the maxim that if the state of domestic affairs makes you depressed, the state of international affairs will make you desperate. None of us can succumb to such pessimism and that is why strong concern and demands for action have been voiced in this democratic House. I very much welcome that. It shows that there are much better and more lively alternatives to simply surrendering to hopelessness, which is sometimes a temptation, both for political representatives and activists and indeed for the more general public.</p>
<p class="contents">Can I first of all turn to the debates on Kosovo and the various tragedies attending that sad part of the world? The Commission fully shares the concerns expressed in the draft resolutions before the House, both in relation to the continuing ethnic violence in Kosovo and the earlier so-called disappearances and the detentions. We naturally also join Members of this House in strongly condemning violence, no matter which ethnic group is the perpetrator or the victim, and we actively support efforts by UNMIK, KFOR and OSCE to establish law and order in Kosovo. The Commission obviously shares the deep concern of this House about the fate of the many civilians who are still missing. We are therefore directly involved in efforts to determine which of the missing people are still held in Serb prisons and which have been killed during the war and the circumstances in which they died. The Union is consequently providing support for forensic investigations into alleged war crimes, and earlier this week the General Affairs Council’s conclusions expressed deep concern that the question of several thousand persons - overwhelmingly Kosovo Albanians - who have disappeared remains open.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on numerous occasions, the Commission has condemned the gross failure of the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbia, to respect accepted international norms of humanity and minority rights. That apparent contempt for international obligations is one of the main impediments to improved relations between the former Republic of Yugoslavia and the European Union and an impediment too to the reintegration of the former Republic into the international community. That impediment is likely to stay, as long as the Serb authorities pursue their present policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I move now to the resolution relating to the situation in Burma. The Commission, as the House will know, strongly deplores the continued violation of human rights by the military authorities in Burma: in particular, the oppressive treatment of ethnic minorities, the persecution of Aung San Suu Kyi and other NLD members, the denial of basic trade union rights and the use of forced labour, the prohibition of freely functioning parties, the countless arbitrary arrests and the continuing state violence. We also share concern about the treatment of European Union citizens who have been arrested because of their public engagement in democracy movement activities in Burma. In April this year the European Union common position strengthened the October 1998 policy decision by covering transit visas and including a ban on tourist visits by people associated with the Burmese authorities. The Commission supported that action and assists the democracy movement and refugees in Burma, including of course by providing financial support for the Brussels office. The Council is currently reviewing the common position and its extension, as honourable Members said in the debate, should be decided before the 29 October.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has made it clear that although Burma has become a member of ASEAN the European Union cannot agree to Burmese participation in the EC/ASEAN Agreement. We use every opportunity to press our Asian partners to urge the Government of Burma to enter into a substantive dialogue with the opposition, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, and with the ethnic minorities and to change its policies radically in order to respect human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Members are aware that Aung San Suu Kyi recently renewed her call for more comprehensive international economic sanctions against Burma, including unilateral sanctions, whilst the present regime controls the country that she loves.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission participated in the recent EU troika visit to Rangoon which was undertaken with the aim of clearing the way for the establishment of a political dialogue with Burma as provided for in the Council conclusions of 26 April. The objectives of establishing political dialogue are to explain the European Union common position on the human rights situation and on the absence of the rule of law and democracy in Burma and to assist in creating conditions that would be conducive to political dialogue between the governing SPDC military junta and the democratic opposition and representatives of the ethnic minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission remains committed to maintaining the pressure upon the SPDC, formerly known as the Slorc. Meanwhile the international situation continues to deteriorate and no meaningful response has been made to the repeated international calls for the Burmese authorities to take steps towards the promotion of democracy, human rights and national reconciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore continues to support the renewal of the common position next month and the strict enforcement of the resulting pressures and sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the situation in Iran, to which attention has again been drawn by resolutions before this House.</p>
<p class="contents">As the House will know, the Commission views the human rights situation in Iran with deep concern, which we share with this House. In the comprehensive dialogue between the European Union and Iran, questions directly relating to human rights are always raised by the European Union representatives. Whilst the Commission does not have any bilateral contractual relationship with Iran or representation in the country, we associate with the <span class="italic">démarche</span> made by the European Union troika. The treatment of members of religious minorities in Iran, particularly the Baha’is, was raised by the Union troika during the meetings with the Iranian Government last December and in May this year. That pressure will be maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">To come to the specific points relating to violations of human rights raised by Mr Zimeray, Mr Morillon and Miss Malmström, I would like to say that a Union troika <span class="italic">démarche</span> concerning the death sentences on four students, which incorporates the views expressed by this Parliament, is being prepared by the Finnish presidency. The Commission is also concerned about the trial of 13 Jews from Shiraz on charges of espionage. The Union has made a number of representations on the subject, both through the troika and bilaterally.</p>
<p class="contents">It is evident that the recent developments in Iran reflect the internal power struggle between moderate reformists and conservative hard-liners. The efforts of the conservatives to regain the initiative and undermine the government must realistically be regarded as a preface to the parliamentary elections which are due to take place next February.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile the Commission considers that particularly in the period leading up to those elections, the policy of the cautious opening of relations with Iran through the comprehensive dialogue, should continue as a way of encouraging Mr Khatami’s government and the supporters of reform, many of whom are showing considerable courage in their efforts for change in extremely difficult and dangerous circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I now move to the issue of Togo. As the House will know, the European Community suspended development cooperation with Togo in 1992. Despite some shifts in the political situation since then, I regret to say that the prerequisites for the resumption of development cooperation and the full normalisation of relations with Togo – respect for democratic principles, the rule of law and human rights – are still not adequately fulfilled. However a certain political momentum towards political reconciliation has been created through the Lomé framework agreement that was reached between the government and the opposition in July of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The progress was made possible through the facilitators provided by the European Union, as Mr Watson just said. The Union, therefore, intends to support continued action by the facilitators as well as projects that are related to the full restoration of the rule of law and respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the positive will for progress that was demonstrated by the government in opposition in the framework agreement, but substantial further progress – for example, properly conducted legislative elections that are anticipated in the next year – is required before we can consider resuming regular cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the particular concern for the resolution of the general human rights situation in Togo that is expressed in motions before this House. It is obviously very disturbing that the offences against human rights reported recently by Amnesty International have largely been confirmed by other sources. It has, however, not yet been possible to verify some of the most serious allegations concerning large-scale killings. Further investigations would therefore be welcomed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The House will know that wherever problems relating to human rights occur the United Nations system provides for a number of follow-up mechanisms to promote improvement in the situation. Such measures could, in the view of the Commission, be considered in the case of Togo and it would appear that they would certainly be justified.</p>
