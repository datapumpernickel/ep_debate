<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Derek Vaughan, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>– Mr President, it is not easy to set your own budget. Therefore, I wanted to start by thanking all the shadow rapporteurs, the Bureau and the Parliament’s Secretary-General for their cooperation in putting together these guidelines. I believe now that there is a broad consensus that in difficult economic times, the European Parliament must play its part and make savings in its budget.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, I now believe that very few in this Parliament would argue against the proposal to freeze our budget. I believe certainly we need to ensure that the rise in the Parliament’s budget next year is below inflation. No doubt there will be discussions as to what inflation is, but at least there is now this broad agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that the main recommendations in our guidelines have been accepted. I think that it is important as a Parliament that we identify savings in our own budget. I believe we need to avoid unnecessary new initiatives unless they are absolutely needed. I believe that we need to freeze our travel budget lines, pending the requested review from the Secretary-General which we requested as part of this year’s budget process. I believe we need to freeze all allowances for Members, both daily allowances and the office allowances, and perhaps have the objective of freezing all those allowances until the end of this particular mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe we need to examine all our budget lines, especially those budget lines which are always under-implemented. I believe that these are the budget lines that we should look to, to make savings in our budget. I believe that we need to ensure that we avoid new unforeseen building projects for the rest of this mandate. In the recent past, we have had many building projects proposed and now we need to take stock.</p>
<p class="contents">We need transparency so that this Parliament is fully involved and informed about building projects and therefore I welcome the request to have regular updates at the Committee on Budgets on the building projects which are proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">Another suggestion is to seek greater cooperation with other EU institutions, for example, cooperation on buildings, on translation, on interpretation, on security and on human resources. For example, there is already a joint agreement in place between the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee working together jointly on many of these issues. I think perhaps we should take a look at that joint agreement in order to learn some lessons and maybe work with them in terms of joint work and cooperation, again with the aim of making savings. I certainly believe that there is a lot of scope for us to make savings in the Translation Service for example.</p>
<p class="contents">So I believe there are many possibilities out there for us to make savings, although I also accept that it is not always easy to identify and make those savings. Therefore, I have suggested that the Secretary-General comes forward with an idea for an independent evaluation of the Parliament’s budget. This is a way of bringing fresh eyes, a new pair of eyes to the budget, helping us to identify and make the required savings.</p>
<p class="contents">My suggestion is that we establish a working group between the Bureau and the Budgets Committee, who can bring in expertise from outside and, between them, look at making savings. I believe this working group could form the basis of an independent evaluation of Parliament’s budget. It could also look at a comparable study which was requested as part of this year’s budget process; a comparable study with other parliaments in Europe and maybe the Congress of the United States as well. Also, the working group could look at the travel costs review. We are promised a report on travel costs, again as part of this year’s budget process. This working group could perhaps look at that.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would say to colleagues that I understand some will be concerned about this idea of a freeze in the Parliament’s budget. They may feel it is too difficult to achieve but, there again, there are others who will want to go much further and to cut the budget, and indeed some of the amendments in front of us today to be voted on tomorrow reflect that. However, I would hope that most colleagues in this House would agree that the guidelines which we put forward are a good compromise. A good compromise and a good way forward; a way forward which would allow us to make savings in the Parliament’s budget but also, at the same time, to ensure that this Parliament is run effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We already presented an austerity budget last year, in which the actual original budget only rose by 0.8% and, in view of the additional costs incurred through the accession of Croatia and the Treaty of Lisbon, we still remained below the inflation rate of 1%, achieving 1.9%.</p>
<p class="contents">This year, we are again publishing guidelines for an austerity budget, seeking to show that we are aware that we are in an environment in which it is not possible to make enormous financial leaps forward, but rather that consolidation is the order of the day, so that the budget will need to be examined in terms of efficiency and the potential for cutting costs.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the convening of a working group that is to bring in external experts as deemed necessary and useful, to work in this direction with the Bureau, the Secretariat and Parliament’s administration.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe it is right for us to further strengthen interinstitutional cooperation and that we should further optimise the way in which Parliament works in terms of organisation, efficiency, the use of financial resources and personnel. This has enabled us to save EUR 21 million in the area of translation and interpreting alone in a single year and we want to continue in this vein this year.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Vaughan has said, we are freezing travel costs and day-to-day expenses and, with regard to buildings policy – after all I am the rapporteur on buildings – I believe it necessary for us to examine closely what we have agreed to see whether buildings policy and construction projects are being managed in a professional, cost-efficient manner. The particular aim will be to save costs in the medium term, in particular annually recurring costs, and to exploit the relevant synergies.</p>
<p class="contents">We also expect the other institutions to join us in our efforts and to offer their support. I believe it is necessary for us to navigate a course in which the precise work of Parliament is linked with efficiency and good organisation. I would like to thank the Parliament administration, the Secretariat and the Bureau for their excellent cooperation and hope that we succeed in presenting a reasonable, solid and well-considered budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me begin by stating that we consider it a very important accomplishment that in the 2012 budget, we were able to achieve significant results in terms of savings. We must continue along these lines. We must manage European institutions, including institutions other than the Commission, like good housekeepers.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider it extremely important in times of economic difficulties and economic crisis that when it comes to savings, we start with ourselves, and it is very important that we start with MEPs, and that a reduction in MEPs’ travelling expenses, the freezing of their allowances and the potential reduction of indirect costs related to them, such as translation expenses, are the first things we implement. However, it is very important that we do not act like a lawnmower when doing so. One of the goals we must set for ourselves is the continuous improvement of efficiency, and this does not only mean that we must save, but also that we must make investments in the hopes of long-term savings. A better integration of technological achievements, for example, is sure to produce savings in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I would also like to stress another very important point, namely, that we definitely cannot save, for example, on the expenses of the preparation of Croatia’s accession. MEPs and staff from Croatia must be granted the same privileges as all other MEPs. Therefore, we must, of course, differentiate. I would like to underline that cuts in staff-related costs must definitely be preceded by consultations with the trade unions and the social partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to personally welcome the suggestion to create a committee to develop continuous efficiency and cost-saving measures in cooperation with the Committee on Budgets and the Parliament Secretariat. Looking forward to this work, I would once again like to thank the rapporteur and everyone else who participated in this work. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you very much for that. The previous two speakers, who spoke on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), have already shown that something is indeed changing in this House with respect to its own budget. Where last year it was really hard to get cuts through the House, I now notice, across the board, a willingness to look much more critically at our own housekeeping.</p>
<p class="contents">That makes sense. The economic crisis is hitting hard, and Member States are having to contend with huge budget cuts. We have only one good answer to that and that is increasing transparency. Our budget is still not completely transparent. Therefore, that is one issue where we still need to do some work.</p>
<p class="contents">One element of that work also forms part of Mr Vaughan’s report, which calls for an analysis of our own budget, so that we can identify where potential cuts can still be made in our House. Last year, this plenary embraced that same request on two occasions, both in the discharge report and in the very report we are discussing now, but they were both last year. Unfortunately, up to now, the Bureau has not yet given a positive response to this. My political leader, Guy Verhofstadt, sent a letter to President Buzek in December asking when we, as a plenary, as the Committee on Budgets, would receive that analysis of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, therefore, through you, Mr President, personally urge the current President, Mr Schulz, to get involved in this issue. The Secretary-General, together with the Bureau, has analysed all the budget lines and we are to receive a selection of the points that have come out of that analysis as a proposal for the 2013 budget. Let them give that analysis to the Committee on Budgets and, then, we can do the political work of making choices. We do not always need to leave that to the Bureau.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to say that I strongly agree with the general line that we should start with a budget freeze and I hope that, during the remainder of this year, we will actually be able to agree on a much leaner budget for our own House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Members of this House, we should be doing the same. We ought to be closely scrutinising the institutions’ budgets; we should be enforcing rigorous cost control, and we have here the real chance to show leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to give credit to the Secretary-General and Parliament’s Bureau for the very realistic figures and proposals which they brought forward today. But I would also say that we now have the right, as Members of this House, to demand that the other European institutions follow that example. We should be demanding real savings in their budgets and they should be able to demonstrate value for money.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully support the rapporteur’s call for a freeze on their budgets; indeed, as he will know, there are many areas where I would wish to go further. But for now, I congratulate Mr Vaughan on a very good report.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are three points that I want to make. The first concerns building policy. The members of this House ought to be looking more critically at building investment, building management and building cost control, and, in particular, we should expect the other institutions to be achieving greater efficiencies through sharing resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, administration and staffing costs. This Parliament should be looking to the institutions to deliver a progressive reduction in costs through exploiting economies of scale. It is now time we looked again at staff levels, staff regulations and staff pensions policies to ensure that they are both up to date, relevant and represent value for money to the European taxpayer.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is not possible to have this debate without discussing the two-seat arrangement of this Parliament. May I remind this House that, in approving the report by the Special Committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 (SURE), we called for the parliamentary seat to be kept under review. It is indefensible that this House goes on promoting cost-saving, efficiency and competitiveness amongst the other institutions, amongst national governments, and indeed amongst the people of Europe, while we continue such a wasteful practice ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to recommend to the rapporteur and to this House that, for the sake of the credibility of this institution, we need to have that debate and we ought to have it now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there is always a ‘but’. The services for this plenary opted to exclude a proposal tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left from the debate and vote. This proposal was that Parliament should reach an agreement with the Council and the Commission on freezing Members’ salaries for 2012. I would say that this moderate and reasonable proposal is fundamental, and that there is no reason for it to be excluded from the debate. Changing the Statute for Members is not the only way to achieve this measure: it can be achieved without changes to the Statute for Members. Above all, however, this is an arbitrary decision. We cannot continue to prevent Members from talking about their own salaries in this House. This is incomprehensible to anyone outside Parliament. I must say that episodes like this mean that, with friends like these, sometimes Europe does not need enemies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is obvious that we need to freeze spending on administration at a time when all of the people of Europe are having to tighten their belts. There is no doubt that we can achieve further savings by improving collaboration between the institutions and by cooperating more effectively in areas such as human resources, organisation and building management.</p>
<p class="contents">However, despite the necessity for savings, there are a number of areas where caution is required. The first of these concerns the environment. We must have an effective environmental policy in all of the EU’s institutions and bodies. The institutions in particular should act as a role model for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area is that of translation and language services. Attempts have already been made to cut costs in this area over the last year. This situation cannot continue indiscriminately, however. The European Parliament is responsible for drawing up legislation for 500 million Europeans. These people need to be able to understand our work in their native language. Transparency in democratic processes should not be sacrificed for the sake of the interpreting budget.

<p class="contents">Referring specifically to the budget for the European Parliament, I want to begin this speech by saying that the budget works well and many of the chapters work very well.</p>
<p class="contents">There are several reasons why Parliament’s budget is as large as it is, such as increased responsibilities, a growing number of Member States, the difficult problem of multilingualism, and the need to provide technical support to over 700 Members. We often wonder, however, leaving the absolutely necessary to one side, whether the European Parliament’s budget is sustainable in the medium term and during this economic crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">We have come from a meeting of the Committee on Budgets, the Vice-Presidents of this Parliament and the Secretary-General. Since I became involved with budgetary issues, I do not think I have ever witnessed such a strong shared desire within the Committee on Budgets to cut costs, even in times of negative growth in real terms, as raised by the rapporteur, Mr Vaughan, as well as the administration’s will to implement genuine saving measures, without affecting Members’ safety and services.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that what we produce in this Chamber is legislation, and that legislation should be the final objective. We must ensure that the legislation, the set of laws we produce, is good quality and is viewed that way by the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Committee on Budgets and the European Commission are seeking an increase of less than 2% for 2013. This Chamber’s Bureau starts with a proposal for an increase of around 3%. We are only one percentage point apart at the start of the budgetary process, and I believe that we will find a common objective during the budgetary process.</p>
<p class="contents">Fellow Members will remember that it is said that virtue lies in the middle ground, and I trust we will also find the middle ground between these two proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Based on concrete examples of bad management, at least those we managed to identify, Members approved the report in which we stated that ‘an independent assessment of the activities of the European Parliament is necessary’. We agreed to start this audit in the Directorate-General for Infrastructure and Logistics and in the area of the Security Service. Instead of an independent external audit, however, only an internal audit was carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">If we assess ourselves and are not interested in the views of experts from outside, we will not identify savings. Ladies and gentlemen the crisis has forced viable businesses and institutions to look for savings and use resources efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Chair of a self-governing region of my country, I manage an area which has about as many employees as the European Parliament. Due to the crisis, our resources have fallen by more than 20%. Without thorough analyses and decisive measures, we could not have coped with the situation. I think that the Secretary-General of the European Parliament has carried out many useful measures that have brought positive results, but this is not enough. We should learn from the European Court of Auditors, which was the first European institution to allow an independent audit of its own work. Even before the crisis, the Court of Auditors reduced its administrative costs and achieved substantially higher efficiency in its work. This is the route to the necessary structural changes. If we follow it, we will save millions of euro and become more efficient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also convinced that we can find very broad common ground in this House. That is important in this difficult economic time.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague, Mr Gerbrandy, explained very well where our group stands. We are very positive with regard to the development in the House right now, where we seriously examine all our costs in order to find savings instead of increasing our own budget. This is a path we need to continue on. A part of this could actually be the external audit that my colleague, Mr Maňka, just asked for. We have been calling for a similar type of solution for a longer time. It probably would not hurt.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Secretary-General, Mr Welle, whom Mr Ashworth referred to earlier, has been doing a good job with finding savings once we started to demand them. So we obviously have to look at ourselves and remember that the savings will only be created once we ask for them. Now we have started to do so and that is a good thing.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also vote on the single seat amendment, which some colleagues referred to. As stated before, this is a symbolic issue for many, but it is also an economic issue. In these times of austerity, it is important that colleagues have the opportunity to take a stance on this issue once again. That is why many Members from our group signed this amendment. So we are on the right path. Let us continue in this direction and we will look far better in the eyes of the public in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the need to cut spending has still hardly crossed the minds of the European institutions. They continue to ask for more money and carry on spending like there is no tomorrow. Fortunately, Mr Vaughan’s report has finally broken with that wasteful tradition and he wants to freeze administrative spending. Bravo! Well done! Put a stop to all that squandering!</p>
<p class="contents">In your report, you also call for an independent assessment of the budget by a Parliament working group. I am less happy about that, because I think that it is a mistake to allow the fox to guard the chickens. We need to leave that to external experts. That assessment also needs to address the question of how all members should account for how their individual allowances are spent, because that sacred cow that is members not having to account for their huge expenses must be done away with. Accountability and transparency.</p>

He proposes to freeze the budget of the EU institutions, but then he contradicts himself, in the very next sentence, when he says that the budget will have to be increased to meet requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">While an increase in the budget is allegedly not allowed, Croatia’s accession to the EU alone has so far cost our citizens around EUR 1 billion, and it will end up costing a whole lot more. Mr Vaughan proposes that we continue with structural and organisational reforms, but the Committee of the Regions, which was tasked with doing exactly <span class="italic">that</span>, has, to this day, done absolutely nothing about it, as was shown by the recent budgetary audit. While institutions are being called upon to make cuts, the European Court of Justice is continuing its expansion regardless. That is not sending out the right message to our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget for travel and personal reimbursements has temporarily been frozen and that sounds good, but it is major savings that we really need to be making. Meanwhile, the House of European History is being constructed at a cost of at least EUR 75 million. That is the kind of thing that causes the budget to increase year upon year. What does Mr Vaughan propose, however? That we appoint a working group. What a joke!</p>
<p class="contents">Our citizens demand action, not empty words. It is high time that the European Union stopped hanging on every word of the smooth talk trotted out by the S&amp;D Group and started listening for once to the voters who are footing the actual bill. Do you know what those voters are saying? They are saying: ‘Those people at the EU really have gone mad’! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is worth mentioning some figures at this point so that we can get a sense of where we are. For the current year, the EU budget is around EUR 129 billion in payment authorisations, which corresponds to approximately 1% of EU gross domestic product, as has been the rule. It is worth noting that the budgets of all 27 Member States are approximately 44 times that of the EU budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Another interesting figure is this: between 2000 and 2010, national budgets increased 62%, as against 37% for the EU budget, and I would stress that 12 new Member States joined in that period. In addition, the EU budget is never in deficit and is an investment budget. The total for all administrative and operational expenditure by all of the institutions amounts to around 6% of the EU budget, and the administrative and operational expenditure of Parliament equates to only around 1%. This does not mean that we should not continue to demand rigour and to employ the principles of economy and efficiency: quite the contrary, we must continue following these principles of sound financial management, when both implementing and drafting budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">As we did for the administrative budget of the institutions and Parliament for this year, the current year, we must achieve maximum rigour and maximum savings, yet at the same time ensure the minimum resources necessary for the institutions to run smoothly and, in the case of Parliament, the means to ensure excellence in lawmaking. I believe we are on the right track. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">He put forward some guidelines for the European Parliament’s budget that are in line with work that was started by this Chamber some years ago and these guidelines are supported by a large majority.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to remind you that the European Parliament’s budget represents a little over 1% of the total budget for the European Union and, even though we are discussing a much reduced budget, it does not mean that we cannot continue to take measures to reduce this Chamber’s expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">We are at the start of the 2013 budgetary debate and the objective of this motion for a resolution is to provide a set of budgetary guidelines, which we are going to work on in the months to come. Our priorities for 2013 will be characterised by budgetary responsibility and the reduction of expenditure without impeding the proper functioning of this institution.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, we believe that all the European institutions have to make the necessary efforts to freeze their budgets. Specifically, here in Parliament, we propose that the necessary measures are taken to reduce travel costs. When it comes to funds for Members, we ask for them to be frozen until the end of the parliamentary term.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Parliament, we consider that we should and could make considerable savings in the medium and long term. For that purpose, we also propose three courses of action: the possibility of carrying out an independent assessment of our budget; the creation of a specific working group with Parliament to investigate possible measures; and we also ask the Secretary-General to carry out an exhaustive analysis to detect any possible duplicities and underused budget lines.</p>
<p class="contents">I have faith that the measures that have already been taken and the future reforms we will put in place will help us to achieve better financial management of this Chamber. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, this is, unfortunately, not something that we have any power over. It is a decision that only the EU’s Heads of State or Government can make.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Vaughan that we must make our work more efficient and look for savings, but I would like to emphasise that savings and improvements in efficiency must not be made at the expense of the multilingualism of Parliament. It is great if we can find technical solutions that can result in savings and perhaps also provide the same or a better service in terms of translations, but we must not abandon the linguistic diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Mr Vaughan on the results he has achieved so far in his work to freeze Parliament’s spending. However, I also think it is important to emphasise that all EU institutions must endeavour to improve their efficiency. This also applies to the European Court of Justice, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. The forthcoming enlargement to include Croatia may be a suitable opportunity to consider whether the resulting increased expenditure can be covered by increases in efficiency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the UK, they oppose every single measure the coalition government takes to reduce expenditure to clear up the mess they left Britain in. I hope, Mr Vaughan, that your masters in London take note.</p>
<p class="contents">A budget freeze is the minimum our citizens expect. I should like to see EU administrative expenditure cut year on year for the whole of the next seven-year period. We should, for example, abolish the useless European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. That would save the taxpayer money and reduce bureaucracy. We could also save money by having just one seat for this Parliament and ending the wasteful monthly trek between Brussels and Strasbourg.

The keywords that are imperative for drawing up the guidelines of the EU budget for 2013 are ‘savings’ and ‘budgetary discipline’.</p>
<p class="contents">I regard as appropriate the call for expenditure restraint announced by Commissioner Lewandowski, which places a ceiling of 1.9% on the increase in the Commission’s administrative costs, equal to the inflation rate expected for 2013. Parliament must follow the same line, by freezing its administrative expenditure and all of its real estate expansion plans, without falling into the trap of agreeing to populist amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">It will not be easy to respond to attacks by those who do not believe in Europe and have lost confidence in it. However, the EU budget represents only 2% of total European public expenditure. We must therefore show that the EU budget is able to generate added value in addition to national public expenditure, supporting and integrating investment in those policies that lie at the heart of the recipe for resolving the current crisis. Coming up with strong responses through policies geared towards growth is our aim, as well as a test of our credibility for the 2013 financial year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I note, too, that he has received praise from practically all of the other political groups, which demonstrates that he has been able to establish broad agreement on where we currently stand.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly worth noting that a new attitude is prevailing. Up to now, Parliament’s budget has increased year on year, but now there is broad agreement that we should freeze the budget at a general level and that we should implement major savings in certain specific areas. There is also a high level of consensus that we should start to place restrictions on MEPs’ personal expenses. This is something that I believe to be extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">The report has certainly made an impact, as we can see by the fact that only seven amendments have been tabled, which I believe is something of a record. If we look at the figures, we can see that, while we have traditionally always added 20% of the long-term budget total for administrative expenditure, we are now down to around 19%, and that, in fact, represents a saving of around EUR 70 million.</p>
<p class="contents">This is, of course, a result of pressure from the rest of the world, but the point is that we should not just make cuts. What we need to do, above all, is to find a way forward that is based on efficiency, modernisation and the principle of economy – and where this is concerned, I believe we are only just beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this can be done without reducing the quality of our core activities. Above all, we must, of course, defend our legislative and budgetary work, but this requires a truly systematic effort. I am therefore very pleased that we have been able to agree on the establishment of a working group in Parliament with the possibility of drawing on external expertise in areas where we can learn a great deal: buildings, maintenance, energy, the environment, procurement, travel and so on. These are areas where we can learn from both industry and public administration.</p>
<p class="contents">In areas relating to the organisation of legislative work, interpretation, translation and so on, I am convinced that we can learn from other parliaments and other international organisations. It is also clear that this Parliament has costs that cannot be compared – travel, interpretation and so on – as this is the only multinational legislative parliament in the world, and that is obviously something that we need to take into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly – and now I am speaking not as the coordinator for my group, but as a Swedish Social Democrat – if we seriously want to be respected for the way we deal with citizens’ trust and money from taxes, we cannot continue to move Parliament between Brussels and Strasbourg in the long term. Therefore, I appeal to those governments that are now pushing for cuts in the EU budget: put this issue on the agenda in no uncertain terms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With regard to Amendment 1 – buildings – I would like to say that Strasbourg is a city of peace, a place where bridges have been built in Europe. and it was here, for example, that one of our Presidents, Robert Schuman, was a founding father of the European Union. This also provides a basis for the future. This is the headquarters of Arte, a broadcaster that does a huge amount of work in bringing European culture to public attention. We should be proud of this and should consider the idea of building another studio for Parliament opposite the Arte studios, as a place for Europe to meet and set the agenda for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 2 refers to a single seat. That is what we have. Our single seat is Strasbourg. We should hold to the Treaties we have concluded. That goes without saying.</p>
<p class="contents">When we come to the issue of a House of European History in Amendment 4, then it is our duty to show our younger generations how important it is to work for this peace every day. This needs to be documented thoroughly. We have over 1 million visitors per year to our visitor centre and here to Parliament itself; it is projected that the new Parliamentarium will have 100 000 visitors. People want to know how the history of Europe has developed. We also need strong European political parties for this. We need to show solidarity in the face of national conflict and the egoism of individual Member States. We need a strong European Union and this requires strong political parties. Naturally, these also need to be funded.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to Amendment 6 regarding representation: visitors do need to be looked after and have the right to expect proper, orderly services here in the House. That is why tomorrow’s vote is particularly important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For yet another year, the debate on the guidelines for the administrative budget of the institutions of the European Union is being held while the economic and social crisis is severely testing the budgets of all the States. Everywhere in the European Union, budgets are being prepared on the basis of rationalised public spending and harsh economic measures in numerous sectors of the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, I support the rapporteur’s position and the need to avoid any superfluous spending or spending which is not immediately necessary, by clearly defining the priorities and, where possible and useful, by redistributing spending, so as to rationalise the administrative budget of those institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">However, like the rapporteur, I, too, should like to emphasise that account should be taken, when rationalising administrative spending, of the need to abide by the economic commitments of the European Union, such as the accession of Croatia, and the need to maintain an effective administration that can respond to the enhanced responsibilities of the European Parliament under the Treaty of Lisbon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has done a good job. </p>
<p class="contents">I think in times of austerity, it is natural that the public at large, and particularly the media, look at politicians and the overall expenditure associated with their activities. This in itself is not a bad thing, and it is good for us to look at our own situation. For that reason, I see no reason why we should not have an external audit of our activities. This would certainly be good in the overall context, but it would also make it easier for us to defend whatever expenditure we have, and certainly it might point out areas that we ourselves would think are perfect but may lead to savings without impacting on the overall effect.</p>
<p class="contents">People have also mentioned the single seat and so forth. This is certainly an issue. Having us here in Strasbourg every month is something that many citizens do not even realise is happening; secondly, it does not make a lot of sense to them. So there is a need for a discussion on that, and maybe a need to come to an arrangement with the French and possibly with Strasbourg regarding how matters could be looked at and improved in terms of efficiencies. Also ancillary committees – the Committee of the Regions is definitely something that needs to be looked at in terms of its size, how often it meets, and so forth. So an external audit is something I would welcome.</p>

We face new challenges following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. The quality of our work will determine how Europeans live in the future. We have begun reforms in connection with the common agricultural policy and cohesion policy. We are also very active in other areas. We must be very professional and have good support both from the European Parliament’s administrative service and the staff of the Commission, as well as from the people we employ. So the appropriate resources are necessary, and we should not be saving on the quality of our work.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we do have a crisis in the European Union. We need to show solidarity with those we keep telling to make savings. This is being said to the Greeks, the Poles and those who live in other countries. I support the idea of freezing the European Parliament’s budget, but at the same time we need to look for many other solutions, too – solutions which will be even more effective. Mention has been made here today of the European Parliament’s seat in Strasbourg. This is something we cannot understand, because we talk about this on a daily basis, and it is also incomprehensible to millions of Europeans, who do not know why the European Parliament has two seats. This should be sorted out immediately and a way found out of this absurd situation. From the very beginning, I have been in favour of the European Parliament having a single seat in Brussels.

This report could consist of just three words: cut, cut, cut. If we want, today, to set an example to the citizens of Europe, we must cut costs, starting with our own, and it is meaningless – I am speaking, now, to Mr Rübig – to talk about small amounts. Would you entrust your money to someone who does not manage with looking after his own, small amount, Mr Rübig?</p>
<p class="contents">Our problem is actually about the fact that we are unable to start with ourselves. We spend such a lot on European Union and European Parliament propaganda. This is the only point on which I am in agreement with Mr Rübig. It is a good idea to give money to fund the House of European History, although I do not know if this money should feature in the budget of the European Parliament. Besides, Mr Rübig, the best propaganda will be if we cut our allowances. The best propaganda will be if we reduce representation expenses by 15%.

With this in mind, I agree with the rapporteur that in the coming years we need to take care to draft a realistic budget and to take action which brings long-term savings.</p>
<p class="contents">I think freezing budget lines for such things as travel in 2013 is a solution which is very definitely appropriate to the difficulties Europe faces. I agree, too, that in this legislature, building projects should be limited to those which are already in progress. Finally, I think it is crucial to have close cooperation between the Bureau and the Committee on Budgets throughout the whole year, as this will enable a smooth budgetary process and effective implementation of changes which bring real savings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have to start doing this through the budget choices and through our vision of a strategy for growth of the Union and of individual Member States.</p>

<p class="contents">In the middle of an economic and financial crisis and ongoing national budget and consolidation efforts, the EU just does not want to see sense. It does not want to actually reverse expenditure but wants a freeze on inflation, which is probably still an increase. What we actually need is to withdraw expenditure and save taxpayers’ money.</p>
<p class="contents">It needs to be by independent assessment. You have the daily allowances of EUR 304 and there will be a significant number of MEPs – and some MEPs I see in this place right now – who sign in on a Friday in Strasbourg when there is no official business, stealing taxpayers’ money. That should stop. Office allowances are only required to be 50% receipted. That should be 90% receipted and they should be independently audited, as mine is independently audited. If that money is not properly spent, it should be returned. The House of History is a colossal waste of taxpayers’ money that should be stopped.

However, rather than a short-sighted cutting of funds for the key investments committed to by the EU which will secure Europe’s economic growth in the future, Derek Vaughan’s report emphasises effective management. In other words, the aim is to do more with the available resources. In practice, that means, for example, closer cooperation between EU bodies and institutions, enabling the more effective use of resources, as well as a thorough review of all items in the EU budget, in order to limit unnecessary duplication of some initiatives and so on. Mr Vaughan also proposes freezing the administrative expenditure of all bodies and institutions. The report provides a sober view of the matter, free of counter-productive populism, and I am therefore ready to support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The sharply rising unemployment, particularly among young people, the collapse of industrial production and trade, and the need for significant savings in the countries which make up the Union, mean that the European Parliament, too, must cut back on expenditure. Therefore, I welcome this report, particularly paragraph 2 and its reference to greater integration of the institutions. Studies have shown that such action would reduce the expenses Parliament incurs in connection with the monthly move to Strasbourg. Looking at the ever worsening financial situation of the Union’s citizens, I cannot see the point of the monthly move, which, on an annual basis, costs around EUR 280 million and results in the emission of 20 000 tonnes of CO<span class="sub">2</span>. Neither can we disregard the opinion of the citizens who, in 2002, collected over 1.2 million signatures petitioning for the European Parliament to have a single seat in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point contained in the report is the proposal to reduce the budget of the European External Action Service. As the work of this institution shows in practice, despite its significant expenditure, it has not given the European Union a more important position in the eyes of our external partners. Therefore, I think it is necessary to review the costs associated with diplomats’ pay and allowances and Ms Ashton’s travel costs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
