<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentleman, the regulation which is the subject of Mr Seppänen’s report is a most important element of European legislation aimed at completing the task of creating a fully operational competitive European market in natural gas. It is an essential supplementary instrument to the second directive on the internal market in gas. This is because it lays down the minimum requirements for the key aspect of the approach to liberalisation of the energy market, namely access to the networks for third parties.</p>
<p class="contents">I am fully aware the draft regulation on conditions of access to gas transmission networks has given rise to a series of interesting debates over the last few weeks. I should therefore like to take advantage of this opportunity to clarify some issues where I believe further explanation is still required.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to reflect firstly on what the draft regulation is designed to achieve, and secondly, on why is it needed and what significance it has?</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the regulation supplements the directive on the internal market and fills the gap remaining. Indeed, both the second directive on the internal market in gas and the proposed regulation are based on the principles of non-discrimination, transparency and competition. Clearly, both legislative acts recognise the fundamental importance of access to the network by third parties. The directive, however, only defines the objectives, whereas the regulation lays down a series of minimum requirements to be met with regard to the crucial issue of access to the network by third parties. Obviously, a number of conditions will have to be met in order to comply with the provisions and objectives contained in the directive, as there are qualitative implications to opening up the market in addition to quantitative ones. These conditions are also needed to ensure the market is competitive and can be exploited in full.</p>
<p class="contents">This discussion concerns drawing on the experience gained during liberalisation of the gas markets. Experience has shown that failure to meet such requirements will mean that conditions of access to the European market will not meet the needs of opening up the market in gas. Competitiveness and smooth operation of the latter will not be ensured either.</p>
<p class="contents">All this has been the subject of debate at the Madrid Forum for a year. Essentially, the participants in that forum laid down the requirements. The latter amount to minimum conditions agreed by all those involved in the Madrid Forum. The aim is to create and guarantee a level playing field for access to this market.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, if this regulation comes into force, in the version proposed by the Commission, there can be every confidence that the means and systems are in place to allow it to become operational. I must remind the House that our common aim is to create an internal market in gas within the European Union. Gas should be able to flow freely across all the networks in the Union. This means gas will be able to cross borders unrestricted. It also means that no restrictions can be placed either on its movement within the various Member States of the Union. This is the reason why it has been stated specifically that all transport networks are covered by the proposed regulation, not simply cross-border networks.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the role of the gas sector in the years to come, there can be no doubt that close cooperation between the sector and the Commission will be essential. This should be borne in mind when it comes to defining the general standards for the gas market in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">For obvious reasons, the Commission proposed the committee procedure. The latter will have no influence in this regard, however. It is not aimed at restricting the role of the sector and certainly not at excluding it from the drafting of future measures. Quite the opposite is the case. The Commission is open to proposals emphasising the role of the sector here and now and in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to turn to Mr Mombaur’s report. I shall focus on those parts of it concerning measures to ensure the security of natural gas supply.</p>
<p class="contents">You will recall that last December, the Council unanimously adopted a political guideline. The Council also amended the legal basis for the Commission’s proposal. Article 100 is now the legal basis instead of Article 95. The European Parliament report we are today debating also supports the change in the legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The House will be aware that the Commission does not endorse such a change of legal basis. On the occasion of the Council held on 15 December 2003, the Commission issued a statement reserving its position on the change of legal basis. We shall stand by our statement and position when the Council finally adopts the text of the directive in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to outline the reasons for maintaining our position. I shall be brief.</p>
<p class="contents">We appreciate that part of the text of the draft directive refers to the security of supply. The text also contains references to the operation of the internal market, however. The Commission believes that the references to the internal market carry most weight, and that therefore they should determine the legal basis of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission is of the opinion that the text adopted by the Council contains a series of standards aimed at bringing a degree of harmonisation to a competitive European internal natural gas market. The Member States are charged with defining a policy to ensure the security of gas supply. It is also for the Member States to define the functions and responsibilities of the participants in the gas market regarding the security of supply. In addition, the Member States are responsible for introducing certain minimum standards. Each country will define its own standards. Nonetheless, a degree of harmonisation will exist, as the standards relate to certain specific criteria for gas.</p>
<p class="contents">By contrast, the provisions aimed entirely at security of supply are designed mainly to deal with situations we hope will never arise. I have in mind situations such as a serious political crisis or long-term uncertainty surrounding gas supply.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of all this, the Commission remains convinced that Article 95 is the correct legal basis. The Commission therefore regrets that the Council saw fit to come to a different conclusion, and that it now appears Parliament will do likewise.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should like to conclude by thanking Mr Seppänen and Mr Mombaur for all the work and effort they have put into these two reports. Following on from the various amendments and speeches, I shall say more on a key issue, namely access to the networks. In the Commission’s view, there can be no question of threatening the profitability and future investment in a most crucial element for the development of the market in gas. I refer to the construction and maintenance of gas networks across the Community. This is borne out by the proposal for trans-European energy networks. A number of the main projects for the future already adopted relate to gas networks.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the first proposal being discussed in the run up to enlargement, the Commission endorses and supports several projects involving major interconnections between gas networks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important to have reliable rules for access to networks. We found that with the gas directive last year. My group believes the proposal should be further discussed together with the amendments tabled by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, there are four points I would like to recommend you consider in greater detail in the Council debate. Firstly, investment incentives. We can talk about markets here for a long time. If we have no investors, then in the end we have no market either. The Commission has often referred to the great risks carried by investors in the gas sector – exploration, pipeline construction. There is competition in pipelines; there already was when the monopolies existed. That is how the market came into being and it must remain clear that tariffs based on costs alone may deter investments.</p>
<p class="contents">My second remark is please will you consider whether more weight can be given to cross-border gas transport. Thirdly, comitology. The problem is not comitology itself, but the question is whether Article 9 is in a correct relationship to Articles 3 to 8, that is whether the most important points really are in Articles 3 to 8. This can perhaps be improved when it is discussed in the Council. My fourth comment, Commissioner de Palacio, is that of course everyone who has anything to say about the market is important, regulators, network operators and above all investors, and it is absolutely clear that you talk to them before you make proposals to Parliament and Council; you always have done. Now they would all like to be mentioned in the legislation. Personally, I do not see why they should be, because I believe the Commission knows how to do its job, but if it would give those I have just named pleasure to be mentioned in a recital, then I do not really mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Then I would like to say something about the other report on security of natural gas supply. It is correct that we depend very much on imports. It is therefore right that we should be concerned with this and oblige the Member States to introduce a suitable policy. Now Parliament has adopted at first reading a different text than the one the Commission presented and the Council has backed Parliament in the matter. We are therefore now speaking about a different text than the Commission originally presented and in our view this text no longer contains any rules for the internal market. This means that the European Union has only one way of justifying it at all, namely Article 100 of the Treaty, and, on the basis of the vote of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the committee therefore recommends that Parliament follow the Council’s lead on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some Member States have had problems implementing earlier decisions, and the Commission has therefore used a strategic weapon, which is to say a regulation, to guarantee access to gas networks in all countries, especially when transporting gas across borders from one country to another, but also within countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft Regulation is mainly based on the work of the Madrid Forum, which was attended by different market participants. They thought they were drafting a recommendation there that would guarantee access to the gas transmission markets on a voluntary basis. Some of those that participated might feel let down, as a voluntary commitment was altered to a compulsory regulation in the Commission’s reading.</p>
<p class="contents">There was not enough time at the Madrid Forum to discuss all the details regarding access to the networks, and new laws are to be drafted in the future under the comitology procedure without any consultation procedure involving the participants at the Madrid Forum. It is therefore understandable if some market participants are worried about how their interests are to be taken into account in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">During the committee discussions the Commission representatives said it was the Commission’s intention that the participants at the Madrid Forum would also be heard in the future when the detailed regulations for implementing the Regulation were being drafted. As the Madrid Forum is not a legal body, it is the opinion of the Commission that consultations with it cannot be recorded in the text of the Regulation. As rapporteur, however, I think it would be appropriate if this undertaking to consult the various parties were also recorded in the minutes of Parliament’s plenary session. I would expect this to be done when the Commissioner makes her next speech or before the final votes.</p>
<p class="contents">After a number of votes on the matter our committee adopted the position that there are good arguments in favour of establishing the Regulation and that the Commission proposal should furthermore be adopted in principle by this Parliament. In the votes more than 40 amendments were accepted as a basis for first reading, and Parliament wishes to hold talks on them with representatives of the Commission and the Council some time in the future when the draft Regulation is being finally agreed. I wish to thank everyone for their excellent levels of cooperation whilst the item for debate was being prepared. Although we were in disagreement with one another and had our different interests to consider, I think we managed to work very objectively and achieve an excellent end result.</p>
<p class="contents">I await the Commissioner’s speech, which will hopefully reconfirm the Commission’s commitment to include consultation with the participants of the Madrid Forum in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is significant that after much debate in committee only one additional amendment has been tabled over and above those adopted in committee. I am one of those who accepted the argument for the need for a regulation to give effect to and make binding the voluntary code on guidelines for good practice agreed at the Madrid forum, and I and my Group therefore support this proposal for a regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur states the case very well in his explanatory statement and I can do no more than commend his analysis to colleagues and make a recommendation to adopt. We must recognise that the industry was not of one view on this matter, with the incumbent network or transmission system operators resisting change, while most of the other operators, be they upstream or downstream, strongly endorsed the underlying principle embodied in the Commission proposal. This measure should assist new entrants.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for competition to flourish and for benefits to flow from it in terms of better service to consumers, greater efficiency as regards both energy and market forces, enhanced security of supply, greater flexibility and increased innovation, there must be a clear regulatory framework. This measure takes us a long way towards genuine and full liberalisation and I congratulate the rapporteur and the Commissioner on their efforts in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe we in this Parliament have been united on that for quite some time. May I remind you that last year, after more than two years’ intensive work, we adopted directives to accelerate the opening of both the electricity and the gas markets in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say, however, that I and a few others, too, were then rather surprised at how quickly this follow-up proposal for a regulation concerning gas transmission networks has come. We are surprised because the time allowed for the Member States to implement the directive has not yet expired – it will do so in a few weeks’ time – and also because we have set a very ambitious timetable for the Commission to submit an evaluation report on the application and implementation of the directive; it was to happen in 2006. So much for the background.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to raise three points which, I fully admit, have left me rather sceptical. Firstly, the compatibility between this regulation and the directive we adopted. Secondly, the justification the Commission has given, which I have not exactly found in the text, namely that the emphasis should be placed on cross-border trade. The third point that has made me rather sceptical was the proposal for a very wide-ranging comitology procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, after a long discussion, as the rapporteur said, we have agreed to continue working on the Commission’s approach. We have therefore proposed a number of amendments in the three areas I have just mentioned. So far as my group is concerned, the outcome is that we support the package as a whole. That is not the end of my group’s work, however. We are waiting to see what the Council does and then there will be the second reading, but we shall continue to back here in plenary these 42 amendments that were adopted in committee, and we hope that this will bring us a little further forwards in the opening of the energy markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When the legal basis of a proposal is unreliable, when the rights of the Member States are infringed in the process, and where the actual text leaves something to be desired, it is not easy to draft a sound report. It is gratifying to note that the Council has reached a political agreement after all, in which Parliament’s reservations have been duly incorporated.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, during the discussion of the issue of safeguard security of gas supplies, I was the draftsman of the opinion on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I then indicated why the Commission proposal was unsatisfactory on a number of scores. It is satisfying to see that the Council has adopted the most important recommendations to have been made during the debates.</p>
<p class="contents">A first recommendation concerned the legal basis of the Commission proposal. The Commission took Article 95 – internal market – as its basis. At the time, we talked about the fact that it would be preferable to use Article 100, which deals with crisis measures. I think the Commission is wrong in its view that Article 100 applies only to economic and monetary policy; in a wider context, economic policy can also include energy policy. You stated, Commissioner, that the Commission fails to see eye to eye with the Council and Parliament. Do you intend to go to the Court of Justice again?</p>
<p class="contents">My second recommendation is this. In the Council, Commission and Parliament, the gas directive, in respect of which the Council’s common position was determined, was circulated last year. The proposal concerning security of supply does not appear to be in keeping with this. On the contrary, the proposal seems to contravene the gas directive. It was surprising that pending the procedure with the gas directive, a proposal was submitted to Parliament on safeguarding security of gas supplies. I should like to hear from the Commissioner whether the amended proposal on safeguarding security of gas supplies has been based on the gas directive. If so, in what way was that done? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is availability and the second is price. In my opinion, we are right to take Article 100 as the basis now, even if Mr Blokland is right in saying we will have to take a very broad interpretation of it. Whenever security of supply is discussed, there is always the temptation really to mean that it is an opportunity to introduce indirect price controls. I believe that on the whole we will fail in that, because it will not work and the perspective taken is far too short-term.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, we must not forget, either, that gas is dependent on price, which is in turn tied to the price of oil, and that we may perhaps be greatly deceiving ourselves about its availability. The best form of security of supply is surely to have our own supplies, and we must therefore welcome the fact that work is gradually being done (a) to produce high-quality gas ourselves inside the European Union and (b) to feed that gas into our own available networks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This may well be my last speech in the Chamber. As a former mining engineer, energy policy has been one of my prime interests, so I am happy to be making my swan-song on an energy subject.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Parliament will strongly support this proposal because it will play an important role in the completion of the internal energy market. Its purpose is to ensure fair access to networks for all market players and a genuinely competitive market for traded gas in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The third-party access guidelines in the Annex have been agreed by Member States, regulators, TSOs and system users. It is therefore appropriate that the text of the regulation agreed in committee should be as close as possible to the guidelines agreed at the Madrid Forum. Consultation with all actors in the industry is vital if the regulation is to be effective. That is why they must all be consulted on the establishment of further guidelines. National regulators will have a vital role to play in enforcing the guidelines at Member State level, as envisaged by the Gas Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposed gas regulation deals with similar issues to the electricity regulation agreed by the Council and Parliament last year. It is appropriate that the same institutional arrangements and procedures should apply.</p>

<p class="contents">In order to overcome the remaining obstacles to the completion of the internal market, the Member States established a system of informal coordination between, on the one hand, Community and national institutions, and on the other, companies and regulatory authorities in the gas sector, seeking to lay down guidelines on third party access to transmission networks. Nevertheless, this informal coordination has proved to be inadequate to address the severe delays which have built up until now; indeed, the interests in undertakings of various countries and the privileges of position which many gas supply undertakings continue to gain from, have seriously jeopardised the possibility of completing a single market in the gas supply sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We should therefore welcome the Commission’s initiative proposing the regulation which we must debate today, which makes the operating rules clearer and binding and responds to consumers’ and companies’ needs for certainty and rapidity. The text put forward by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy further strengthens this proposal and I therefore believe that it should be supported as it stands.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in the interest of certain countries – Italy in particular – with a high consumption of natural gas, insufficient national production and a strong, growing dependence on imports, which require several countries to be crossed, to have certain rules which signify, in operational terms, a real opportunity to have a market and, consequently, a system of liberalised networks which make gas available to companies and consumers in the required amounts, with freedom of choice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I cannot answer that question today.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is certain: security of supply will be improved by more competition; we have always been clear about that. Even competition cannot do that without supply, however, which means, I believe, that security of supply, of natural gas in particular, will depend very much on a European foreign policy for energy, in other words diversification and security of supply through access to gas.</p>
<p class="contents">Like many others, too, I also advocate proceeding gradually. I believe that, as with oil, the responsibility rests in the first instance with the companies.

Consequently, I shall focus on the various views expressed and on the amendments to Mr Seppänen’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to begin by thanking the House for the discussion that evolved on a matter of such vital importance, and for the calibre of the 43 amendments. This does not mean that we will be able to endorse all 43, however. In particular, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work. Thanks are also due to Mr Mombaur, who has already left the House. I do not share his views on changing the legal basis, but he certainly has worked in a most constructive manner also.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that the Commission cannot support the amendments restricting the scope of the draft regulation to cross-border trade only. That would amount to scaling down the aim of this proposal significantly. The same would be true of its possibilities. There would be no difficulty in trading gas from one country to another, but internal competition would definitely be restricted. In a number of States, including several new Member States, gas flows along many networks. Some of the latter do not link into a specific point of importation. Consequently, they do not link into a cross-border point either.</p>
<p class="contents">All these transport networks and the relevant companies would be excluded from the scope of implementation of the proposed regulation. This would hinder and prejudice the smooth operation of the internal market. In addition, the scope of implementation is that envisaged in the transit directive and in the second directive relating to the internal market in gas.</p>
<p class="contents">What is at issue is facilitating competition, not only competition between the various countries but also within them. Restricting the scope of implementation of this regulation would entail limiting its aim significantly and also limiting the possibility of actually achieving a competitive European gas market.</p>
<p class="contents">It must also be taken into account, however, that several speakers, and in particular Mr Mombaur, have raised the issue of guaranteeing a degree of profitability that would make the allocation of funds to the creation, construction and maintenance of the gas networks an attractive proposition. In this connection, I can say that we are able to accept Amendment No 12. We believe it clarifies our text and improves its quality. We feel the amendment takes account of competition between the various networks. There was no specific provision for this in our text. We are therefore of the opinion that the amendment helps to allay the fears of those concerned about the lack of profitability. Consequently it also allays concerns about future difficulties relating to new investment.</p>
<p class="contents">I must point out that the minimum standards for access to transport networks are absolutely crucial. They are essential in order to facilitate access to new competitors, and therefore also to creating a genuine internal market in gas. I cannot emphasise this enough.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject of the Madrid Forum has also been raised. It has been suggested that we should move somewhat further ahead. Furthermore, concern has been expressed as to whether, in future, the comitology procedure will result in sidelining the Forum, or sidelining the sector, that is, its protagonists.</p>
<p class="contents">The House must be aware that over the years I have always stressed the need to listen to the main stakeholders on a regular basis and we are, therefore, prepared to consider a solution guaranteeing that the sector will be consulted at the Madrid Forum, together with all other interested parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 3 could prove helpful in this regard. However things eventually turn out, we have no intention of excluding the sector. On the contrary, we hope it will remain involved. Looking to the future, we intend to support the Madrid Forum.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does not wish to go beyond the ground covered by the Madrid Forum. Nonetheless, we do believe that one of the proposals put to the Forum by Eurogas, relating to the ‘use it or lose it’ principle, is essential in the field of contracts. Otherwise, <span class="italic">a priori</span> contracts could result in outright prevention of genuine access to third parties. This would mean restricting competition. Future user contracts must therefore be based also on the ‘use it or lose it’<span class="italic"> </span>principle. This is the only way of ensuring they are genuine contracts and not contracts aimed solely at using or saturating available capacity. By creating artificial congestion in the networks such contracts would prevent access by third parties.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, the draft regulation is in line with the Madrid Forum guidelines, as you have pointed out and recognised, ladies and gentlemen. The amendments that clarify or support the provisions of this draft regulation are acceptable, at least in part or if their text is adjusted. This is true of Amendments Nos 1 and 22, and of many others I shall not mention individually. A detailed list will be provided.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning certain technical issues such as those dealt with in Amendments Nos 14 and 16, these are matters dealt with by the European Association for Gas Exchange. The latter was set up at the request of the Madrid Forum. I have to say that given the very specific, complex and technical nature of these issues, we shall continue to leave them to the aforementioned organisation to deal with. It has already made significant progress, and is reporting regularly to the Madrid Forum. We believe this is the best way to deal with such matters.</p>
<p class="contents">There are practical and legal reasons why amendments such as Amendments Nos 8, 17, 22, 27, 30, 35, 37 or 42 are not acceptable. Finally, we cannot agree to the presentation of new guidelines on the remaining issues dealt with in the draft regulation in a predetermined time period. Some of these issues may require studies to be undertaken. Discussions and negotiations on others may take longer than anticipated. Consequently, Amendment No 31 is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this is the last debate on fundamental issues concerning energy to take place in this Parliament. There will of course be a debate on Eco-design later. To some extent, however, that is a side issue, bringing together industry and energy. It tends to be always the same people taking part in these debates, and we have come to know each other fairly well. I should like to congratulate Mr Seppänen, the rapporteur, and also to thank all the honourable Members present for their input and support over the years. Their contributions were most welcome and have been incorporated into many of the proposals drafted during this period. I feel Parliament’s constructive attitude and the helpful interchange of ideas have resulted in considerable improvement to most of the proposals brought before the House. Personally, I have valued your help, ladies and gentlemen, and also the Commission’s constant support.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth remembering that, thanks to this constructive attitude, it has been possible to make spectacular progress during these last years. The Commission’s adoption of the Green Paper marked a turning point. Parliament’s report on the Green Paper was of the utmost importance too, as were the conclusions it led to. I could mention the gas and electricity liberalisation packages. There were also the crucial accompanying measures, such as access to the networks. Work on the latter is just drawing to a close. As Mr Linkohr, Mr Rapkay and several other speakers have mentioned, we would have liked to wrap up earlier on this. Nevertheless, our goal is in sight and we are moving slowly but surely towards it.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with the liberalisation of gas and electricity, the proposal concerning trans-European networks is essential in order for the European internal market in energy to become a reality as far as infrastructures are concerned. The relevant measures dealing with the current Union have been adopted already. Work on similar arrangements for the enlarged Union is well advanced.</p>
<p class="contents">We have worked as never before to debate and promote matters relating to energy and the environment. In the past, in other parliaments, the tendency had been simply to set goals for this key area. Many good intentions were expressed, but there was a lack of specific proposals aimed at attaining the objectives. We have succeeded in translating those pious statements and good intentions into texts, obligations and responsibilities. By way of example, I could mention the promotion of renewable energies, energy efficiency in buildings, issues related to biofuels, the creation of intelligent energy, Eco-design and energy efficiency. Community policy has come into play too. This has been most important. Good progress has been made concerning Community policy on nuclear safety. The work is not yet complete, but much has been achieved. A further issue related to the European energy market on which substantial progress has been made concerns the adoption of a European objective with regard to the security of energy supply. Mr Linkohr referred to this when he took the floor. Furthermore, the importance of ensuring security of internal supply within the Union has been recognised also.</p>
<p class="contents">Good progress has been made. We have worked well together. Madam President, I am bound to thank the House once again for its cooperation, for all the effort it has made and for its valuable contributions. In particular, honourable Members are to be commended on the intellectual skills and depth of knowledge they displayed in tackling the texts, which have sometimes been extremely complicated and technical. They demonstrated an excellent grasp of the issues, and I believe congratulations are in order. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You were kind enough to say how much you appreciated the excellent collaboration with the European Parliament and especially with the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. I think I can say, on behalf of the members of that committee and on behalf of the European Parliament as a whole, how much we too have appreciated being able to work with you in the field of energy and in other fields. Your feelings, I believe, are reciprocated by the Members of this House.</p>
