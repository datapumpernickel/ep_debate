<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Thorning-Schmidt (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, the Council of Ministers has presented a common position on mechanical vibrations. There are a great many good things in the common position. The best is that agreement on a compromise has been successfully reached in the Council. This means that there is now broad recognition of the fact that vibrations constitute a health risk, when it comes both to hand/arm vibrations and whole-body vibrations. It is also good that all three institutions appear to be in agreement as to a method of limiting these vibrations. The key to this method is the parallel introduction of action values and limit values that should never be exceeded. In the Committee reading, we talked a lot about the limit values. That is really rather a pity, however, for it is in actual fact the action values that are the most important for, when the action values are exceeded, the employer is obliged to do something and to take preventative action to change the way in which the work is organised. It is precisely this method which offers flexibility and emphasises prevention rather than injunctions. Moreover, I find it very annoying that it is precisely this flexibility and the emphasis on prevention that have not been recognised at all by the opponents of the proposal here in Parliament. That is a great pity, in view of the fact that they themselves often talk about flexibility and prevention rather than injunctions.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are, unfortunately, also less happy facets of this proposal by the Council of Ministers. The Commission’s original proposal has been weakened in a number of ways, and it has therefore been necessary to table some amendments. I will go through a couple of them. Amendment No 1 is a reminder that we still do not have the directives concerning the remaining physical agents. We know that the Noise Directive is on the way, but we are now waiting impatiently for the latter, and it would be appropriate if, by accepting our amendments, the Commission were, today, to tell us that they are as committed as we are to putting these directives in place. We have been waiting for many years.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 2 is crucial. As I say, it is good that the Council could agree to set a limit value, but when you consider how high it really is, you can also understand how agreement could have been successfully reached. The proposed 1.15 m/s2 constitutes a significant weakening of the original proposal. The report therefore proposes a limit value of 0.8 m/s2. We know from the internationally recognised ISO standards that it can be said with certainty that there are health risks with exposure of more than 0.8 m/s2. It therefore makes more sense to set a limit value in which the protection of employees will, in actual fact, be something real. There is no question of any tightening-up. All that is proposed is a return to the level proposed by the Commission itself at first reading, and there is no new knowledge to justify choosing another limit value.</p>
<p class="contents">Some MEPs have repeated again and again that there is not one single proof of the connection between whole-body vibrations and injury. That is simply not the case, however. There is a quite clear connection between strong vibrations and injury. That is something that science is agreed about. It is true that we cannot put clear figures upon the number of people who will be injured in the case of a specific limit value. However, that is how it will always be when it is a question of people and their working environment. In such cases, the precautionary principle must be applied, and this is also something actually laid down in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 5 proposes shorter transitional periods than those proposed in the common position. Clearly, these could be applied in practice out in the real world. With the common position, however, we should arrive at transitional periods of up to 12 years, and it makes almost no sense to legislate for such long periods. Finally, on behalf of my own Group of the Party of European Socialists and of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I have tabled an amendment that makes it possible to exempt agriculture and forestry from the limit values for whole-body vibrations. We have arrived at a compromise whereby agriculture and forestry, like aviation and shipping, are given the opportunity to be exempt from these limit values for whole-body vibrations. We have done this because we remained doubtful as to whether agriculture could, in fact, comply with these conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to emphasise two things in this connection. First of all, I think that the farming industry’s impact assessments have been very exaggerated and therefore not to be taken seriously. It has been maintained that farmers would only be able to work for two hours a day. That, I think, is wrong. I believe in actual fact that, in preparing the assessments, it has been forgotten that the directive only applies to employees and not to people who are self-employed. The second thing it is important to state is that this compromise proposal does not mean that we are giving up combating harmful vibrations within agriculture. It simply means choosing another method, and it is worth emphasising that the action values must go on being maintained. I hope that the Commission and the Council will respond positively to our proposal. I also hope that we shall obtain wide support for the proposals here in the House. The text before us is balanced and reasonable and fulfils the main purpose of this directive, namely to ensure flexibility in the workplace at the same time as ensuring that employees are guaranteed the necessary protection against harmful vibrations in the workplace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you know, this is an objective that Parliament quite rightly considers very important.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, however, find a fair balance between, on the one hand, the need to protect the health and safety of workers and, on the other hand, the need to prevent this directive from placing excessive burdens on companies and particularly on small- and medium-sized enterprises. If we adopt overly restrictive exposure limit values, it could, in practice, and technically speaking, turn out to be extremely difficult to abide by them; it could actually harm the interests of workers, either because this could lead to their working time being limited to two hours per day, or because if the limit values are not applied, the protection they do have could be significantly reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Since this report only concerns the issue of vibrations, we must also take into account the delicate and hard-won agreement between the various national requirements, and we must not impose further excessive restrictions on the sectors and industries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">And in this respect, I would like to say that our Committee was not able to complete its work due to an incredibly busy timetable. We were unable to interview all the relevant people involved before the deadline, and this is something I regret.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, our group believes that the amendments adopted in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs are a relatively acceptable compromise between the requirement for the protection of workers and on the competitiveness of European industry. Nevertheless, our group considers that it is essential to include the derogation option for the agricultural and forestry sectors, since the current arrangements for servicing and replacing machinery in these sectors would not enable exposure limit values to be effectively applied.</p>
<p class="contents">On a personal note, and particularly with regard to the work that we did last week, I would lastly like to thank Mrs Thorning-Schmidt for her cooperation. Mrs Diamantopoulou, I hope that this spirit of openness, as part of our conciliation work with the Council, will enable us to agree on a halfway point so that the directive can be adopted within a reasonable timeframe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hughes (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, for the tremendous grasp she has demonstrated of this highly technical subject both in committee and in plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">My father and his brothers and, in fact, all the male members of my family worked in the coalmines in the northeast of England and most of them have received compensation for both industrial white finger, which is caused by hand-arm vibration, and industrial deafness. This proposal concerning physical agents is a very real proposal to me.</p>
<p class="contents">Vibration has been a major problem in the past. But it still is, and that is demonstrated by the very strenuous lobbying on all Members of this House from various sectors of industry in relation to this proposal. I would like to echo what the rapporteur has said about the other elements of the original physical agents' directive. Noise, the original directive of 1986, was due to be reviewed in 1991. Here we are, ten years later, and no revision to the existing legislation on noise has been made.</p>
<p class="contents">On optical radiation, industrial lasers were in their infancy when the original proposal was brought forward. They are now in widespread use and we need to update or introduce law at European level on that subject in regard to fields and waves. We are increasingly bombarded by fields and waves of all types and all intensities in our homes and workplaces. That is set to increase radically as a result of developments such as the new bluetooth standard. All of those outstanding elements are becoming increasingly urgent, and I hope the Commission will continue its good work to break the impasse that has so far existed inside the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has introduced a number of important amendments in her report, but probably among the most important is Amendment No 2 concerning whole-body vibration. Amendment No 2 represents a compromise, it lies between the Commission's original proposal and the common position, and I hope it will receive the support of the House.</p>
<p class="contents">We have received strenuous lobbying, particularly on whole-body vibration. There is general consensus on the need to act on hand-arm vibration, but industrial lobbyists have worked hard to convince Members that there is no link between whole-body vibration and injury. I know for a fact that the Commission has at least 17 box-files of evidence showing causality between exposure to whole-body vibration and injury. The difficulty is in untangling what proportion of the injury is due directly to whole-body vibration and what proportion is due to other factors such as poor ergonomics or bad posture. There is a causal link and there is a need to act. I hope we will see support for the rapporteur on that issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has also mentioned a compromise to exclude agriculture. It proved necessary to introduce such a compromise; the exclusion would be for five years if it does come to pass. I would have preferred that it did not occur, but it had to happen to secure political consensus here for today's vote. If it is agreed, the Commission must not do its usual trick of waiting the full five years before assessing the scientific evidence and bringing forward a proposal. The preparatory work needs to be done to move quickly once that five years has expired.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, we are aiming for and will continue to seek to achieve in conciliation, beyond the debate and vote today, is a balance between action levels and limit values which it will be possible for industry to accept and implement but will at the same time drive forward improved engineering to eliminate vibration from new equipment and improve the way in which ergonomic considerations are taken into account. I hope the report will be supported today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As has already been said, there is evidence that whitefinger can be caused by hand-arm vibration, but I do not believe that there is sufficient evidence that whole body vibration causes tremendous health risks for workers. There is a slight health risk, but even the ISO standards say that there is no quantitative health risk, and so without further scientific evidence, I think it would be crazy for us to put more burdens on industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that the rapporteur has eventually agreed that we need a compromise on agriculture, so I urge you all to vote for Amendment No 11. This would exclude agriculture and forestry for five years and then it would come back to Parliament after further research and scientific evidence has been provided. If we do not vote for the compromise in Amendment No 11, I believe that the harvest across the whole of the EU will not be able to take place. If we do not vote for it, tractor drivers, for instance, will be able to drive their tractor for between 2 to 4 hours in any 8 hour period and that is if we get the 0.8 m/s2 that the rapporteur is suggesting. Even if agriculture and forestry is taken back, we need to go back to the common position of 1.15 m/s2 instead of the 0.8 that the rapporteur is proposing, because if we do not go back to that, other parts of the industry such as engineering, mining, construction will have tremendous problems, so I urge you to make sure that you do not vote to put more restrictions on industry when we do not have a quantitative health risk demonstrated. I hereby beg you not to vote for the rapporteur's position on this and to go back to the common position and vote for Amendment No 11 and against Amendments Nos 2, 4, 12 and 9. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have been active in an advisory role vis-à-vis works councils, trade unions and industry concerning conditions at work, among other things. I have observed that, for some fifteen years, we in the Netherlands – but that also applies to other Member States in terms of best practices – have been working with the ISO Standard 2631, as recommended and followed by Mrs Thorning-Schmidt. Only at the end did we decide to adopt the amendment by Mrs Hermange.</p>
<p class="contents">I actually agree that we should not simply consider the views of industry. There are also other angles to be considered. For example, the trade unions have stated that this is not simply a matter of exposure from a health perspective, but also a matter of symptoms of fatigue, for example. Consequently, the standard should, from the point of view of safety – or, rather, the lack of this – actually be stricter than is now the case. I have not yet heard this aspect mentioned here, and it should actually help us find a happy medium. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a wide-ranging declaration, within the chapter on solidarity, which includes not only the measures taken against obvious risks, such as the risk of falling or risks faced when dealing with abrasive materials, but also those preventative measures used against risks that could go undetected by the majority of those who are not experts in this field. These are the risks that those who work in mines, in construction and in the field of transport have to face on a daily basis, which, according to those who study them, affect up to 24% of European workers. These risks originate from two different types of vibration: Hand-arm vibration, which is the cause of whitefinger, impaired feeling and grip, amongst other problems, or Whole-body vibration, which is the cause of back problems, lumbar pains and slipped discs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth remembering, Commissioner, that these measures should not be limited to including only physical causes, such as vibrations, but should also take account of electromagnetic fields, noise and waves and optical radiation, for example, and also bear in mind the transitional period needed to make the required adjustments arising from the adoption of these measures. I am convinced that all employers and workers have a common goal, which is the improvement of their workspace and environment, so that the place in which they work is suitable. A transitional period will be needed so that equipment can be replaced and procedures can be improved and adapted. Differences relating to technological development and type of activity, such as agriculture, will have to be taken into account, with a conviction that ‘no-risk’ does not exist and that the quest for safety is the responsibility of all those involved: workers, be they self-employed or employed, employers or local, regional or national administrations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am talking particularly about whole-body vibration aspects, rather than hand and arm vibration. These comments are not just from employers, large and small, in farming, quarrying, mining, engineering and construction businesses – to name but a few – who are rightly concerned about the very viability of their entire industries under these proposals. They are also from ordinary employees concerned about their jobs if the rapporteur's amendments go through.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently published and well-respected scientific work from Germany, Italy and the UK, as well as the rapporteur's own country of Denmark, shows no direct quantifiable link between whole-body vibration and back pain. I note that Mr Hughes maintains otherwise; not for the first time his own government disagrees with him. The above comments from constituents have two things in common: their anger that Socialist MEPs should be proposing such amendments in the first place, and their sheer disbelief that such MEPs could be so out of touch with reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be clear. The above comments are nothing to do with health and safety, issues which all of us recognise as important. They are everything to do with the rapporteur jumping to conclusions that are not supported by specific scientific evidence. The UK government is strongly opposed to the rapporteur's proposed amendments which, it maintains, would damage industry and agriculture for no benefit. UK Conservative MEPs agree, and we urge the UK Labour MEPs, who supported this report so resolutely in committee, now to support the common position, and meanwhile to support our compromise, tabled jointly by a number of political groups. I urge you all to join us in voting for sound science and sound sense. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The benefits it offers are vague and speculative – they are unproven and unquantified, but the costs are real, immediate and massive. Credible estimates suggest that the costs of implementation in the UK alone could range between EUR 15 and 30 billion. The effects will reach into a wide-range of industries – not only agriculture, but road haulage, construction and many other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been contacted by an exceptionally wide-range of business organisations and they are universally opposed to the measure and especially to those amendments which would make it even more repressive. Those organisations include: the Confederation of British Industry, the National Farmers' Union, the Road Haulage Association, the Quarrying Association, the Coal Industry and JCB, the heavy equipment manufacturer. It appears that the limit set by the directive would restrict a truck driver to six hours work, a tractor driver to two or three hours and a brush cutter to 15 minutes. This will do huge damage to European economies. It will cost jobs. It has been pointed out that the average jogger exceeds the limit by a factor of 7 or 8, while even walking down a road could break the rules. I suspect that I was over the limit on Monday on the bus from Basle Airport to Strasbourg!</p>
<p class="contents">The directive also places huge new costs and administrative burdens on industry in terms of measuring vibration levels and recording exposure. There is a crying need, Mr President, for proper regulatory impact assessments to be applied to European legislative proposals. If that had been done in this case, it would never have got this far. Any possible benefits are far outweighed by the costs. It appears that we cannot reject the whole proposal, but I appeal to colleagues to support amendments which would soften it and to reject amendments which would make it even more disastrous than it already is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I consider that this legislation on vibrations will be a fundamental step to achieving better protection of the health and safety of workers exposed to risks arising from physical agents, but of course, we have to take into account the economic impact, the impact in the enterprises – the small, medium and large. That is why we propose a step-by-step approach.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot forget that a considerable number of workers suffer from the effects of their exposure to vibrations, notably neurological, vascular and musculo-skeletal disorders. This is a particularly serious problem which is costly for business and society and which, more importantly, causes suffering for the people directly involved as well as for their families, and when we discuss costs, we must calculate the cost that enterprises have because of the health problems of their workers.</p>
<p class="contents">On your amendments, the Commission has worked very hard to maintain a high level of protection while, at the same time, ensuring that a compromise could be reached. Although we consider that lower values more in line with the amended proposal would be more appropriate, we have accepted the Council's common position with a view to achieving a global compromise. The common position increases the exposure limit values and exposure action values for the whole-body vibrations and introduces new provisions on transitional periods for existing work equipment in general and for equipment used in the agricultural and forestry sectors in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">For reasons of consistency, the Commission cannot therefore accept Amendment No 2, which decreases the exposure values for whole-body vibrations in the common position, nor the part of Amendment No 5 which reduces the length of the transitional periods. However, the last part of Amendment No 5 would be acceptable if slightly redrafted.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 8 and 12 because they merely restate the principles of the employer's responsibility already contained in the Framework Directive without additional added value, nor Amendments Nos 9 and 13 since they either remove the possibility for Member States to grant derogations on whole-body vibrations in case of seasonal work or simply allow for the averaging of exposures which is already considered by the ISO standards to which the directive refers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 11 for both technical and political reasons. Although the Commission agrees with the principles behind the changes proposed by Amendment No 1, we can only agree with the first part but we cannot accept the second part which foresees the commitment of both the European Parliament and the Council to continue with the adoption of other parts of the original physical agents proposal. This is not a question of political disagreement. This part of the recital contravenes the rule that the recitals 'shall not contain normative provisions or political exhortations'. I accept Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 7. These amendments clearly improve and clarify the text.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret that I have to reject Amendment No 6 as it stands. Nevertheless, I could accept the idea of justifications to be provided by Member States on any transitional periods or derogations granted by them. This should however be integrated in Article 14 (1).</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me remind you that the step-by-step approach we have used, starting with vibrations, implies that we should now push ahead with the remaining three physical agents included in the Commission's original proposal: noise, electromagnetic fields and optical radiation.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 7. It can accept in part Amendments Nos 1, 5 and 6 and it rejects Amendments Nos 2, 8, 9, 11, 12 and 13. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some Groups have not had a chance to look at the Ghilardotti report in particular and to debate them. Can we at least, if this happens in the future, have far more warning? We only heard last night that this was about to happen when it was too late for us to do anything about it.</p>
