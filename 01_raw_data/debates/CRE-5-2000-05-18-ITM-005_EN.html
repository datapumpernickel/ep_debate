Meanwhile, coal and steel have ceased being the cornerstones of the integration process. Over the past six months, it has become evident that values are increasingly at the centre of the debate. Europe as a Community of values.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of the directive which we are debating today threatens to become lost in the commotion about the time of issue of the French translation, the deadline for the amendments and our Rules of Procedure, whilst its very content will probably explain why we are all fighting so hard. A couple of months ago, when the content had still not been specified, all parties agreed to a swift passage of this directive. During the Portuguese Presidency, there has been a political momentum within the Council of which I, as well as other MEPs, would have liked to have made use. </p>
<p class="contents">Technical problems were deemed subordinate to political will at the time, and this is still true for the majority of MEPs. Therefore, in addition to the draftspeople of the opinion, I would also like to thank a number of people by name for their extremely constructive contributions to the report. They are Mr Richard Howitt, rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mrs Anne Van Lancker, Mrs Joke Swiebel, Mrs Sarah Ludford and Mr Arie Oostlander.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to move on to the Commission’s proposal. It embodies a sound minimum level of protection against racism by means of sanctions and independent bodies, by which we set great store. The Commissioner has done justice to the wide range of areas across which discrimination can manifest itself. The directive covers both direct and indirect discrimination, as well as the term “harassment”. </p>
<p class="contents">My report also calls for the inclusion of incitement to discrimination. This is, for example, the case if an employer asks a headhunting agency to be selective on improper grounds. I hope that this addition can be adopted by the Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has also looked very carefully into the areas to which this directive applies. I have understood that some people in the Council are in favour of excluding asylum and migration policy, as well as the issuing of visas, from this ban on discrimination. I hope that I have got the wrong end of the stick here. Indeed, although a distinction based on nationality may be completely understandable, it would, of course, be quite improper to let the colour of someone’s skin be a deciding factor in their request for asylum or to treat the asylum request of a black person in distress differently from that of a white person. These days, asylum and migration policy falls within the scope of the first pillar. The deliberate exclusion of this area could not therefore be justified. </p>
<p class="contents">A much-debated topic in this Parliament is the burden of proof. Every Member State is by now familiar with this concept, whereby both the defendant and plaintiff have a role to play. Indeed, the burden of proof has already shifted in cases where men and women are treated equally. In this procedure, the plaintiff has to supply actual facts on the basis of which direct or indirect discrimination can be presumed, and the defendant subsequently needs to refute the charges. This arrangement works well and has caused few problems. Maybe those opposing this procedure could explain to me sometime during this debate why we nonetheless have to review it and, more specifically, why there is less protection against racial discrimination than against sex discrimination. </p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I recognise the fact that even more protection is not essential. I hope therefore that the House, in its wisdom, will decide tomorrow to adhere as far as possible to the Commission’s original text. </p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, statutory measures against racism are necessary. They provide victims with protection and a right to redress. But it is also important in the forming of attitudes. It makes it clear that Europe will not stand for racism. It is this message which this Parliament needs to broadcast. Everyone is different, everyone is equal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On behalf of my colleague Mogens Camre, I wish to categorically repudiate this categorisation and in particular the misleading nature of the text, given that the report refers to a leader of a neo-Nazi party in Denmark, which has nothing to do with the Danish People’s Party. I would also like to make it clear, in this Chamber, that these unjustified and extravagant accusations were the subject of a court case which was ruled upon in Denmark in 1999 and the originator of these accusations was found guilty. The court found that these accusations had been proved to be unjustified and convicted the person responsible for this defamation. I regret that this defamation has been echoed in this House and we will send a copy of the court’s judgement to the Bureau. I would request the Bureau to forward this judgement to Mr Howitt also, and to any other Members interested in it.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I wish to emphasise that the leaders of the Danish People’s Party were involved in the resistance against the Nazi invasion, which cannot unfortunately be said about certain former leaders of other political groupings in Denmark.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will send a clear signal to the racist extreme right that they have no part in modern Europe and it closes the chapter of racism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia which tragically blighted our history in the century just past.</p>
<p class="contents">Racism is not an opinion – it is a crime. The 24-year old black care worker set on fire in a racist attack in Britain, the 5 neo-Nazis convicted of beating two Vietnamese people in Germany, the French authorities cited by Amnesty International for torture of a Moroccan-Dutch national, all of which took place in Europe this very week are simply the most visible examples of racial discrimination which is the daily experience of black and ethnic minority Europeans in our businesses, communities and on our streets. For example, the group from Watford in my constituency whom I met just last week, were witness to racist intimidation at a border post, which is sadly too routine even to be reported.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be clear – today the European Parliament places on record our belief that this legislation will concretely tackle such racism. The shift in the burden of proof because the discriminator holds all of the information will guarantee greater fairness in the way that complaints are heard. The definition of indirect discrimination will enable covert action which is more pervasive, more insidious to be challenged and will permit implementation by genuinely independent bodies with sufficient funds to do their work so that our words are turned into reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission for Racial Equality from the UK is just one example in Europe and I am pleased that some of the best lessons of the UK’s Race Relations Act alongside best practice from other Member States are being translated into European law today.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament should be aware that the elements I have outlined are intrinsic to the legislation and that Mrs Buitenweg and myself have come to a clear understanding with the Portuguese Presidency that, in return for our cooperation in accelerating parliamentary approval, those elements will form a minimum in the final directive agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the specific improvements we propose and which we expect to be accepted: that incitement or pressure to discriminate is banned just as much as the discrimination itself; that groups as well as individuals will be able to bring cases including a legal status for voluntary organisations to engage in civil dialogue, a partnership to implement the directive for the first time; that the scope of the new law is clearly applied to all public authorities; that conciliation is offered to resolve disputes without prejudice to the right of access to the courts; and that the effectiveness of the new law is tested one to two years, not five, following its implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I ask the Commissioner to address specifically in her reply our additional demands for application of the principles of the directive in the policies and programmes of the EU itself. Second, to give public authorities the right to require companies to demonstrate compliance with anti-discrimination in awarding contracts. Third, on the importance of statistical monitoring, if we are genuinely to combat discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I offer my sincere congratulations to Kathalijne Buitenweg for her work and I thank her for her cooperation in bringing this before Parliament. Members should all acknowledge the campaign by the anti-racist movement throughout Europe. National groups such as the UK Race and Europe Network in my country, the European Network against Racism and, in particular, the Starting Line group have worked for 20 years to get this legislation and for them today is still simply the beginning.</p>

This is a Parliament with a proud record. Since the 1980s we have led on action and on initiatives to combat racism, xenophobia and discrimination. We now have, in the Buitenweg report, a unique opportunity to see those efforts incorporated into a package of legislation and an action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank the rapporteur for incorporating the amendment by the Committee on Legal Affairs to extend the proposal to cover institutional racism. We, too, believe that we have to see a ban on incitement to racism. Groups and anti-racist organisations in my region, in the North-West of England, are eagerly awaiting this legislation. For some of them, victims of racism, action cannot come quick enough and PPE pleading on respecting parliamentary procedure, I am afraid, will fall on deaf ears in my region’s organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Racism is on the rise again. We all have our local examples. For example, in Liverpool an Asian scriptwriter was attacked, his car forced off the road and local thugs then tried to impale him on a fence spike. So vicious was this attack that Merseyside police called for an urgent press conference. The Jewish community in North Manchester are persistently the subject of victimisations and racism, their property defaced and they are subjected to racial threats and abuse. This has to stop. This is why it is vital that Europe gives a strong public statement on racism and discrimination backed up by legislative action to ban this and to extend the scope of legal redress by shifting the burden of proof from the victim to the racist and allied groups and organisations to bring race discrimination cases to courts across the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In voting through this report and its recommendations, this Parliament can give a strong signal that it is prepared to be tough on racism and tough on the causes and perpetrators of racism. Those parties which seek to legitimise and promote racism and discrimination through the ballot box, and we have examples in many countries, should take note of this directive and incorporate the recommendations and its legal force in their own constitutions.</p>

It is a good text. Many of the basic principles we wanted to see are in it. I also congratulate the Portuguese Presidency because they have pushed this through and given it their political clout to make sure we get it on the statute book because, as Mrs McCarthy has just said, people who are victims of racism cannot wait until all the procedures are sorted out. They want this legislation quickly and they want it now. That is why it is important that we vote this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important legislation. In the context of what has happened in Austria, it becomes even more important. There are a few things which would add to and strengthen the text. Two things I would like to highlight: Amendment No 29, which tries to make sure that there is no hiding place for racism, no hiding place behind considerations of religion, considerations of belief and considerations of nationality. We need to make sure that these are not just covers for racism.</p>
<p class="contents">The second amendment, which is important, is the amendment on incitement to racial discrimination which is as important as the act of racism itself, and I hope the Commission will take it on board. My own committee, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, thought it particularly important that we make sure that the applicant states are aware of the legislation and are in a position to implement it as soon as possible. I hope the Commission will make sure in the Action Programme, proposed to accompany this package, that we have a lot of projects from the applicant states.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive will have a direct impact on the lives of many constituents of mine in Yorkshire, people from ethnic minorities and many thousands of people across Europe. It is very important that we get it through today. I hope that at the end of the afternoon we will have no more shenanigans, no more delays and we will make sure we get the vote at 6 p.m. so that we can get it through before the end of the Portuguese Presidency.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Oostlander (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, first and foremost, I would like to warmly congratulate Mrs Buitenweg on the fact that she managed to finish the entire report, ready for discussion and vote, at the eleventh hour today. That is the first point. </p>
<p class="contents">When I read the report and hear the discussions, I get a strong feeling of <span class="italic">déjà vu</span>. Some 15 or 20 years ago in the Netherlands, I worked together with a Christian-Democrat member of government, Mrs Jeltien Kraaieveld, who was also involved in this anti-discrimination legislation in the field of discrimination based on sex. All the points raised then, together with the hesitation and conflicts, have come up again now. The hesitation mainly relates to what should and should not be included in the one report. Then, too, we realised that it is better to address the types of discrimination one by one than to try to cram them all into one act or even one directive. In addition, the rapporteur has persuaded me that it is preferable to leave out religion for that reason, because it merits a separate chapter. </p>
<p class="contents">What would really cap it all for me is if we could withdraw Amendments Nos 15 and 29, in which religion is portrayed in a bad light. This would then render my Amendment No 63 redundant, where religion is seen in a positive light, as we would thus redress the balance and have a clean report. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I think it is important in this context to bring up the issue of the ‘distribution of the burden of proof’, also erroneously referred to as ‘reversal of burden of proof’. In the past, we have had huge arguments in the Netherlands about how this should be done and whether this could be done. We finally concluded that it was necessary and that it should also be tied in with the establishment of an independent council or independent committee for equal treatment – in fact, one of my best former collaborators currently forms part of such a committee. This would then be able to look into the extent to which particular complaints should be taken seriously, whereupon we would go to court and, if appropriate, support the plaintiff. It is then up to the party which is indicted to prove that we are wrong. That is the type of distribution of the burden of proof which is not only already operational in most Member States in the case of men and women and, as from 2001, will have to be extended to include everybody, but which also already exists in legislation on the environment, for example. There, too, a reversal of the burden of proof applies, if necessary, or so I was told by an expert in the field a moment ago. Indeed, these are phenomena which are extremely difficult to prove and which, using the traditional method, an interested party can try to wriggle out of, usually successfully, even if this is completely unjustified. It is to be welcomed if legislation develops in this respect. </p>
<p class="contents">The distribution of the burden of proof is an important point which should be looked into by a committee such as the one mentioned above. As such, on behalf of those in my Group who welcome this, I am strongly in favour of the parts of the report which pertain to this point. </p>
<p class="contents">It is, of course, the case that in the traditional forms of administration of justice, some employers or people playing important roles used to be in a strong position, or those forming part of a majority always took exception to anti-discrimination. Distribution of the burden of proof will affect their position. As a Christian-Democrat, I think we have to side with those who are most under threat, those in the weakest position. As such, this is a positive development, in my view.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, I very much applaud the rapporteur’s compromise to the effect that she is possibly prepared to reinstate in their original form those regulations which have been tightened up in ways not required by statute. I consider this to be an important gesture, also vis-à-vis the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and this I very much appreciate. </p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the other points of the report, I do have to say that the nature of a directive is such that you do not need to be too specific. A directive needs to be incorporated into national legislation. Naturally, one could say, what if some EU government or other lost its faculties, you would need to specify all the steps one by one. I assume, Mr President, pursuant to the principles of subsidiarity, that this kind of mental breakdown will not affect Member States and that they will transpose this directive into national legislation in a proper and reasonable manner, so as to meet the objective. This is, after all, the nature of the directive. This does imply for our Group – and I am speaking on behalf of the entire group – that a number of points are redundant, something which, in fact, the rapporteur has already hinted at. Let us weed them out and exclude them from the directive. </p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we do not need to include a number of bureaucratic procedures of how everything needs to be done step by step. We will not be voting in favour of this, or rather, we will be voting against this. But this does not affect the core of the report, Mr President, which is what this is all about. </p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, there are a number of points which we do want included, such as, for example, the right to perusal of confidential information, or whether it is, for example, necessary to establish whether a business administration is not secretly committing systematic discrimination. On behalf of part of my Group, I also find it extremely important that elections of employees representatives are clearly provided for. Naturally, these too should be held free from discrimination based on race or ethnic origin. We must strike up a social dialogue where this type of issue can be discussed. This very much strengthens the concept of subsidiarity because, where anti-discrimination is concerned, we should start at the basis, the very place where social dialogue is extremely pertinent. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, discrimination, especially based on ethnicity and race, is of great concern to me because it touches the very core of the European Union and European integration. This is what it is all about. We are gathered here, people from different nations and of different origins, and we are working together. This is what the pioneers of the European Union once did and we must translate this now into legislation such as is before us today. As a Dutch person, I have to say that I am also moved by the discrimination issue involving generations of Dutch speakers, often fellow believers, who kept the apartheid regime in South Africa alive. This has made us particularly alert and, in my opinion, we should take the warning we received from this historic learning process seriously. I am delighted that this subject is now being discussed in a proper manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Lancker (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am a Member of the group which has joined forces with the two rapporteurs, Mrs Kathalijne Buitenweg and Mr Richard Howitt, with a great deal of conviction in order to enable Parliament to deliver the parliamentary opinion on this Commission proposal this week, and I would like to thank the rapporteurs very explicitly and with all my heart for the extremely constructive spirit in which we have been able to work. The Social Democrats in Parliament have fought doggedly to keep this item on the agenda and I am pleased that we managed to achieve this thanks to a sound proposal for compromise from the Liberals. With all due sympathy and respect for the work which Mr Arie Oostlander and a number of delegates in the PPE-DE Group have put into this in order to win that group over too, I have to say that the continuous attempts at sabotage and procedural games which we have experienced here this week are, as far as I am concerned, proof that a hard core of conservative PPE-DE Members want nothing more than to undermine this report and the directive. I am pleased, however, that we managed to stop them in their tracks. </p>
<p class="contents">We all know that the Portuguese Presidency is determined to bring this debate in the Council to a successful conclusion. This will not be easy. The majority of MEPs know very well why this directive is important. By implementing the Treaty’s non-discrimination principle swiftly and forcefully, Europe wants to give out an unambiguous message to the citizens in our own countries and those in the candidate countries. This is to prove that Europe is serious about the fight for equal opportunities, irrespective of people’s race or ethnic origin and also because it is a well-known fact that discrimination is still rife in our countries, and that there is still racism and extreme nationalism which, in fact, is more prominent than before because racist political parties are cashing in on the ‘own nation first’ ideas. I know that the debate in the Council is also a difficult one. It is precisely for this reason that it is important that the European Parliament strengthens and supports the Commission's position, because we will soon need a sound and efficient directive which fights any type of discrimination on the basis of racial and ethnic origin. </p>
<p class="contents">To finish off, I would like to highlight a number of my Group’s priorities in terms of content. Firstly, it is extremely important for the non-discrimination directive to have a wide and efficient scope. This is why we are very much in favour of extending the directive to groups of people who are discriminated against and also to areas such as housing, education, public service operations and attitudes within the police force. We are also pleased with the solution which we finally reached regarding discrimination on the basis of religion which should not be a covert reason for discriminating on the basis of ethnic origin. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in our opinion, the strength of this directive will stand or fall with its enforceability, the extent to which it monitors discrimination, the efficiency of the measures taken against discrimination and, as such, the importance we attach to the possibility of organising collective actions to tie sanctions in with the directive. With all due respect and sympathy, Mr Oostlander, but since you refer to the cleaning-up operation, I notice that this is precisely one of those cornerstones of our reinforcement plan which is being removed. I do not agree with this. This is taking it much too far. Moreover, my Group also supports the reinforcement of, and support for, the operation of, those independent monitoring bodies. I am convinced that the centre for equal opportunities in my own country will be encouraged in its activities by this directive. </p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish off with one last consideration regarding the shared burden of proof because I am really at a loss to understand the resistance on the part of some people. Surely it should be clear to everybody that it is impossible for a migrant who is discriminated against to prove that he is being discriminated against at work or by house owners, unless the defendant too is at least asked to prove that the facts brought by the plaintiff are unfounded. We women are already familiar with this procedure. This is why we have fought for such a long time for a directive which distributes this burden of proof, and all we men and women of the Group of the Party of European Socialists are asking for is for migrants to be treated in the same way as women. This is why we will also support the Commission’s proposal and will not permit any amendments in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
