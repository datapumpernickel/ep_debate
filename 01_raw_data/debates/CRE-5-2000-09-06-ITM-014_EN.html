<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lucas (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the Commission on a very timely and far-reaching communication which explicitly acknowledges the rapidly growing environmental impact of air transport and clearly recognises that this growth is unsustainable. Before coming to the proposals contained in my report, it would be helpful to remind ourselves of some of the key issues in this debate. Essentially, the problem can be expressed very simply: aviation is growing at an unsustainable rate. It is a serious environmental threat and not only is it a problem, but we are actually subsidising that sector, which is making the situation very much worse.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of aviation growth, air traffic is forecast to almost double in the next 15 years. When you think what that means in terms of congestion and environmental impact, then clearly that is a nightmare. To take a case that I know well in the UK, the government's own air traffic forecasts which were published in June this year show total passenger numbers at UK airports rising from 160 million in 1998 to 400 million in just over 20 years' time. That increase of 240 million is equivalent to four new airports the size of London Heathrow or eight new airports the size of London Gatwick. Obviously the environmental consequences of such expansion would be totally unacceptable and these projections only serve to show the nonsense of assuming the possibility of continuous exponential growth.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the environmental impacts of this growth? On the noise side, we know that as far as ordinary people on the ground are concerned those changes that have been introduced to make individual aircraft quieter are actually in danger of being cancelled out by the increasing frequency of each noise incident. On the emission side, air travel is the world's fastest growing sources of greenhouse gases which cause climate change. That may only count for 3% of total emissions today, but by 2050 it is projected it could account for up to 15% of total global emissions or even more. You would think that litany of environmental problems, coupled with a projected growth that is clearly unsustainable, might have produced some measures to discourage the exponential growth of this sector, but not a bit of it. On the contrary, global aviation policies are actually encouraging the unrestrained growth of this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Aviation is massively subsidised. Unlike motor vehicles or trains, airlines pay no tax on their fuel. Indeed it has been calculated that the European aviation sector receives about EUR 30 billion in subsidies every year.</p>
<p class="contents">To mention some of the key points of my report very briefly: on noise, current noise standards for new aircraft have actually been in existence since 1977 and there is therefore an urgent need for more stringent standards. I am recommending that the EU uses the World Health Organisation's own guidelines for Community noise to develop new guidelines for daytime and night-time exposure by 2003. On emissions, a perfectly feasible target for the developed countries would be to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by 5% on 1992 levels by 2012, which is the first budget period according to the Kyoto Protocol. This would be a first step to reverse the current exemption of international aviation from responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">On subsidies, the report makes it clear that in principle we support the taxing of aircraft fuel at an international level, but we recognise that there are political difficulties with this because of the need to get international agreements at ICAO. In the light of those political difficulties, we are proposing instead an environmental charge based on the polluter-pays principle. In fact, such a charge would be a more subtle instrument since it could actually be calculated to reflect both the amount of fuel used and also, by factoring in the efficiency of the aircraft's engine, the amount of pollutants generated. Indeed the political difficulties of introducing such a measure would disappear since it is perfectly within the rights of the EU to introduce a levy on all flights starting from airports in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">One final but very important point, you will hear the airlines say that all this is very well but it should be undertaken by ICAO, the international body. The fact that it is an international body means that it moves at a very slow pace and what the Commission communication proposes – and what I endorse in my report – is the principle that some of the more industrialised regions like the EU should be able to move more swiftly towards more stringent standards than other regions like the developing countries. This does not spell the end of ICAO. What it does is to introduce some flexibility into ICAO which is perfectly consistent with other international organisations. Others do just the same thing.</p>
<p class="contents">The reaction of the airlines is to ask why we are picking on them. In fact, clearly the opposite is the case. The airlines have been getting away with not paying their way for over 50 years. Meanwhile, other Members of this House are quick to claim that the measures I propose will have devastating effects on the European aviation sector. That is nonsense. An environmental charge along the lines I have described would not have adverse effects on competition because it is levied on all airlines using EU airports regardless of their origin.</p>
<p class="contents">They claim it will have crippling effects on the European economy and that too is nonsense. The aviation sector is responsible for some jobs but it should not be forgotten that making aviation pay its way in terms of taxation will create thousands of jobs in other sectors. So I commend this report to you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Environmental concerns must, however, be balanced against the needs of the aviation industry to ensure its success in the future. I was disappointed with the report from the Commission, not least because it was so negative towards aviation. Unfortunately this has been built upon by the rapporteur. I would like to assist honourable Members by pointing out the following information: air transport is responsible for generating 25 million direct jobs world-wide. In the United Kingdom alone aviation is responsible for supporting nearly 500 000 jobs. The United Kingdom transports GBP 35 billion worth of exports, maintaining unrivalled access to global markets and contributes around GBP 3 billion per annum to the exchequer. If multiplied by the number of countries in the European Union one can see and understand just how important this industry is to our economies.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of environmental impact, aviation uses less than 8% of the land required for rail and less than 1% required for road use. In practical terms, aside from maritime transport, aviation is the only form of international transport now transporting a third of all goods world-wide.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past 15 years CO2 emissions have declined by 70% and unburned hydrocarbons by 85%. Aviation is responsible for just 2.5% of CO2 emissions. Short-term measures are available, such as tackling the 44% air traffic flow management delays and 30 bottlenecks which take place over France, Italy, Spain and parts of Germany. National governments must take action now. They should also tackle land planning around existing airports and take responsibility for their decisions in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">To suggest that either a tax on kerosene, which is internationally exempt from tax for the aviation industry, or VAT on tickets or aircraft purchases is the answer is incorrect. The industry already pays all its infrastructure charges, some of which go towards environmental improvements. It is not subsidised.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if Mrs Lucas' proposals were passed, they would decimate the aviation industry: aviation, tourism, businesses and the aerospace industry. Their supporters would love to abolish cheap flights. In short, they would make Europe uncompetitive and give Americans and overseas carriers an unfair advantage. I would hope in future the proposals from the Commission are thought through more carefully. Otherwise its members may find that flying to or from Brussels or Strasbourg or on holiday, for that matter, with a European carrier may not be an option. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group has not proposed any further amendments for this plenary discussion. This means that we agree with the thrust of the report, and I would like to dissociate myself somewhat from the comments made by Mrs Foster, suggesting that the Commission proposals or those included in the report would spell disaster for aviation. I do not think you should try to block a sound environmental policy by making this type of threat.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission statement on aviation and the environment is a first step towards better European legislation. This is needed given the growth in aviation and, along with it, the growth in environmental pollution caused by it. We therefore endorse the key points of the Commission proposals. The Group of the Party of European Socialists is all for imposing European rules on the aviation industry and making it pay for the environmental pollution which it causes. As Mrs Lucas has already stated, we do not want aviation to be given preferential treatment. But today we are merely tracing an outline. What conditions must European legislation meet? We will then look forward to the further regulatory and legislative proposals which will also contain the details and specific standards.</p>
<p class="contents">So what are the guiding principles of the Group of the Party of European Socialists? We are at any rate of the opinion that rapid growth in aviation leads to the creation of more and better train alternatives, to give an example in terms of short-distance travel. I believe that the shift from one mode of transport to another which is more environmentally-friendly is of great importance. We do not think that capacity growth in aviation is unlimited.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we would like European noise standards: in the interests of the public and to discourage competition between certain airports. Noise at night should, in our opinion, be given more attention and we share Mrs Lucas’ view that, in the development of standards and more detailed rules, the standards of the World Health Organisation should come first. Accordingly, we are expecting ambitious proposals from the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point naturally relates to emissions, the emission of pollution to be precise, which, in our view, should be tackled as well. This is also why we support the principle of a tax on kerosene. However, the viability of these ideas and proposals is questionable. As stated in the report, we would like international consultation and further research. Since the outcome of this research is uncertain, we support the fall-back position, as formulated in Paragraph 20 of the report, in the form of a European environmental levy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the final analysis, what matters is for us to follow the Kyoto agreements, and aviation should contribute substantially in this respect. We prefer to have effective agreements on noise and emission worldwide, but should these not materialise, we certainly will not rule out a European policy. I believe that that is also an important element in the report, and it has been formulated clearly in our view. We hope that international consultation will bear some fruit. Should this not be the case, we feel that we should be able to table European rules in a few years’ time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is indeed the case that aviation is growing rapidly. I share Mrs Foster’s view that aviation is a major economic sector, a sector which provides services which are irreplaceable up to a point. At the same time, however, it is abundantly clear that such a sector also brings with it a number of adverse environmental effects, such as noise and air pollution, and that we need to invite the sector to take a pro-active approach in dealing with this issue as quickly as possible, more so than is the case at present. Both the Commission statement and Mrs Lucas’ report provide guidelines as to how this can and must be done.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight a few points. It is clear, as Mr Wiersma has already stated, that the different modes of transport – road, train, etc. and also aviation – must be treated the same way as much as possible, which is not the case at the moment. There are specific reasons for this, but something must be done about the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is clear that, in tackling the problems of noise, standards, tax on kerosene, etc, we should certainly at the present time opt for a worldwide approach. A regional approach is premature at the moment, and I am pleased that the rapporteur has amended a number of her points in the original text to this effect. In my opinion, the European Union does not need to take any unilateral measures at the moment, if I can put it that way. There are important negotiations under way, Commissioner, which will have a positive outcome, or at least we can still be hopeful of this. I believe that this is a factor of importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point is that noise must be tackled by means of a package of measures. Hence my amendment to provide details of these measures. I have also tabled an amendment to develop a common method of measurement which will enable us to curb competition between different airports, as referred to by Mr Wiersma. It is, of course, important for competition between airports not to have any adverse effects on the people who live in the vicinity and on the environment. I believe that this is a factor of importance and that is why we need European regulations in order to prevent competition between the different airports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the effects of this is particularly detrimental to the peripheral parts of the country. It has a disproportionately distorting effect on competition, affecting local firms in the periphery competing against large multinationals in the UK. That is an important caveat to put down about ways in which fuel taxes can distort local economies.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think there is a good environmental argument for trying to drive most of the population of the United Kingdom into the bottom south-east corner. I did not enter politics to repeat the Highland clearances. That said, it is also clearly absurd to exempt aviation from the duty to diminish greenhouse gases and ozone depletion and it is also a good thing to look towards an equality of taxation across the European Union, as Mrs Lucas has done, rather than grossly distorting differentials between different parts.</p>
<p class="contents">I have considerable reservations about how this will work in practice, but we should welcome the principle that Mrs Lucas has put forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, the reduction of these noise or gaseous emissions must be limited to the commendable search for technical solutions that are to everyone's advantage. It must not serve as a pretext for other objectives in the field of tax or for extending the competence of the Commission. The latter should instead concentrate on correctly carrying out its already vast range of tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, we cannot accept the instigation of this eco-tax. This first step towards a European tax will only affect passengers, once again, without achieving any of this report’s objectives. Our citizens are already squeezed hard by taxes and, at a time when the Member States are trying to reduce taxation, a European tax could put our businesses in a difficult position in relation to their competitors, in particular American businesses or others, with numerous disastrous consequences for employment. We cannot accept this.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we demand that tax subsidiarity in favour of the Member States be observed. Europe, rather than artificially swelling its budget by means of this tax, should use this budget more effectively, with respect for the freedom of the individual. The political dependency of the Member States depends in large part on their freedom in terms of tax. The eco-tax will solve nothing. This is a purely ideological measure, with no direct effect on the environment. We would prefer a rational measure that respects the interests of the individual and favours economic development while fully respecting the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee too has made a decision along the same lines, although we ought in all honesty to say that we had completely to re-write Mrs Lucas’ report, since it was based upon totally unrealistic premisses. However, we finally reached a majority agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The summer has again shown how important air travel is for people heading for their holiday destinations. Particularly where families with children are concerned, air travel offers the quickest means of getting away to the sun, and the one which puts least strain on the nerves. At the same time, it provides the basis for jobs and businesses in many parts of the European Union. Business travel and freight forwarding on international air routes are also vital to trade and commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, air travel has an obvious detrimental effect upon the environment due to exhaust emissions and noise pollution. We must make sure that we limit these forms of damage to the environment, at the same time, however, as distinguishing between the damage caused to health around airports and the ways in which people’s ordinary well-being is prejudiced. I fear that, if we were to adopt the WHO’s regulations, none of us here this evening would be allowed to go on working, since more than ten hours spent in this Chamber is scarcely compatible with these regulations. So let us be realistic, please.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats in any case calls for a significant reduction in permitted levels of noise pollution – which, in view of the international character of air travel, ought more sensibly to be regulated within the framework of the ICAO – and for noisier aircraft to be excluded from using European airports following brief transitionary periods. We hope, and are campaigning for, a situation in which the Member States of the European Commission will provide a clear mandate. If, however, we were not to obtain success at ICAO level, then we should have to take action ourselves, for Europe is densely populated and we do not have the luxury of the large distances between population centres that are to be found in America or Africa. We have to protect our citizens from unnecessary noise.</p>

That is because the volume of traffic is growing even faster than the economy. In this sense the problems of air traffic are still greater because we have to find global solutions for them. On the other hand, we have heard that the Kyoto Protocol does not contain provisions concerning air traffic emissions. Furthermore, air traffic problems are not discussed in the directive on ceilings for emissions which is under consideration. Being in this situation we really have to channel greater efforts into the work that is done in ICAO and its environmental protection committee, which drafts international environmental norms. This is a regrettably slow process, but we have to be able to set objectives that are sufficiently ambitious in scope and create negotiating mandates to be able to make progress accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion it would not be a bad idea if the developed, industrialised countries, including the European Union, were to set an example in this matter. It is important to develop engine technology, as a decline in the volume of traffic is not foreseeable. We will have to have recourse to different acts, environmental taxes, charges and administrative measures, for example regulation of departure and arrival times, taking account of the fact that rail traffic exists alongside air traffic in areas where long distances are not a hindrance, and that must be developed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will be vital to ease congestion at airports and for environmental reasons too.</p>
<p class="contents">Replacing short flights with alternative forms of transport will make room for long haul flights, for which there is no alternative. In Parliament we discussed several reports before the summer recess that aimed at improving the competitiveness of railways and sea transport. In addition to improving rail and sea transport competitiveness, we also need to take other action. One possibility is an environmental charge specially designed for air traffic.

Whilst the previous two focused on the freedom and growth potential within aviation, this one highlights the downside, justifiably so, in my opinion. As I have already indicated when we discussed the Atkins report, the measures which are currently being drafted for aviation only provide short-term answers. They cannot provide a lasting solution for the problems of congestion and environmental pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">This report looks beyond the near future, which is why I would like to congratulate Mrs Lucas. It is not an unnecessary exercise to indicate the pre-conditions within which aviation should function, both in terms of space and the environment. This, however, does require sufficient expertise and alternatives. At present, there is room for considerable improvement with regard to both of these aspects. This should not deter us, however, from sketching the outlines for the future and to expect this to be done internationally. This report sets the right tone for this, especially for the benefit of the Commission.</p>

But we need to focus all our efforts on how we can minimise the effects of the rapid growth within this sector on the environment. I would like to highlight a number of points.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the European Union should support the ICAO process. Only within the context of this international body is it possible to discuss tighter rules for noise generated by aircraft. We should however urge caution. Proposing new standards has a huge impact on the European aviation industry as a whole. In concrete terms, a standard considerably stricter than the current one would mean that out of the present European fleet of 3,300 aircraft, 1,067 would need to be replaced. Such a rapid and forced decommissioning would make it practically impossible to replace these aircraft with new ones, due to, among other things, the small production capacity for new aircraft. We only have two manufacturers.</p>
<p class="contents">The consequences for European aviation are not hard to imagine. It would need to surrender part of the market to its competitors, and it is very questionable whether this would benefit our safety. Furthermore, it would lead to a considerable reduction in employment, with all the problems that this entails. Air fares would go up. I am very aware that this would be a bonus for some, but do remember that, for airline passengers who need to travel short distances, there is still no real alternative, contrary to what one of my fellow MEPs just stated, to the effect that we would all much prefer to see such passengers travel by train..</p>
<p class="contents">Member States and my country in particular, the Netherlands, are extremely slow in introducing high-speed trains which could form a viable alternative for short-distance travel.</p>
<p class="contents">Aircraft manufacturers should be put under considerable pressure to build cleaner and quieter aircraft. That is why the new standards cannot be put on hold forever. We will try to exert this pressure at international level but we will run out of patience at some stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say a few words on noise-sensitive airports. In my opinion, measurements should be taken in a truly objective manner and complaints from those living in the vicinity should not be the only point of reference. An international standard needs to be established, but some airports, which do not cause any pollution whatsoever to those living in the vicinity, should be exempt so that they are not hindered in their development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I agree with the Commission on drawing up more stringent standards on noise and also on establishing transitional provisions to satisfy the needs of the regions that are confronted with noise pollution problems. We also believe that it is essential for us to participate as one in the 33rd assembly of the ICAO in autumn 2001, speaking with one voice because, without a doubt, there is strength in unity and on subjects as important as the tightening of standards against noise it is vital. It would also be important to ask the Commission to present proposals for the introduction of economic incentives aimed at achieving a reduction of the negative effects on the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, what we do not agree on is the unilateral establishment of tax on kerosene, as a unilateral decision without the backing of the ICAO would have a minimal impact on the environment, would create legal problems, would damage competition among European airlines and would consequently affect users, who would see their tariffs rise. It would also be essential that, before taking any measures with regard to the adoption of taxes on the aviation industry, a study should be carried out on the costs and benefits that these measures would imply.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to emphasise the importance of efficient management in the aviation industry in reducing pollutants, placing the emphasis on improving airport management and clearly supporting the creation of a single European sky, by means of which we would also undoubtedly contribute to reducing environmental pollution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I mean her original version. She is right when she points out that if the volume of air traffic continues its rapid growth it will be absolutely necessary to take measures to control the problems it causes. It is part of sustainable development to reduce emissions and bring noise levels down. The report gained the support of everyone in the committee. The amendments made to it, however, throw the baby out with the bath water.</p>
<p class="contents">The original report was a natural extension of previous EU legislation, but if the amendments are adopted it will mean enormous financial losses for European companies that have taken investment decisions on the basis of EU acts. For example, the time span for noise reduction is very long. The time that passes between the decisions taken and implementation can be up to two years. But now some excellent aircraft which have just been modified in accordance with Chapter 3 would have to be scrapped in four years’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens and companies of the Community must be able to have confidence in legislation, as continual shifting of the goalposts undermines long-term plans. The resultant costs weaken the area’s air transport competitiveness as compared with airlines outside the EU, and, at the same time, in fact, makes it harder to adopt environment-friendly technology in the airlines based within the EU. What is economically realistic about demands for new technology in the name of environmental protection to replace aircraft which are still serviceable and in good condition? On the contrary, this sort of action will constitute a burden on the environment, as materials will have to be produced and aircraft built before the economic lifetime of existent equipment is up. In addition, scrapping serviceable aircraft will mean an additional burden on the environment. Drafting radically new regulations on aircraft noise has to happen globally and under the auspices of ICAO, and careful, long-term community and town planning consequently has a key role in this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to remind everyone that increasing fuel tax in the air transport industry would bring with it an added burden for those who live in sparsely populated countries. A long journey is a long way to go. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we are all aware, the environmental consequences of air transport have recently attracted a great deal of interest.</p>
<p class="contents">At local level, the debates surrounding airport development are increasingly determined by environmental considerations relating to noise abatement and air quality improvement in areas surrounding airports. Many citizens living in these areas believe that much more could be done to improve their situation and that is what they are demanding. Furthermore, the long-term impact of gases from air transport on climate change is undoubtedly a cause of concern in the world today, as is the impact of other types of emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">The air transport system must therefore be handled globally and coherently, from an environmental point of view, that is, we must also take account of aspects relating to the activity of air transport.</p>
<p class="contents">We must try to reconcile interests that are not always easy to reconcile as air transport undoubtedly involves economic interests that are characterised by high investment costs which require a long life span before they are paid off. For example, an aircraft requires a much longer life span than other types of investment in order to be adequately paid off. This requires a stable operating environment with no ups and downs or modifications that change the rules of the game and may have disastrous economic consequences for the functioning of aviation companies.</p>
<p class="contents">A sector based on extremely expensive technology, with a rapid rate of growth, has an immediate effect on employment in ancillary sectors, such as research, industry and tourism. In my opinion, trying to safeguard the environment by simply slowing down growth in the aeronautical sector and the air industry is not a valid option. But there is no doubt that the public, not only people in the surrounding area who suffer most directly from certain types of pollution such as noise or even emissions, but the public in general, who want sustainable development and quality of life, has a right to demand action from us to guarantee this type of growth that should be the European model.</p>
<p class="contents">In its communication on air transport and the environment, the Commission maintains that the aviation industry needs to increase its efforts to improve the environmental quality of new aircraft being built. If the current rate of growth is maintained, the improvements needed to compensate for the anticipated environmental impact of the increase in air traffic will not be made. I know this message is not well received in many parts of the sector but, without a doubt, in the medium and long term there is no solution but to look for an alternative unless we want air transport to become a victim of its own success.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, however, is aware that the air transport sector is correct in saying that before carrying out environmental measures, a serious in-depth study must be done on the economic and social repercussions that these measures will have. I have the impression that today, those most concerned by the environment are accepting, little by little, but more and more, the fact that in order to develop a definite environmental policy, account must be taken of the balance between the cost and effectiveness of the measures proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">The report we have before us considers these fundamental issues and takes account of both the need to reinforce environmental protection beyond routine efforts and the profitability analysis factor. I would like to thank Mrs Lucas for the efforts made to achieve flexibility, as it is clear from her amendments that this is not exactly what she would like as a report, but she is looking for a compromise that makes parliamentary approval possible. For example, what she says on kerosene seems to me to be a reasonable way of presenting this problem, which undoubtedly cannot be solved at European level, but at world-wide level and by the ICAO.</p>
<p class="contents">For it is in aviation, ladies and gentlemen, the industry in which globalisation is more evident than in any other, that these issues must be resolved. I would like to thank the rapporteur for the support she gives the Commission in the report, and say that we find ourselves at a difficult stage of the debate on new noise standards and on legislation which gradually eliminates the noisiest aircraft, within the framework of the ICAO.</p>
<p class="contents">On many occasions, we have indicated our preference for an international solution to these problems, and the Commission has noted with satisfaction the positive development of the United States' stance in relation to the standardisation process that is taking place in the ICAO. I have to say that the legislation on the so-called “hushkits”, with regard to the noisiest aircraft, adopted in its day by Parliament, the Council and the Commission, was based precisely on the fact that the United States had adopted unilateral measures outside the ICAO. There is no doubt that it is within the ICAO that this work needs to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall coordinate the actions of the various Member States within the CAEP, given that it is the Member States that are the signatories of the ICAO, and I hope that Parliament will support initiatives such as the single sky, to which Mr Ojeda referred, which, naturally, will also have consequences for kerosene saving, if it can be implemented, and the improvement in the allocation and general management of slots.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, once again I thank everyone for the work carried out in trying to obtain a realistic and flexible text that is acceptable to the various parties. We await Parliament's vote, to which the Commission will pay great attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
