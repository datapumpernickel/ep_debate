We are a long way from the economic growth and rising employment of the late 1990s, as a consequence of restrictive economic and financial policies, the Stability Pact and the rapid liberalisations and privatisations called for by the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, with rising social and regional inequalities, unemployment affecting almost 20 million workers, growing job insecurity and almost 70 million people living in poverty, social inclusion and cohesion have to be a priority, a central concern in this mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy. That means not only creating secure jobs, but also sharing out the created wealth more fairly, through social policies designed to ensure human rights, better pensions and retirement provision, quality public services in health, education, research and vocational training, social security and protection, housing and family support, paying particular attention to promoting equal rights for women and taking account of suitable environmental policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of that, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, has come here to state that the Lisbon Strategy is at the centre of our economic policies, following the conclusions of the Kok report, which places particular emphasis on competitiveness. What is required, however, as mentioned in our group’s resolution, is to call a halt to this neoliberal race, to strengthen public investment at EU and national levels, to put a stop to the privatisation of public sectors and services, to withdraw the proposal for a directive to create the internal market in services, to revoke the Stability Pact, to establish a clear distinction between current spending and investment, and to promote a development and employment pact, prioritising growth in jobs with rights, social inclusion, and economic, social and territorial cohesion, the only way to help create the 22 million secure jobs that are required to meet the 70% target by 2010 laid down in the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">If that does not happen, we will have a rise in social tensions among the people in our countries in protest at the policies we are implementing. They want greater social protection and better social policy, and that, Mr President, is the challenge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now we hear the half-time whistle, but I suspect Mr Barroso is not a man to listen to whistle-blowers.</p>
<p class="contents">We are asked to consider a mid-term review, but there seems little to review. The unemployment rate is high and rising and 101 000 regulations and directives are bleeding the life out of the wealth creators. Growth is worse. Mrs Figueiredo said in her report yesterday that 22 million jobs need to be created in the EU in the next five years. You do not have to be Hayek to know that cannot be done. It is interesting to see the panic setting in amongst the federalists at last; the cracks are really showing. Mr Barroso is a rampant free marketeer, according to the people over there, while his ideas went out with the Ark according to Mr Mandelson, from the right.</p>
<p class="contents">In Britain, at least, people are waking up. I quote from this morning’s <span class="italic">Times</span>: ‘Peers tell Brussels to give back cash from EU budget’. We have paid in GBP 180 billion and got back GBP 105 billion. Where has the GBP 75 billion gone?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, you try and keep bleeding the British taxpayer at this rate, because worse is better and on that basis this corrupt institution is doing very well indeed.</p>

We have realised that ‘Lisbon 2000’ is an unachieved objective and a clear demonstration of a lack of political will. Although when we look at the situation realistically it is not, on the whole, a dramatic one, nevertheless the resources for implementing the strategy require radical rethinking. As I see it, this is what the Commission is indeed proposing. The objectives remain the same, which is understandable since there is no real alternative. The main task also remains the same — to convince the Member States’ social partners and all European citizens to accept change. The risk is — it so happens that at the same time as we are relaunching the implementation of the Lisbon strategy we are also discussing the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact — that we have a reform that will not promote convergence between the Eurozone states and will pass greater economic and financial risk on to the Member States. The Member States will need political leaders and the will to put reforms in place.</p>
<p class="contents">The Services Directive too, which the Commission put forward as an essential tool for implementing the Lisbon objectives, has met with stiff opposition. Unfortunately, the Commission is willing to make concessions. On the other hand, in implementing the Lisbon strategy there is a risk of falling into the trap of excessive regulation at the European Union level, and so we must ensure that the subsidiarity principle is observed and that there is regular evaluation of the effect of the European Union’s legislative initiative, where the main goal is to guarantee the competitiveness of Europe’s businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the serious risks I would also mention is the ideological debate we are hearing again today, about the importance of the Lisbon agenda pillars. This debate is tending to return to the previous already overcharged agenda. Among the advantages of this period is that the European Union’s enlargement by ten new Member States is a propitious moment. Fears about jobs moving to the new Member States, cheap labour forces and tax competition within the European Union itself are forcing politicians to consider reforms and are making society more open to change. With the enlargement of the European Union the time for active competition and change has arrived. This is the right moment to relaunch the Lisbon strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You state that, and I quote; ‘We need to avoid the type of jobless growth that has marred the performance of the US economy’. I am not sure whether it was dyed-in-the-wool anti-Americans, Communists or perhaps trade unionists who tricked you into including this false statement, but I should like to point out that figures from Eurostat show that the American economy is growing faster than the European economy, and that unemployment is not only lower in the USA, but dropping almost twice as fast as in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask that you refrain from using false economic data, and I would particularly ask that you do not give in to pressure from those socialists who do not wish to admit that maximum freedom for entrepreneurs and minimum state intervention are the only way to achieve prosperity. I would ask you to face up to the truth and to take action. This is the only way in which you will make good on what you said when you took up office in the summer, namely that Europe must first earn its right to a welfare state.

It also gives real impetus to the strategy’s revival.</p>
<p class="contents">All three of its elements – growth and the labour market, welfare policy and the environment – have been addressed in a proper context, and my group has been particularly keen to stress the importance of making a clear connection between these two pillars. A proper environment and social policy is possible only if there is economic growth and a functioning labour market; there is a close and practical connection between the two, for the success of the one as a policy is conditional upon the other, and that this resolution makes this clear is crucially important.</p>
<p class="contents">As the short time available to me prevents me from discussing all three of these points, there is one aspect to which I would like to give particular attention, and I regard it as being of fundamental importance. I refer to the implementation of the interinstitutional agreement of December 2003 on better lawmaking, which – as I have been observing for a year now – is not operating adequately. It is particularly unsatisfactory when it comes to scrutinising the impact of laws and to involving interested parties in the production of drafts within the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">One reason why we have had to have the debates we have had on, for example, the services directive and REACH is that the impact of legislation has been assessed either inadequately or not at all, and that the interested parties were not sufficiently involved in the process whereby they came into being. This is, I think, one of the priorities that this resolution addresses, and it is something that must change.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude with a couple of observations on the role played by the other groups in this House. I am grateful to the Socialist Group in the European Parliament for following the Liberals in now deciding to support this draft. They were not quite willing to do that in the Steering Group, but I am glad they have now decided to do so, for it needs a broad majority. It is vitally important that the Lisbon process should be supported by all. I do have something of a problem with the attitude of the Greens, who met separately in Luxembourg and decided to oppose it without even waiting for the result of the Steering Group’s deliberations. Surely, this is rather peculiar; perhaps the Greens should re-read the text and think about whether it might after all be better to vote in favour of it, or else they will find it difficult to explain their opposition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In most national parliaments, the Lisbon strategy has finally become a political subject. The European Parliament, in its turn, has done its utmost to produce proposals that are less ideological, more balanced, and closer to the day-to-day reality of life for our 455 million fellow citizens. </p>
<p class="contents">Of course our draft resolution could be improved still further. There are certain deafening silences, such as the lack of any reference to the need to adjust the Stability and Growth Pact. Happily, the governments, whatever their political colour, have a more realistic approach than some Conservative or Liberal MEPs. Thus, the Ecofin Council, in spite of some difficult debates, is moving towards an adjustment of the pact. </p>
<p class="contents">I am willing to bet that the spring summit will succeed in transforming a somewhat ineffectual budgetary monitoring tool into a political-economy tool in the service of growth. With limited inflation, interest rates which are low compared with the past, a savings surplus and businesses that are more than profitable, Europe – and above all the euro zone – is currently lacking, not in stability, but in growth.</p>
<p class="contents">As a matter of priority we should stimulate internal demand, particularly in the larger countries within the euro zone, Germany, France and Italy. It is only by resuming public and private investment and giving new impetus to consumption that our Union will be able to increase its growth and create jobs. </p>
<p class="contents">The mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy will have to result in the concentration of resources on the priority objectives, that is, investment in education, training, research and infrastructures.</p>
<p class="contents">Fewer reports and more specific actions are needed in order to create that Europe of excellence which the Socialists are calling for. Defending a Europe of excellence, however, does not mean defending the status quo. High social and environmental standards can and should be included in the framework of any successful economic option. In a world in which capital is becoming increasingly mobile, Europe’s most precious competitive advantage remains its well-educated and trained labour force, which also has the independence necessary to enable it to react to constant change.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no accident that the Scandinavian countries, which showed the greatest determination in adopting the Lisbon strategy with regard to social and environmental excellence, are now among the best performing European countries in economic terms. They did their utmost to ensure that they could provide the type of real job security that is based on the capacity to maintain the constant upgrading of professional skills.</p>
<p class="contents">A modern competitive framework requires a re-examination of the concept of flexibility. In a rapidly developing global economy, the most prosperous businesses will be those that are the most flexible. Those businesses which rely on revolving reserve supplies of temporary workers will lose ground to those whose employees are tied to them by motivation based on job security and decent working conditions. </p>
<p class="contents">Policies on the employment market and on industrial relations systems must be reoriented towards the anticipation and management of change, so as to create a dynamic European economy and persuade the European labour force that change is an opportunity rather than a threat. We need a modern labour organisation system and active employment market policies. </p>
<p class="contents">The same logic applies to social protection policies which play a crucial role and which call for the strengthening of policies to combat poverty and social exclusion. </p>
<p class="contents">I shall end, Mr President, by saying that the Europe of excellence is possible. Moreover, the European Union is much better than its reputation. Seen from the outside, the Union is the world political entity which has the highest standard of living, not only in economic terms but also in social and environmental terms. </p>

My warm thanks go to them all.</p>
<p class="contents">Five years after the inception of the Lisbon strategy, we have now reached a fork in the road, and I would like to take this as an opportunity to reiterate something fundamental about the situation in Europe. The last time Europe suffered from this sort of structural mass unemployment was in the 1930s. In Germany, from which I come, the number of unemployed is higher than at any time in the history of the Federal Republic, having gone over the million mark in North Rhine-Westphalia, which both Commissioner Verheugen and I call home. At the same time, many Member States are getting deeper and deeper into debt, and science and research are going elsewhere as the intellectual, moral and political consequences of mass unemployment spread – lower turnouts at elections, general dissatisfaction with politics, burgeoning racism, and extremism from both the Right and the Left. All of these things we have to face up to.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had five wasted years in which we wanted everything and achieved nothing, and now Europe must come to a decision. Do we have the courage and the strength to at last go into battle against mass unemployment? Do we have the courage and the strength to turn things around, and go for more jobs and more growth? Do we have the courage and the strength to stop focussing on those who are still in work and at last turn our eyes upon those who want to work but cannot? In response to that, I say that we must, clearly, summon up the courage and strength to do these things, and it is no less clear that they call for a combined effort by all of us and for absolute concentration on greater competitiveness. Let us at last come to grasp what that is: the indispensable requirement for more growth and new jobs, without which we will not achieve the ambitious social and environmental goals of which we are all in favour, as the resolution says.</p>
<p class="contents">In this, the completion of the internal market as the engine of development will be crucial. None of us can any more be ignorant of the fact that the European internal market has created two million jobs since 1993. That being so, can we afford to have a European market for services that exists only on paper? Ought we not, therefore, to concentrate on the sector that now accounts for 70% of the European Union’s gross domestic product? There is enormous potential for growth in the reduction of obstacles to the provision of services across borders. If we want to put Europe on course for growth and combat mass unemployment, this is where we have to start. In this debate, let me add, those rabble-rousers who know nothing except how to stoke people’s fears have had a free run for far too long, and I am at present primarily referring to the unholy alliance that has been forged this week in Westphalia, on the other bank of the Rhine. President Chirac and Chancellor Schroeder are waging a campaign of half-truths and falsehoods that play on people’s fears, and so let me make it quite plain that it is a particularly good thing that the Commission has at last fought back against such polemics. I would like to congratulate Commissioner McCreevy on his passionate appeal yesterday. Let us muster the courage to fight mass unemployment. I also believe that we should be having this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg.</p>

He will recall that we, as part of our coordination on Lisbon, introduced many amendments into the debate, but, on the points where we thought it necessary to make the text more concrete, we did not hesitate to list what we saw as its potential breaking points. Let me remind you that, when we in the steering committee began to debate this text, we agreed that it would profit us nothing to have only general agreement, but that this House would have to make of the Lisbon process something more concrete. That is still the Group of the Greens’ position.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, we do believe that an agreement on the freedom to provide services in the European Union is really necessary. If I may be frank, the impression I get is that the Bolkestein directive basically refers to the realities in the old European Union and that it fails to address the great challenges in terms of social convergence, including that of preventing social dumping, that await us following the creation of the larger European Union that we now have.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, I take Chancellor Schroeder’s, and President Chirac’s, statements seriously. I believe that this directive must be withdrawn, and that the Socialists in this House will support our amendment. If, for example, you do not want the Poles, Czechs and Slovaks to be disappointed in their hopes that this Europe would actually bring them social progress, or if you do not want Europe to be associated, in the West, only with social decline, then you cannot vote in favour of the Bolkestein directive as it stands. For us, that is a breaking point in this text. We would have expected this House to come to an agreement on it.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning myself as I do with environmental and energy policy, I was delighted to see that many general blocks of text on sustainability have been incorporated into the draft that we are to vote on today. I do, though, refuse to accept that these blocks of text are fit only for pious platitudes on Lisbon and that everything will be forgotten again when, for example, we vote in the Committee on Agriculture on such things as REACH, the research Framework Programme or genetically modified organisms.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the Greens’ rejection is well founded, and we will continue, in the months to come, to debate with you on the future of social justice, a proper approach to the environment, and innovations, with reference to the actual projects concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We, in this House, do indeed agree on what the Lisbon strategy’s goals are, but we have quite different views as to the ways by which to reach them. The main task is to create jobs, and that is something I can do only if demand for products increases and business is obliged to invest in expansion and thereby meet the increased need. The facts ought to prompt even those whose economic thinking is of the most neoliberal kind to accept that, in the absence of demand, cutting taxes does nothing to create new jobs, but that, on the contrary, either the consequent rationalisation wipes them out or the increase in revenue is not reinvested, or alternatively, it finds its way, via taxation, into the state’s budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon strategy must not be about competing for the biggest returns, but rather competing for highly skilled jobs, excellence in education and training, product quality, high environmental standards and a high level of consumer protection. That also means that the lower income groups – who, contrary to what is often asserted, are not saving more than they used to – must either have their wages increased or their taxes cut, all the more so as there is sufficient political room for manoeuvre, productivity having risen much faster than pay over recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">I might add that this is also reflected in the favourable foreign trade balance enjoyed by most of the European Union’s Member States, who, despite high social transfers, were able to offer products acceptable in global markets. Low-paid and part-time jobs do nothing to help do away with the scourge of unemployment. If we want to become the world’s strongest economic region by 2010, we must devote our attention primarily to welfare and the environment in the European Union, for that is the best way in which we can promote our economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is detrimental to good decision-making on economic reforms. Alongside this, decision-making at the coming summit is also fed by the fear that the welfare state might be affected. That much has become clear since the autumn summit when Mr Kok’s report was discussed here.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to urge you to take a different look at economic reforms. Is it socially acceptable for people at 58 to be taken out of the labour market? Is it socially acceptable to saddle young people today with the burden of our system that has become unaffordable, while they themselves will never be able to enjoy the benefits?</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore call on the Commission, together with the Member States, to work on the necessary structural reforms. Growth is needed to maintain Europe’s social model, which, at the same time, needs to be reformed. Whoever claims today that structural reforms are unnecessary is a dangerous demagogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We find it incomprehensible that Mr Barroso has been criticised over the Lisbon strategy, as after all it is not the European Commission’s fault that the Lisbon strategy has not yet been implemented. It is the Member States who are to blame for the fact that the Lisbon strategy continues to be a paper construct rather than a feature of Europe’s real economic life, as it is they who lacked the courage to reform the European Union’s economies.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from a country in which for over 45 years attempts were made to cast a verbal spell over the economy. This is an impossible task, as what economies need is concrete action. It is precisely because the European Commission is in favour of such action that we will support it. I should like to make it very clear at this point that there is little chance of our commitments under the Lisbon strategy being honoured, or of real growth being achieved in Europe, if the Member States lack the necessary courage. This is the very courage they also lack when it comes to the services directive that is currently under debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The prerequisites for growth in Europe are lower taxes, less regulation and more economic freedom. Reality is knocking at our door, and Europe is not alone in the world. We are all fully aware that Asia is experiencing very rapid growth, and that the United States is also experiencing growth. Sooner or later, this economic reality will come knocking at our door.

<p class="contents">First and foremost, cooperation between institutions has failed. The European Council determined the objectives, whose fulfilment it had only to coordinate and facilitate, because in the majority of cases these objectives are subject to the national states within the framework of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call upon the national states and, the citizens of these states directly, to assume an increased responsibility in adopting the ideas of the Lisbon Strategy. The European Union would have to provide continuous monitoring and more consistently ensure the role of a flexible and effective centre, as it has, for example, in the verification and fulfilment of the Maastricht criteria. Individual Member States have not undergone the social reforms required to resolve the issue of social inclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of securing greater job opportunities: the fulfilment of this objective requires an increased mobility of the work force. But here we lag behind in the recognition of qualifications and skills, and particularly in the streamlining of this procedure. The movement of the work force appears to be in an East-West direction, mainly the highly sophisticated work force, which intensifies the differences in the less developed regions even more.</p>
<p class="contents">The ageing of the population: the national states have failed to pay attention to this phenomenon and, through their social reforms, have not managed to ensure the social inclusion of these citizens, that is, an entire generation. The main problem here is the qualitative replacement of this economically serious loss. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Lisbon Strategy launched in 2000 has not brought the progress we hoped for. We find that growth is stagnant and insufficient jobs have been created. The first reason seems obvious: the strategy was too confused, too fragmented and looked like a battle plan without an army. Even now, most people do not know what it is about.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must therefore leverage on its ability to create added value while preserving its social model; the way to do this is through priority action plans with precise timetables. We know that in terms of conventional competitiveness our companies are no longer a match for countries like China or India. Our advantages are innovation, the quality of our training, our environment and making the most of our know-how. Our trump card is eco-innovation and cutting-edge technologies that meet a demand for very high added-value products that our competitors are unable to satisfy.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must also avoid shooting itself in the foot by always stifling its economy, faced as it is with the challenges of an ageing population. That is why we have asked for an economic and social as well as environmental impact assessment for every legislative proposal. That constitutes ‘better law-making’. Reviving the economy and boosting employment means backing entrepreneurial activity by helping our large companies to become world champions and giving our SMEs the means to expand, developing a dynamic society for our fellow-citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We must mobilise to make Europe a centre of excellence, as you said, Mr Barroso. For that, we want a simple and fair tax system that causes as little hindrance as possible, public-private partnerships, an internal market with no social dumping, a high level of commitment to young people with the recognition of qualifications and greater use made of exchanges, the appointment of a ‘Mr or Mrs Lisbon’ in every capital and commitment by the Member States to the financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The world’s cards have been re-dealt. Every continent has a good hand. Lisbon ought to be Europe’s winning number, but we must always keep in mind what Churchill said, and make it our motto: ‘However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to say that I was delighted to hear Mr Juncker’s recent comments, when he said that we should now end the debate concerning what comes first and establish that in Europe things happen at the same time; that we improve our competitiveness, carry out social reforms – including in the labour market – and implement environmental reforms all at the same time. I should like to say that we in Scandinavia have shown that it can be done, and that is indeed partly what we understand by the European dimension. We are not aiming for just any kind of combination, however. We need reforms, and we need investment.</p>
<p class="contents">President of the Commission, I feel today that the greatest investment of all that we need is investment in human beings over the coming five years. The Commission and Mr Špidla talk of flexibility; we of the Group of the European Socialists in the European Parliament have nothing against flexibility. It depends on the type of flexibility we are talking about. I myself feel that we can create a reform that says that people must be able to move from an old job to a new job while maintaining social security and in the constant assurance of becoming more skilled, better qualified and more education-minded. If we do this, we will have an opportunity to bring about a new deal in which we say to people: ‘We shall safeguard your security in the twenty-first century in a new labour market with new jobs’. We shall commit ourselves to creating 1 500 new jobs in Europe each time we lose 1 000 jobs to Asia, India or the developing world. In other words, we shall say that we are here to create new jobs that can take the place of the old ones, and we shall ensure that people are able to take those new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">May I end by urgently saying to the Luxembourg Presidency and to the Commission that we need greater demand in Europe and that we need macroeconomic coordination of investments, for I can assure you that, without major economic growth, there will be no popular understanding for reforms, and without reforms we can have no sustainable economic growth. If we can agree on this in the Luxembourg Presidency’s proposal to the European Council, we shall have come a very, very long way. I want to wish you the best of luck with your work during the Luxembourg Presidency. I think great efforts are being made to secure balance, and we want to be there all the time, as Mr Schulz said today, to secure that balance that is the European identity.</p>

<p class="contents">That is how we will demonstrate to our fellow citizens our determination to give substance to a Europe that is, of course, competitive, but is also based on social cohesion and the restoration and preservation of a healthy environment.</p>
<p class="contents">This text also sends a number of clear messages that I would like to underline. A message to the younger generation first, since the text encourages the joint initiative of four Member States to help young people, an initiative which appears in the Commission’s communication to the spring European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The second message confirms the role of SMEs as job creators and innovators in a proactive and balanced industrial policy, one focused on the leading corporations, but also – and perhaps primarily – on those small companies which, again, are the key to job creation in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The third message stresses the obvious need for a major boost to research in the EU as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the text makes a fundamental point to which you referred just now, Mr Verheugen, namely that the Lisbon Strategy’s ambitions are pointless unless sufficient resources are made available, and this means in particular, as I am sure you understand, a European budget commensurate with its objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">From today, while the future of the Lisbon Strategy is indeed a matter for the European political authorities, it is just as much, and perhaps even more, a matter for the national political authorities and all those with a role to play in the economic life of the 25 Member States. The Lisbon Strategy’s success depends on the Member States’ ability to steer their policies in the required direction and to involve Europe’s population as widely as possible. It will only be possible to involve people in this way if public opinion is generally well-disposed towards the work of the European Union and its institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must understand that and respond to that expectation. If we bear in mind some recent statements that have been made about delocalisation, or what Mr McCreevy said here yesterday about the services directive, then I fear, Mr Barroso, that you may be continuing your work on the Treaty of Nice. Be careful! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is what we are working to do. We have a new project to work on – no longer economic and monetary union, but competitiveness, growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">What do we have to do? Firstly, we have to breathe life into the European social model of an environmentally-responsible market economy, making it tangible and implementing it, for we see the market not as an end in itself, but only as a means to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have to make the internal market a domestic market for all. Without an internal market in services, then, the new Lisbon strategy will remain unrealised.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we should make real the four freedoms for all Europe’s citizens, for businesses and for research.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we have to revitalise the Stability and Growth Pact. What does that mean? It means wanting to achieve the goals we have set ourselves in a consistent way; it means allowing the Commission to exercise the prerogatives conferred upon them; it means not making judges of criminals, it means doing our work at home rather than blaming Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">The same social model applies also to the Lisbon strategy. Where it is concerned, we must not repeat the mistakes we made with the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, we need more leadership from the Commission. We therefore need a European action plan, a European timetable, a European catalogue of measures; the Commission needs to engage in dialogue with the Member States when drawing up national action plans and it is the Commission that must monitor them.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, you are the trainer and captain of the Europe squad. The governments of the Member States are the members of your team. That is why all the Heads of State or Government – and not just the ministers for the internal market – must again make the Lisbon strategy for growth, competitiveness and employment, their own project. Listening to today’s debate, I wonder what the ETUC wants to demonstrate against in the run-up to the summit in Brussels. Against what you have put forward today? Against competitiveness, growth and employment? I call on the ETUC to call off the demonstration against growth, competitiveness and employment and do as the Socialist Group has earned our gratitude by doing – get back into the boat of growth, employment and competitiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would be good if we were to manage to become, if not absolutely the strongest knowledge-based society in economic terms, but one that is strong and – for this is another objective that must be listed, has a social orientation.</p>
<p class="contents">The results from the mid-term review are, alas, something other than favourable, and so we must, as a matter of urgency, implement in a consistent manner the strategies that have already been devised. At the heart of the Lisbon strategy, alongside social cohesion, growth, and employment, is education, which underpins everything else. There is a need for more investment in education, science and research, although this needs to go hand in hand with reforms in response to the changes in technology and society. What that means in practical terms is that we need, among other things, learning that accompanies life rather than learning that is lifelong – that has the ring of punishment about it – along with the promotion of mobility in employment, science and research, cross-border educational opportunities, the recognition of degrees – for many of them are not yet accepted everywhere – and access to education for all. In other words, there must be no cutbacks in education, no tuition fees, no depriving universities of resources, and no reduction in teaching hours, particularly in the natural sciences, for it is they that foster creativity and are therefore necessary both for the development of the individual, whether personal or professional.</p>
<p class="contents">Any strong, and socially-responsible society must also take the gender dimension into account, and so, at its Spring Summit, the Council must devote its attention to such issues as equal pay for equal work, about which much was said on Women’s Day yesterday, and also equality of opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, the Lisbon strategy must, after the euro, enlargement and the Constitution, become the EU’s next big success. We have no choice. That presumes, though, that we give the citizen the confidence and the leeway to develop new initiatives and meet new challenges. My neighbour in Rijswijk is perfectly capable of taking sound decisions about his future himself, and he does not need to be told what to do by the Dutch Government, let alone the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to my second point. We should be more critical about the role of the government in the framework of the Lisbon strategy. The question presents itself whether the government should be the problem solver or if it is perhaps the problem itself. Needless to say, the government must keep an eye on things and prescribe certain conditions, but far too often, we notice that the government obstructs, rather than stimulates, new initiatives. In my view, deregulation, a reduction in the administrative burden and cutting right down on red tape must therefore be central in the Lisbon strategy if we really want to achieve this desperately needed reinforcement of Europe’s competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I do, of course, agree completely with the Members who believe that Europe should take pride in its unique model, but we should also realise that this social model can be enforced only when we generate more economic growth. All too often, my fellow MEPs on my left have preserved the myth that social policy and economic growth are mutually exclusive, whether the subject is the Lisbon strategy or the services directive. Time and again, they intimate a false contradiction between a free, innovative, dynamic knowledge economy and social policy. It is therefore beyond me why the Socialist Group in this House abstained during last week’s vote in the parliamentary coordination group, particularly in the light of the fact that the other groups had really done their level best to reach a widely acceptable compromise. I am therefore delighted that the spokespersons of that group now say that the text before us deserves broad support. It makes last week’s abstention of vote all the more mysterious, but let us simply put it down to progressive insight.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no policy that is more social than policy that creates more and better jobs and creates space for entrepreneurship. It remains to be seen whether there is really a majority to back this Commission policy. Should this be the case, then that would be a welcome development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The causes of the strategy’s lack of success to date have been mostly the inaction and short-term thinking of the Member States. Because of this, Parliament and the Commission must jointly exert pressure on the Member States, in the interests of reaching the targets which have now been clearly redefined. They must exert pressure because the Union’s seven-year financial outline guarantees the necessary funds for realising the goals of job creation, and assistance for small and medium-sized research and development businesses. At the same time this should not reduce the new cohesion funding for new members and for helping less-developed regions catch up.</p>
<p class="contents">This is vital for maintaining the unity of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that realisation of the Lisbon targets is equally accessible to all. It is important that the stimulus reaches those affected by it, and in this pressure must be used on the governments of the Member States, so that they override short-term political and budgetary objectives. In some of the new Member States today there are still major budgetary and bureaucratic obstacles blocking small and medium-sized enterprises and farmers from successfully competing with larger businesses, or simply from being able to get what is theirs by law. Because of this, farmers are demonstrating at the moment in the streets of Budapest against Hungary’s government.</p>
<p class="contents">Support for knowledge centres with more developed cultures of research and science in the new Member States is vital too, as is that they too should be able to take equal part in the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy. Today, because of lack of funds in the new Member States, they are not able to prevent the loss of their best researchers. The brain drain mostly improves American, not European, competitiveness. Work, work, work: this makes Europe competitive, and European citizens richer.</p>

My second reason is that we all agree that in order to properly relaunch the Lisbon Strategy it is essential to create a sense of ownership of the strategy that filters down to local levels, so that responsibility lies first and foremost with national governments and parliaments as well as with the public. I agree wholeheartedly on this point, which I hope will be transformed into tangible measures in the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">This time, however, I must disagree with what Mrs Frassoni said in her speech. Among her reasons for rejecting the proposal for a resolution – which I, on the other hand, support – she mentioned the fact that one of the paragraphs in the resolution called the REACH regulation into question.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, you know very well how much I value that regulation and I would never risk jeopardising it by supporting the proposal for a resolution. I should, however, like to call on my fellow Members not to regard the regulation as a symbol of good or evil any longer, as polarisation of that kind implies that in the end there will be winners and losers.

I am rather sorry about that, but I can tell you that the working atmosphere was excellent, that we worked in extraordinarily good conditions and that I was highly satisfied as chairman.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the revitalisation of the Lisbon Strategy should be an indisputable priority and, for that to be the case, we must mobilise all the parties concerned. Parliament has therefore set up its coordinating working group, with the sole aim of helping to improve the strategy’s implementation by making Parliament a clearer and more influential partner in the process than has previously been the case. One of its tasks will be to prepare a recommendation for the Conference of Presidents before the spring summit.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, Mr Barroso, that you and all the commissioners will take everything that has been said into account. There is still a short paragraph which I have not heard, Mr Barroso, on the coordination of the three presidents. I believe that is very important for what lies ahead. So far as this draft resolution is concerned, I therefore hope there will be a very large majority today in the vote. That is why we also need to identify key measures like the importance of the service sector, special support for private businesses and also the need for a new regulation on chemical substances and the modernisation of the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important stage will begin next week with the holding in our Parliament in Brussels, under Mr Borrell’s presidency, of the first parliamentary meeting on the Lisbon Strategy with the national parliaments. It is very important that we study and work much more with our national parliaments. Our meeting will mark the opening of a parliamentary dialogue on this Lisbon Strategy. The aim is to coordinate initiatives at parliamentary level so as to send a strong and consistent message to the Heads of State or Government on the eve of each European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also be continuing our work on the other aspects of the mandate we have been given, namely to work at interinstitutional level for better legislative programming and to improve the transposition and implementation at national level of the measures taken within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy. Indeed, as the Kok Report suggests, we want Parliament to play a proactive role in monitoring the results obtained from this strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So it is that people in other regions of the world look at us and wonder whether we, in the European Union, really are capable of competing internationally in a new age and of remaining so while maintaining and further developing high social standards. Are we able to take economic and technical leaps into the new age while ushering in a new generation of production with higher – the highest – environmental standards? The President of the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen have presented us with very bold visions. Commissioner Verheugen has spoken of values – values in the way businesses are run, values in social standards, values of social participation both in enterprise and in the life of society, describing these as vehicles with which the process of modernisation travels forwards.</p>
<p class="contents">While that is something I would underline, I do believe that the reality of life for many people is somewhat different. They fear insecurity; they fear that these objectives will not be achieved in their day-to-day lives. If we want to bridge this gap, our instruments must be reformed first, and then the gap must be bridged in the broad outlines of economic policy and elsewhere, where I want to hear no more of stale ideologies, but more of how people really live in society. If what we are working on together in this House is to become reality, it is our own instruments that must be reformed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, the aim of growth and prosperity has clearly not been achieved. Half way through, growth is so weak that the OECD is describing the euro zone as the black hole of world recovery; growth is stagnating at 1.7% – lower in many countries – while world growth is 5% and, irony of ironies, Europe as a whole is producing a rate of 2.9%, thanks to the relative performance of those very countries which are not foolishly shackled to the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">As for prosperity, for our fellow citizens this is at present more synonymous with insecurity, loss of purchasing power and unemployment, the latter exemplified by the 8 million unemployed in the Franco-German nucleus.</p>
<p class="contents">The outlook is increasingly bleak, especially in the euro zone. The euro has not kept its promise. Clearly, it is not a currency of trade, nor is it a factor of budgetary discipline but is, on the contrary, one of laxity. For our contemporaries it is more a factor of inflation.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Stability Pact, it is clearly in the process of breaking up. Moreover, I fail to understand how anyone can support the euro without supporting the Stability Pact. That point, at least, is a contradiction in terms, and I should like to draw the Commission’s attention to it. The lesson for the Commission, moreover, is simple. The enlargement of Euroland must be postponed so that only 12 of the 25 (soon to be 30) countries will be euro zone members. That is, of course, a long way from the declared objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">All these are obviously arguments which will be used by the supporters of a ‘no’ vote, and we would be quite happy with that, were it not for the sad fact that what is at stake is the very notion of Europe, an idea that has unfortunately been compromised in the minds of our citizens, perhaps for a long time to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was dismayed that the completion of the internal market was ranked well down the priorities in that original paper and there was only one page devoted to it in a voluminous document.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank you, President Barroso, and your team, for elevating the internal market to the top of the agenda where it ought to be. If we do not complete the internal market, we will never have the basis for creating the jobs, growth, social and environmental policies we all want. It is absolutely clear that the next phase of the internal market has to be in services; we all know that.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week I said publicly to you, President Barroso, that I thought you were wobbling over this proposal. You were not here last night to hear Mr McCreevy make his barnstorming speech. It showed how important this directive is and I thank him very much for that. I can assure you that this side of the House will work with you to get the measure through, because it is the most important measure for the internal market since the 1992 programme and it is crucial for jobs and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Small- and medium-sized companies are already benefiting from it. I was delighted to hear that Commissioner Verheugen is going to bring forward a comprehensive programme for modernising and enhancing the conditions for small businesses. That was a weakness in the proposal. I am delighted it is going to be remedied, because if every small- and medium-sized company across Europe creates one more job over the next five years, we will have met that job creation goal. That will<span class="italic"> </span>only be achieved when we have business-friendly policies and an environment in which people want to go out and start businesses, whether in services or in manufacturing and technical innovation. That is the key to delivery of this Lisbon Agenda. We stand ready, President Barroso, to work with you to achieve those goals.</p>

We include social and environmental sustainability in competitiveness. The Commission speaks too narrowly of competition and employment. We Social Democrats are calling for social and environmental sustainability. Moreover, this is how it should be. In the long term, competitiveness will not be sustainable if it is not based on a social framework and the environment. Is that possible? Yes, it is. For example, my country is just as competitive as the United States of America, to which we are frequently compared. At the same time we have been able to maintain social and environmental sustainability, unlike the United States. As a consequence, ours is a more equal, more secure and more environmentally sustainable society. Competition must not be allowed to merely become a benefit for the few, because at the end of that road awaits a controlled society, currently the digitalised control dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the Lisbon Committee, I was disappointed that the report is not insisting that the names of those Member States that have not implemented the Lisbon legislation should be repeatedly published. There are as many as 1 500 internal market laws that have not been implemented and the process has therefore come to a halt thanks to a certain kind of non-solidarity movement. I would ask the media now to publish over and over again the names of the Member States that purposely avoid implementation. That way, having received the information, people could encourage implementation. That would be one method of sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we want to achieve this united cooperation, but also this involvement, then we have already negotiated the most important hurdle to succeed. To you, President Barroso, I gladly trust the difficult, but also central, role of the pivot of this process.</p>
<p class="contents">When we look at the Lisbon objective, a – to my mind absurd – contradiction is created. It is impossible to drive a wedge between the EU’s competitiveness, social policy and ecology, because without growth, we cannot meet the ecological obligations. Growth provides more jobs, employment, income and prosperity among the public. More people in jobs is the best guarantee for social security’s affordability and for cushioning the rising cost of care, as well as the reform of affordable and lasting pensions. Economy, ecology and social policy are therefore inextricably linked.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Verheugen has drawn attention to new initiatives: better and simpler legislation, new industrial policy and more support for innovation. In my view, these initiatives lack one thing, though, and that is retraining and extra training. Without providing permanent education to the potential workers, we cannot put the unemployed, whether they be women, minorities or the disabled, in jobs. So if we want to achieve this Europe <span class="italic">d'excellence</span>, we should once again put our money where our mouth is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(COMECON was the economic coordination organisation of the East European countries.) The answer is: a green field with ten thin cows all milking each other.I am convinced that if the European Union does not make some crucial decisions within one or two years – decisions which the Member States will implement – then in twenty years’ time this could be the coat of arms of the EU too, only with the difference that there will be more cows, and they may be even thinner.</p>
<p class="contents">So that this does not happen, a radical change of approach and a series of bold steps are needed. This is independent of one’s political orientation, whether one is religious or atheist, woman or man. According to my heart, my mind and my actions, I am left-wing. I believe, as a left-winger, that our only chance rests in using the opportunities of a unified internal market, breaking down all barriers to the free circulation of goods, services, labour and capital with lightning speed. Increasing European competitiveness is a question that will decide our future. If we do not change direction, we will not only fall behind others, but also our own opportunities and our dreams.</p>
<p class="contents">We must forge an alliance to push ourselves and our national governments, and strive to convert public opinion to accept these changes, to subordinate their four-year electoral propaganda machines and their individual interests to Europe, and to the millions living in Europe. We must be able to do so: we decide the future of our children and our grandchildren. Whether they will have work twenty years from now. My youngest daughter is nine years old. I do not want her to say, mother, you wasted it. The question is not who says what, but who does what. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In March 2000, we decided at Lisbon to maximise the competitiveness of Europe, subject to the limitations imposed by the maintenance of cohesion and environmental protection. However, what we referred to at the time as the Lisbon strategy described everything we wanted, but not how we would achieve it.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we worked out our priorities. Competitiveness is no longer the sum total of wishful thinking. It is a strategy of hierarchical priorities. Thus, the mid-term review summarises the Lisbon strategy in a simple equation:</p>

<p class="contents">I particularly welcome Commissioner Verheugen's emphasis on innovation and funding, because efforts to give young Europeans better training, to improve training and skills among workers and employers, to increase the number of women at work with equal professional opportunities while maintaining a commitment to family life: all of these activities we are advocating today as MEPs will not be enough if we are unable to promote the public and private investment required to establish infrastructures in Europe that underpin economic development, and to make free circulation of goods, services and people a reality throughout the European Union.</p>

The Lisbon strategy could be this Commission’s vision. One difference, though, is that Jacques Delors was dealing with Heads of Government like Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand, who had their own visions and goals for Europe. With some of the Heads of Government that we have now, one could well ask, in a critical way, where Europe ranks in their list of priorities. That, Mr President of the Commission, is one of the fundamental priorities for you – to overcome that obstacle and let Lisbon become a reality, so that you do not end up saying, ‘I had a dream’, whilst nothing productive came out of it for us. That is what is crucial, and the Commission can contribute in various ways. Commissioner McCreevy, whom I see here, can, in his own field, do a great deal to that end. I hope that you will get your own way, despite the Member States, where the cause of Europe needs to be advanced. People in the Member States need to be told what those States are supposed to be doing. Transparency and comparability are at stake here.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently seeing a failure to apply the law as it stands in the case of the Stability and Growth Pact, and that leads me to suspect that progress reports will not be enough. Let us make very clear comparisons here, with benchmarking, in order to establish who, in Europe, has the best labour market policy. When handling the Lisbon strategy in future, we will have to take care that the economy, ecology and social objectives do not act against each other, but are instead all subordinated to the goals of the Lisbon strategy. When nation states implement it, it is even more important to ensure that lawmaking is improved. There are Member States – and I am from one of them – that manage over and over again to plug the gaps as required. The most important thing will be to encourage people in Europe, so that the goal of the Lisbon strategy can become reality. Our main problem is that there are elements in Europe that do not believe that we can hold our own against the Americans. If we do manage to do that, then we in Europe will have achieved a great deal. This House is right behind you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One might say that everyone agrees on the goals but few know what to do to achieve them.</p>
<p class="contents">A knowledge-based economy requires a high level of education, as the text states, but it makes no mention of the fact that a high level of education has to be based on schooling that is also high quality right from a child’s first years at school. As basic and secondary education in most countries is known to have a number of failings, it is a pity that the recommendation does not call on the Member States to examine this aspect and to seek an urgent solution to it. This document points to the future, and the future cannot do without such a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">On another point, the text emphasises the need to mobilise European public opinion so as to convince it of the benefits of the Lisbon Strategy and to make it accept them, but there is not a single word on cultural policies at either a European or a national level. It talks of a culture of dialogue, but it does not even mention a dialogue of cultures. For the European citizen, accepting the need for the Lisbon Strategy and seeing its benefits will be a cultural process, more than anything else. Culture is not only an essential aspect of democracy; it is also the yardstick with which we can measure the gap between failure and success in a strategy like Lisbon, particularly if we want to preserve the European social model.</p>
<p class="contents">A knowledge-based economy implies a world view that only culture can provide. For that very reason, we must call on the Council, the Commission and the Governments to make a special, serious commitment in the financial sphere as well – I repeat, in the financial sphere as well – to further Europe’s cultural policies. Without them, the Lisbon Strategy will remain little more than a nice list of good intentions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we also have what is sometimes the cause of all the European Union’s failings: great ambitions but not the resources to match the targets we set ourselves. That is what we have just experienced over these last five years.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore try to change things over the next five years. That is why, Mr Barroso, Mr Verheugen, I was pleased to hear you say this morning that we were at the beginning and not at the end of the process of reviewing that strategy and that the results of the European Council were not awaited as an end in themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">After the meeting we are having today, there are, I believe, at least two essential meetings to come. First, the one on the adoption of the financial perspectives, and what you have just said to us seems to me to be going in the right direction. Then there is the reform of the Stability Pact, about which few have spoken this morning but which is facing the challenge referred to by Mr Poettering this morning when he called for stability and flexibility. Where, however, have we seen leadership being recreated or confidence restored by telling the citizens that nothing must change except their ability to make their employment more flexible? We will not achieve the Lisbon Strategy’s objectives like that.</p>
<p class="contents">If we really want to implement this strategy, a thorough reform of the Stability Pact will also be needed.</p>

In response to the question of whether this is an overly-ambitious objective, the answer is no. As to whether we are capable of achieving that aim, the answer depends on what we do and do not do.</p>
<p class="contents">What must we not do? We cannot follow the example of those countries which have abandoned structural reforms and increased public spending. We need to do the very opposite: to increase growth.</p>
<p class="contents">On this subject, I would like to use the example of the Aznar Government's policy in Spain – which can hardly be accused of inefficiency – to propose four practical measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, let us make the labour market more flexible in order to increase labour force participation. Secondly, we need to ensure that the cohesion budget for the 2007-2013 period is sufficient for requirements. Thirdly, we need to encourage entrepreneurship by reducing fiscal and administrative burdens. Fourthly, we need to support measures designed to improve education and life-long learning.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to complete the single market, making the liberalisation of the communications, energy and financial services markets a priority. Then we need to open up the European economy to the outside world, focusing in particular on NICs.</p>
<p class="contents">However, none of this will be possible, ladies and gentlemen, unless we have adequate budgetary resources – the figure of 1.24% of gross Community income set by the Commission is fine – and unless we involve the Member States directly in the process, since they are the main stakeholders in the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">If any of these States uses the Lisbon Strategy to propose cuts to Community policies that have been effective growth generators or in order to relax the Stability Pact, ladies and gentlemen, I bet you all a slice of Spanish <span class="italic">tortilla</span> and a Belgian beer that we will be on the road to disaster. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not think that the original document from the Commission succeeded in doing this. It stated that growth was needed in order to achieve prosperity and environmental sustainability. That is true, but it also applies the other way around; in other words, we need social cohesion and must make long-term sustainable investments if we are to achieve long-term growth. What is important is for these to co-exist. If we in Parliament can effectively make this point to the Council and if it becomes policy in the future, then we shall have succeeded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The whole point of integration and the opportunities afforded by the Lisbon strategy is to act in solidarity to support less-advanced regions and to help them catch up.</p>
<p class="contents">The original premise of the Lisbon strategy was to provide an answer to the internal and external challenges we currently face. Over the past year, however, we have not seen any evidence of new ideas or debates on how to reinvigorate the Lisbon process. I believe that the fundamental reason why the Lisbon strategy has not yet been a success is that both the European Commission and the Member States, which signed up to the strategy in 2000, have lacked the political ability to make changes. The latter are a prerequisite for the implementation of the strategy, and include in particular far-reaching liberalisation of the labour market, a lower level of welfare protection, an exhaustive review of regulatory barriers and major cuts in the amount of public money that is redistributed. The Lisbon strategy has fallen foul to bureaucracy, and the latter has become the greatest obstacle to the development of innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve the goals it has set itself, Europe must forge new visions and develop common actions that unite all its Member States. Priority should be given to linking up the principles of the Lisbon strategy with cohesion policy instruments and the funding earmarked for these instruments. This funding should not resemble alms given by the wealthy to the poor. Instead, it should be an instrument to boost the competitiveness of regional economies and the development of human capital, and to encourage innovation and the transfer of technology from science to EU industry. The new Member States have brought to the EU of 25 the vitality of a liberalised market, a strong spirit of entrepreneurship, a critical approach to over-regulation, a high level of compliance with Community legislation and rapid increases in productivity, as well as the synergy and similarities that exist between the Lisbon goals and the structural changes we have undergone in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say that the basic principle of economic development policy should be that the goals of economic growth and job creation are not designed to be achieved simultaneously. It is difficult to achieve the second without having achieved the first. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also true that focusing on the economic agenda does not mean that we are downgrading other agendas, be this the environment or the social agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say to Commissioner Kroes that competition is the objective, not the problem. We cannot have a race to the back of the queue as Member States scurry to avoid attracting outside investment for fear of getting a rap on the knuckles from Brussels. Two high-profile examples from Ireland – Intel and Ryanair – have been highly instructive in demonstrating how unreasonably applied competition policy can militate against competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge Commissioner Kovács, in relation to taxation, that ‘if it ain’t broke don’t fix it’ and above all ‘don’t break it’! Member States must be given the flexibility they require to implement the solutions they need to achieve their Lisbon objectives, hopefully by stimulating employment through a reduction in direct taxation, especially a reduction in labour taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">I would underline to Commissioner Potočnik that it is absolutely imperative that Community funding for research be substantially increased under the Seventh Framework Programme. Fundamental research is essential, but equally we must facilitate the application of research and development in European businesses and foster innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say to Commissioner McCreevy that facilitating the free movement of services is the missing key needed to unlock the potential of the European workforce and galvanise the European economy. As you mentioned yesterday, Commissioner, it is always easier to find reasons not to do something. Services contribute 70% of European GDP, and I urge you to proceed with the Services Directive. It is particularly important for our new Member States, which have been denied the advantage of free movement of people, goods and services for so long. Please single out health services, consider the benchmark of good regulation, and deal with this specific area in a more appropriate way.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a word to the College of Commissioners in general. Could we please have less regulation; better regulation; simpler regulation; thoroughly vetted regulation; risk-assessed regulation. We need to Lisbon-proof REACH, the Services Directive and the Nutritional and Health Claims Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">We are always an action plan away from action. Commissioner Barroso and colleagues, please go for it!</p>

It is not a question of others being better in various areas, but of why they are better. We may take particular pride in the social model, but we are still seeing unemployment, exclusion, stagnation and conflict. We also have to ask ourselves why, and what decisions we must take to change this state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">What Mrs Doyle just said is correct. In each area in which our actions hinder competition, the result is a deterioration in competitiveness. Those who are currently fighting the Services Directive with its free and open market for services are actually opposing new jobs and European growth in the future. There is no conflict between the internal market and people’s social security, since nothing is as crucial for social security as a job and an income. There is nothing so crucial to social cohesion as opportunities for new businesses and new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important integration process in the European Union is happening right now while we are sitting here. It concerns a flow of people, goods and services that is taking knowledge and ideas across borders. We must therefore ask ourselves whether, in this process, we want to make it possible for every single Member State to exploit its particular competitive advantages. The old Member States have had the advantage of developing their social economies and their competitiveness in peace and freedom for over fifty years. During that time, the new Member States were suffering oppression and poverty. The internal market must be characterised by everyone’s being able to exploit their competitiveness. The Commission has a duty to realise and emphasise that what we are concerned with here are solidarity, integration and opportunities for all to create prosperity. That is why the Services Directive is important, and that is why it is important to remember that it is a question here of a European integration that is vital to competitiveness. This is something we must implement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Lisbon Strategy has set us a task which is not an easy one – to create new and higher quality jobs and, at the same time, to provide for the citizens of the European Union a similar or higher level of social security. Most countries allocate substantial resources to pay for an army of unemployed. Many young people spend far too long searching in vain for their first job, so that they can gain the necessary experience.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, apart from their regular employment, mothers have the responsibility of maternal duties and are therefore working twice over. At the same time Europe has an ageing population as women are no longer prepared to bear as much responsibility for the normal reproduction of the population as they did in the past. Equality in the field of education has given women more opportunities in employment and vocational advancement, if, of course, they do not have children or put off having children until later.</p>
<p class="contents">In this day and age we can no longer ask women to have more children for the good of society and devote themselves to motherhood, and also expect them to bear all the financial consequences on their shoulders. Similarly we cannot expect employers to provide extra benefits for mothers voluntarily.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason the countries of the European Union need to formulate systematically the kind of employment policy, including financial incentives and benefits, that will encourage employers to create jobs suitable for mothers, without either the employer or the mother herself suffering any negative consequences as a result. In this way mothers would not have to choose between a career and motherhood but could combine both in the interests of society and for their own development and benefit. Economising at the expense of motherhood is a poor investment for the future of society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I take my cue from the subject of human capital, which everyone considers a strategic factor in regaining our competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">During the last parliamentary term, when it was found that 94.5% of Europe’s schools had Internet connections but only 25% of teachers knew how to use the new technologies for teaching purposes, we spent a long time hoping that the <span class="italic">e</span>-learning initiative would materialise. Parliament hoped for action from the national governments, which were supposed to make good use of resources – amounting to EUR 30 billion, or so we imagined – through a system of priorities that would enable them to solve the human capital problem.</p>
<p class="contents">When it was clear that the governments would not act, it was decided that the Commission should introduce a programme. By that time the billions had shrunk to millions, 44 million to be precise, a derisory amount to solve the problem, and so the proposal was left as just a statement of principle and the priority remained purely theoretical without ever becoming a budget priority.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of that, I ask that the Commission should be able to assign responsibility to those in power and to promote action in the area of human capital. As the Union budget quite rightly obliges us to provide for agriculture to the tune of 50%, this step would prevent Europe from remaining just a guardian of animal capital rather than the promoter of human capital. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In spite of all the flowery language, however, there is no getting away from the fact that the Lisbon goals will not be achieved. The revised version of the Lisbon strategy sets fewer goals, while attempting to categorise these goals, and gives clear priority to economic growth and greater competitiveness. This is a good thing in itself, yet unfortunately this does not provide an answer to the contradiction inherent in the project, namely that the problems with which the European Union is struggling are due to the over-regulation of every area of economic activity. The impact of this over-regulation is quite simply devastating, and it leads to low – or, in some Member States, zero – GDP growth and high unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">The main problem Europe faces is the over-sized tax burden and excessive number of regulations with which the private sector and investors have to contend. Liberalisation in the sense of the four freedoms has always acted as the foundation of the Community, and care must therefore be taken to ensure that any legislation that is adopted serves to promote effective liberalisation and freedom instead of over-regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon strategy also fails to mention a number of obvious problems that have arisen as a result of the EU’s enlargement to include ten new Member States. Such problems relate primarily to discrimination against workers from the new Member States on the labour markets of 12 of the old Member States. Such discrimination violates European principles and the concept of the four freedoms, and poses a major threat to the economic productivity of the European Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the Lisbon strategy does not mention the common agricultural policy in any detail, although this programme swallows up the most EU funding. This is another instance where double standards exist in the European Union; one rule applies to the old Member States, whose farmers receive full support, and another to the new Member States, whose farmers will not receive full support until 2013. The amount of money spent on this policy is also ridiculously large. In general terms, Europe needs less regulation, fewer grants and more freedom of movement for workers, services, firms, investments and capital.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schmit,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I believe the debate has adequately shown that Lisbon is crucial, while at the same time we have to realise that we are in a way faced with a paradox. Europe is the world’s greatest trading power, certain Member States are export champions, as Vice-President Verheugen has also said, and many European firms are world leaders in their sectors – and yet we rather have the impression that we are falling into a kind of perpetual pessimism.</p>
<p class="contents">In aeronautics and space technologies, with Galileo for example, European industry has demonstrated its ability to make up lost ground. Note, too, that we are experiencing the success of enlargement. The new Member States are showing dynamism and an exemplary European momentum. The gap between the old and the new members of the European Union is closing: 5% growth for the new, around 2% for the old. This shows that Europe has tremendous creative ability. It also shows that Europe’s decline is neither real nor inevitable.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when we are complaining, feeling we are experiencing a period of decline, the rest of the world is concerned about the US deficits, the trade deficit and budget deficit. However, the US is producing growth, it is producing research, it is producing jobs. In the end, that is where the weakness of Europe as a whole lies. The question must nevertheless be approached with some caution, because when we speak of Europe the situation varies from one country to another. There are differences between Member States, there are States where employment is less of a problem, where there is growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, however, we are struggling to reach a sufficient and sufficiently sustainable rate of growth to create the jobs Europe needs if it is to cut an excessively high level of unemployment appreciably and sustainably. As I have already said, however, there are no grounds for pessimism provided the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy does not stop at fine words but really does bring a fresh impetus, a fresh impetus that we need, that Europe’s citizens need and on which they are really counting.</p>
<p class="contents">The revival of economic growth is certainly not synonymous with dismantling the European social model. The suggestion that we can achieve growth by dismantling the system of social protection does not seem credible to me. Nor is it synonymous with unlimited exploitation of natural resources regardless of the consequences, because in a way that would be the opposite of real quality growth. That is not the way that has been chosen for relaunching the reform strategy, the Lisbon Strategy, either. Social exclusion produces neither more growth nor more jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also be aware, however, that an economy that is increasingly uncompetitive and which no longer generates enough jobs, inevitably leads to social exclusion and undermines the very foundations of the European social model. That is why the presidency advocates growth as a way of fostering social cohesion, because social cohesion and economic growth are closely linked and in a way enrich one another.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I think the European Parliament’s resolution is an important contribution to the great reform project which the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy represents. Your messages have been heard: more research, a better translation of research and innovation into new products and new services, better access to, and wider dissemination of, new technologies and innovation, enabling new knowledge to be better anchored in the economy and in society – a project for a knowledge-based economy that is the opposite of a society which marginalises large sections of the population – and accelerated development of the eco-technologies that can allow Europe to affirm its leadership in its future activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I entirely agree with what Vice-President Verheugen said about the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the reservoir of jobs that Europe needs. If that network is to develop, however, we have to think of new ways of financing it. It is unfortunately often too difficult to find the financial resources to establish a business. The bureaucratic and administrative hurdles are sometimes too much of a deterrent for young people to embark on the adventure of forming new businesses. We must therefore concentrate on better legislation, reduce the bureaucratic obstacles where that can be done easily and also have European laws that are more accessible and easier to understand. I believe we must follow that route more energetically in future.</p>
<p class="contents">However, social innovation, investment in human capital and lifelong training are also ways of ensuring that flexibility, a term on which there is broad agreement, does not preclude a necessary amount of security. Insecurity is not a source of confidence for the future – quite the contrary. To some extent, the aim of the new Lisbon Strategy is a dynamic Europe which is not a victim but is a protagonist of globalisation – a genuine protagonist helping to shape that globalisation. We do not want a multi-speed society, we want everyone to share in growth, economic development and the expansion of knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">Knowing that these are crucial days for the EU’s economy and for its economic development, we would be deceiving ourselves if we thought we could relaunch the Lisbon Strategy successfully without being able to agree on a serious reform of the Stability and Growth Pact. It would be a waste of time. We cannot face the media saying ‘yes, we succeeded in relaunching the Lisbon Strategy but we failed to come to any agreement over the Stability Pact’. That is no solution.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs structural reforms just as it needs a macroeconomic framework that will create a proper balance between stability on the one hand and growth and employment on the other. Uncontrolled deficits are certainly not the answer here. At the same time, however, future investments cannot be used to pay the price for a purely accounting approach that has nothing to do with good economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I also agree with Mr Verheugen when he makes a direct connection between the success of the financial perspectives and the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy. What credibility would the European Union have if, in March, it decided to revive research, to step up its action in support of competitiveness and to develop policies more compatible with the ecological balance only to find, scarcely three months later, that, for 0.0X% of its GNP, it was unable to agree on Community financing for its policies? You must agree that is a joke. It is not realistic.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">People will be watching the European Union very closely over the next two weeks. It may create a genuine new momentum. It may also fail, putting at risk its future development, the confidence people have in its economy and also, perhaps even more seriously – as a number of speakers have pointed out – putting at risk the strong support it will need from its citizens if it is to succeed. In close cooperation with the Commission and attentive to your Parliament, the presidency wishes to make a success of this great partnership project that we are in the process of getting off the ground. We are counting on Parliament’s support as next week it organises a big meeting on the Lisbon Strategy with the national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon Strategy is also an issue of democracy, it needs the backing and support of our societies. Without that support, there will be no success at the end of the road. I believe we now have the ability to release the energy, to release the creativity, to release the spirit of innovation and initiative with which Europe is overflowing, but we must take things in hand, open up new prospects for the people of Europe, and that gives me confidence for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barroso,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission. </span><span class="italic"></span><span class="italic"> (FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to offer you my sincere thanks for this very committed and, above all, very rich debate in which many of you have taken part.</p>
<p class="contents">From it I conclude that Parliament is broadly in support of the new Lisbon Strategy. I am pleased about that. Our very positive exchange of views shows that the Commission can consider the European Parliament a genuine partner for the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy. You have responded positively to my request at the opening of the debate this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">In her speech, Mrs Ek almost made a slip of the tongue: speaking of Parliament’s resolution, she almost said revolution. I will not go as far as that, what we are doing is not a revolution, but it is a genuine reform. It is also a revolution in the sense of our partnership: we are going to work together and we are all – Parliament, Commission, Council – capable of reaching a dynamic consensus, not a consensus of inaction or paralysis, but a dynamic consensus for the changes that are needed in our Europe. They are changes that are necessary for a reform that is proactive but has a sense of moderation and balance.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I would like to answer a specific question put to me by Mr Turmes of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. You asked me, Mr Turmes, where I was when the global strategy for sustainable development was drawn up in Rio in 1992. Well, I was in Rio, but I was not on Ipanema or Copacabana beach! I was the EU presidency’s representative, because at that time it was the Portuguese Presidency. I was then working with the Commission and the Member States, and it was Europe that led the debate on sustainable development at the Rio conference.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I am telling you this to show you my personal commitment and that of the Commission to the objectives of sustainable development. There is no contradiction between social cohesion, sustainable development and growth and competitiveness. I believe that is an obvious conclusion from our debate. As we have always said, they are not contradictory objectives, they are objectives which can reinforce one another.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, we are all now aware that Europe urgently needs to raise its level of growth. Growth and job creation are particularly urgent objectives. That is why we are sure we are right to concentrate our short-term objectives in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">I am of course very pleased with the debate because we have shown that consensus was possible. However, that consensus must go beyond the European institutions, extending to the national level, to the national parliaments and governments. Your positive response increases our joint responsibilities. The Commission, for its part, will do all it can to make the new Lisbon Strategy a success.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission now knows that it can count on the European Parliament for the achievement of this objective. However, Parliament will have to be an active partner, taking account of the Commission’s demands. The Commission and the European institutions must not forget that the time for action has come. In this regard, I would like to highlight the support I have found in this Parliament for the priority we have given to developing the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">We will have no growth in Europe without a fully operational internal market. Services account for 70% of our economy. We have an internal market for goods, but still have 25 different markets for services. We therefore need to integrate the service markets, but to do so of course while taking account of the legitimate concerns put forward during the debate on the services directive. That is why the Commission is listening. It wants to work with you. I also want to stress our support for all that Commissioner McCreevy said about the services directive yesterday. We are going to work with you in that spirit. We believe an internal market in services must be established and that it is, at the same time, possible to resolve any problems to which the implementation of that directive might give rise.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also very attentive to what has been said about human capital and the priority of human capital. Many of you, Mr Rasmussen in particular, have stressed the importance of human capital, education, research and innovation, and I will also add, as Mr Graça Moura said, culture. Indeed, our concept of human capital is not a technocratic view. Culture is also a part of our objectives for the knowledge economy. That is why we have made concrete proposals: the European technology institute, the new research programme. We have definite programmes to encourage a growth economy, but also a knowledge-based economy, at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I would like to answer a specific question put to me by Mr Daul – whom I would like to congratulate as chairman of the Committee of 33, together with all the rapporteurs who have made a broad consensus on your resolution possible. For our part, we agree to the holding of a tripartite summit of the presidents of the three institutions to discuss the Lisbon Strategy. I personally am willing to take part and I hope the President of Parliament and the president of the Council will back the idea.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, our medium-term objective is that the three institutions should work together. Having said that, the Lisbon Strategy would gain a lot if there were a greater sense that the institutions we represent were wholeheartedly behind it.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we are looking to the European Council in the expectation and, if I may say so, the certainty that it will, in turn, give the necessary political impetus to the relaunch of Lisbon and the preparation of a European strategy for growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of you - Mr Karas, Mr Radwan, Mr Watson, Mr Titley, Mr Harbour – have stressed how important it now is that the Member States should be committed. Of course, the Commission now feels stronger due to the support which the European Parliament is giving to the new Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals made by ourselves and the European Parliament must not now be weakened when they come to be implemented, the Member States must also be able to commit themselves and national public opinion must understand that the new Lisbon Strategy is not purely decorative but is really at the heart of the programmes for economic reform, social cohesion and sustainable development in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I must say that, for me, the great result of this debate is this willingness to work together, the possibility of reaching a dynamic consensus and also the broad support for the new Lisbon Strategy and, beyond that support, the fact that, for the next five years, it will be at the centre of the work done by our institutions and at the core of the reforms that will have to be undertaken by our Member States.</p>
