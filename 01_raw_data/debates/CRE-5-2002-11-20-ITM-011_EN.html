We all know that this was not an easy procedure; there were serious political and technical difficulties and I really must thank her, because I think that, with the work that has been done, Parliament will help push through this important directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the beginning of the 1980s, temporary agency work has become an important cog in the wheel of the European job market as companies strive for more and more flexible employment management. Over recent years, this type of work has increased in leaps and bounds.</p>
<p class="contents">Truly massive employment agencies have developed in numerous countries, sometimes with hundreds or thousands of workers, and we see this sort of intervention on the job market as a positive development; it often creates jobs and it is always an extremely important tool for people looking for their first job.</p>
<p class="contents">The growth in temporary agency work is firmly on the agenda of social and economic reform which was strengthened at the Barcelona Summit. In many countries, however, temporary employment is looked down on, mainly when flexibility and quality of work are not pulling in the same direction. This is the shortcoming on certain job markets which this directive is designed to rectify or prevent in future. The aim is to create a broad, flexible framework based on fundamental workers' rights; these rights must be protected in all cases so that we can protect the quality of work.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission tabled this proposal when talks between the social partners broke down in May 2001. I think it is extremely important that the Council and Parliament manage to approve this directive, which sends out a very important political message that the European institutions are prepared to shoulder their responsibilities and take action even where the social partners are unable to agree. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">van den Burg (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. –<span class="italic"> (NL)</span> Mr President, I did indeed intend starting with the difficult legacy of this dossier, which goes back to the early nineties when a number of proposals for directives on atypical work were submitted. You have already referred to the agreements of social partners and also to the failure of their negotiations in this regard. Considerable effort has been expended on tabling this proposal in the Commission. It has taken nearly a year. Indeed, that whole legacy shows that it was extremely difficult to draft the directive and that it was also highly controversial. People have therefore often asked me what on earth possessed me to think that I would get it through just like that.</p>
<p class="contents">Why have I sunk my teeth into this as I have? In the first place, because I have 25 years of experience of atypical working relationships of this kind and of providing protection for people in the weakest positions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, because I am utterly convinced of the usefulness and the need for flexibilisation of the European labour market and I see temporary work as a worthwhile tool, provided that the protection of temporary workers is also regulated in a sensible way.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, because I believe in the opportunities that temporary work offers workers with specific wishes or problems. People who need a leg-up into the labour market or people who are seeking tailor-made work patterns that are not provided by the ordinary employers in the ordinary work patterns.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, because I believe in the entrepreneurship of the temporary sector and the art of combining the wishes of workers and employers with regard to flexibility in a positive way. However, I would also say, the art of entrepreneurship is also for example not transferring the risk of underutilisation to the workers, but guaranteeing to workers that as an employer you will ensure that they have work and that they can be deployed at the times that they themselves would want.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, because I believe in the regulating and salutary effect of collective employment conditions, which have an important part to play in this proposal too. It is a question not only of collective bargaining agreements in the sectors in which that work is used, but also collective bargaining agreements in the temporary employment industry, the temporary sector itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, because I totally disagree with the trend to declare European regulation in the social sphere out of order. I actually think that it is very important, especially in view of enlargement and the developments that are under way, to lay this basis in European legislation and to ensure that from here we also go further in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">All this I can see in the proposed directive. It includes flexibility and security, promotion and patronage, acceptance and protection, liberalisation and regulation. I think that there is a good balance in the Commission’s proposal, but that this balance has been enhanced by what we in this Parliament have done. I therefore strongly oppose the attempts of some in this Parliament to remove precisely this balance of flexibility and security. Their assault focuses in particular on three things.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, they are trying to remove the equal treatment principle by not linking it to the conditions of employment in the user company, but taking other temporary workers as a reference point. Then you have something like the equal treatment of women by comparing them only with other women and not with men.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, they are contesting the fact that the directive should have anything at all to do with pay. We now have the legal opinions of all three institutions that this is very much possible, because it is a question of a comparison and not of fixing the level of pay. With this attempt, however, they are also trying to take the sting out of it, because pay is of course the most important condition of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, they are trying to exclude the exception that was in paragraph 5.4 of the Commission’s proposal, concerning short temporary assignments, and to make it general and even to raise it to 12 months. That will mean that the directive no longer has any point, because then the majority, if not all, temporary work will fall outside of its scope. I know that this is also a major problem in the United Kingdom. I have also tried to make a proposal to make this possible for a transitional period, that is for the first six weeks. That has not been supported in this Parliament so far, but I hope that further discussion on this subject will prove possible. There is one final comment I should like to make. Last week, parliament in Germany agreed on a system that is very much in line with the directive. I therefore hope – and I would like to conclude on this point – that the Social Affairs Council on 3 December will try to reach a common position, because in any event the way is now open for Germany too to do this in the line of the directive, and because it would be very good and, in fact, be proof that social legislation is indeed still possible if we could have a decision quickly and then proceed under the Greek Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I speak on behalf of Mr Gargani, the chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, in whose name our opinion stands. That is due to the chivalry of my colleague, Mr Koukiadis, who is here tonight and who is the original draftsman of the opinion. He tried in vain to persuade our committee to support the thrust of the Commission proposals. By a convincing majority the Committee on Legal Affairs voted in a series of sensible modifications that would have blunted some of the harm that this directive, if it is not changed, is going to do to the economy and employment throughout the European Union. I thank Mr Koukiadis for doing the decent thing and laying down his report.</p>
<p class="contents">As the second speaker, I want to pay tribute to Mrs van den Burg. I have not had the pleasure of working with her before. She has worked in a very open-handed and friendly way. As she said, she has taken advice from a lot of people. Unfortunately, she has not listened to that advice. I am pleased that a number of other groups have supported the thrust of our amendments and I thank members of my own political family for going along with some of our ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that, as amended, the proposal from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs does not achieve the sort of flexibility that its advocates, the Commission and the rapporteur, were claiming. It has become more intrusive – there is more regulation. My concern about this report is that it fails to accept that high-quality temporary work, delivered by a caring and well-run agency, is not just a second best for employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to conclude by thanking the Committee on Employment for accepting one of my amendments which states: 'Member States shall transpose these provisions in a manner consistent with promoting job creation and making temporary agency work more attractive, recognising the different circumstances pertaining to their own territory'. If you had achieved that, I would have been delighted to support the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Temporary agency work is making an increasing contribution to this process. Successful placement on a temporary basis increases the chances of permanent employment. This applies to the low-skilled and the long-term unemployed, but also to specialists.</p>
<p class="contents">In the opinion which I have drafted on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, we refer to the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We have incorporated the right to paid maternity leave and parental leave into the draft directive. We are against every form of discrimination, whether it relates to payment for equal work or work of equal value, is based on sex, or discriminates against temporary workers compared with permanent staff.</p>
<p class="contents">For us, it was important to ensure that temporary workers should not be used to break strikes or as a means of imposing radical cuts in full-time jobs or permanent staff. Men still account for more than three-quarters of temporary workers. It is the difficulty in achieving a balance between work and family life that explains why there are far fewer women in this category . Yet temporary work in particular allows adaptation to individual needs, and offers women good opportunities to enter the workforce or return to work.</p>
<p class="contents">There are problems in practice, however. In Germany, temporary work agencies, known as Personnel Service Agencies, are now being established in the Employment Offices; as part of the public sector, they are subsidised from taxation and bear no commercial risks. This puts the private temporary work agencies at a severe disadvantage. I can tell the rapporteur, Mrs van den Burg, that the Federal Government is not implementing its supposedly groundbreaking concepts on a one-to-one basis, as it had pledged, but is watering them down. Temporary agency staff are to be paid as much as the permanent staff in the user company from day one. Yet equal pay from the start and the exclusive application of collective agreements are an impediment to temporary work.</p>
<p class="contents">It was unfortunate that my proposal to introduce a six-month qualifying period at European level failed to secure a majority. In the Group of the European People’s Party, we are therefore developing a compromise which takes appropriate account of the different rules in the Member States and respects the subsidiarity principle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Everyone involved has made great efforts to achieve the best possible solution for temporary workers, temporary work agencies and dynamic economic development in our EU Member States. Reaching this outcome was a difficult task. I would like to thank everyone who helped to ensure that we could present a fairly good compromise today.</p>
<p class="contents">With around 10 million jobless and a shaky economy in the European Union, we must be sure that our well-meaning intention – to guarantee a basic level of social provision for temporary workers – does not paralyse an entire sector. It would be quite inappropriate to term 'temporary work' an atypical or even an unworthy form of working. Temporary work can help new recruits find a direction for the future, and it can help prevent employees who are particularly difficult to place from leaving the workforce, or assist them to return to work.</p>
<p class="contents">My group attaches particular importance to flexibility in this sector. We must not create new bureaucratic hurdles, and temporary work must continue to be affordable for small companies too. Otherwise, the days of temporary agency work are numbered, leaving even more millions jobless in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">If, when we vote tomorrow, we are guided by the principle of subsidiarity and the concept of pro-active economic development as a basis for more jobs, we will create more scope for the EU Member States to pursue their own courses towards flexible labour market development which does not conflict with appropriate protection for workers. The measures adopted in Germany with regard to temporary work lead to a dead-end. I hope we can create a more effective framework here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have heard that provision varies from Member State to Member State in terms of the protection afforded to temporary agency workers. That is indeed the case and that justifies the laying down of a basic framework of protection for temporary workers throughout the European Union, but I would also underline that it will include the accession countries. The numbers of such workers are increasing in those countries, but as far as I am aware they have no existing protection for temporary agency workers.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that tonight we are pursuing a strategy which has been under way since 1997, when we adopted the employment strategy at European Union level. In the adaptability pillar of that strategy, to which all Member States have signed up, we agreed to strike a balance between flexibility for companies, of all shapes and sizes, and a degree of security for the workers working within, and moving between, those enterprises. We have already dealt with that in relation to the earlier proposals on part-time work and on fixed-term contract working. We were warned at the time of the part-working directive that it would cost hundreds of thousands of part-time jobs, particularly for women workers within the European Union. We now have the evidence and the opposite is the case, because part-time work has come to be seen as a positive option. What we are working on now will mean that temporary agency work will also become a positive option in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We are often told that it is already a positive option, and that many people want to be temporary agency workers. Only 10% of the 61,000 temporary agency workers in my own region say that they are temporary agency workers by choice. We can increase that percentage quite significantly if we get it right and bring this proposal to a successful conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">We should pursue that balance between flexibility and security. Mr Harbour says we have not done it yet but I would say to him that this is the first stage. This is the opening gambit and not the end game. This is a codecision dossier. We have a long way to go, through common position, through second reading and no doubt into conciliation. We can continue to pursue that balance between flexibility and security.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own group, two issues have been of great importance at this first reading stage. One is 'day one comparability'. I therefore hope that Amendment No 42 will be carried tomorrow. The second is the comparator. To whom is the temporary agency worker compared in terms of pay and basic employment conditions? None of the potential solutions we currently have on paper are that elegant, but they get us through first reading and I am sure we will be getting back to that at the common position and second reading stages. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not just a problem for the UK, it is a problem for Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands and various other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have to do is carry out a proper comprehensive impact assessment. We wish to return the directive to the Commission for them to do that assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of temporary workers receiving protection but believe that it is probably best left to Member States, rather than having the 'fit-all' directive which we have in front of us today.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal in its current form will reduce flexibility, reduce opportunities for temporary workers and lead to more bureaucracy. We have, however, suggested various amendments in case the proposal is not rejected outright. To make it more workable for Member States we would firstly like to exclude pay and other financial benefits from the directive's scope altogether. I do not believe it should be an EU competence in any case.</p>
<p class="contents">The second major amendment is to give an exemption for 12 months for temporary workers placed in user companies. That is only for pay and financial benefits, not for health and safety. Most temporary workers in the UK and some other Member States are covered on health and safety grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">Another key amendment is to make sure the user company or the agency can be comparative, to give Member States that choice. Another area of concern is the temporary-to-permanent contract fee. Agencies should get some sort of recompense if the temporary worker is taken on by the user company.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, these amendments will make the directive far more workable and more acceptable to temporary workers, agencies and user companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, although the proposal is intended to improve the working conditions of temporary workers, guaranteeing them equal rights and equal treatment, it only guarantees these through minimum standards of protection, based on the principle of non-discrimination, with countless derogations and with the dangerous prospect of an upsurge in temporary work agencies, which will contribute to greater job instability.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, in the debate in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we agreed with all of the rapporteur’s attempts to improve the proposal for a directive and to guarantee workers’ rights, having tabled various proposals for amendments, specifically the removal of various derogations that could undermine the principle of non-discrimination, the guarantee not to use temporary workers to break strikes and the principle that the work undertaken by temporary agencies must not contribute to increasing job instability.</p>
<p class="contents">We regret that most of these proposals have not been accepted, although we welcome the fact that some important ideas have been adopted, specifically on the restriction of derogations, enshrining the application of the principle of non-discrimination from day one with the removal of the six-week derogation, thereby guaranteeing some rights in the field of the information and participation of temporary workers and their not being used to break a strike.</p>
<p class="contents">Other articles, however, are worded in a way that is unfortunate, incorrect and in some cases dangerous to workers, in addition to opening the way to further derogations, to be granted by the social partners. These articles are also intended to ensure an active role for temporary work agencies, contributing to greater labour flexibility. Hence the proposals we tabled for the vote in plenary. We are attempting to ensure that the European Parliament proposal achieves a significant improvement in the rights of temporary workers and does not pave the way for greater job instability. Our commitment is to ensuring that the greatest value is attached to work, by creating more high-quality jobs with rights and not to instability and the devaluing of workers. We therefore hope that you will support our proposals and reject all those that will, in practice, create greater instability and damage the rights of temporary workers who, in most cases, only resort to taking this type of work when they cannot find permanent employment. Let us not, then, contribute to a dual form of discrimination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My group will not be supporting the amendments which oppose this directive, but will generally support the rapporteur. It is quite true that there are many reputable agencies which pay well, which engage in training their staff and which provide very good terms and conditions. These agencies are generally already used to working within a regulated framework. This directive possibly changes part of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been told by certain major agencies, some of the largest operating in the European Union, that they do not oppose a regulation, which is not what the Confederation of British Industry and others would have us believe. But some of the difficulties raised we found difficult to credit. Some of the agencies have told us that they cannot compare the work done by their staff with that of the end-user company's staff as their agency staff do unique work which is highly skilled and is on a project basis. So, I found myself wondering on what basis, then, is the pay rate set at which the agency charges the end-user company? What percentage of that income is then paid to the worker? They cannot be working in a vacuum. Internal pay rates, some have told us, are confidential. Well, how then do reputable companies perform transparent audits on equal pay for equal work?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that good agencies have nothing to fear from this directive. We would like to think that those who should be worrying are the disreputable ones who exploit the poorly-skilled, or people in areas of high unemployment who have little choice as to who they work for and under which conditions. These include cleaning agencies who employ shifts of temporary night workers and then pay them at training rates for longer than necessary, and companies who effectively employ long-term agency workers at lower rates of pay than permanent staff, and who replace paid staff who leave with agency workers because they can lay them off much more easily and with poorer conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">For some strange reason, those agencies have not lobbied us. We need to ensure that we protect the rights of workers who do not have choices and whose agents know that they can exploit that weakness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, as was said on a number of occasions in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we are starting with a flawed proposal. It is flawed because we have moved away from the social dialogue and social partnership model where there was agreement between both sides of industry before a proposal came before this Parliament. This has put us all in a very difficult position, because we who are supporters of social dialogue, of protecting the rights of workers and of increasing the opportunities for employment of all the peoples in Europe want to ensure the best possible conditions for those most in need.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst I have no difficulty with the general tenor or the general intent of this directive, a number of facts have to be recognised before we give greater protection to those who are in temporary work contracts under the aegis of agencies. Firstly, there are various pieces of national legislation which already protect workers and this is merely duplicating or replicating what is already in place. Secondly, we have different types of employment systems in each Member State and a 'one size fits all' approach will not necessarily work. Thirdly, temporary workers work temporarily by choice and sometimes they can earn more money as temporary workers in an agency capacity. Fourthly, there is no provision in the Treaties and no place in this Parliament, the Council or the Commission for laying down conditions relating to workers' pay – that is still exclusively a matter for the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point is on the question of the six-week period. There are amendments tabled for this to be extended to a one-year period. This is far more sensible and practical from the point of view of protecting all workers' rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it could be improved, and I think it was partly improved and clarified by Parliament when it was voted on in committee; I hope it can be further improved tomorrow when the House votes on it.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to add much, or even anything, to the opinion already expressed in the debate by the Commissioner and so many other Members on the question of temporary work. Such work has made it possible to try out necessary and opportune kinds of flexible working, in some cases it has allowed workers to achieve their own plans in life, and it has provided greater opportunities to enter the labour market, which is essentially the main issue here.</p>
<p class="contents">At this juncture, on the basis of the experience gained so far, we needed to raise the thresholds for certain minimum levels of compulsory protection and to uphold the principle of non-discrimination. I reject the argument put forward by some regarding the desire to impose a straitjacket on pay issues from above: no one can specify a Europe-wide level of pay that will be valid in all Member States. The principle to be upheld was that of non-discrimination, and that has been done, but even more can be done if, as I hope, certain proposed amendments are adopted by this House, without imposing a single model or, much less, denying the direct role of agencies in the three-way relationship that characterises this type of work.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want a one-dimensional Europe but rather a Europe that can retain features that give meaning to a Community model and a Community commitment, which, when necessary, stop us from throwing out the baby with the bath water or, worse still, from running the risk of throwing out the baby and keeping the bath water. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The German legislation formerly in force was certainly not as simple as has been claimed here, and the public, whether they were employers or employed, did not accept it.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me list just some of the peculiarities in the German restrictions: the ban on 'synchronisation', limitation to twelve months, a ban on fixed-term employment, and a ban in the construction industry. This is why I think that the German Government and parliament have taken a very courageous and significant step by already incorporating the European directive currently being debated into the qualitative improvements for Germany. It was unacceptable for workers in Germany to be earning up to 40% less than the permanent staff. No wonder the industry as a whole has such an appalling image. This is precisely what we are trying to change. What is interesting, however, is that temporary work is most readily accepted by society, and is also increasing to the greatest extent in those Member States where the principle of equality applies, namely in France and the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the employers want social acceptance as well. The main reason for using temporary agency workers – as our Foundation in Dublin found out – is not the cost savings incurred, but the option of flexible deployment during seasonal bottlenecks, as a response to personnel fluctuations, and in some cases in the extension of probationary periods. This is exactly what the European directive facilitates, with Mrs van den Burg's amendments. The necessary flexibility is further safeguarded through wage negotiations. Let us adopt this directive tomorrow and send out a clear signal that there really is such a thing as a social Europe! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we are to promote flexible labour markets then we must ensure that those working within them are not put at a disadvantage.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot risk temporary work being used as a way of bypassing normal employment laws rather than, as it should be, a properly regulated means of satisfying employers' short-term needs. It is for this reason that we should not emasculate the proposal by removing pay from the scope of the directive or applying it only to workers in assignments of more than 12 months. That said, I am not convinced that we have yet struck quite the right balance between flexibility and protection.</p>
<p class="contents">There are real difficulties in implementing a fixed-term worker comparative for pay in the case of assignments of a short duration. Accordingly, I urge colleagues to support Amendments Nos 72 and 74 which should overcome this problem. Similarly, I hope for a positive vote on Amendments Nos 71 and 73 which guard against any adverse effects the directives might have in both the shorter and longer terms.</p>

Specifically, in my own country, temporary work agencies – or at least some of these companies – are factories for insecure work. At the moment, in Spain, 33% of this work is insecure, more than double the European average, which stands at 13%.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have difficulties with some of the amendments which my colleague, Ilda Figueiredo, has already mentioned in that they may possibly lead to discrimination. The rapporteur herself, in the explanatory statement, says that she is not very happy with those amendments that jeopardise the principle of non-discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">In the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, although it points out that these companies have contributed to improving the labour market, it is also stated that these companies, in certain countries of the European Union, employ illegal workers, and that they regularly violate the rights of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, as my colleague has already pointed out, if certain amendments mentioned are approved, it will be difficult for us to vote in favour of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Lisbon Council, there was discussion of the quality of work and employment rights.

We have had great difficulty bringing this directive to a successful conclusion. I think that the main point is that the legislation this directive is about is very different in what are very different countries, that temporary work is regulated in a very different way in the different European countries and I would like everyone to recognise that.</p>
<p class="contents">We must nonetheless seek a solution because of the previous history and also because of the fact that we would otherwise be unable to regulate cross-border traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">To move in the direction of the Lisbon process we must develop further the important role that temporary work can play. We have considerable experience of it in the country where I come from. It is currently still the country with the highest percentage of temporary workers and experience shows that you can deregulate, but that you must then take certain statutory measures. That is a fact.</p>
<p class="contents">As each country needs its own balance, the directive must be relatively flexible. Thanks to the work of the rapporteur, but also thanks to the work of the two shadow rapporteurs from the PPE-DE, this has been achieved to a very large extent and I would therefore like to thank all three of them very much. The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has also, I think, made a significant contribution, as has the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, to the achievement of a result. It is very important that there is a result, as I have already said, but there are occasionally some interfering noises. These interfering noises often come from people who are thinking only of their own situation, of their own country. This we must prevent. This we cannot accept.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I would ask the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to take another look at their own amendments. Amendments have been submitted in duplicate or triplicate, and contradictory amendments have also been tabled to the same Paragraph. This is no way to negotiate. We cannot deal with codecision this way. I would like to ask whether they would like to go through their own amendment list one more time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament can debate today, and tomorrow, I hope, it will be able to adopt a report that improves the Commission proposal. It is, as has already been said, a very problematic dossier, because the different countries have very different systems to deal with this matter – they range from situations of all-embracing guarantees to a lack of any kind of protection. I too applaud the Commission’s initiative, which is not a straitjacket restricting autonomy and subsidiarity but comes after 20 years of attempts by employers and workers to reach an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe there are three basic objectives of equality of treatment contained in the proposal: equality of treatment for temporary workers compared with other workers in terms of job security and status; respect for established social standards within the user enterprises, through equal treatment in terms of pay and working conditions of temporary workers and other, comparable workers in the user enterprises; and recognition of the work of agencies supplying temporary workers as a legitimate professional activity, removing unnecessary restrictions, authorisations and prohibitions.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the directive is thus to guarantee and harmonise a common minimum level of protection for temporary workers, without any discrimination. It is a directive that places temporary work within its own part of the labour market, recognising its importance and value without, however, pushing it until it becomes almost the only system for hiring people. I also believe, since Lisbon has been mentioned, that this directive regulates temporary work in a way that brings it qualitatively into line with the Lisbon objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its main aim however is to legitimise the flexibility and fluidity of the labour market. This is in the interest of employers and, in addition, of capitalists who invest in temporary work agencies. This is why the report presents temporary employment as a normal form of working, even though it accentuates exploitation, flexibility and insecurity. Even in a period of high unemployment, temporary employment is never a real choice for workers.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of amendments even ratify the employers’ point of view on the flexibility offered by this form of insecure employment. Clearly, temporary employment makes it possible to dismiss workers overnight, without even being obliged to implement a social plan or pay compensation. In many countries, temporary employment is becoming a normal way of running a business. There are firms where 30, or even 40% of employees are in temporary, insecure jobs on a permanent basis. This has been recognised by the relevant British employers organisation. It reports that there are 1 300 000 temporary workers in Great Britain, and that 10% of these have been in their temporary post for a year or more.</p>
<p class="contents">Temporary workers everywhere should at least benefit, from the first day of their contract, from the same working conditions, pay and holiday entitlements as the staff employed by the company using the temporary workers. However, certain amendments mean that temporary workers would not benefit from these same conditions until they had worked in the company for six weeks, six months or even 12 months. This is intolerable! We shall oppose all European directives and regulations endorsing the unacceptable policy of the employers aimed at worsening employment conditions as a whole and making jobs more insecure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More jobs can provide both. More employment laws like the atypical workers' directive will secure neither. The Commission is trying to impose a straitjacket on something that cannot and does not need to be standardised.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague, Mr Pronk, said a moment ago that he would like everyone to recognise that Member States organise temporary work in different ways. That is absolutely right. I too would like everyone to recognise that, and we want Member States to be able to continue to organise in different ways. The very adjective 'atypical' in the name of this directive says it all.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier in this debate Ms Attwooll said that Amendment No 71, for example, would guard against any adverse effects. That is wishful thinking. This amendment offers some help, but the improvements are marginal and all our temporary workers, recruitment agencies and client companies will be saying the same thing – that we are still left with a directive that could cost the UK alone 160 000 jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">I will address my final remarks to the Commissioner, even though she will probably never speak to me again. Last week the press reported her as saying that the EU had created a net 12 million jobs over the last six years and that the EU' s rigid labour market was not the main problem facing Europe's economy. It is very easy to say that there is no problem or that, if there is, then it is someone else's problem. It is a problem for all of us, but you are, with respect, making it worse. You are proposing the atypical workers' directive which, instead of promoting job flexibility, will help to kill it off.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive has little to do with protecting the rights of temporary workers, certainly in the UK where happily they already enjoy such protection. It is notionally about protecting the jobs of permanent workers by making it more difficult for companies to employ temporary staff.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> yesterday reported on the labour market problems in Germany, describing how reform is being resisted and vested interests are being protected, all under the guise of promoting social justice. The Commission should have the guts to strip away this pretence and withdraw this directive. To encourage it to do so, the UK Conservative delegation will vote against this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The kind of detailed work that is involved in this kind of directive is never adequately appreciated outside of this House. Anyone who has watched the way in which Mrs van den Burg has worked on this directive will appreciate the enormous amount of commitment and expertise that had to be brought to it.</p>
<p class="contents">We are trying to balance flexibility with security for workers who, in many countries, still do not have any security at all. We have been told here that national legislation already exists in Ireland to protect these workers. That is not so. We are told that it is best left to the Member States to deal with these matters. The Irish experience will demonstrate that is not so. There are close to 100 000 agency workers in Ireland. The European Foundation for Living and Working Conditions, based in Dublin, published a study in May showing that there is no guarantee of equal treatment for agency workers in Ireland and that there is virtually no legal protection for agency workers at all in Ireland. That is a study carried out by a foundation funded by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It also points out that Ireland has failed to implement the 1991 Health and Safety Directive covering agency workers. Incidentally, Ireland has also failed to implement the Part-time Workers Directive and is now seriously out of line with the rest of Europe on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is not a good idea to leave these matters in the hands of Member States – and certainly not a good idea to leave it in the hands of the current Irish Government, the ruling party of which Mr Crowley is a member. I would challenge him to back up his statement in this House tonight that there is already adequate protection for Irish workers in this area. There is not adequate protection. There is none. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It shows that the policy of flexible forms of work is alive and kicking, it exacerbates the exploitation of the workers and it confuses the fight of the workers' movement. The fact that all this is happening with the assent of the compromised leaders of the trade union movement and the International Labour Organisation merely demonstrates their destructive role.</p>
<p class="contents">The claim that the directive safeguards and enhances the professional status of working victims, that it improves health and safety and that it increases employment is pure fraud. The truth is that this is a well-organised attempt to step up exploitation and share out unemployment by creating modern slave-trade organisations. Protecting full, stable employment with rights for everyone is always a vital objective but it will only be achieved by stepping up the fight against the monopolies and the anti-labour policy of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the purpose of temporary work agencies, as an instrument for flexibility in the labour market, which reconcile the aspirations of workers with the needs of companies. I believe they are going to provide greater possibilities and opportunities for employment, for accessing the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to comment on the restrictions and prohibitions relating to the use of the temporary provision of workers and, from a doctrinal or theoretical point of view, I would like to say that, where there is permission for contracting workers on a temporary basis, there is no reason to prohibit the contracting of workers provided by agencies. It must only be objective and duly justified – and therefore restrictive – criteria that regulate prohibitions.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would like to stress the need for particularly intense action on the health and safety protection of workers during work and on the health and safety of workers provided by temporary employment agencies. There are various reasons for this: firstly, the temporary nature of the employment itself, which seems to increase risk; secondly, the diversity of the work to be carried out in the different contracting companies; and, perhaps, thirdly, the differing methods and procedures, even for a task or post of an identical nature in different companies.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we should seek different arguments – for example, the voluntary requirement for non-discrimination – which could make a reference to health at work possible, as well as conditions in general and pay, in particular, without regulating them, but making this reference on the basis of support for the principle of non-discrimination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some fellow MEPs have already said that the temporary sector is a very fast growing sector. If we want to ensure that this sector delivers flexibility in the labour market, at the same time delivers quality jobs for the people who work in it and also does not put permanent recruitment under any pressure, then we need sound protection rules, at European level too.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Pronk is right in saying that the systems and the regulations in the different Member States differ. Moreover, some Member States offer considerable protection and this we may certainly not undo. That is why the non-regression clause in the directive is so important. There are, however, also very many Member States that do not offer good protection, Mrs De Rossa made full reference to this. Nor is this a one-size-fits-all directive. There is scope here for various national choices. I would very briefly like to make three comments.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, in connection with what Mr Hughes has just said, for us, it is crucial that temporary workers are protected from day one. That was, Commissioner, a point that I found weak in the Commission’s proposal. You will therefore understand that it is absolutely unacceptable for us to agree to the Liberal amendment that excludes temporary work up to one year. That would make the directive an empty shell.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is important that temporary workers enjoy good employment conditions. I still think that equal treatment is best served by the principle by which, as far as essential employment conditions are concerned, a temporary worker is compared with workers of a user company. However, then of course, we must also ensure that our definition of essential employment conditions is sound. Such a definition without the concept of remuneration? That takes the biscuit. That would completely nullify the principle of equal treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, an exception to the principle of equal treatment is acceptable, but only where the systems concerned provide good guarantees internally in the temporary sector itself, also for the period between two contracts. The countries where this is properly regulated usually guarantee contracts for an indefinite period of time or long contracts. I should like to warn our fellow MEPs from the PPE-DE against stepping onto a slippery slope by reducing these guarantees too much. Commissioner, just like you, I hope that we as legislators will be able to do what the social partners have been unable to do, that is to guarantee all temporary workers throughout the European Union solid social protection. That will then definitely be to the credit of Mrs van den Burg too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This rapid growth is justified because temporary work enables companies to respond better to the need to be flexible and to adapt to the economic climate. The aims of the proposal we are discussing are:</p>
<p class="contents">- to ensure that temporary work is a factor in creating jobs that encourage more stable and longer employment relationships;</p>
<p class="contents">- to guarantee the rights and safety of temporary workers;</p>
<p class="contents">- and to increase flexibility in the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic premise is to extend, at Community level, the principle of non-discrimination between temporary and other workers. The guarantee of minimum rights will make this sector more attractive and give it a better reputation, bringing to an end the prejudice against it that still exists.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is balanced and represents a step forwards from the proposal for a directive presented by the Commission and I therefore thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs from my own group for their contributions to it. This balance is reflected particularly in the definition of minimum Community requirements, leaving it to the Member States and the social partners to adapt these to the specific situation in their respective countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Other issues have been taken into account and rightly so, such as the guarantee of basic protection, the opportunity for women to reconcile family life with professional life and the integration into the market of young people and individuals with fewer qualifications. I should like to point out that, in Portugal, Article 4 is the provision that could cause the most problems: in fact, current national legislation contains a restrictive set of arrangements on this type of work in order to ensure that it is used only to serve employers’ occasional needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to have seen the social partners at European level solving this issue, so that we would have been able to achieve a directive this way. The employers did not want this, however. That was the reason, Mr Crowley.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore thank the Commission for the fact that a good proposal has been tabled. This sector is becoming increasingly large, as many people have already pointed out. It is also a transboundary issue. In addition, the issue concerns an atypical form of work, which is why it is appropriate for us to adopt a directive establishing minimum requirements, especially bearing in mind enlargement. We must not create a Union only for capital – the Union must also be for its citizens. That is actually what it is all about.</p>
<p class="contents">I heard Mrs Lynne say that this is also a problem for Sweden. As a Swedish Social Democrat, I disagree. This information must come from incorrect sources. We have agreements in Sweden in this area, which will continue to be applicable in the future. This is clear from Mrs van den Burg’s proposal. Naturally, the most important term of employment, pay, must be addressed. This is a case of discrimination regarding pay. This issue has already arisen in conjunction with the Part-time work Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I also dislike the idea of a six-week period, for this would allow shorter assignments, which only encourages cheating. The provisions should therefore apply from the first day. I also do not in fact like the idea of transition periods, but I accept them as a political necessity in order to get this through.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say something about the members of the Swedish Moderate Party who will soon be speaking here. They are increasingly allying themselves with the Eurosceptic Tory Party. They talk all the time solely about the rights of companies and never about the rights of employees. Company rights at European level and employee rights at national level – that paves the way for social dumping. It is then no longer a matter of social cohesion. Instead, a society and a Europe of conflicts is created. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With talks having broken down, it has run with the views of one side, namely the EU trade union, ETUC, and has largely ignored the EU employers' body, UNICE. If social dialogue is to work, then there needs to be a more balanced approach to social measures, particularly in line with commitments on labour market flexibility in the context of the Lisbon competitive process.</p>
<p class="contents">The definition in Article 3 of a comparable worker will cause major difficulties, and by adopting a user comparison agency workers will find their conditions of employment varying depending on where they are assigned.</p>
<p class="contents">In Article 4 the inclusion of a limitation on the use of temporary work runs counter to employment policy at EU level and there is no economic or social justification for it. It could even constitute gender discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to Article 5, the reference to 'essential' employment conditions is unclear and has no precedent in EU law. The Commission has departed from normal practice and the wording used in previous social dialogue agreements should be the template, rather than the views of only one social partner. The same applies to Article 6 and the matters governed by points 6.2 and 6.3. These should be left to the discretion of Member States. Point 6.4 in Article 7 reflects a poor understanding of employment and commercial relationships.</p>
<p class="contents">The reference to 'sanctions' in Article 12 again departs from previous approaches and social dialogue agreements, and should be dealt with at Member State level, in line with national industrial relations practices.</p>
<p class="contents">It is inappropriate to include reference to pay as an aspect of basic working conditions, given the limitation imposed by Article 137(6) of the Treaty. Six weeks is far too short a period to decide whether a temporary agency worker should be made permanent or not. All workers have a probationary period. Ireland is behind in transposing EU law in this area but we have true social dialogue and a comprehensive body of national law where there is a general qualifying period of 12 months' continuous service for entitlement to rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the approach of this directive is an example of where an idea in theory has not been thought through in practical terms, both from a temporary employee's perspective and that of an employer. My congratulations to our rapporteur, to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities for their amendments. We need them, without them this would be inoperable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Amendment No 87 gives Member States the right, wherever derogations are allowed, to pass laws allowing new derogations and, more to the point, the same working conditions as those which would apply to a comparable temporary agency worker.

The recruitment difficulties of companies are solved to an increasing extent by taking on staff from temporary work agencies. Immigrants often gain excellent opportunities to get a foothold in the labour market through these companies. It is therefore important to encourage and facilitate the activities of temporary work agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard here that legislation regulating temporary work agencies varies greatly from Member State to Member State. It is therefore difficult to create even framework legislation which takes into account all the differences. The political starting points for the proposal for a directive are to view work done for temporary work agencies as a variation on temporary employment, and to prevent what has come to be known as social dumping. The problems with framework legislation at European level are clear when one looks at Sweden. Here, the political starting points are not reflected in the actual conditions. In Sweden, permanent employment is the rule. Around 70%of those employed through temporary work agencies are on permanent contracts. Terms and conditions of employment are regulated by collective agreements for both permanent and temporary employees.</p>
<p class="contents">The salary of white-collar workers is set individually and separately, which means that no pay comparisons can be made. Blue-collar workers have collective agreements guaranteeing that pay will not fall below the pay in the user undertaking and that the working hours of the user undertaking will apply. This is not regulated in law, however, but through negotiations between the social partners, as should continue to happen in the future. This is why we do not believe that pay should be included in the directive’s definition of terms and conditions of employment. Nor should comparisons of pay and terms and conditions of employment be regulated in the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The temporary work agency sector functions well in Sweden and could be a model for Europe. There you are, Mr Andersson. However, the proposal before us does not facilitate development of this sector in Europe. Europe needs more forms of employment, not fewer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to go further and say that strenuous efforts were made to understand the situation in some of the highest concentrations of agency workers anywhere in the European Union. For example, in my own region of London we have cleaners, nurses, IT specialists and now, crucially, manufacturing workers, many of whom Mr Harbour would have been referring to earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation now is a classic contrast between flexibility and protection. There is a need to understand the situation in countries where there is a less-developed temporary agency worker regulation. That is why I welcome amendments like Amendment No 71, through the efforts of the rapporteurs and others to understand that situation. We are not at extremes in this area. We are in a situation where there is evidence that those vulnerable workers looking to us for protection require that protection and good agency employers require growth and flexibility. It is a balance which should be struck. We want to find that balance. As Mr Hughes said, we are at the beginning of that process. Let us shape a directive that strikes that vital balance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For many years now Europe has clearly not managed to fulfil its aim to become the world’s most competitive economic area. Unfortunately, this proposal for a directive on temporary agency work will take us even further away from our objective. The Lisbon targets bind us to a more flexible labour market than before. Increased bureaucracy and interference in contracts between companies will constrain the labour market. Do we not want supply to meet demand?</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Treaty of Rome the EU has aspired to the creation of a dynamic Internal Market. The Member States take care of the social consequences of that by taking account of the interests of employees in the way they themselves consider best. This lies at the heart of the principle of subsidiarity. It is not the EU’s job to regulate sectors that do not require intervention at EU level. For historical reasons there are big differences between the labour market systems in Member States. One rigid solution in this sector will not suit everyone. If things have not been dealt with properly in Ireland, it does not mean that this directive should be employed to complicate things in Finland, where they have.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive’s implementation will clearly worsen the general situation regarding temporary agency work in Finland. It would appear that, once again, no thorough cost-benefit analyses have been carried out. The results will ultimately be reflected in growing unemployment and weakening competitiveness. The committee’s decision to allow employment agencies to receive reasonable costs, however, is an improvement on the poor proposal put forward by the Commission. Refusing to pay such costs would lead to the work of the agencies discontinuing.</p>
<p class="contents">Temporary employment agencies offer a flexible solution in the way they fill vacancies promptly and speedily in sectors suffering from a shortage of manpower. Under no circumstances should we make conditions worse for them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, several honourable Members raised the question of subsidiarity. There is a whole body of evidence on subsidiarity; I should just like to make one very important point. At a time when national markets are fast turning into European markets and we are on the threshold of enlargement, highly diverse labour legislation and differing rights from one country to another are obviously creating distortions on the internal market. So there is clearly a need, just as in all other sectors of labour legislation, for a common, flexible framework.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment concerns whether we evaluated the repercussions of this directive. May I remind you that this directive will apply to 1.5%-2% of workers in Europe. But what is important politically is that this sector is mushrooming and workers' rights are being distorted left, right and centre, which is why we need to be pro-active and regulate it as quickly as possible within – I repeat – a general framework.</p>
<p class="contents">We have taken account and I would ask you to examine the study – available to any Member who is interested – which was carried out by the CIETT, the <span class="italic">Confédération Internationale des Entreprises de Travail Temporaire</span>. The companies themselves clearly conclude in this study that employment legislation is needed in order to resolve the problems which generally arise on the questions of pay and working conditions and underpin the development of this sector, which has a very bad press in numerous countries. There is a clear reference to the Netherlands and the Dutch model, a model which has managed to combine flexibility with social insurance and protection for workers in a country in which some of the biggest and most successful temporary employment agencies are to be found.</p>
<p class="contents">Serious concerns were expressed about the model getting tied up in red tape. I would say they are completely unfounded. The legislation does not introduce any new procedures for recruiting or transferring workers and each country keeps its present system. Flexibility, at least as we interpret it in Europe, means a set of policies and practices to help the company, the worker, the public sector and the law to adapt to new production requirements. Flexibility must not be interpreted as meaning fewer or no rights as a prerequisite to job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">Specific references were made to Great Britain, to the effect that jobs will be cut etc. All that will happen in that particular country is that there may be a small increase in labour costs due to the minimum social rights granted to workers on the British job market.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like if I may, Mr President, to comment on specific amendments in order to give the Commission's position. There are two types of amendment. The first type clarifies the proposal and adds a number of definitions. The second type amends the proposal materially by adding or deleting certain important provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the first type is concerned, I welcome the proposed new title. I think it conveys the objective of the directive much better.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the amendment designed to convey more fully the triangular relationship between worker, agency and user undertaking innate in temporary employment. We support the amendments that redefine temporary agency work, the user company and the temporary work agency.</p>
<p class="contents">We also accept the amendments that clarify the text. The definition proposed for the term ‘assignment ‘ is far more accurate.</p>
<p class="contents">The new wording for the group of workers that Member States cannot exclude from the scope of the directive is a vast improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the addendum specifying the means to be used to inform employees about any vacant posts in the user undertaking. I also think it is helpful to state that agencies may receive a reasonable level of recompense for services provided to user undertakings but that agencies must not charge workers a fee if they enter into a permanent contract of employment with the user company at the end of their assignment.</p>
<p class="contents">I accept the amendment rewording the reference to social services more clearly. I also welcome the reference to collective agreements and worker representation because worker representation can indeed be set out in collective agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the amendment requiring the Member States to ensure that both workers and their representatives are equipped to press the provisions of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to material amendments to the directive, which add or delete certain important provisions. I shall deal first with the amendments that are acceptable and then with the amendments that are not.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the amendment extending the scope for lifting restrictions and prohibitions on temporary agency work. This scope was very restricted in the proposal for a directive, because it only applied to restrictions or prohibitions on certain groups of workers or certain sectors. And of course, I accept the spirit of the amendment designed to ensure that temporary agency workers are not used to replace workers taking part in collective action such as strikes and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think the principle of non-discrimination has been cleverly reworded; I think it is clearer and easier to focus on the working conditions which temporary workers would enjoy were they employed directly by the user company. I can allow the exemption for permanent contracts to be restricted solely to pay but I cannot allow this derogation to be extended to fixed-term contracts. Nor can I allow the 6-week period which allows temporary agency workers to be used in certain countries for a very short space of time for work of minor importance to be deleted. This is a factor which will help significantly in the overall negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, I accept Amendments Nos 1, 4, 22, 28, 33, 43, 46, 47, 48, 51, 52, 85 and 92 in full. I accept Amendments Nos 6, 15, 16, 20, 23, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 38, 40, 44 and 49 in part or in spirit, if they are reworded. The remaining amendments are rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank you all for helping to bring about a new text which will facilitate the final acceptance of the directive, what is without doubt a politically and technically complicated directive. May I again congratulate Mrs van den Burg and urge the Danish presidency to take whatever action is needed in order to reach agreement at the Council on 3 December. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
