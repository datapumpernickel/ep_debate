<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lipponen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the European Council. </span>–<span class="italic"> (FI) </span>Madam President, Members of the European Parliament, I am very happy to be able to appear before you and speak for the first time in the European Parliament as Finland’s Prime Minister. I wish to congratulate you on your election and wish the new Parliament every success in its work. When we met recently, the President and I pointed out that we have a new Parliament, a new Commission, a new start and, above all, a new President, meaning that the new institutional arrangement is now, on the whole, a better one.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the President for the views of Parliament that you presented at the European Council in Tampere, when it began its work. I believe that the decisions taken at Tampere correspond well with the expectations that Parliament had of the meeting there. The European Council has approved both the policy guidelines and the practical action to help the Union become an area of freedom, security and justice, within the meaning of the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">The results we achieved at Tampere can, in my opinion, be regarded as successful in many regards in terms of the expectations of the public and the development of the Union. Obviously, expectations cannot always be fulfilled in all respects, but it is good to be able to say that the NGOs, such as the European Council on Refugees and Exiles, have praised the results achieved at Tampere. Sadako Ogata, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, told me on the telephone, after the meeting, how satisfied the UNHCR is with the outcome of the meeting. I assured her that we would continue on a path of good cooperation with the UNHCR in the implementation of the decisions as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The meeting at Tampere was, for many reasons, important for the Union. The European Council sped up the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam, making it a concrete reality. At Tampere, justice and home affairs were raised to the highest political level in cooperation with the Union. The meeting took an important step forward towards closer cooperation among the Member States, and it was decided to break down the barriers to cooperation between the police and judicial authorities. The Member States of the Union showed determination in bringing the work of the Union closer to the people by tackling commonly shared concerns and deficiencies in Union cooperation. At Tampere, the Union strengthened the basis for cooperation in justice and home affairs, of which a respect for the principles of human rights agreements, civil freedoms and rule of law are an essential part.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council called its results the ten milestones, and I will briefly consider them here.</p>
<p class="contents">At Tampere a step was taken in the direction of a common Union policy on immigration and asylum. The European Council emphasised the consideration that asylum and immigration issues are separate, but are still close to one another. The first milestone for Tampere is the creation of a comprehensive policy for the union on questions of immigration and asylum. What is most important is to have an influence on the reasons behind emigration through contact with the countries concerned. The European Council meeting welcomed the work the high level taskforce has done to draft action plans for influencing reasons for emigration. This work requires a wide-ranging assortment of Union foreign policy and policy on development cooperation, human rights and trade, and the prevention of conflicts. The taskforce’s mandate was extended to the drafting of new action plans.</p>
<p class="contents">We decided to strive towards a common European policy on the asylum system. This decision is, I believe, one of the most important of the breakthroughs at Tampere. The European Council adopted a very strong position in support of the right to asylum by committing to a full and comprehensive interpretation of the Geneva Convention regarding the European asylum policy. The principle of <span class="italic">non-refoulement</span>, according to which no one may be sent back into a situation where they might suffer persecution, was again reinforced separately.</p>
<p class="contents">Building a common system will obviously take time. The Commission is being asked, however, to draft within one year an announcement on the creation of a common asylum procedure and on a common status for those granted asylum throughout the Union. With the implementation of the decisions taken at Tampere we can decisively improve the way the asylum system works, as well as standards of fairness, in Europe. An important achievement at Tampere was setting an objective whereby those who have migrated into the Union legally must have rights and obligations comparable with those of Union citizens. The legal position in particular of those who have resided in the Union for a longer period of time must be improved, for example, by guaranteeing the right to stay, the right to education and work, and the right to practice a profession.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union must also defend its most important values against intolerance and discrimination. This must be something that is today regarded as being very important in the European Parliament as well. The European Council emphasises the importance of more effective action to combat racism and xenophobia, and urges Member States to draft national programmes for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">Important decisions were taken concerning the control of mass immigration. It was decided to take measures to combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings. There will be tougher penalties for those engaged in human trafficking and other forms of financial exploitation of immigrants, and the Member States will work in closer cooperation with Europol to counter the work of crime networks. I would like to stress here that, at the same time, we must safeguard the rights of the victims of crime and, in particular, the position of women and children. Border control cooperation, both among the Member States and in cooperation with the applicant countries, will improve through, inter alia, exchange programmes and the transfer of technology. In this connection, the importance of the Schengen Convention and the professional control of the external borders are being emphasised in an expanding Union. </p>
<p class="contents">It was also agreed at Tampere to embark on practical action that would allow us to build a European area of justice. We decided to create an on-going information system that would be up-to-date and easy to use, enabling the public to obtain information about other Member States’ legal systems. The Union is to adopt, on the basis of the Commission’s proposal, minimum standards, thereby ensuring there is proper legal aid available in cross-border situations. We similarly decided to simplify and speed up legal proceedings relating to consumer, commercial and maintenance demands of slight monetary value. The position of the victims of crime will improve with the adoption of minimum standards for the protection of the victims of crime, especially with regard to legal protection and the right to receive damages.</p>
<p class="contents">After a thorough debate on the issue, the Council of Europe approved the mutual recognition of sentences and judicial decisions as a keystone in the development of an area of justice. I consider it an excellent achievement that the principle of mutual recognition was endorsed as a basis for both private law and criminal cases.</p>
<p class="contents">An important milestone at Tampere was reached when it was decided to continue with the convergence of civil law and civil process law, for better cooperation and legal protection.</p>
<p class="contents">At Tampere, joint action to make the prevention of crime more effective within the Union was thoroughly discussed. The European Council was unanimous in its verdict that persons and organisations that abuse freedoms and violate citizens’ rights within the territory of the Union have to be brought under better control and be held responsible for their deeds, through closer cooperation between the authorities. It was agreed that the key to fighting crime was better prevention of crime. The Member States will draft national crime prevention programmes and establish their mutual cooperation and a comparison of best practice. The European Council called for a study into the possibility of financing a programme from Community funds, the primary focus of which would be youth, urban and drugs-related crime, which have been found to be the fastest growing areas of crime in many countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The decisions taken at Tampere will enhance cooperation in Europe between the police and the judicial authorities. The European Council decided that joint investigative groups should be set up to counter, initially, trafficking in drugs and humans, as well as terrorism. A top-level European taskforce would exchange experiences and aid the planning of operations together with Europol. Europol should also be given powers to request Member States to commence, perform and coordinate investigations.</p>
<p class="contents">Action to combat organised crime will also be reinforced with the establishment of a new body – Eurojust. Member States, depending on their legal systems, will send state prosecutors, examining magistrates and police officers with similar powers to join this unit. In this way we can see to it that Europol’s criminal investigations lead to criminals being convicted and sentenced more effectively. A European police academy will be established to train higher-ranking legal officials. This will also be open to officials from states applying for membership.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council also decided to embark on a programme of legislative convergence in certain areas of national criminal law. The purpose is to agree common definitions of crimes, and agree on prosecution and legal consequences. This work will initially focus on certain forms of serious cross-border crime such as fraud, trafficking in drugs and human beings – especially the exploitation of women – the sexual abuse of children, high technology crime and environmental crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the last milestone I have to mention, which I regard as being very important among the decisions taken at Tampere is special action to combat money laundering. The importance of this action is underlined by the fact that money laundering has a major role to play in organised crime, and it is closely connected with areas such as trafficking in drugs and human beings, and the illegal trade in weapons. I especially want to raise the point that the legal authorities and centres of investigation into money-laundering will be given the right to acquire information, regardless of bank regulations or business secrecy rules, when the information is necessary to conduct an investigation into money laundering. Europol’s powers will be extended to money laundering in general, regardless of what type of crime the laundered funds derive from. Member States will try to reach a coherent and comprehensive definition of the scope of criminal activity that would constitute a so-called originating crime with regard to money laundering.</p>
<p class="contents">The targets set for cooperation in justice and home affairs can be realised only through comprehensive action. That is why the European Council has approved the political guidelines regarding how the Union’s external action must be strengthened in order to achieve the targets for justice and home affairs. The results achieved in cooperation with the Baltic Countries are an example of practical regional action to combat organised crime. Special attention was paid at Tampere to closer cooperation with the Balkans region.</p>
<p class="contents">Implementing the decisions taken at Tampere will begin immediately, but it will obviously take time. Monitoring will be carried out using a method that proved beneficial in the creation of the single market. The Commission is drafting a proposal for a scoreboard to monitor the implementation of decisions and adherence to timetables. A thorough survey of achievements will be undertaken in the European Council during the Belgian Presidency in December 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, if you will allow me I will briefly present the most important aims we still wish to achieve during the Finnish Presidency. </p>
<p class="contents">The most important decision taken at the European Council at Helsinki will affect the future of the whole of Europe. At Tampere, I became increasingly convinced that Member States have a very converging opinion of how Union enlargement should be taken forward. The political impetus behind the process that has begun must not be lost. Finland, as the country holding the presidency, wishes to ensure that all applicant countries are encouraged and supported equally in their efforts to meet the criteria for membership. Each applicant country must progress on the basis of their individual conditions. We wish to ensure that the better-prepared states can move forward in negotiations faster than the others.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to point out to the applicant countries that the membership criteria set at Copenhagen must be met before membership is possible. I am convinced that, on the basis of the proposals announced by the Commission on 13 October, it will be possible to take decisions at Helsinki that will be based on a comprehensive, credible and consistent policy. This is vital to ensure that the enlargement process has a positive impact on European stability.</p>
<p class="contents">But the Union must also reform. I discussed this with the President this morning. The process by which we try to strengthen Europe cannot be allowed to weaken decision-making in the institutions of the Union and, hence, the Union’s capacity for action. I will be presenting a report to the European Council in Helsinki on necessary institutional reforms, which are due to be approved in an Intergovernmental Conference to be held in 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">The Finnish Presidency will comply with the European Council mandate, which means preparing a brief agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference. Over the next few years, however, we require a broader debate within the Union on what sort of European Union we actually need, in order to be able to respond better to the challenges that lie ahead. I do not wish, in this connection, to estimate when the Member States will be ready to take steps in a more ambitious direction and amend the Treaties for the further development of the Union. Hurrying the matter is not necessarily of any benefit, but the need for more thorough reform is growing, both with enlargement and the changes in the world outside the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of a common security and defence policy and the Union’s readiness to respond to crises is one of our most important objectives. The Union has the potential to develop into a strong global player, as it has at its disposal a vast range of political and financial instruments and resources. A common foreign and security policy is presently being reinforced through common strategies. In order to become a credible player in maintaining peace and stability, the Union also needs a civil and military capacity for crisis management. The report that we will present at the European Council in Helsinki discusses an approach to integrate both civil and military means to solve conflict situations. We would like to achieve real progress in the development of security and defence policy and take prompt and decisive steps forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have to say that we, as the country to hold the presidency, wish to improve effectiveness and transparency in the work of the Union. This is a key question when securing the confidence of the people in the work of the Union. During our presidential term we have started to reform the work of the Council. We have improved transparency in its work and access to documents, and we are announcing meeting schedules for the Council and working parties, and agendas for meetings of the Council. A debate on other proposals for reforms to increase transparency is presently under way. The Commission may still issue during the Finnish presidential term a proposal as required under Article 255 for rules on transparency. I hope that we can, in this way too, leave a permanent imprint of our presidency on the work of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I await with interest the opportunity to enter into discussions with the Members of Parliament.</p>

The Commission, on the basis of dialogue and cooperation with the European Parliament, is prepared to do everything necessary in order to create an area of freedom, security and justice which, above all, achieves balance between its three components: freedom, security and justice. </p>
<p class="contents">The letter that President Romano Prodi wrote to the European Council highlighted our main concern which was that Tampere should not be a restrictive summit. This objective was achieved. The Commission is particularly pleased with this fact. And I would like to emphasise that the steadfast affirmation of the untouchable nature of the Geneva Convention as a basis for constructing a European asylum policy is something that merits our backing and applause. </p>
<p class="contents">We are pleased with the commitment given at the highest level to working in partnership with countries of origin and transit countries in confronting immigration issues. We are pleased with the far greater emphasis given to fighting the trade in human beings than to action against its victims in relation to illegal immigration. The Commission backs the clear affirmation of the importance of prevention in the fight against crime, whether it is financial crime, crime in the cities or juvenile crime, and notes that its efforts to give special prominence to the rights of victims of criminal activity have been recognised. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees with the proactive view of the establishment of a European concept of access to justice as an instrument for people to exercise their right to free movement without obstacles of a legal or administrative nature. It is also necessary that this right to free circulation should now be accompanied by the legislative measures which are necessary for us to be able to achieve it as quickly as possible. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is pleased with the establishment of the principle of harmonising, as fully as possible, the rights of citizens originally from third countries, but who have lived for a long time in the Union, with the rights and duties granted to citizens who are nationals of the Union’s Member States. We realise that we will have to move forward with specific proposals in this area. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission would like to single out the establishment of the clear priority given to fighting racism, xenophobia, and all forms of discrimination, which are laid down in Article 13 of the Treaty, as being a very positive move. </p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the Tampere conclusions tackle, in an appropriate way, the strengthening of cooperation between police forces and between judicial authorities in order to protect and preserve the freedoms of Europe’s citizens. The conclusions do this in a way which is necessary in order to respond to citizens’ legitimate concerns about security and about the judicial guarantee of their rights, as is fitting in a Union which claims to be founded on the principle of the prevalence of rights and of the law. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight, in this regard, the principle of mutual recognition of decisions and sentences, which all Member States should contribute to by adopting common definitions and penalties against certain criminal activities which transcend borders,. This would cover areas such as organised crime, illegal drug trafficking, the trade in human beings, or crimes against children. I would also like to highlight the establishment of the EUROJUST network which is, without any doubt, the beginning of the construction of a European Judicial system which will be an instrument of support and monitoring for EUROPOL’s actions in guaranteeing security within the Union and which will also be an instrument for protecting the rights of European citizens. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is looking at its own role and proposes to act by responding to the ambitious action plan for fighting money-laundering, which involves changes both in the Union’s position towards the rest of the world, and also at the level of legislation in each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Madam President, Tampere did not fully meet all of the Commission’s expectations. Without wishing to criticise the positive results which, to a large extent, have just been highlighted by the President-in-Office of the Council, I cannot help admitting that on some points, the Commission is rather disappointed. The Commission regrets that the European Council has not accepted the idea of a single asylum system which represents, as we see it, something to aim for, but also the urgent necessity of dealing with asylum issues in a collective and coherent way. The Commission will not stop making proposals which will allow us to dispel any possible fears that a centralised asylum system may bring about in some Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, I regret the fact that some Member States were reluctant to support the idea of a European refugee fund, even though the Commission made it clear that this fund would not involve any new or additional expenditure. The lessons drawn from Bosnia and Kosovo reinforce our conviction that it is crucial to persist in explaining our aims, which we hope will happen before the end of the current year, specifically in the context of preparing the 2000 budget. </p>
<p class="contents">Tampere did not allow the idea of a European Public Prosecutor to be adopted yet, even one who would be limited to protecting the Community’s financial interests. I would like to suggest that the next debate on the Intergovernmental Conference might be a good opportunity to take up this idea of ours once again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">An event like Tampere, with the expectations which precede it, can sometimes appear to be an end in itself. It is only the beginning of a process. The Commission believes, however, that Tampere sent out the right message to many different audiences: to our citizens, first of all, that a subject high on their personal agenda is also rising quickly to the top of the Union’s political agenda; to national administrations that there is no turning back and that their own heads of government are committed to making the improvements, including the institutional improvements of the Amsterdam Treaty, work properly; to the criminal world, that the Union is mobilising all its potential to counter their activities which threaten our freedom and our well-being, if not our own democratic regimes; finally, to the outside world, that an internally secure Union does not mean a fortress Union and that our commitments to those in need of protection are sacred. That is not a bad start.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an enormous task ahead, not least for the Commission, to whom the European Council entrusted numerous tasks, thus showing a gratifying confidence in us. With the help and cooperation of Parliament and the necessary resources to do the job I am confident that we will be able to play the part that has been allocated to us by Tampere.</p>
<p class="contents">We certainly plan to begin by working on how to create the scoreboard requested of us as a way of keeping up the pressure on ourselves, in the first instance, but also on others, as well as ensuring that everything takes place with the fullest possible transparency in the very near future.</p>
<p class="contents">If either you, in Parliament, or we, in the Commission, see any signs of back-sliding we will not hesitate to remind heads of state and government of their message from Tampere. When I say “their message from Tampere”, it is not only the message in the letter of Tampere but also what we could call the spirit of Tampere.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Suominen (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FI) </span>Madam President, Prime Minister Lipponen, I agree with the view that the European Council meeting at Tampere may be considered a historic occasion for the reason that, for the first time, the Council discussed the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice in the discussion, and put it at the top of the agenda. The issues discussed have great importance in the everyday lives of ordinary people and for companies as well. The Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats finds that progress has been made in part, although we are also disappointed with how short the steps are that have been taken. </p>
<p class="contents">The major decision in the creation of the European area of justice was to make the mutual recognition of judicial decisions and sentences the foundation stone for legal cooperation within the Union, both in matters of civil and criminal law. A precondition for the continued support, by the people, of the principle of free movement, is that there needs to be better opportunities to obtain justice within the whole area of the Union. Improvement in police cooperation in practice and growing support for Europol will boost the investigation and prevention of crime. In this connection our group would like to say that legal cooperation must, however, lead the way for cooperation, and it is with satisfaction that it welcomes the cooperation of prosecuting authorities in the Eurojust scheme. We are nevertheless disappointed that the decisions of Tampere do not mention a European public prosecutor, whose field ought to have covered the fraudulent dealings behind the Community budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group agrees with the view of the Council that the Union and its Member States strengthen transparency of the Union through personal, cultural, political and economic relations with the rest of the world. This also relates to the fact that the right to seek asylum should be fully respected. We hope that the Council, with its decisions to ultimately create a common asylum-seeking process and a common status for those who have received asylum throughout the Union, has opened up the way for Europe to become a united area in matters of asylum and refugees. The meeting in Tampere did not take us quite that far; the resolutions merely refer to a common area.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group will use its opportunities to influence the Community budget for the creation of a basis for a European refugee fund. This is a matter that was only mentioned in the Council’s decisions, in which the Commission was urged to explore the possibility of considering some sort of reserve fund for situations where large groups of refugees are applying for temporary protection. The Council’s decisions contain no mention of how the financial burden caused by refugees and asylum seekers should be shared within the Union. Although the States of the Union now want to decide themselves ultimately who can settle in their territory, the longer-term aim must be a coherent policy and consequential share of costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group welcomes with satisfaction the composition of the institutional assembly that will work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, believing that the strong parliamentarian dimension contained within it reflects the democratic implementation of EU development better than a conventional Intergovernmental Conference. We shall participate fully in the work of this institution.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, President-in-Office of the European Council, although I have made a few critical remarks, we consider the results of the Tampere meeting to be important, and our criticisms are targeted at the fact that the Council should aspire, in future, to yet more ambitious Community objectives. The decisions are, however, just words on paper. Now, we believe, it is important that the Council and the Commission attend to the implementation of the resolutions quickly. When the resolutions are passed back down from on high to the plain greyness of the Councils of the Ministers of the Interior and Justice, they also become run-of-the mill and nothing more happens for three or four years, Tampere will remain in history as the forum of unrealised declarations. This is what will happen, although the Council has borrowed a good idea from the world of business, the scoreboard, the actual term being a perfectly balanced scorecard. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, keep the momentum up.</p>

This demonstrates that we are not only building a Union based on freedom for goods, services and capital, but also one which will respond to the question of the freedom of settlement and movement of European citizens. A step forward has been taken with regard to the fourth liberty of the Treaty of Rome: the access to justice beyond national boundaries, thanks to the mutual recognition of sentences, the possibility of fighting organised crime and money-laundering beyond national boundaries.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore there is another important dimension, Madam President, and that is that we are now on the eve of a new wave of enlargement, as the President-in-Office of the Council has said, and we are also witnessing a series of election results which are a clear warning for all of us that certain xenophobic and racist attitudes are arising within the populations of some of our countries. Therefore, it is very important, at the moment, that we are capable of sending a message of freedom and progress in the face of this type of defensive reaction which demonstrates that not everything has yet been consolidated.</p>
<p class="contents">And this is especially important in relation to two issues. The first is asylum. I believe that this is one of the basic freedoms which we have to defend, and to this end, a single system of asylum is very important, and I say this from the point of view of somebody who comes from a country in which political asylum saved the lives of many of those who fought for freedom and allowed them to continue to live in other European countries. The second is immigration. We have to strive, depending on our own particular situations, for legal immigrants to have the same rights, together with a policy of co-development which will prevent the kind of out-of-hand immigration which we have been witnessing for a long time. And to this end, we believe that this is the way to tackle the issue afresh and we also support – as the Parliament’s initiative demonstrates – the creation of a refugee fund, which we believe may be a key element.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Madam President, we understand that the Commission has repeated what it did with regard to the internal market, the scoreboard system and the emulation system. This is positive. We still advocate that there should be a public prosecutor to fight fraud at a Community level. Finally, I am grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council for being here today. I regret that the presence of the Council in the Committees of this Parliament has not been too frequent, because that would have helped us to debate and get to know each other better so that we could have moved forward together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We will look back in amazement at how much more progress Europe made on cutting red tape on goods and businesses than it did on people. This must now change quickly. But Parliament is not yet a full partner and that must be our goal over the next few years.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unacceptable that Europe’s directly elected representatives are, despite the presidency conclusions’ stress on democracy, marginalised in the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice. May I say how much I believe the voice of Parliament is strengthened by the ability of four groups to agree on the resolution put forward today.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only pick out a few points, but firstly: refugees. We welcome the reaffirmation of the full and inclusive application of the Geneva Convention, and credit is due to the Finnish presidency for this point. It is very important that the common EU asylum system – which ought, however, to be a single system and incorporate EU funding – should not be based on the lowest common denominator. We must also be very careful not to whip up racist prejudice and we look forward to proposals based on Article 13 to combat racism.</p>
<p class="contents">On individual rights, some progress was made but not enough. We very much welcome the reiteration of how important it is to legislate to give legally-resident third country nationals rights as near as possible to those of EU citizens. This is now urgent.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need tangible progress on the rights of EU citizens to move freely and reside elsewhere. It was a pity nothing was said at Tampere about rights to access information and documents despite transparency being cited as one of the important principles.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of access to justice we need mutual recognition to be accompanied by common minimum standards and it would have been good to see something about the rights of people to get bail when they are criminal defendants in a state other than their own.</p>
<p class="contents">We look forward to the body preparing the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which it would be appropriate for a representative of this Parliament to chair, producing a document which can confer direct rights on EU citizens and enable them as individuals to enforce their rights in the European Court. It is appropriate to give governmental authorities greater cross-border powers to pursue criminals but the use of these powers must be supervised by the European Parliament and the European courts so that civil liberties are entrenched and robustly defended.</p>

<p class="contents">Generally speaking, it is significant that the Council should have announced a specific timetable for the measures to do with the area of security. On the other hand, no clear timetable has been drawn up for the actions to do with an area of freedom. Our fear of the establishment of Fortress Europe therefore still remains.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as measures regarding the right of asylum and immigration are concerned, they are still totally vague and not at all mandatory. The only good news is the commitment to the observance of the Geneva Convention and further confirmation of the fight against racism.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Group is pleased to see the desire that was shown to grant similar rights to nationals of third countries as well as to European citizens. It is concerned, however, at the grey areas which remain on this matter. It is indeed vital that this equality in rights should be extended to political rights, to freedom of movement and the right to live together as a family. Europe has a duty to offer the same guarantees to all individuals resident on European soil.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister Lipponen’s statement regarding the future of the Charter of Fundamental Rights may also be cause for concern. Announcing at this stage that this is to be nothing more than a political declaration is tantamount to wiping out in advance the hard work of the working party. The compulsory aspect of this charter is essential with a view to the construction of a Citizens' Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, while the Council announced that the scope of activities and the mandate of Europol, a necessary instrument in the fight against organised crime, were to be increased, what of democratic and judicial supervision, especially regarding the compilation of files? This omission is the potential source of future irregularities as regards our individual and collective freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">This omission must be dealt with as a matter of urgency by setting up a Committee on Information Technology and European Freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that it could have been worse, much worse, especially for the citizens of third countries who are in Europe or who need to come here, but that does not change the fact that we have missed a good opportunity to actually start constructing an area of freedom, security and justice. The Summit’s conclusions seem to be a summary of the preparatory documents which had already been in circulation in Parliament for some time, without any more detail being added. There was a long list of good intentions with which we cannot disagree, but I am concerned and perplexed by some of the clearer decisions. I will give only one example out of the many I could give – the priority given to cooperation in fighting urban youth crime seems a little odd and out of place, given that, to make any real impact, the States would do better to join forces in order to defeat large-scale organised crime, which increasingly operates on an international basis. We will only be able to find out more from the legislative proposals that will be put forward. In the meantime, we repeat our concern that what we will actually achieve is an area of internal security fitted with an iron lock to stop the outside world getting in.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Madam President, I believe that the EU leaders’ recent meeting in Tampere in Finland was a very successful one. It was the first such meeting since the European Parliament ratified the new College of European Commissioners and the new President, Romano Prodi, has stated many times that he is deeply committed to involving Parliament in more decision-making in the future. This new interinstitutional approach within the European Union was certainly in evidence at the Tampere Summit. EU leaders had extended an invitation to you, Madam President, to attend the meeting: a recognition of the importance of the European Parliament as an institution.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with the statement issued by the EU leaders when they expressed their deep regret at the failure of the American Senate to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. This treaty is a cornerstone of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation efforts, and without it, the prospects for progress in nuclear disarmament are considerably reduced. The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is in the interest of all States worldwide, and the European Union is correct to restate its deep commitment to bringing the treaty into force at the earliest opportunity possible. I welcome the restated commitment of President Clinton to ratify this treaty as well as his renewed commitment to the maintenance of the US moratorium on nuclear testing.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier this year the European Council in Cologne decided to establish a chapter for fundamental rights which will bring together in one comprehensive document all the fundamental rights applicable at European Union level in order to make these rights more visible to its citizens. The Cologne Council directed the Finnish government, as the office-holder of the Presidency, to establish the conditions for the implementation of this project in time for the Tampere Summit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Judging by the reports from the Summit and the Presidency’s findings, the Council has, I am pleased to say, followed this modus operandi. There has been criticism to the effect that the outcome has been indeterminate as far as asylum and immigration policy is concerned and some of my colleagues in the European Parliament would probably like Community legislation to be in place already. I believe that it is the very caution with which cooperation is being brought about that will have a major bearing on asylum and immigration policy receiving a broad spectrum of support.</p>
<p class="contents">The outcome of the Tampere Summit is pervaded with a positive attitude that is clearly expressive of the desire for practical cooperation. Even Parliament seems to have been affected by the positive tone set by the Summit and has maintained this in its resolution. The fact that Parliament’s resolution contains any criticism at all can be put down to those who nurture the pipe dream of a federal Europe. I do not share this dream. What I do want is for the European Union to be one in which the Member States endeavour to draw closer together in those areas that have a European dimension. The Council took a positive step in this direction at Tampere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Tampere, not only did the reticence and insignificance of the decisions mean that Europe is not being constructed, but the creation of the Europe that we – and I think the citizens of Europe as well – do not want was announced. The much trumpeted area of freedom, security and justice is nothing more than the confirmation of a bureaucratic, repressive view of politics where much is said about security but little about freedom and justice, as demonstrated by the intensive series of Intergovernmental Conferences, Dublin, EUROPOL, EURODAC, EUROJUST and reciprocal assistance on legal matters, none of which are under the democratic control of Parliament, the Commission and the Court of Justice. </p>
<p class="contents">Once again, you have chosen to let bureaucracy determine policies, and not the other way round, as is the case in the major democracies. Since you have created the European bureaucracy of the right to asylum with the Dublin Convention and with EURODAC, perhaps one day you will finally decide on a European asylum and immigration policy. How can we combat organised crime using the instruments you are proposing? Firstly, the way EUROPOL was established, and its nature as a body which is not covered by democratic and legal control, means that thanks to you it continues to gain new competences, and so EUROPOL has the characteristics of the phenomenon it is intended to combat. </p>
<p class="contents">As for the actions concerning the fight against drugs for the period 2000-2004, the Council is now urging us to rush through the adoption of this document while, as the Commission itself admits, no systematic and rigorous assessment of the presumed results of the previous plan have been carried out. Not only is the Commission anxious to state that the objective is far from being achieved, but it is also saying that drug trafficking and abuse is on the up, which means that a large part of the money spent up till now has turned out to be an investment not in the fight against drugs but in the spread of drug abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">And what about freedom? The Council is proposing the implementation of Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam in the most minimalist way possible, by proposing that we give a non-institutional body the responsibility for drawing up a Charter of Fundamental Rights. Ladies and gentlemen of the Council, this is not the Europe we want – an intergovernmental, ademocratic, illiberal Europe which it is the duty of your institution to represent! We, along with Ernesto Rossi and Altiero Spinelli, want the federal United States of Europe of rights, freedom and democracy!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pirker (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I should like, on behalf of my Group, to ask and answer three questions. The first question is this: was the Tampere Summit an important summit? I should like to say yes to this question on three counts. Firstly, because the subject of internal security was brought to heads-of-government level and wrested from the nation-state mentalities of the Ministers for justice and the interior. In this connection, I should like to thank former President Jacques Santer and José Maria Aznar, who were at the Pörtschach Summit, and who provided the impetus there for the summit on security in Tampere. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this summit was important because it gave a signal to the citizens of Europe. The summit said in effect: we are here for the sake of your security. Where the Member States have come to the end of what it is open to them to do, the European Union steps in: in asylum policy, in migration policy, in the fight against organised crime and in cooperation concerning justice. Thirdly, this summit was important because, although we may so far have managed to translate economic and monetary union into reality, the special summit took the first step in the direction of a union for security and in the direction of an area of freedom, security and justice for the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question is this: was this summit a success? We still cannot at present answer this question with certainty. In 2001, when the initial results will be there to see, we shall be able to say whether it has been a success by then, and we shall be able to say in five years’ time whether Tampere was a success. What we can state, however, is that there have been many small successes and instances of progress. The first and important one is this: it has clearly established goals, responsibilities and deadlines for the first time. In other words, we have been placed in a position to monitor how progress actually occurs.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important feature – and the reason why Tampere was a success – is this: it provided for the first time clear distinctions in asylum policy, labour migration policy and the policy for dealing with temporary refugees, which is to say people driven from their homes by war. It also provided the first concrete measures for taking action in these particular areas. In asylum policy, it is important to issue a clear declaration of belief in the Geneva Convention and to declare our support for rapid, joint procedures, but also to set about tackling abuse. In the case of migration policy, it was important to make a clear statement that there exists a commitment to combating abuse and a stated belief in hands-on management and in a country’s capacity to receive and integrate refugees as a basis for management of this kind. The first initiatives have been taken to establish sensible measures with a view to receiving temporary refugees. </p>
<p class="contents">A further point concerned the taking of concrete measures in connection with combating organised crime. These included more operational powers for Europol, a European police college or more stringent measures to combat money laundering, and cooperation with the candidate countries, for these are very often the countries where organised crime originates. A further point is the cooperation introduced here concerning the matter of justice, for it is only if there is cooperation in this area that organised crime can also be successfully combated. This means that the constituent elements of particular criminal offences are to be defined, that substantive criminal law is to be harmonised, that there is to be mutual recognition of court judgements, that EUROJUST is to be set up and that there is to be protection for the victims of crime: all in all, a full range of measures signifying that the summit was a success. </p>
<p class="contents">Let me nonetheless briefly pose the question: what critical comments might be made? Announcing the results of Tampere as the Council has done here is to fundamentally misinterpret the Amsterdam Treaty. Cooperation with Parliament also means cooperation in the relevant committee. We missed seeing the Ministers for justice and the interior here on the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. Little that is concrete has emerged on the subject of labour migration. Nor, unfortunately, has any uniform asylum system emerged, and there has been nothing on how the burden is to be shared. </p>
<p class="contents">Overall, however, I must say that, in spite of all the critical comments which can be made, Tampere is, for the time being, a success. It was a first step in the direction of a union for security and it now lets us together set to work in the interests of security and of the citizens of Europe. </p>

The country to hold the presidency played an important part in reaching these results.</p>
<p class="contents">An extra challenge to the extraordinary summit conference at Tampere was that justice and home affairs are only now being debated on the EU general agenda. The steps taken thus far have, owing to the basis of the agreement, been modest. The issues are difficult and lead easily to conflict. However, we have to devote our considerable energies to matters that affect the security of our citizens, such as crime prevention, at European Union level. Criminal investigations and convictions must take place within the context of a real European area of justice. Mutual recognition of sentences and judicial decisions is therefore needed, as is work to harmonise criminal law. This is especially needed in the area of fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">It was important that, in the fight against crime, prevention was raised as a Union level issue. We have to be concerned about our youth, and invest in youth employment and training. The European social model must show more solidarity and, with its help, we must be able to prevent exclusion, encourage spontaneous recovery, and support equal opportunities for all groups of citizens, including immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of the meeting at Tampere also confirmed that we do not want a ‘Fortress Europe’, but want to take responsibility. The new comprehensive approach that has been established for issues of immigration and asylum, the European Council’s commitment to the full application of the Geneva Convention as it relates to refugees, and the decision to aspire towards a European asylum system, are steps in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We must realise, however, that our work is just beginning and the biggest challenges still lie ahead. It is important to take account of issues relating to the applicant countries as well as regional cooperation in this area. Face with these challenges we will need seamless interinstitutional cooperation. Furthermore, the citizens of the Member States must be included in the process and we must ensure firmer support from the people than is the case at present in decisions taken at EU level.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   – Madam President, I should like to congratulate the Council and the Commission on the progress made at Tampere in so many areas and I would like to associate myself with the remarks made earlier by my Liberal Democrat colleague Baroness Ludford.</p>
<p class="contents">In the short time I have available I would like to touch on two issues. The first is the position of non-nationals, the many millions of our fellow human beings not citizens of the Union but either legally resident here or being offered asylum. I welcome some of the progress that was made at Tampere: for instance, on giving them comparable rights and on the fight against racism and xenophobia. If we are talking about creating an area of freedom, security and justice, however, we must recognise that these are the people to whom justice is most regularly denied. They are still too often associated with criminals. Racist urban youths are a social embarrassment but racist policemen are a major social hazard.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome legal aid and greater information to citizens on legal systems and I recognise that progress can be made on mutual recognition of judicial decisions. Nonetheless, we need common high standards of judicial competence and I hope that we will see more work done in this area. We need protection of victims and the right to compensation; but we also need a recognition of the rights of defendants if we are to live in a decent society.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I would like to touch on is the involvement of citizens. The President-in-Office made much of the increased efficiency and transparency that Tampere has brought. He talked about this being key if the Union is to win the trust of its citizens. He talked of “opening up” the Council to public scrutiny and looking at other reforms. He hoped that the Finnish presidency would leave a lasting impression on the Union in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">As chairman of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I would like to suggest to the President-in-Office that more recognition be given to the role of this Parliament in dealing with citizens. The European Parliament could have been invited at a working level to many more of the debates surrounding the Tampere summit. The presidency could have sent a representative to our committee to come and talk about the results of that summit. Does the presidency recognise the legitimacy of the European Parliament or is it somehow running scared of our participation? I have a message for the presidency: relax – come and discuss with us. I hope we will be able to prove to you through our work in the body that will draw up the Charter of Fundamental Human and Social Rights that the presidency and Parliament can work very well together.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, as we proceed in this area where so often Parliament must work directly with the Council, we will see much more effective cooperation between us. I hope we will move from the somewhat stilted process of government by summit to more government at working level.</p>

We in Parliament must also, of course, express our thanks to Commissioner Vitorino, for his contribution was decisive as far as the outcome was concerned. I think that the Finnish Presidency should learn from this that, when one is prepared to cooperate, one can also achieve reasonable results. We saw this when the Commission got involved and salvaged a good deal of what there was to be salvaged. With this in mind – and in view of the fact that my colleague, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery, of my Group has really already said everything that needs to be said – I should just like to add the following comment. We now have a good outcome. There are still outstanding questions, and the years 2000 and 2001 will be the decisive years in which a great deal will finally be undertaken. I hope the future Presidencies of the Council will support the Commission and Parliament and keep us informed. In that way, we shall, in the end, be able to translate this positive outcome into action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it is time now to begin to see if Europe cannot introduce an immigration policy of its own, and I should like to urge the Council to do some thinking along those lines.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also the case, however, that special situations demand special contributions – and a special fund was necessary to cover the special contribution we have been discussing. It will not then be projects already up and running which will have to pay for special situations, in the way that there is now a risk of Africa’s having to pay for the EU’s contribution in Kosovo. </p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close by saying that I cannot support the idea of a scoreboard in the legal sphere. I think this is integration by the back door and a move in the direction of a United States of Europe by the back door. It is out of step with the democratic approach to things which I otherwise know from experience that Mr Vitorino is in favour of. If we are to go down that path, it must be by the front door. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is clear that without security there can be no social peace, and we must combat crime using strict controls on illegal immigration. Immigration is now a phenomenon which affects all European countries and, to prevent this causing imbalances or tensions in our national societies, it must be regulated and controlled in every aspect by common legislation. Creating a European judicial area means eliminating the inequalities between the Member States’ legal systems and changing Europe’s multi-speed image in this field. An area of justice will give form and substance to the third pillar and allow a more intensive fight against organised crime, in all its terrible forms – trafficking of women and children, paedophilia, prostitution of minors, the production and selling of drugs and prostitution. These have all been fuelled recently by illegal immigration. </p>
<p class="contents">I think it is difficult to conceive that all of this can happen in the short term if there is no strong signal given out to the national States as well. In 1998, in Italy alone, there were 130,000 statute-barred criminal cases, and the magistrates themselves say that the penal code has failed and that the Italian judicial system is bankrupt. We need common legislation or we will not be capable of promoting growth in Europe or stopping the spread of crime. To this end, we must also address the issue of how to prevent laws on security being in force in one Community country but not in another, given that our borders are open. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are predominantly technical problems which we might reasonably set the lawyers to solve. However, the ambitions which now dominate, both in the motion for a resolution concerning the Tampere Summit and in the communications from the Commission, go much, much further. They go much further because the hidden agenda is not merely to solve technical problems but to establish a number of supranational systems. There has been talk of “creating a union of security”. This is part of the European Union’s project and of the development of the Union, and it goes much further than is necessary. When the discussion turns to legal and home affairs, it is the family silver we are talking about. We are at the heart of a nation’s right to make its own decisions. We talk about a common policy on crime, refugees and immigration, but the question is: which policy is to be pursued? There are widely different interpretations of crime involving drugs, for example. There are many different legal traditions and, where legal policy is concerned, you can talk in terms of repressive and liberal approaches. You can do so too on the question of refugees and immigration. I would warn against establishing the supranational systems. Better to wait a bit and not be too impulsive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But for the low turn-out (with people not voting, either because they were not interested in, or did not agree with, the development of the Union), the election was probably a milestone of democracy. Whether the conclusions of the Presidency and whether the results of the Tampere Summit will merit the term “milestone” remains to be seen. </p>
<p class="contents">By the time of Amsterdam, we had had to acknowledge that the limits had been reached of how far the Member States were prepared to move towards integration. Following Amsterdam, there was extensive agreement that the Intergovernmental Conference was no longer a suitable instrument of change. This analysis was impressively confirmed by the embarrassingly low turn-out in the election. Otherwise, everything is continuing much as before. True, the Intergovernmental Conference is to get a face-lift, but the basic problems remain the same. There are doubtless some more positive entries on the balance sheet: the Tampere declarations concerning the area of freedom, security and justice; efforts towards a more intensive programme for combating crime; and improved access to justice. And also the results we are already seeing of the new policy on asylum and migration. Where, however, it was a matter of placing common interests before individual ones – for example, when it came to a fair sharing of the load – no agreement could be reached. Our conclusion, then, about Tampere: no doubt some important steps were taken there, but these were hardly milestones. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You will see, however, that, when it comes to translating these initiatives into practical terms, you will only achieve the relevant goals when the opportunities afforded by the Treaty of Amsterdam are taken to make decisions about these areas using majority voting. This subject should therefore, perhaps, be addressed again in advance of the Intergovernmental Conference in Helsinki, for a decision about voting can in fact be made simply by the Council and without an Intergovernmental Conference. </p>
<p class="contents">The tasks of any policy on justice and internal affairs are twofold: to provide the citizen with security against crime, yes, but also against instances of interference by the State. In a liberal community, both are tasks forming part of the relevant policy concerning justice and internal affairs. Partly in connection with what has been achieved in Tampere, a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be designed. I should like to thank the Finnish Presidency of the Council for the way in which it has set this process in motion. What now needs to happen is for the matter to take on a dynamic of its own, leading in the end to obligations on our part and to certain rights for our citizens. This process ought not to give rise to revised new catalogues of fundamental rights for the individual Member States but to legal entitlements in respect of action taken by the European institutions and in respect of legislation affecting our citizens. I believe we should achieve this in time. </p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I should like to ask the Presidency of the Council to abide by the bill and give the Commission the chance, however, to submit, in preparation for the Intergovernmental Conference, its own proposal for how working methods might most sensibly be put into practice. This is a really effective way of making progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, let me make a final remark about the Pack Report which is to be voted on today. The European Parliament has no institutional objections to the Report. It would like only to display an efficient approach, and there is also the widest possible agreement on this matter. With this point of view and in the light of the decision by the European Council concerning the competence of the Agency, agreements should be reached which, in time, achieve reconciliation throughout the Balkans and tie the region into the Stability Pact. The Administrative Council should no longer have an advisory role in deciding on individual reconstruction projects. In this connection, and with a view to achieving the greatest possible degree of efficiency, there is certainly broad agreement that a reasonable distribution of the workload between Priština and Thessaloniki should be achieved. It would be helpful if you could adopt a position on this matter which might make the decision at 12 o’clock easier for us to take. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In any case, I am fairly sure that Tampere will be a significant step on the road to the establishment of a Citizens’ Europe, the Europe which we must henceforth fight for with determination. In this area of freedom, security and justice which we hope to create, all three elements are important, and Tampere acts on all three of them. What is more, Commissioner, in undertaking to draw up this “scoreboard”, you are henceforth assuming a considerable responsibility. There is a helm which is in your hands; we have great expectations of it.</p>
<p class="contents">On the matter of fundamental rights, the establishment of a forum for Parliament to make its contribution to drawing up a charter is one element, but we shall be debating the basis of this for, as far as we are concerned, this charter must have a direct application, i.e. citizens must be able to appeal to the Court of Justice, and this charter must include the new rights for Europeans in the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of immigration, by integrating what might be called a co-development strategy, that is to say, by acknowledging that, in order to resolve the question of immigration, the underlying causes of the refugee phenomenon must be tackled in full, I believe that Tampere is a significant milestone. It is also a significant step in the recognition of the nationality rights of nationals of third countries. It is an important step. We also think that, in this fight, the contributions of the French, Germans and British on the subject of asylum rights and immigration will offer elements which must be taken into account to a greater extent in future.</p>
<p class="contents">In the measures relating to justice, we attach especial importance to the mutual acceptance of verdicts in civil and criminal cases. This is an essential point, in our view, for this is underpinned by the reality of a Citizens’ Europe in which it will be possible for the rights of the family to also be extended to the rights of couples of different nationalities, and not just to be a cause of problems. We therefore invite you, Mr Lipponen, to integrate the second Brussels Convention at the earliest possible juncture, since this is a matter of urgency, and it is a legal entitlement which many families are waiting for.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, and this will be no surprise to you, in this Parliament we attach great importance to the democratic nature of procedures. We therefore request that the legislative procedures envisaged by the Treaty of Amsterdam be applied properly. We also request that, as regards police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, these matters may be communitised in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if there is a Tampere spirit, we request that heading 4 of the Amsterdam Treaty may be implemented ahead of schedule. We would see that as a pledge of the good faith of all the partners involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The fact that the HCR was consulted on immigration and asylum policy may be seen as a significant sign of progress. I am sorry to see that human rights associations, anti-racist organisations and both sides of industry have already been left out of the process of drawing up this charter. For my own part, I would like to pay tribute at this point to these men and women. Their dedication and their groundwork have made it possible to re-establish a social structure and drive back racism, hatred and contempt on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlisting these human resources would make it possible, when discussing matters of immigration and asylum, to find a way out of a debate which has been cut short. Unemployment, lack of security and immigration are too often lumped together. It is not acceptable to have people say today that Eurodac is going to be used to record the fingerprints of asylum-seekers and minors, and justifying this on the grounds that it is easier than taking DNA samples is beyond belief.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite the contrary, immigrants must be given equal rights and treated as citizens in their own right. This means granting the right to live as a family unit, combating discrimination in accommodation, employment, leisure, and full nationality rights. And, in view of the daily round of humiliations inflicted on immigrants, it is only fair to grant them the right to vote. Finally, regularisation of the situation of those immigrants without proper documents, and elimination of the double penalty, would amply justify the existence of this Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">There was one extremely important phrase which was used at Tampere, if you will permit me. This charter will guarantee, when confronted with outbreaks of extremism….</p>

Like disease, crime knows no borders. Therefore, there can be no good reason for opposing the meetings of Heads of State as has happened at Tampere to discuss these issues. However, one has to express a note of caution. The suspicion amongst many in the United Kingdom is that these issues and the high-minded pronouncements are yet another power play by stealth on the part of the EU and its institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen it all before: first the problem, a problem of huge legitimate, public and topical concern, then the meeting and then the solution. The central agenda is that whatever the problem, the solution is always the same. More power to the EU and its undemocratic institutions. The issue of asylum, immigration and cross-border crime and the administration of justice impact on the very fundamental issues of human rights and individual civil liberties.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are considering is vesting even more powers in the hands of the EU and the unelected bureaucrats to take control of our very liberties – the body which brought us the inestimable benefits of the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy. Both are absolute disasters. British fishermen and farmers are now martyrs to the irresistible ambition of the European Union. Therefore, before we even think of passing more powers to the European Union, we must take into account its past activities and failures. Fishing and farming have been subjected to its most tried and tested policies: policies tested almost to destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">We should forget the theory, fellow delegates. Forget the high-minded pronouncements and look at the implications. If there were prizes for rhetoric, the EU would be a world-class performer. But when it comes to performance, the EU is the bottom of the class for efficiency. There is a yawning gap, an unbridgeable gap. So, when it comes to the issues of liberty, the EU cannot even sort out fishing or look after our farmers. Why should we trust it with our freedom and our security? Much more can be achieved by using existing national institutions and an international organisation….</p>

<p class="contents">In this respect, the Tampere Council marks a new era in the refusal to accept reality. Reading the report of the proceedings of this conference, the special characteristics of the peoples of Europe should actually merge together in a sort of worldwide melting-pot in which migrants have, I quote, “rights and obligations comparable to those of EU citizens”, and “the legal status of third country nationals should be approximated to that of Member States’ nationals”, all this in application of an alleged principle of non-discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">All these fine sentiments will clearly only result in increasing the flow of migrants yet further, and this means unemployment and lack of security. A realistic immigration policy ought, on the contrary, to involve making the situation of migrants in Europe more difficult by particularly eliminating any social assistance, and this indeed is the policy of the American Congress, by reducing economic aid to countries which encourage immigration, and organising systematic deportation.</p>
<p class="contents">But for that, we should have to make a break with the prevailing ideology, denounce the media who spread this ideology, such as the ARTE television channel, and, in general, stop being afraid of our social and cultural superiority. We cannot carry on our shoulders the poverty of the entire world, the inability of some parties to organise themselves and the thirst for revenge on the part of formerly colonised peoples. It is natural for groups of men to attempt to dominate others. It is up to us, the peoples of Europe, to be the strongest in this fight. If we do not fight, then Europe, like any entity which stops fighting, will ultimately be lost in the melee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It pleases me as a Spaniard that it has given its backing to the impetus which the Spanish Prime Minister, José María Aznar, gave to this Summit. The European citizens are very concerned that freedom of movement should not be coupled with the free movement of those people who wish to use it to threaten their security. Terrorists, drug traffickers, traders in human beings and other criminals most not be allowed to move around within Europe unhindered by the police or the judiciary.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me to be good news in the fight against terrorism, although the resolution of Parliament does not say so, that the formal extradition procedure for people who have been finally sentenced should be removed. It also seems to me that the Commission, in accordance with the new Tampere spirit and as the monitor of Community legislating, should ensure that directives to tackle money-laundering are complied with, given that non-compliance with these directives is hindering effective judicial cooperation as, for example, in the case of Gibraltar.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the will expressed in the Council to tackle illegal immigration networks must come to fruition urgently as a result of decisive and effective police and judicial action. The Straits of Gibraltar and the Andalusian coasts are the silent witnesses of the tragic deaths of human beings. Not one death more, Mr President-in-Office of the Council. Not one death more.</p>
<p class="contents">The President-in-Office of the Council has also referred to the cooperation with countries of origin by means of action plans.

I would like to see Tampere as a starting point, as a door which is opening and which will show us the path which we must travel along during the coming months, since there are some things which I still wonder about and I hope that they will be resolved during this process.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to fighting crime and the creation of an area of justice, I believe that we have moved forward and that this is positive. But I would like to concentrate principally on the question of immigration. I believe that it has also been positive to confront the need for a common asylum policy, but we need the funding to sustain it. We also need to confront the reality of immigration. I hope that, in the coming days, we will receive more information about what the Council intends and how the measures adopted at Tampere will be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">The action plans approved seem to me to be very interesting. This “interpillar” policy opens up possibilities which may lead us to a good result, but it also raises many questions as to by who and how these action plans will be developed and whether the Council will ever give us any information concerning the results of the one which has been implemented, that is to say the action plan concerning Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against illegal immigration also interests me. But I believe that, in order to combat illegal immigration, we must ensure that it is more worthwhile to approach a European Union consulate than a band of traffickers. If we want to put an end to the ignominy of deaths on our borders, as Mr Hernández Mollar said, we must offer a genuine common immigration policy, which we did not see at Tampere, offer new initiatives, and allow those people who live in the Union to do so with equal rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The only resolution adopted was to adopt the resolution to adopt a resolution at a later date in order to resolve the problems we face.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the situation is urgent. While all the States in Tampere were pledging their commitment to human rights, the Belgian government was sending several dozen gypsies back to Slovakia by chartered plane, under military guard. In France, due to changes in the legislation, around 70,000 immigrants now find themselves without the proper documents, in an illegal situation. In Saint-Denis in the Parisian region, six of them started a hunger strike more than 30 days ago.</p>
<p class="contents">The question remains, how can Member States be forced to respect the rights and the dignity of immigrants and asylum-seekers? In concrete terms, this means freedom of movement, voting rights, the right to live together as a family, abolition of the double penalty, regularisation of the situation of immigrants without proper documents, and an end to racist discrimination. The Tampere approach is, thus, a poor one. Rather than harmonising the repressive laws in this Europe which more and more resembles a fortress, let us establish real status and real rights for immigrants and asylum-seekers throughout the Community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Any member or aspiring member of the EU should already have in place systems to protect their citizens based on their own common law, precedent and legislation. The third pillar is a vital repository of national competences arrived at through historic development, reflecting different cultural and social histories of the nations. Its demolition in my view is very sad and a big mistake, just at the time when it could be needed most.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the proposals on immigration and asylum, I was the minister in the UK until 1997 dealing with these issues. From my experiences there, I now believe that the uncontrolled movement of people in global terms over the next 20 to 30 years, whether it be based on economic issues or climatic issues, represents a massive challenge to good order and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am certainly in favour of free movement in the EU where legal status exists, but what of the applicant states and their borders – they will have to take over protection of the EU under Schengen? Are we really happy about those arrangements and does Tampere really address them? What do our German friends think? What do the ordinary electors in Yorkshire or in Brentwood in the United Kingdom think? The granting of asylum is a precious gift not to be abused, as is unfortunately the case too often. The United Nations Convention in 1951 was clear: it should be applied to the letter but not replaced or surrounded with new regulations which, in my view, could cause even more confusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes, in order to be generous, in order to show good sense, it is essential for us also to be firm. I regret that Tampere does not address the issues with sufficient firmness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Tampere proved that the Union has the political will to carve out joint policies on issues which indirectly affect our daily lives, policies which will, for example, make citizens feel more secure through effectively stepping up the fight against organised crime, particularly in the area of drug trafficking, money laundering and the trafficking of human beings through judicial cooperation and mutual recognition of judgements. </p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I would like to see a common European family law and further efforts to combat racism, nationalism and xenophobia. The protection of the fundamental human rights of every person, without exception, who lives in the European Union is a sine qua non for the creation of a common area of freedom and justice. It was very encouraging to hear special reference to the Greek-Italian memorandum on strengthening cooperation in the Adriatic and Ionian Seas in order to combat organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Council remained quite diffident when it came to endorsing the common European Asylum System and Fund for immigrants proposed by the European Parliament and the Commission, as opposed to simply approximating rules and procedures. In addition, the Union seems unable to formulate a strategy to combat the social causes of immigration and to provide aid to the countries of origin so as to reduce pressure on the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, please allow me to express my reservations on one question in particular. Do you believe that the Tampere meeting has set in motion a five-year process to enhance the democratic and political make-up of the Union or to transform it into a fortress which is unassailable to all the victims of persecution around the world? I believe that only in December 2001, with the interim assessment and with hindsight, will we be able to judge the direction which it has actually taken.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are therefore waiting impatiently for the good will declarations to be followed by real, concrete policies. For example, the need to establish a joint policy on immigration and asylum is now commonly felt by the peoples of Europe. We must aim for an open, secure European Union which will establish partnerships with the migrants’ countries of origin and draw up joint development policies with these countries and those that migrants pass through. To start with, we need a common European asylum system with the basic conditions for receiving migrants and, later, we need a uniform statute for asylum seekers. </p>
<p class="contents">I am worried that, along with joint legislation, there is a lack of effective solidarity measures between the Member States for times when we need to address emergency situations, as in the case of the huge influx of Albania and Balkan citizens into Italy following the political crisis in those countries. Think of the Mediterranean in general, and the Adriatic in particular which forms an external border of the Union and not just Italy. The invitation to the Commission to assess the possibility of a budgetary reserve for this is significant but it is still not enough – the entire European Union should take responsibility for the extraordinary influx of non-Community immigrants with a strong act of solidarity towards the most affected countries, Italy in particular. The act of solidarity and improved control of migration flows are important instruments in the fight against organised crime and, in particular, against trafficking in human beings. The issue of women and children who are exploited and set up as prostitutes and the relationship of this world with drug trafficking, apart from being important matters affecting public safety, are, from a human point of view, tragic and distressing and require specific intervention on our part.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these actions and others as well, which relate to the security of European Union citizens, must be carried out in full compliance with the fundamental rights of those living in the Union, because the keystone of the future area of freedom and security is in fact those indispensable fundamental rights.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have to be honest with you; it was vital that this should happen for we needed to give form to the aforementioned area of freedom, security and justice. Of course Parliament wanted more far-reaching European commitments to come out of the Tampere Summit but I have to say that since these important issues are now on the European agenda all the same, along with a scoreboard, a clearly-defined task for the European Commission and thus also a role for the European Parliament, then that is a very good thing and I would like to congratulate the Presidency on this, but also the European Commission in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">However I would like to raise two critical objections in connection with the outcome of the summit; first and foremost with regard to the rights of the citizens of Europe. It is a good thing that it was at last resolved at the summit that all citizens of the European Union must be accorded equal rights, and that includes those who are non-nationals of the Member States. Citizenship of a Member State must not be founded on exclusion and discrimination though. And so it is also my hope, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that the Council will assign the European Commission the task of establishing what the rights of citizens from third countries are, and that the Commission will interpret these in the broadest sense, respecting the non-discriminatory principle, also when it comes to voting rights, to the right to live as part of a family and to the right to freedom of movement, notwithstanding the fact that nothing was said on this at the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the policy on asylum and migration appears to me to still be lacking in balance. For one thing there are intergovernmental measures which can be implemented immediately through the action plans but which are primarily geared towards the protection of migrants, and for another there are tasks for the European Commission, common asylum policy, protection of asylum seekers. On behalf of my group, I would like to urge that the principles of the Geneva Convention find full expression in all its aspects in the two aspects of the migration policy and that the Commission and Parliament become fully involved in all said aspects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Among the Commission’s tasks was that of establishing a table of results as a model for comparing the extent to which the relevant measures had been implemented. This is a good initiative which will also clarify the areas within which the Commission should be the first to take action. It is, however, only an evaluative instrument and can only go so far towards achieving the goal of a European Union governed by the rule of law. As well as strengthening fundamental rights, the table of results can provide legal convergence rules with legal objectives and guarantees. </p>
<p class="contents">If an area is to be designated an area of justice, the rule of law is required to operate there. If it is going to be possible to measure how far the Member States have progressed, criteria must be established and effective methods of measurement devised. It is about being able to compare legal systems and bring about improvements. </p>
<p class="contents">If differences are to be made clear and voluntary harmonisation achieved by means of group pressure, comparisons ought to be illustrated in the form of a table of results open to all. This is how the driving force can be produced to push ahead with extending throughout the European Union that dependable area of justice which is the prerequisite of citizens’ being able to move about freely, securely and safely. </p>
<p class="contents">The principle of mutual recognition, accepted in Tampere, must, however, in future, be supplemented by a degree of harmonisation within the field of criminal law as well. Initiatives were also taken at the summit to strengthen the position of the victims of crime and to ensure that citizens have access to the judicial system. I should like to have seen the Member States urged to introduce national funds for the victims of crime so as to be able to guarantee that the latter receive support in terms of financial prerequisites which are similar throughout the Union. Victims ought to receive aid, economic, psychological and social support through State, voluntary and individual contributions throughout the entire European Union. </p>

The political role of the Commission and of this Commissioner will be strengthened as a result. Some essential fundamental principles were also reaffirmed such as the right to seek asylum and the fight to combat racism and discrimination. It goes without saying that this is all to the good. But it is still a matter of first seeing then believing. </p>
<p class="contents">The decisions taken still need to be given substance and some policy options have not made it. The proposed common European asylum system still falls a long way short of the idea of integrated European policy. The notion of spreading the burden between the Member States is still taboo. A European approach to migration as such is not a realistic proposition at this stage. We are talking in terms of a policy of determent at the very most. And it remains to be seen how exactly the Council proposes to improve the rights of people from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should take the lead in drawing up a further agenda and Parliament must be enabled to play its rightful role where all of these issues are concerned. Cooperation in the fields of criminal and civil law establishes the principle of mutual recognition as the crux of the strategy. That may sound modest but it is probably a sensible choice in view of the disbelief and repugnance that this development still seems to evoke amongst the professional circles that lawyers move in. A great deal of work still remains to be done here to get the message across.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, setting up EUROJUST is a bold initiative. Hence it is all the more a pity that the parliamentary control aspect has been swept under the carpet.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note: the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Now that a decision has been taken on the composition of the forum that is to compile the Charter, it is high time that we determined what the status of this document is to be. So far, the Council has left this matter up in the air. If this Charter is to have any added value then it must become binding law to which every EU citizen can appeal. To that end, it will have to be incorporated into the Treaties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very happy and grateful that, in Tampere, the Council gave concrete expression to this order by establishing the European Police College. I am also delighted that, on Monday in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, Mr Vitorino gave notice that the Commission would soon be submitting a study concerning the way in which this project might be specifically put into practice, for I believe in fact that, when our police are trained together in the European spirit and when, as specified in the order, the police in the candidate countries are involved right from the beginning – and this idea too is traceable back to the proposal by this House – then we shall be taking an important, concrete step towards a Europe of justice and internal security. I should be very grateful if this College could be located in the border area between the EU and the candidate countries, for example in East Bavaria. Here, there are already a lot of examples of practical cooperation in the sphere of policing, and these might be useful in connection with this project. </p>
<p class="contents">I should like to address a second issue. I am of the view that the Council has done well to set the course for a common policy on asylum and refugees but, unlike many members, I am not so unhappy about the fact that we still have some way to go in that direction, for a number of quite important elements are still missing. Above all, I should like here to criticise the fact that, now as before, no specific sharing of the burden between individual countries has been arrived at. It even looks as though any such personal distribution of the burden has receded into the far distance. I am of the view, however, that, without such a sharing of the load, a common policy on asylum and refugees would be something which might be likened to a large roof erected only with a single supporting wall somewhere on the perimeter. A roof of this kind would inevitably tumble down. I consider a common asylum policy to which there is no definite key for sharing the load to be completely unthinkable. We therefore ought to use the time we have here and do some further, specific work on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However we may categorise the result, the Tampere Summit was, and is, important. It is important because it signifies a step towards a common European area of justice. The direction is the correct one. But with the great goal of the common area of justice in front of us, Tampere is just a small step on a long road. The people of Europe expect more. They expect larger and, above all, courageous steps in quick succession. I am convinced that they are also entitled to these. </p>
<p class="contents">The citizens of Europe can certainly demand that the law in every individual Member State should offer them the same level of safety, protection and security. They can expect not to be taken to the cleaners in a neighbouring country with the help of another legal system which is alien to them. Summits of varying degrees of solemnity do not alone do justice to these entitlements. Just as peace is not created simply by not going to war, so too is a common European area of justice not created just by a handful of governments expressing their good will. Reliable rules for cooperation must also follow a willingness to cooperate on issues of justice. The Council and the governments alone cannot create these. Parliament must help them. The Council should know that, in the interests of the people whom we represent as Members of the European Parliament, we are prepared to do this and will in fact do it. </p>

<p class="contents">Contrary to the idea that our Union should be of an exclusively or mainly economic nature, the Council, following a course of action that Parliament has now been defending for a long time, turned to our citizens, to their freedom of movement, to their security and to the recognition of their right to justice, rights which must be granted not only to citizens of the Union but to all those who, for a variety of reasons find themselves in our territory on a regular basis. Various political priorities and guidelines were agreed on, and the Commission will have to put forward a “scoreboard” proposal, that is, a panel which will assess the progress that has been made and whether we have met the terms laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, by the Vienna action plan and by the conclusions of this European Council itself, a pragmatic initiative which promises good results and which relied on the commitment of Commissioner António Vitorino, whom we should congratulate for this too. </p>
<p class="contents">It is true that there will be greater cooperation and that there were some areas in which it was easy to reach agreement, such as in the case of creating EUROJUST which should become operational towards the end of 2001, or in the strengthening of EUROPOL’s role or even in the creation of a European Police Academy. But, we should recognise that, on the whole, compatibility, convergence and the approximation of practices in the 15 Member States were given preference over the harmonisation and standardisation which could and should have taken place. In this way, the emphasis was placed on convergence and on common rules on asylum procedure, on the creation – albeit in vague terms – of a financial instrument for situations in which the temporary protection of refugees is required, on closer judicial cooperation, on recognising judicial decisions etc. The principles have been laid down and are on the whole positive ones. What we are now waiting for are the decisions and the initiatives which will allow us to give real substance to what was laid down. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a strong signal that Europe is no longer just a market and that the European citizen is no longer just a consumer or a worker; that the citizens, in all their forms, with all their worries, with all their needs, with all their demands, are at the centre of European construction.</p>
<p class="contents">And it seems important, bearing in mind everything that has been said here, to point out an issue which, in my opinion, symbolises this setting for the citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">At Tampere, a quasi-constitutional transformation has taken place, because the Council has given the Commission a mandate to establish, on their proposal, common rules on admission and residence, on small claims and many other issues.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way we are moving from a shared right of initiative to a right of initiative which is wholly in the hands of the Commission. It seems to me that this, from the point of view of European construction, is enormously important.</p>
<p class="contents">In the final seconds of this debate I would like to highlight judicial construction and the fact that the citizens, in addition to security, the police and the fight against crime, wish to know that justice is on their side, in any part of Europe, and that they will find justice before any judge. This is another of the great messages of Tampere. Commissioner, you have said that a lot of things were left undone in Tampere and it is true. But there is – as the French say – <span class="italic">du pain sur la planche</span>. You have at least fifteen enormously important mandates to perform.</p>
<p class="contents">We in this Parliament hope that those proposals will be on the table very soon.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lipponen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the European Council. </span>–<span class="italic"> (FI) </span>Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, I would like to thank you for your speeches; they have been very constructive. I would like to take up your valuable time, first to move on to some general comments, and then to reply to your points in detail, and finally speak about the future, and about implementation and monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the last speech, by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, was very important, as it put forward the notion that we should be setting ambitious targets. On the other hand, Mr Holmes, in his speech, was concerned that the harmonisation of legislation and administrative practices would advance too hastily. The problem for Tampere was that the issue of justice and home affairs is, all in all, a very conservative area. On the one hand, there is the worry that national practices will have to change too quickly. On the other hand, we have a real need for the convergence of legislation, inter alia, in the fight against crime and the enhancement of police cooperation. For example, we do not have in our legislation any coherent definition of what organised crime is. The method we use here is the single market method, where we look pragmatically at how progress is to be made, using problems as the point of departure. The mutual recognition of sentences is one line of action, and the other is that we examine the need for the harmonisation of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">First, I will speak of Eurojust and the European prosecuting authority. Eurojust itself aims, not just at networking among the prosecuting authorities, but also at achieving a situation where investigations and action can be initiated in investigation teams. The question of a prosecuting authority of benefit to the Community was raised in the final stages by the Commission. It is quite another question, as it would be expressly concerned with crimes committed within the territory of the Community, in which the Community has a financial interest. This has quite a lot to do with the issues that were discussed mainly last spring, but they can certainly be returned to once more.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Europol, worry has been expressed here concerning Europol surveillance. I think that is very justifiable, as this must be monitored as Europol’s mandate or, to be precise, its competences, expand. However, Europol’s basic operational model and nature were not altered at Tampere. Europol and its officers did not acquire independent competences, but will work more closely with the Member States, providing aid and support. This must be monitored closely.</p>
<p class="contents">Some speeches focused attention on the status of nationals of third countries. At Tampere the term “comparable” status was used. This means that we shall go as far as possible in the direction of full citizens’ rights but, for example, there is perhaps a certain unwillingness to grant voting rights in parliamentary elections. Instead, the right to vote in local elections is a good example of the sort of European practice we should be hoping for.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of a refugee fund, of the share of the burden, gave rise to some discussion, and we agreed that we should return to the question of a fund. We must clarify our concept of what we are trying to do. What we mean here is that, when masses of refugees suddenly arrive seeking temporary protection, we should support those countries that are the target of such large-scale migration. The request is entirely legitimate, and financial aid may also come into it, but the matter will take more preparatory work. Speaking of the share of the burden, we might say that in the situation in Kosovo we saw that we were not prepared. We should be able to agree policies to build solidarity among the Member States. We perhaps do not have to go as far as an automatic share of quotas, but we are in need of better practices when it comes to solidarity. Obviously, we have to work in cooperation with the UNHCR, as in the Kosovo situation. The capacity for action by the international community in these situations must, on the whole, be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to return once more to the question of organised crime, which Mr Di Lello Finuoli referred to in his speech. At Tampere we in fact agreed some very far-reaching aims. Money laundering came within the scope of Europol’s mandate. In my opinion, the work will be enhanced on a very broad front when the prosecution authorities are involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I would like to speak on certain other matters that have been raised here. Firstly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights: will it be a political act or a draft for a new constitution. As the country to hold the presidency of the European Council, we shall take the matter further on the basis of what was decided at Cologne, i.e. that it is a political act. But that will not prevent us from raising the question at some stage that the Union needs some sort of constitution, into which fundamental rights should be written. This is a matter of processes. At Tampere resolutions were made on the working party’s mandate and composition, and it will assemble for the first time during the Finnish Presidency. I hope that it will acquire a prestigious chairman.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of an Intergovernmental Conference was raised, for example by Mr Brock. I would like to emphasise that this is a matter for the presidency. We were charged with the task at the Cologne Summit. Obviously, we will work on the basis of the Commission’s proposal, but I hope that it will not be forgotten here in Parliament that such an institution as the Council and its presidency do exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Brock raised the issue of the situation in Kosovo and the Stability Pact. They were discussed on the evening before the meeting at Tampere. The President of the Republic of Finland, Martti Ahtisaari, spoke on the subject, considering it necessary that the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, the Secretary-General of NATO, Javier Solana, and Balkans representative, Bodo Hombach, should now work together more effectively to safeguard both the implementation of the Stability Pact and, obviously, the progress in practical matters, such as cooperation between Priština and Thessaloniki. The country to hold the presidency is therefore monitoring this issue very closely. As for the Obnova regulation, the Council will carefully look into Parliament’s draft amendments. I discussed this this morning with President Fontaine. The purpose is to clear the matter up immediately, as the European Parliament has adopted its opinion, and the Council will already be initiating discussions at the end of this week about how the amendments proposed by the European Parliament might be taken account of when making the final decision on Obnova. I hope this will also be one of those issues that will be settled during the Finnish presidential term, signifying that we have, as it were, got beyond this problem of the institutions, and that is what our citizens actually expect.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to how the European Parliament participates in decision-making, and what has happened in this matter, I accept the criticism, as the representative of the country to hold the presidency. I would, however, like to point out that in the part-session in September, three of our Ministers were here to report on the Tampere meeting. They were the Minister for the Interior, the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. A fourth was present too: our Coreper representative. As far as we understand it, all that information, which has been at the disposal of governments, has also been at the disposal of Parliament. Generally, what was achieved at Tampere is founded on our adherence to transparency, and we did not, for example, at the last moment produce any surprises for governments or Parliament. Everything was known; our draft agenda was available to all.</p>
<p class="contents">In the future, the European Parliament will participate in decision making, and this will obviously be rooted in the Treaty of Amsterdam. The conclusions of Tampere will improve further the European Parliament’s practical opportunities for involvement and monitoring. The conclusions of Tampere show a commitment at the highest political level to an assurance of much-needed transparency and to the practice of regular supplies of information conveyed to the European Parliament. I have already told the ministers that if something is unsatisfactory, they have to come here. The constructive and active nature of the conclusions of Tampere will provide Parliament with better opportunities to participate in the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice. In other words, the aims and means have now been more clearly defined, and it will be easier to take part in their implementation. For this, that adopted proposal provides an important aid. I would like to thank Mr Suominen for the advice on terminology. It was, if I remember correctly, a ‘balanced score card’, which we have to achieve. That will also facilitate the work of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding transparency, may I be so bold as to remind everyone that in the Treaty of Amsterdam it was Finland that proposed a change to the paradigm. Until then, it was a principle in the Union that documents were not generally public, although there were exceptions. We proposed that the opposite principle should be adopted, that documents should be public, although there might be some exceptions. Now the question is whether all the institutions, within the framework of their own responsibility, will put this principle into practice and whether the Commission will actually make proposals for acts on these issues. Then I would speak finally about implementation, which was something Mr Suominen and others drew attention to. The Council on justice and home affairs will initiate the implementation of the Tampere resolutions on Friday of this week. As the country to hold the presidency, we have drafted a certain sort of agenda for that meeting, which comprises all the action required of the conclusions of Tampere, which is to say, what needs to be done, who is to do it, and according to what timetable. I hope that we will succeed with this model of working, so that it will also facilitate the work of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the President, the Bureau and those who have spoken for their very kind words, but also for their criticism, as we simply cannot be complacent in the wake of the Tampere meeting. We have to really take the decisions reached there seriously and start work accordingly.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would simply like to thank you, on behalf of the Commission, for all the contributions you have made in this debate. I must assure you, ladies and gentlemen, and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi in particular, that the Commission is well aware of its own responsibility as regards the application of the Tampere conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">I must stress that the Commission could never have fulfilled its role if it had not been able to count on the support of the Finnish Presidency, particularly the Prime Minister, Mr Lipponen, whom I must thank once more for his cooperation and his work to make Tampere a success, and also on the support, critical and vigilant as always, of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is now indeed counting on the critical and vigilant support of the European Parliament in order to prepare the “scoreboard”. In fact, the “scoreboard” is not just an instrument for legislative programming, it is also an instrument intended to strengthen the transparency and accountability of all European institutions with regard to the citizens, because it is the citizens who are in control in the area of freedom, security and justice. It is not just a control panel, it is also an instrument for evaluating the actual results achieved in terms of actual progress in the application of the Tampere conclusions. The progress achieved will not be the concern of just the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament, but also the Member States, insofar as some “scoreboard” tasks will be entrusted to them in application of the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I wish to stress the importance, for the Commission, of the decisions regarding the drawing up of the Charter of Fundamental Rights which were taken at Tampere and which will be followed up in Helsinki.</p>
<p class="contents">As the political and philosophical foundation of the area of freedom, security and justice I propose to consider all matters related not only to the fundamental rights of the citizens of the Members States of the Union, but also the rights of third country nationals legally resident on a long-term basis within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As for rights relating to the fight against discrimination, based on Article 13 of the Treaty, they will be discussed during the debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights. At this time, a clear sign must be given so that the process of drawing up the Charter and the Intergovernmental Conference of the Union, which are due to take place at the same time, both express movement in the same direction, with a view to guaranteeing the conditions for enlargement and strengthening the foundations of the rule of law in our Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Before handing over to my fellow Commissioner, Michel Barnier, who is going to present the objectives of the Intergovernmental Conference, I would once again like to thank the Parliament for the support given to the Commission in this project, the Tampere project, the spirit of Tampere, the letter of Tampere, but most of all the project of the citizens of this shared Union of ours.</p>
