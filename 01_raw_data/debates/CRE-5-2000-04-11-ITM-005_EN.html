<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gama,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Lisbon European Council has certainly given new impetus to the European agenda and I am sure that you will be aware of its results, both through reading the conclusions and also as a result of the broad public coverage that this Council received in the European and international press. The key aim of defining a new world-wide strategy for the European Union within a world economy that is open, competitive and truly global was achieved. That strategy is to make the European Union the most dynamic and competitive economic area in the world, based on knowledge and able to guarantee sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and with greater social cohesion. A knowledge-based economy underpinned by a society based on information and research will be a powerful factor in the European Union’s development and of course requires a swift and consistent process of structural reforms and the completion of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">This objective also involves modernising the European social model, investing in people and combating social exclusion. It also involves implementing sound macroeconomic policies encouraging economic growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Strengthening the European Council’s coordinating and guiding role will be vital to developing the Lisbon strategy. The European Council will annually monitor the progress that has been made, by holding a European Council meeting each spring. It will also establish the broad guidelines for the sectoral Councils. A coordination method was established, with specific timetables for the short, medium and long term, outlining objectives, benchmarking based on best practice and also other kinds of indicators. This is an open method of coordination, which we hope will produce optimal results. These guidelines will also be transposed into national policies, and will be periodically monitored and assessed as part of a process of mutual learning between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The goals set at the Lisbon European Council are extremely ambitious and give specific mandates to the Commission. Just yesterday, President Prodi presented the Commission’s programme in this area to the Council and also to the various Council formations, and it is therefore crucial that we bear in mind the diversity of platforms on which the strategy laid down in Lisbon was developed, with its implications for the fields of scientific research, education, the single market, industry and so forth. Developments in electronic commerce, the liberalisation of the telecommunications market and the establishment of a framework for reducing the costs of access to the Internet are, of course, crucial factors in the success of this modernising strategy, and the e-Europe Action Plan, which will be presented to the Feira European Council, will also be a key instrument in speeding up the progress of the European Union towards becoming an information society.</p>
<p class="contents">Just yesterday, I was able to inform the General Affairs Council that the Portuguese Presidency had already prepared a timetable for the remits given by the Council for implementation of specific measures in the various areas, and also for appropriate preparation of the Feira and Nice European Councils. The Ecofin Council will primarily assume responsibility for strengthening the Cardiff process, the action plan for financial services, the action plan for venture capital, the tax package, the mid-term review of the employment guidelines and for the assessment of the contribution made by public finances to growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Internal Market Council will assume responsibility for electronic commerce, copyright and related rights, for the dual-use export control regime, for removing obstacles to services and public contracts, for Community and private sector electronic procurement systems, for the establishment of a coordinated strategy with a view to simplifying laws and rules and for the Community patent.</p>
<p class="contents">The Employment and Social Affairs Council will assume responsibility for conducting a review of the employment guidelines, for mandating the High-Level Working Party on Social Protection to prepare a study on the sustainability of the pensions system up to 2020, for applying an open method of coordination to policies for combating social exclusion and for considering the future direction of social policy, with a view to reaching agreement on a European social agenda at the Nice European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Research Council will assume responsibility for the e-Europe Action Plan and for promoting the establishment of a European research area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Telecommunications Council will assume responsibility for concluding the review of a regulatory framework for telecommunications and for the liberalisation of the market in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">The Consumer Affairs Council will assume responsibility for the distance selling of financial services – by approving pending legislation – and for alternative systems for resolving consumer disputes, by establishing a Community network.</p>
<p class="contents">The Education Council will assume responsibility for considering the future objectives of our educational systems, with a view to contributing to the Luxembourg and Cardiff processes by establishing new basic skills at European Union level, for creating a European diploma for basic IT skills, for removing obstacles to the mobility of teachers, for developing a European format for curricula vitae<span class="italic">,</span> for monitoring national policies on implementing these objectives, for access to the Internet in schools by 2001 and for the minimum training, by 2002, of the network of information technology teachers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Industry Council will assume responsibility for drafting the charter for small businesses and for establishing a procedure for standardising appropriate practices for the creation and development of innovative businesses, particularly small- and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The Justice and Home Affairs Council will be responsible for adopting the pending legislation on jurisdiction and enforcing judgements. It should be borne in mind that implementing the remits decided in Lisbon will require close cooperation between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament, since many of the laws to be adopted are subject to the codecision procedure. As you can see, the task of setting objectives at the Lisbon European Council is developing into a major timetable for action that the Commission and the various Council formations must now implement. The Portuguese Presidency has already taken appropriate measures in Council so that the specific Council formations can immediately start implementing the programmes defined for their respective fields, and so that appropriate coordination takes place in this area, through the presentation of a synthesis report, either by the time of the Feira European Council this June, or by the Nice European Council, during the French Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was certainly a turning point. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Council defined a new Union strategy, a strategy which will make us a leading power in the new knowledge-based economy and make it possible to restore the necessary conditions for full employment. Even at this early stage, the revised forecasts for both economic growth and employment are cause for optimism. </p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon European Council made a firm political commitment to an ambitious socio-economic plan; clear objectives were agreed for the reforms, the European social model was consolidated and, most importantly, it is now possible for the pledges made to be followed with immediate, practical actions. This amounts to a completely unprecedented sign of confidence in Europe’s future and in the future of our economy and our social cohesion. </p>
<p class="contents">Our success in Lisbon was largely due to the excellent preparatory work of the Portuguese Presidency. António Guterres’ handling of the debate was exemplary. The Commission also made a decisive contribution to this success, for the conclusions are significantly similar to the contents of the preliminary synthesis document which we drew up in preparation for the Council. </p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon debate generated substantial agreement on most issues. The only truly disputed points were the time frames for the liberalisation of the energy and transport markets, public services, the tax package and the competences of regional authorities in education and training. These issues are major but they are limited in number. This high level of consensus allowed the Presidency to set an extremely ambitious agenda. </p>
<p class="contents">I will not go into the conclusions in too great a detail, but stick to the main points. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Council stressed the importance of a strong, sound macroeconomic policy, consolidation in the field of taxation and sustainable financial policies and the structural reforms. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the information society, the principle elements of the e-Europe initiative proposed by the Commission were put into effect, in particular regarding the legal framework for e-commerce, the opening of the telecommunications market, internet connections for schools and teacher training. The Commission was asked to develop a benchmarking strategy to define best practice and to guarantee both the development of the necessary infrastructures and the availability of the necessary funds.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the internal market, the European Council adopted ambitious objectives in the field of procurement and in order to implement action plans for financial services and risk capital. In addition, measures will be taken to accelerate the liberalisation of transport, energy and postal services. Research, education and lifelong learning all received a boost. The Council also agreed on the need for a sharp increase in employment, particularly employment of women, and, I repeat, the forecasts are currently very encouraging. </p>
<p class="contents">One of the most significant steps forward was the consensus between the Member States regarding the need to explore the possibility of modernising the social security systems and making pension systems sustainable, on the basis of a Commission initiative. Until recently, such an agreement would have been unthinkable, and this could be an extremely important development. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is therefore going to play a central role in the follow-up to this Summit. </p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to mention some of the items on our agenda: firstly, we are going to draw up new legislative proposals, in particular regarding the legal framework for e-commerce – which has become extremely urgent due to the inadequacy of the present framework for e-commerce – and for procurement; secondly, we are going to introduce benchmarking in all the stages of the “open coordination” process in the areas of research, enterprise policy and social exclusion; thirdly, we are going to present our communication, entitled “A new European social agenda”, which will serve as the basis for the Nice Summit organised by the French Presidency; finally, we are going to prepare for the spring Councils by producing an annual synthesis of economic and social progress which will be a sort of general report on the economic and social situation in Europe. These spring conferences, which will take place each year, will be important in terms of assessing progress made and developing future strategies. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will therefore play a crucial role in ensuring that the Council’s undertakings are translated into practical measures, and that Lisbon is thus a genuine success for Europe. The Commission must act as the driving force in this process. Tomorrow, I am going to meet my fellow Commissioners to ensure that work starts immediately and that the various different objectives set are achieved. I am determined to see that this Commission makes good its promises. I would like to thank Parliament, before this House, for its encouragement, but also for the new ideas that it has given us during these debates. </p>
<p class="contents">In Lisbon, we also tackled the issue of the Balkans – in a meeting held during the break for supper, which was not on the agenda but was nevertheless a working meeting. At that meeting I raised the point of the European Union’s political responsibility for the Balkan region, and stressed that our entire credibility is at stake. The European Council subscribed to the joint report prepared by the Commission and the High Representative, and also our request for more effective coordination between the various programmes implemented by the Union in that region. I repeat before this House that the need for this coordination is urgent, spectacularly urgent. Following my lead, the Heads of State and Government agreed upon the need to clean up the Danube. We have accumulated the necessary resources and I now expect appropriate measures to be taken. We also agreed to speed up the procedures for supplying aid to the Balkans. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the subject of Russia, the European Council recognised the strategic nature of our relations with Moscow and invited President Putin to take note of our concern over the situation in Chechnya. I sent him a letter congratulating him on his election and stressing the Commission’s genuine interest in cooperating closely with the Russian Government, but the Chechnya issue was mentioned specifically. </p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, Madam President, I would like to thank this House for its valuable contribution to the Lisbon Summit and for all it did to ensure the Council’s success. </p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I find the outcome of this Summit very encouraging, and I would like to stress once again the Commission’s commitment to ensuring the swift, efficient implementation of the decisions taken at the European Council. I am counting on your full support and your cooperation to help us to achieve this. The eyes of the citizens of Europe, whom you represent, are on us, and they expect a great deal of the follow-up to Lisbon. It is our duty not to let them down. </p>

At the meeting the Union’s strategic objective was to create the world’s most competitive and dynamic information-based economy, with steady growth and the ability to create more and better jobs. The aim alone does not, however, make the meeting a historic one; what does is the range of measures that the meeting is recommending the Union and its Member States take to achieve their objective.</p>
<p class="contents">I will borrow the words of the Presidency. Firstly, to achieve the model, we have to put our faith above all in the private sector and in cooperation between the private and the public sector. That will be dependent on the mobilisation of market forces available and action on the part of the Member States themselves. The Union will act as a catalyst in the process. Secondly, we must reduce the tax burden among the workforce, especially among the relatively low paid and less educated. Thirdly, we have to reallocate public money to increase the relative importance of the growth of capital both physically and in terms of human beings. Fourthly, we must speed up the process whereby competition is freed up, for example, in the gas, electricity, postal and transport industries, with the objective of having a fully functional internal market in these sectors too.</p>
<p class="contents">I have given just a few examples to show that the Council of the fifteen countries of the European Union, fourteen of which have socialist governments, has adopted a totally central to right policy with regard to the economy and development, one which is associated with social responsibility, in many respects like that of the PPE-DE Group. When I speak of this with such satisfaction on behalf of my group, it is not with the slightest hint of mockery. In our opinion, the essential thing is not to look for political conflict, but to use the right tools for the benefit of our citizens. In the decisions taken at the Lisbon Council, those tools took the form of a social market economy, which was a good thing.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me utter a few words of warning. The main responsibility for achieving results lies with the Member States as far as the liberalisation of markets and the making of electronic commerce cheaper for consumers are concerned. I would ask whether the astronomical price of the third generation mobile phone licences now being put up for auction in England will be of benefit to the consumers of the future? It will not be. Greed will bring its own revenge in that the system will be made expensive and will be slow to establish itself. I give the example because it is relevant and not because I want to draw attention to the fact that the United Kingdom is doing something than runs counter to the decisions of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me issue a second word of warning. We are on the threshold of enlargement. As we now step on the gas with regard to an <span class="italic">e</span>Europe within the Union, are we making it more difficult for those countries joining the Union to adapt? The answer cannot be not to speed up developments in the direction of an <span class="italic">e</span>Europe. The answer is, in fact, a question: are enlargement, which has been planned, albeit relatively slowly, and the budget in accordance with the decisions of Agenda 2000, mutually compatible? Is structural aid to be increased after all, so that those states intending to join are not left even further behind in terms of development compared with the Union?</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say finally, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, that we have full confidence that Romano Prodi and the Commission he heads will be able to achieve the Lisbon objectives. The PPE-DE Group and, to the best of my knowledge, the whole of Parliament, support the Commission’s work while voicing constructive criticism. As the imperfections of the Single Market now also stem from protraction on the part of the Member States, the implementation of each of the decisions taken at Lisbon will also depend at institutional level above all on whether the Member States will stand by the solemn theses of Lisbon in the years to come.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following on from Luxembourg in 1997, when Europe revealed its joint responsibility for employment, the European Council has just outlined a new economic strategy, intended to make the European Union not only the most competitive and most dynamic knowledge-based economic system in the world, but also a model in terms of employment and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">“The novelty of this summit is that it dealt with the entirety of economic and social policy.” This is a quotation from Belgium’s Liberal Prime Minister. Along with him, the President of the French Republic, and the Heads of Government of Austria, Spain, Ireland and Luxembourg have endorsed the Lisbon conclusions. Some political forces within this Parliament nonetheless appear to wish to turn the Lisbon Summit into some sort of Socialist International ‘happening’. How else is one to interpret the refusal of the PPE and ELDR Groups to negotiate a joint resolution common to the main political forces within Parliament? Some conservative and liberal ayatollahs seem not to want to hear anything about a macroeconomic and monetary policy of benefit to the European social model. The untrammelled free market seems to be their only god. </p>
<p class="contents">Yet the market economy must necessarily have a social dimension. Here is a riddle. In Lisbon, who was it that said that the citizens of Europe are looking to the European Council to give shape to a social Europe? Who was it that said that, for European citizens, I quote, “unemployment wrecks lives and societies for entire generations and, even though it is starting to fall, unemployment remains the main concern”? That “the across-the-board return to economic growth means that we can do things today which were impossible yesterday”? That citizens are scandalised by “untrammelled capitalism, whose relocations, social dumping, ruthless exploitation of the disparities between the social and fiscal legislation of the Member States and remorseless pursuit of profit at the expense of working men and women”? </p>
<p class="contents">These are the words of Mrs Nicole Fontaine, the President of this Parliament. The Group of the Party of European Socialists also supports Mrs Fontaine in her declaration made in Lisbon to the effect that, I quote, “The European Parliament is committed to the social model in all its aspects”. The President has our support when she asks the European Council to, I quote, “introduce balanced rules on company mergers within the European Union”; and says that there should be “a ban on any mergers that do not comply with binding European legislation on prior notification and consultation of workers”; “that, before such mergers can take place, a serious assessment of their social impact is carried out”, and when she points out that “unregulated mergers, based merely on dominant capitalist concerns, have a devastating effect on the Union’s social cohesion”.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Party of European Socialists agrees with the President, when she demands an observatory of industrial change, and a fairer distribution of income between capital which enables and work which produces. In short, the Group of the Party of European Socialists endorses the conclusions of our President, whom we congratulate on her fair and courageous statements.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament would appear ridiculous if it voted in favour of the joint resolution tabled by the PPE and the ELDR, who seem to wish not only to disown our President, but also to disassociate themselves from both President Prodi and the Conservative and Liberal Christian Democrat Prime Ministers who endorse Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore advise all the Christian Democrats, all the Liberals and all the Democrats in general who want to see a social market economy, to vote in favour of the resolution proposed by the Group of the Party of European Socialists. We wish to combine economic efficiency, quality of life and social protection. We want sustainable development in all these aspects.</p>

However, we were very pleased about the far-sighted messages which were to be found in the conclusions from the Summit. We are particularly pleased about the emphasis placed upon Europe’s creating prosperity and employment by strengthening the market economy and increasing competitiveness, partly through greater flexibility in the labour market and reduced social charges in connection with low-paid jobs. I also want to express satisfaction at the fact that the open coordination with which we are familiar from employment policy is to be used as a tool in other areas to promote the use of information technology and reinforce training and strengthen research. Working for common goals in this open and flexible way, in which countries can measure themselves against each other and learn from one another, is a good way both of ensuring progress and, at the same time, of guaranteeing individual countries’ freedom to seek their own solutions to their own problems. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also express great satisfaction at the fact that the opinion sets a time-frame for developing the single market in important areas, chiefly through the commitment to rapidly create a legal framework for e-commerce. However, there is, in fact, just a great a need to develop the traditional economy, and I am therefore delighted at the emphasis on increased research efforts and on the enlargement of the single financial market, as well as at the Council’s support for liberalisation within the energy, postal and transport sectors, even though it has not set a time scale for such liberalisation. In developing employment policy and combating social exclusion, it is only right to invest not only in economic growth but also in education and training as a way of giving those who are excluded from society a foothold in the labour market and enabling them to help themselves. There are major advantages in a form of coordination based upon benchmarking, but we should of course be careful that the whole process does not take a bureaucratic turn or lead to over-zealous management. Finally, I would offer an important and perhaps less complimentary remark. In the Lisbon conclusions, the Council refers a good deal to what it is going to do in the future, perhaps following proposals on the part of the Commission. I hope that we are not to read too much into this apparent emphasis upon the intergovernmental character of EU cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jonckheer (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, I think it is clear that, in January, when the Portuguese Presidency issued its first paper, the original impulse was perfectly laudable. The widespread dissemination of communication technologies was going to cause, indeed, is causing considerable change in the living and working conditions of the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions of the Portuguese Presidency contain many positive commitments and objectives. Having said that, these are in danger of being watered down, and the motion for a resolution tabled by the PPE Group and the Liberal Group presents an absolute caricature of this, giving Parliament the opportunity to split along the good old left-versus-right divide, which does not match the observation of the practical policies implemented within the fifteen Member States, and which certainly does not meet the challenges of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, Mr Prodi, the real challenge would be if, in coming months, you did not endorse this motion for a resolution, in the event that Parliament votes in favour of it tomorrow. We therefore call upon you, along with the Council, to consider in further detail a number of points which we feel are noticeably absent from the Lisbon conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point is the strategic goal. Has the strategic goal of sustainable development which was supposed to be an integral part of a twenty-first century economy, which would meet the requirements of the planet and its citizens, been forgotten? There is not one line on the reports which the Commission nonetheless submitted at the European Council in Helsinki. Not one line on the practical implementation of Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union. The connection must be made between the dissemination of modern communication techniques and the implementation of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point relates to employment. European citizens must not be kept in ignorance of the fact that the dissemination of these communication technologies is going to destroy jobs as well as create them, and that at the very core of our societies, at macroeconomic as well as at microeconomic level, it presents a challenge to the redistribution of working time and the redistribution of incomes. Avoiding these questions is to invite serious social crises despite the spirit of optimism currently characterising the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to the matter of taxation, which you mentioned. In one of its documents on the integration of financial markets, the Commission itself said that such integration was possible only with a minimum of tax regulation. This is also true of the Monti package. These matters are going nowhere, and integrating the financial markets without fiscal regulation at European level is still tantamount to establishing a two-speed Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in social matters, I do not think it wise, Mr Monti, for the Commission to give up any legislative proposals in matters of employment law. The new economy also involves enabling workers, in the event of company restructuring or necessary discussions about the incorporation of technological innovations in companies, to proceed in decent conditions. This must also be included in the Nice social agenda and we urge you to ensure that this is the case, because my Group wishes to see a strong and ambitious Commission, and will support you if you take the comments I have just made into account. </p>

If that means that the Lisbon Summit sanctioned a liberal view of Europe, then I must of course, unfortunately, concur with this analysis. I cannot however be delighted by it. I do not by any means wish to allow the current British and Spanish Heads of Government to monopolise the offensive position with regard to the information revolution. In my opinion, this is indeed a huge challenge which must be accepted. So when I read the summit conclusions which state that Europe has set itself the goal of promoting a dynamic knowledge-based economy ‘capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs’, I say, ‘Go on then, I dare you.’ An annual upturn in investment in people and adopting a proactive policy to promote full employment is something I am firmly in favour of.</p>
<p class="contents">The political difference between us is not a question of whether or not to adopt modern methods, but of what our concept of these modern methods is, particularly on the place and the role which all men and women, bar none, must play, both as workers and as citizens. In this respect, however, Mr Blair and Mr Aznar and their followers are held captive by archaic liberal ideas, which are conformist in the most ordinary way: allow the market, particularly the financial market, to operate, introduce wage flexibility, reduce labour costs, even if it means boosting the mechanism which produces inequality, precariousness and exclusion across the entire planet. There’s the rub: do we or do we not have the courage to tackle these taboo areas at the very time when we are starting to see such promising beginnings of a new phase in human civilisation? This, in my opinion, is the yardstick against which we will be able to measure Europe’s true ambition and also the true modernity of the left. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These conclusions were presented by the Heads of State and Government as part of a strategic objective to make the European Union the most competitive area in the world within ten years, by developing a knowledge-based economy and adopting policies geared towards growth and full employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I must ask this, however: do the statements by those currently in power in Europe, who are, in the majority, Socialists, and who, for various years have headed the governments of their respective countries, not above all reveal more about their shortcomings and the serious failures of the European development model which they have been promoting? Is there anything genuinely new and original about the Lisbon Summit conclusions that had not already been diagnosed and stated in the 1993 White Paper “Growth, Competitiveness, Employment”? A commitment was made at that time to, and I quote, “information networks”; today the commitment is stressed, and I quote again “to the area of knowledge and access to the information society”. In the White Paper, the stress was put on “lifelong learning and continuing training”. Now, and I quote once again, the issue is “lifelong learning”.</p>
<p class="contents">I could go on, as there are countless conclusions completely identical to those in the 1993 White Paper. There is nevertheless one aspect that deserves a particular mention in the area of policies for full employment. In 1993, the objective was to halve the number of unemployed in the European Union, from 17 million to 8.5 million. The fact is that we are now in 2000, unemployment still stands at 15 million and the summit conclusions promise us rates of almost full employment in ten years’ time. </p>
<p class="contents">This is at best politically irresponsible and displays a mentality which is quite typical of the Socialists, even for those followers of the third way, which is based on the proactive development of a strategy which, as you all know, is the product of many different factors and is ultimately based on the actions of businesses. As one well-known analyst said, Europe’s leaders have decided on something that they cannot possibly achieve. To promise, as they have done, ambitious targets for growth and employment is equivalent to announcing an increase in the population or the number of days of sunshine. We believe that the role of governments should instead be to focus on developing means to enable social and economic agents to generate wealth and to produce positive results in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect that is worthy of attention is essentially that the summit appears to have ignored the fact that the countries of the European Union have different historical backgrounds and economic and social structures. These are disparities which eastward enlargement will only accentuate, and the summit also appears to have ignored the fact that there are still imbalances that even average levels of development cannot hide. This applies to both positive and negative aspects. How can we explain, for example, that Sweden and Finland, countries with highly developed social protection systems, have levels of Internet use identical to those in the United States, that is around 50%, whilst the United Kingdom, a much more liberal country, has levels of around 29%?</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, how is it that there can still be gross disparities in the minimum wage levels of some Member States, marked differences in the quality of social security systems and in the value of retirement pensions, and even in levels of unemployment or hidden unemployment, not to mention increasingly widespread pockets of poverty and exclusion?</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union may have begun its race towards levels of development already seen in America’s economy and businesses, but this, the real Europe, will not become a reality until the convergence of national economies and internal economic and social cohesion are given top priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There was a very impressive display of rhetoric, chiefly indicative of impotence on a massive and growing scale. It is, of course, all well and good to have the strategic goal of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world with a view to creating sustainable growth. The first problem, however, is that no specific actions of any kind have been outlined which can give actual substance to this ambition. The second problem is that the social problems entailed and which (for better and, particularly, for worse) are a very significant part of actual life in the European Union have been ignored. The Presidency’s conclusions talk of “the European social model”. I am not aware of any European social model. I am familiar with a number of different models for social welfare, tied to specific national traditions. In my own country, there is a tradition which differs markedly from the dominant tradition in the European Union. The real problem is being completely ignored. This was hinted at in the negotiations prior to the intergovernmental conference, namely the problem of implementing reforms so as to create a European social model. I must issue a strong warning against doing any such thing. There is to be a commitment to majority decision-making in this area. My own country’s government opposes this, and so do we who are sceptical about this self-fulfilling development within the European Union. The most significant legacy of the European Council’s summit in Lisbon is all the unresolved problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But Lisbon is not the first summit to discuss the topic of “employment”. Since Essen, we have had numerous declarations of intent and well-meant action programmes. The only way to achieve a sustainable increase in the employment rate is to give companies the entrepreneurial room for manoeuvre which they need in the form of framework conditions. The proposed measures to promote SMEs are confined to analyses and to drafting yet more non-binding declarations of intent. Paper is cheap. Unfortunately there is a total lack of concrete results. A sustained improvement in the employment situation can only be achieved through structural reform, which means reducing the tax burden, simplifying tax systems and making it easier to incorporate a company. We are all familiar with these requirements. Everyone says, “Yes, that is quite right”. But implementation is where it falls down.</p>
<p class="contents">As an Austrian member, I must also address the sanctions of the 14 in connection with Lisbon. The ability to be democratic goes hand in hand with the ability to discuss. The efforts of the presidency to ban the subject of Austria from the agenda gave me even more food for thought. It is in the interests of the Union to clarify relations between Austria and the EU. Refusing all discussion was never a recipe for resolving a conflict. Many people back in Austria ask me “How can the peaceful house of Europe be built if the highest representatives are not on speaking terms or refuse all discussion?” These symbolic gestures are the right way to open up old wounds between people. I therefore say to everyone who declares that the sanctions are for the government but not the people, that such a separation is not possible. A democratically elected government cannot be separated from the people who elected it. This is illustrated by absurd examples such as the taxi boycott in Brussels, problems with school exchange programmes and much else besides.</p>
<p class="contents">The distrust shown towards Austria, despite the fact that it has not once violated democratic principles since 1945 stands in clear contradiction to the spirit of this Community. Judge the Austrian government by its deeds. You will not find any violation of the spirit of the Union.</p>

I am sure that we are all in broad agreement with the Lisbon Summit’s strategic objective to make Europe, and I quote, “the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth”. Nobody doubts the importance of preparing the European public for the demands of a society based on information, knowledge, and new communications technologies as strategic weapons, in order to emerge victorious in the future, generating employment with higher-quality work and higher pay. This would all be fine if the Lisbon Summit had been held specifically to discuss this kind of issue, which would mean that it should have been called the Information Society Summit, or the Knowledge Economy Summit or the New Economy Summit, according to people’s whims, taste or pretensions. To call it the Employment Summit, however, would be to depart from its real purpose. It is like putting a fake label on a product, which does not match the content. In this case, it was done out of political expediency. </p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that the objective of employment goes far beyond these issues. Firstly, the new economy, which essentially represents a challenge for this generation, cannot put a bomb under the old economy, which is the mainstay of our lives and whose modernisation and structural adjustment represent a stage that we cannot dispense with. This means that we must immediately discuss strategies for restructuring the traditional sectors of our economy, which rethinking the choices that we will have to make in relation to the guiding principles of the World Trade Organisation would require. Secondly, a strategic debate on employment would have to start with a substantial analysis of the European Union’s agents of competitiveness, because that is what sustainable economic growth depends on, and hence employment and social well-being.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that in a debate of this kind, we are bound to wonder why the EU has grown at half the rate of the United States of America over the last few years, and why no government has had the courage to question the more harmful effects of the so-called “European social model”, because, without wishing to detract from its positive aspects, this model is, to some extent, an incentive to passivity, to indolence and sloth in some elements of society, who could and should work. We should therefore ask ourselves why the level of economic reintegration into the active population has been so low amongst those who have benefited from certain support policies. This applies particularly to the “minimum guaranteed income” type of system. We must also ask ourselves why we in Europe have a system that is so state-led and so interventionist that it regulates the competitiveness of the economy in a damaging way, and which, in the guise of arguments about society and stability, sometimes conceals high-spending strategies and even, very often, strategies for helping their political cronies. These strategies certainly have a harmful effect on economic growth, on the distribution of wealth, and consequently, on employment. A far-reaching debate on the problem of employment in the European Union would inevitably, therefore, have to address these issues properly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think we will come to see in the future that all roads did lead to Lisbon via Luxembourg, Cardiff and Cologne, because Lisbon should be the end of a process, one that can actually deliver as regards the sort of priorities we want to bring to a successful conclusion throughout the whole of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The key question is how we turn the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit into action; we must ensure that we turn the rhetoric of Lisbon into a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not dwell too much on the specifics of the Lisbon Summit. A lot of us have been through that already and we welcome many of the conclusions. I want to look at the challenges that are inherent in the Lisbon process for Parliament, the Commission and, indeed, all three institutions. In particular, for Parliament there is a huge challenge in realising the full legislative implications of completing a single market. There is a challenge in realising the full potential of the <span class="italic">e-</span>economy. There is a challenge for Parliament in playing its part in helping Europe to become the dynamic centre of sustainable job creation, innovation, competitiveness and modernised social welfare.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a challenge that Parliament must rise to, working with the other institutions, Commissioner Prodi and his colleagues, and the Council. If we do not, nobody will understand or forgive us for not realising our aim. The reason, as I mentioned before the Lisbon Summit, relates to those who are in the gallery with us today – the citizens of Europe. We have to turn Lisbon into something that means something to them, something to the people in my home town of Wolverhampton.</p>
<p class="contents">To me, Lisbon is all about creating a Europe of highly-paid, highly-skilled, high-value-added jobs. If we can achieve that sort of Europe from the Lisbon process, it will be good for our citizens and for Europe as a whole, because what could be more socially just and inclusive than a Europe that genuinely benefits from full employment and good jobs that everybody can enjoy? That is our challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I thank the Portuguese presidency very much. I thank the President-in-Office, the Minister and, in particular, Prime Minister Guterres for all the personal effort he put into this process. At Lisbon the Portuguese presidency gave us the key to unlock a decade of sustained innovation, competitiveness and job creation across our continent. Now is the time for us as a Parliament, the Commission and the Council to work together to ensure that key is turned.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The policy that has been adopted could conceivably result in a high rate of growth, rivalling that of the United States, but it is unlikely to prevent social exclusion or achieve social cohesion and regional balance.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to discuss this problem, which affects fundamental European policies. The European Council ought to be aware that in Europe today, the lowest per capita income and the highest levels of employment exist side by side in the same regions or countries. This requires a European employment policy with its own budget, linked to the Structural Funds policy that the European Council does not want to blindly accept. The Council should also be aware of the fact that there are countries in Europe that are not highly developed, but which are nevertheless prepared for the knowledge economy. They have a high-quality system of technical, university and professional education, but since they do not have the necessary economic development, they are once again seeing their sons and daughters emigrate. These young people, paradoxically, are acting in the same way as computer experts who are trained in India but then go to work in the United States. The Council ought to think about this and work towards a real Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its supporters may try to make its conclusions look rosy, whether they are talking about the so-called modernisation of the European social model or about the need to make the European Union the most competitive area in the world, but they cannot hide their real aims, which are to produce a labour market free from the conditions imposed by legislation designed to protect workers’ rights, to put social security entirely in the hands of the financial markets and to speed up the process of liberalisation in fundamental sectors such as gas, electricity, postal services, transport and telecommunications.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, instead of more high-quality jobs with employment rights, instead of a reduction in working hours whilst maintaining salary levels and without flexible working arrangements, the summit’s decision will, in practice, lead to poorer jobs, which are less secure, which provide fewer rights, and do not offer an effective system of social protection. Instead of high-quality public services which meet users’ needs, protect the most vulnerable sectors of society and generate high-quality jobs, the Council has decided to speed up privatisation to satisfy the interests of economic groups and to increase their profits. This will have a harmful effect on employment and on working conditions – which will deteriorate – and on the environment and town and country planning.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to draw something positive from this, it is the major demonstration by tens of thousands of workers who condemned the growing instability of employment as they marched past the Lisbon Summit. They condemned unemployment and social exclusion and demanded more high-quality employment, better salaries, more social rights and a change of direction in European policies, in order to achieve economic and social cohesion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Following this Council meeting, in our view, the scales have tipped in favour of the freer approach, since the Lisbon conclusions declare that there is no question of adding further European regulations to those which exist already but, quite the contrary, of implementing – the expression is used several times – a new open method of coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">The knowledge economy which we are moving into is thus already having a retroactive effect on our concept of the European institutions, for this new method of coordination must mean, as we already know, that top-down authoritarian integration and uniformising regulations are to be abandoned and replaced by a system in which the States and national democracies will play a much more important role, and will combine within networks following the specific model of a computer network. The Union as such must then simply play the role of coordinator and catalyst, to use the precise word used in the Lisbon conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">This new method also entails the European Council rediscovering its fundamental strategic guidance mission, while allowing the various Councils of Ministers to take the practical decisions and the Commission to prepare and execute policy. This is the way we may finally achieve more balanced and more democratic European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon conclusions, Mr President, may, however, in other respects, give rise to a number of reservations. Since there is not much time, let me cite just one: the proactive goal of increasing the proportion of women in employment from 51% to 60% by 2010. This really is the type of authoritarian attitude which should be a thing of the past. It is not up to the authorities to say how many women must go out to work. This is a matter for the interested parties and civil society. The authorities must simply ensure that housewives receive fair treatment and that personal choices may be made freely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is true that the Lisbon Summit also represented something of a sea-change in attitudes towards the global society and in particular towards issues like <span class="italic">e-</span>commerce. At the same time there was a tension in Lisbon between the old world of the international socialists and the new world of those who have a slightly wider perspective. So the city of Henry the Navigator may become the city of Netscape the navigator, a new approach which I thoroughly welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The summit was variously described as a social summit and an <span class="italic">e-</span>summit and so on. Much was said about the economic and social policies that were supposed to emanate from Lisbon. The reality is that the European social model is now living in London and she is called Laetitia Casta. She is Marianne, the symbol of France but taxes in France are now so high that she now has to go and live in London despite the vastly increased taxation under Labour. Very soon now the government is about to raise GBP 16 billion through the sale of the third generation mobile telephone licences as Mr Suominen reminded us.</p>
<p class="contents">There is tension around Europe but at the same time I detect a sea-change. I rarely speak in debates after summits but this is an important one. I therefore look forward to some genuine action from the European Commission. It is action not words that is needed. When I talk about words, I am thinking about words like “bench-marking” and “peer review”. I am sure there are not many people in this Chamber who understand what bench-marking or peer review means. Do not worry, it is meaningless. What actually matters is a light touch on the <span class="italic">e-</span>commerce directive, a light touch on telecommunications. Give people the freedom to use the Internet to their advantage, to their benefit, for social reasons, for educational reasons, for the disabled – all the benefits the Internet can give us. We do not need the heavy regulatory touch of the past. Please Mr Prodi, ignore your friends on the Left and stick with the new world not the old world.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(EL)</span> So what is the strategy for making a success of this incredible economic transformation Lisbon is promising us? It is a strategy which is radically innovative. All those who have endeavoured to tackle the problem of the European economy so far have done so within the context of the old economy. </p>
<p class="contents">Guterres decided that the problem was practically insoluble in this context and, rather than having to contend with the deadlocks of the old economy, he decided to circumvent them altogether. It is what you might call a great inspirational strategy which proposes that Europe put all its effort into the new economy, into information technology and into telecommunications in the hope that, as this new economy develops, the old economy will take a new direction in its wake. The most basic example is employment. Europe currently has 16 million unemployed whom it cannot absorb. At the same time, there are 800 000 highly-skilled jobs in the new economy which cannot be filled due to a lack of skilled human resources. Some say these figures are set to reach 1.6 million next year. If Europe does not learn its electronic<span class="bold"> </span>lessons fast, these unfilled jobs will multiply and the economy will slump. And even if we do fill these 800 000 jobs, there will still be a further 15 million unemployed. We do not appear to have solved any problems whatsoever. </p>
<p class="contents">However, the new technologies can, with our support, lead to competitiveness and cost reductions in all sectors. And as all the other sectors become more productive, thanks to the impact of the new economy, they too will create more jobs. This is the simple yet great idea of Lisbon. The question is whether this idea will work in practice. And whether or not it will work in practice depends on whether or not we are capable of a new financial perspective in Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">All these years, Europe has been convinced that investing taxpayers’ money into the old-style economy was a waste of time. This is where all the zero deficits, stability plans and so forth come from. It is debatable just how much of ECOFIN’s die-hard approach was totally justified, but perhaps we are now in a position to leave this behind us. Lisbon may well have shown us how to leave this behind us because, if we are to attain its objectives, we need public investment in the new economy. We need to build information highways, on which private enterprises can of course then create and run their own vehicles. However, these highways can only be built by the Member States, by the public sector and by the European Union. Lisbon will be judged on this, i.e. on whether or not we are capable of integrating the public and private economies in an original and enterprising manner.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such cynicism borders on candour! The present situation, which is exceptionally advantageous to employers and the property-owning classes, arises specifically because of the extent of unemployment, the pressure that this exerts on wages and the generalisation of precariousness.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the promise to create twenty million jobs in the years to come, this is just as deceitful as it is ridiculous. The Council presented the so-called new economy as the main provider of jobs for the future, but the stock exchange crisis which occurred a few days after the Summit demonstrated just to what extent the new economy was, more than anything, the basis for old-style speculation, and that the promised jobs in information and communication technologies were, after all, just virtual jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the demonstration of Alsthom’s European workers in Brussels reminded us that the real economy, that of big business, is continuing to cut thousands of jobs and to make unemployment worse, while governments back these firms up by cutting support and allowances to the unemployed in order to force them into accepting any old job, at any price, under any conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Lisbon aroused expectations as far as rectifying these shortcomings is concerned.

In fact, seen from the perspective of employment and social policy and against the long procession of summits which preceded it, Lisbon stands out along with Luxembourg in terms of the potential it offers us. I stress the word "potential" because, as others have said, we now need to look at the follow-up. Partly that follow-up is institutional. We will be looking very carefully, for example, at how the broad economic guidelines will be prepared, at just how successful the input of the Social Affairs and Employment Council will be in emphasising the need for employment and social cohesion when it formulates the broad economic guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, we are told that each spring the European Council will consider an overall report to be produced by the Commission that will deal with structural indicators to be agreed. We wonder who will agree those structural indicators and just how strong the synthesis report to be produced by the Commission will be. What will the role of the Commission and this institution be? Will it, in fact, be largely intergovernmental? If so, I think we will be disappointed.</p>
<p class="contents">But we are not just concerned about the institutional follow-up. We are also concerned about the substance. What proposals, for example, will the Commission come forward with by June this year on social inclusion, as it was challenged to do in the Lisbon conclusions? Further than that, how quickly will the high-level group on the future of social protection begin to move into the realm of a convergence strategy for social protection that this House has called for? So we are concerned with the substantive follow-up as well.</p>
<p class="contents">One point disappoints me – that is the stance of the EPP in all this. It is trying to pretend that it welcomes the outcome because it is largely liberal and concentrates upon the liberal market aspects. It should be honest and say that, like us, it has always supported a social market economy. We welcome the emphasis upon the smooth and efficient functioning of markets. But as always we want that to be balanced by solidarity and social inclusion. I hope the group has the political honesty to accept that it continues to support that point of view.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am talking about the request to the Commission that it contemplate, for 2001, a coordinated strategy in the legislative field.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment we have, to name but a few, initiatives such as SLIM, the Business Test Panel, the Regulatory Policy Guidelines and the Better Law-Making Report, not to mention the initiatives relating to codification or the quality of legislation. Clearly this will all have to be coordinated and we will even have to go further in laying down the new regulations or restructuring the existing legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Improving quality must not only be directed at Community legislation but also at the legislation of the Member States. In all new legislation we must establish a better balance between ‘self regulation’ and ‘public regulation’, in accordance with what, in the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit, in some initiatives, has been called coregulation. We must review the ‘Best Business Impact’ initiative. Throughout the whole of this exercise, we must take account of the interests of the consumers and the interests of the environment, and these are complicated tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to simplification, the SLIM initiative requires a complete revision. We need a clear programme. We also need this programme to be applied on a national level, where there is still a lot of ‘gold plating’ of directives when they are transposed. We need expiry clauses and we need to improve codification. Codification is currently too cumbersome an instrument, too ineffective, and therefore we perhaps have to reform the Treaty. We have to tackle that reform of the Treaty. Lastly, we have to regulate more quickly and be more effective. Since we are in the Internet era, we have to take account of the fact that, in Internet terms, a year is equivalent to three months at the most. Therefore we need to make improvements in that respect as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There was particular emphasis at this summit on the European area of research and innovation, following the excellent communication from Commissioner Busquin. This is a domain of severe under-achievement in the European Union. We need deeper knowledge in science and technology.</p>
<p class="contents">We have grasped the need to rectify our lack – by means of patent protection, mapping of areas of excellence, tax incentives for research and development, an electronic network for scientists and enhanced mobility for our researchers. The sixth framework programme will be another tool.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as deeper knowledge, we need wider knowledge. We need people who have been disenfranchised in the areas of science and technology – women, older people and particularly those suffering disadvantage – to be on board in the quest for this wider knowledge. We need to use the knowledge in better ways.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we need new products and we need new processes and we need new ideas about how our society should be run. We also need new sustainable technologies. The European Socialists are fully behind the leap forward which is possible given the cogent analysis that took place at the Lisbon Summit.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Both have been profoundly anti-democratic, both have seemed opposed to enterprise and wealth creation. At the Lisbon Summit it appeared that the EU had rediscovered a commitment to enterprise. Although I have some reservations about references to the social market in the EPP resolution, I am happy to support it. Let us hope that it is carried into effect and is more than mere soundbites and press releases.</p>
<p class="contents">In direct contrast, the President of our Parliament made a remarkable speech in Lisbon which amounted to a virulent and vituperative attack on multinational companies, on liberal economics, on free markets and on the very heart of western capitalism. I have no doubt that she was prompted by the best humanitarian intentions. But we must understand that if her proposals were carried out, they would damage competitiveness and productivity, they would deter investment, they would hurt prosperity and, above all, they would increase unemployment in Europe. She was attacking nothing less than the foundations of western capitalism, the engine which has delivered wealth and success undreamed of by earlier generations.</p>
<p class="contents">She said that Europeans are quite “scandalised by untrammelled capitalism, whose relocations, social dumping, ruthless exploitation ... and remorseless pursuit of profit at the expense of working men and women have a direct and traumatic effect on their lives." This goes beyond socialism, this is pure Marxism. It may have been appropriate for the Kremlin in the 1960s but it is totally out of place in 21st century Europe. It is typical of this Parliament that we call for an end to unemployment yet we promote actions that have the opposite effect. Her remarks fit this depressing tradition perfectly. I do not know whether she was speaking for her party, for the Parliament or in a personal capacity but I absolutely reject, repudiate and condemn her remarks and am delighted to have this opportunity of publicly dissociating myself from them.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And today, now that the Council has taken place, we would like to offer our congratulations on its conclusions and to congratulate President Prodi on the way in which the Commission, under his leadership, contributed to the Council’s success through the timely presentation of its own paper.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr Gama, all such conclusions have one drawback in common: they cannot change the world overnight. Today, we have heard several speeches by Members who would like the Portuguese Presidency to come here and say “before the summit we had 15 million people unemployed and today we only have 10 million; before the summit we had 40 million people living in poverty and today there are only 30 million”. We know how difficult the real world is and how difficult it is to get the European Union to agree on a strategic objective. I would like to express a deep-felt concern here: whilst the presidency, the 15 Member States, the President of the Commission, the Commission itself, the President of the European Parliament and a substantial part of this European Parliament are agreed on an objective and on a strategic plan, the main group in Parliament is deeply divided over what it wants and over which path it should follow in the European Union. We confirm once again that we agree with this objective and that we are fully behind it, but we also wish to reiterate that the only part of the American model we are interested in pursuing is that of growth, since we do not want Europe to be a carbon copy of the American model. Nor do we want to copy the social aspects of the American model. We urge the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission to continue in their determination to fight for us to be able to create our own model from the opportunities offered by globalisation, so that the wealth generated can be used to combat poverty and can be more evenly distributed to ensure that social cohesion, full employment and sustainable development will be the outcome – in ten years’ time, but things should steadily improve up to then – of this meeting in Lisbon. Congratulations, Mr President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It appears that the socialist group only wants to hear one-sided applause and praise about everything which took place in Portugal. We too would like to congratulate you, Mr Gama. There is a certain likeness between you and your distant predecessor Vasco da Gama at Cape of Good Hope. The employment situation in Europe seems to be slightly improving. As far as this is concerned, congratulations are in order, also for the fact that many fine promises have been made. It remains to be seen whether they will materialise or not. This is not so evident as the Summit is remarkably opaque about this, especially if we consider the three most important Prime Ministers involved. First of all, Mr Blair. He makes enough noise but is destroying the British industry by setting the exchange rate for the pound far too high. The French government is drafting a definition of social policy which implies that nothing should change and, as such, will run into problems with this social policy. This is a problem too. Finally, there is Mr Schröder, who does nothing at all, so we can be very brief about him. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in a situation such as this, surely it cannot be expected from the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats that we come up with a ‘hurrah’ resolution. We are satisfied with what the Portuguese Presidency has said and brought about, but we really need to wait and see whether action will follow. We have listed a few problems. There may be reservations regarding issues which have been presented by both the liberal group and our group. However, we as the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats – and this is clearly spelled out in the resolution – proceed on the basis of the model of a social market economy, and this is what it is about. It has taken socialists a very long time to get this far and we are pleased that they are nearly there. We also hope that they will implement it efficiently. Unfortunately, we have not yet seen any evidence of this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an experience because if only half of what is regularly announced to us really happened, if Europe had already achieved the results which have now been presented to us as the slogan of the European Council – fighting unemployment and putting the European Union in the leading position on the world markets -, this alone would be a success. Has the Council still not learned how little its political promises are worth when it then fails to implement anything and trivial matters are blocked in the Council for years? Has the Council still not learned that we never solve any problems in Europe because we keep shifting them to European level? Can the Council really back out of its responsibility in the individual Member States so easily?</p>
<p class="contents">As the European Parliament, we should not accept this. The right model for successfully meeting the challenges of globalisation is competition for the most successful economic, employment, research, education and social policies, not European dumbing down. Who, if not Europe with its different traditions and cultures, can find an answer to this, provided that we leave responsibility for problem solving where it belongs, namely with the Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">It makes no sense to define European targets for economic growth if we do not remove barriers to growth at Member State level. It makes no sense to unify education policy at European level if we still have countless problems with arrangements for recognising diplomas. Even the desire to connect all schools to the Internet is not a question, which should be dealt with at European level. It needs to be done locally. As a member of the Committee on Budgets, I warn you against doing this with European funds from the European budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Lisbon missed its big chance to really improve things substantially for the citizens of Europe. Instead, all we heard were pipe dreams which can never be checked and for which the Council is responsible in the Member States, not at European level. In the end, people will take their leave of such a Europe. We must not allow that to happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that the Lisbon Summit has given us a new impulse in this respect. This is important and these are aspects which one would expect from a Summit. But it goes without saying that the merit of this Summit, at which so many good intentions were formulated and which is also based on an excellent analysis, will be judged on the action taken subsequently. Because a number of the matters which were brought together at the Summit – as, in fact, happened – had been formulated previously by the Commission. The e-commerce document springs to mind, for example. This is an existing document. Another example is the intention to draft a legislative frame for pension funds. This intention was formulated a long time ago. </p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the positive aspects of summits such as these, I would also like to make room for some criticism. These summits try to build a momentum – and it is important that they do so – but this momentum caves in because so little action is taken subsequently, as a result of which people no longer believe in the next momentum. The press now writes that the most important element of the Lisbon Summit was that it actually took place, nothing else. This is very serious. The content of the Summit was not bad, but faith in subsequent action is evidently ebbing and this is a very serious matter indeed. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to list three elements which are lacking in my opinion. Firstly, fiscal integration, which has been talked about for so long. In order to take action in the economic field, fiscal integration is required. Secondly, social security. There should be a convergence programme, a kind of guideline for social security. Thirdly, if you want to enhance employment for women, you will need to undertake some action in the care sector and not simply in the new technologies, however important they may be. The care sector will be of key significance in years to come. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I do not share the view of the British Conservatives and I would like to make this quite clear. It is important to point out that, within the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats, there are also voices other than these. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, you will perhaps have realised that I have not come here to trumpet the successes of the Lisbon European Council, because that has already been done and it would be a waste of my time and of yours if I had come here to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">What I have come here to tell you is what the Portuguese Presidency is doing to consolidate the program laid down at the Lisbon European Council and what it is doing in terms of specific programmes to boost Ecofin, the Internal Market Council, the Education Council, the Telecommunications Council and the Research Council. We already have specific programmes on which the sectoral Councils will begin work immediately. The President of the Commission, yesterday in Council and today, here in the European Parliament, has also presented a very clearly timetabled programme of actions by the Commission for implementing the e-Europe programme.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very important time for Europe to assert its identity: we have managed to control inflation at European level and in the Member States. We have managed to stabilise public expenditure, to reduce deficits and to ensure a certain level of growth. We have managed to reduce unemployment, and to launch the single currency, we are defining consistent policies for institutional reform, reform of the Council and the Commission, and we are also committed to enlargement and to building a very dynamic and innovative common security and defence policy. So we could not afford to miss this opportunity – and the Lisbon European Council did exactly what was required – to provide Europe with a certain degree of coherence in terms of a general strategy for modernising the economy and employment. We did so bearing in mind that this could not be done in an independent, self-sufficient way, but only by taking account of the fact that we are part of globalisation, that we are facing a competitive challenge on a world-wide scale and that we had to provide a European response to this challenge. This is why the Lisbon European Council surprised those with excessively ideological positions, because it did not address employment using the clichés of the past. Do you remember? Two, three, four or five years ago, the issues of unemployment and employment were only discussed in terms of two theoretical opposites: state-funded job creation, resulting in spiralling public expenditure and deficits, or job creation through unemployment, through the lay-offs caused by excessively lax social policies.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">So the Lisbon European Council marks a watershed in the way we perceive the challenges of modernising the European economy in a framework of global competition, on the one hand, and, on the other, the problems of employment itself. This Council was nevertheless firmly focused on both modernisation and employment. This is the first time that the European Union has set a goal for economic growth that is not to be imposed but which is aspirational: 3%. This is the first time that the European Union has set goals in the field of overall employment by trying to raise the overall employment rate from 61% to 70%, and employment amongst women from 51% to 70%. It is also the first time that the European Union has set goals for those parts of society that lack adequate preparation, in the 18-24 age group, and it is the first time that the European Union has set clear goals for more modern professional training, specifically professional training that will equip our citizens to address the problems of employment in a highly competitive economy and not in an economy which is old or obsolete, or in an economy based solely on manufacturing. By setting very clear goals for fiscal policies, in order to gear them towards employment, or by setting goals so that the Commission can assess the sustainability of social security policies up to 2020, the Lisbon European Council has also established a new social agenda in Europe and will even enable the next European Council to focus on something that for years the European Council has not wished to focus on – a European social agenda. What is significant is the fact that this was done without any scandal, without any great controversy, and in an absolutely consensual way.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to thank you for your speeches and to say that Lisbon European Summit marks a turning point in the way we talk about the problem of economic and social innovation. And, of course, we who were so deeply involved in preparing the Lisbon European Summit, with the cooperation of everyone, the Commission, Parliament and our social partners, now also have a duty to say to you, that if we are not to treat this issue as a caricature, now is the time for everyone to get into the frame, as anyone who wishes to go back to mere caricature will not be in the frame at all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, few words are needed to conclude this debate, for the debate itself has been extremely clear and detailed. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to start from the Mr Martinez’s happy fault when he juxtaposed the two debates: I say “happy fault” because the atmosphere of the second debate, which was on Africa, could not have been more tragically different from the Lisbon debate. The few days – hours even – which separated the two debates revealed a wealth of differences: when we talk of a new Europe, an innovative Europe, we must not forget that, across the water, there is a terrible situation in Africa which is out of control. </p>
<p class="contents">To return to Lisbon, the debate was intense and passionate because it touched on tangible subjects of major concern. However, we must be clear on one point: although we did talk in Lisbon of the new economy, we cannot divide the economy into a new economy and an old economy. Europe is like a huge seed, and its economic strength lies precisely in its tradition of operating in all sectors, both new and traditional, and excelling in the traditional sectors. Now, the spread of new technologies, which we call the new economy, acts like fermentation process, completely transforming the old economy. This is its strength. E-commerce is not a separate end in itself. The Internet and the other new tools cannot be regarded as a separate factor, but they can be translated into an enormous increase in the productivity of other sectors. When the means of distributing the most basic, simple wealth changes, the entire economy changes as well. This is the boost we were waiting for: we are now in a position to take the leap forwards, thanks to the extensive coordination achieved in Lisbon. </p>
<p class="contents">This begs another comment on Lisbon. I have observed some differences of opinion over the role of Europe and the roles of the individual States. You must understand that this is a network. The importance of the Lisbon Summit does not lie in the fact that some areas have to be managed at European level, although a certain amount of large-scale coordination of investments does have to take place at European level. Most of these innovations are the responsibility of the national, or even local governments. That is clear. The significance of Lisbon lies in the fact that, when we are united in our action, this boosts the productivity of the system. If the same countries were each to act separately, the effect would not be great enough to boost the European economy. This is the importance of these Summits: if we unite in our action, we multiply its efficiency. This is the potential significance of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is, once again, the development of human resources. This applies to both new and old economies as well. European investment in human resources is still low, and this is a huge area in which we must make up lost ground. I feel that the goal of halving the number of 18-24 year olds who attend neither a school nor a training course is both realistic and of paramount importance. This is clearly the way to overcome the problems experienced even by some of the larger European countries in recent months such as a shortage of young engineers and the need to import Internet engineers from the third world. This is clear evidence of a development block, which is due precisely to the failure to exploit our human potential. </p>
<p class="contents">In Lisbon, our policy-making action was focused mainly on this issue, and certain major horizontal decisions were adopted which engage both public opinion and our own imagination. Somebody mentioned the fact that the mobility of teachers and researchers was also discussed in Lisbon. This gives me great pleasure for few people remember it. Well, for this to occur at European level is revolutionary, although our task now is to set regulations in place to make teachers and researchers effectively mobile. This is such an unprecedented idea to emerge from the fertile European intellectual climate that, if it succeeds, it will genuinely be a great leap forwards for the productivity of Europe and the European way of thinking. In my opinion, these are the genuinely important horizontal decisions adopted in Lisbon. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we need a little bit of luck as well, for perception of this recovery is necessary for all these initiatives to be effective. We have wept and wailed on each other’s shoulders for the last three years. Either we have confidence in ourselves or we do not even attempt such measures, for what we lack is not money but confidence. There was a meeting of the Commission today on the economic previsions, and I have to say that Europe has acquired a new dimension over the last few months, in terms of employment, commercial orders and company policies. If we take into account the macroeconomic stabilisation referred to by President Gama, we have the genuine possibility of a sustained period of growth. In Lisbon, we laid the foundations for exploiting this period of growth: now it is up to us to make sure we build upon them. </p>
