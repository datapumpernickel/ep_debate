<p class="contents">Even though there were some demands that we could not get the Council to accept, I therefore recommend that all Members of this House should accept the result of the conciliation procedure and express their satisfaction with what has been achieved. Considerations of legal certainty for ports, port operators, and port workers mean that the European Union needs its first basic directive on ports. Rejection of this compromise would leave unregulated for years matters of vital importance to European transport policy, such as market access within the ports and the conditions under which ports compete with each other, and would therefore open the door to distortions of competition among ports and uncontrollable duplications of their services.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me issue a warning to those Members of this House who advocate rejection: if that were to happen, the Commission would be entitled to examine the situation in each individual port. We would do better to lay down basic rules, so that everyone knows from the outset by what rules they must abide. In particular, Parliament can count itself very fortunate that the Council has accepted its demand that the definition of self-handling should cover only the deployment of the shipping companies’ own seamen and not of its land-based staff as well. In that respect, Parliament has been able to give practical expression to the principal concerns of both the operators of ports and of the people who work in them.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve a compromise, on the other hand, Parliament’s delegation had to abandon its demand for a general requirement for prior authorisation for port services. The Council wants to follow the subsidiarity principle and leave this in the competence of the Member States. Our side was nonetheless able to gain acceptance for the idea that the Member States should be able to ensure that the competent authority can insist on prior authorisation for the provision of port services, so this is still left to the Member States’ discretion. Finally, the Council accepted Parliament’s amendments on periods and conditions for authorisations and transitional arrangements, in which Parliament has ensured that interests in ownership are put on an equivalent footing to leasing arrangements. Parliament’s delegation has also achieved acceptance for the requirement that authorisations be amended or abrogated where the criteria for authorisation or for the social security regulations to apply are not complied with in substance. It must therefore be noted that we have taken up an unambiguous position on the social conditions of port workers, and have done a splendid job of it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also accepted that the Member States have to enact regulations whereby the newly-authorised service providers are obliged to make appropriate compensation payments to former service providers, but – and this is something with which we are not very satisfied – the Council wants this to be restricted to those instances in which the period of validity of their authorisations is reduced as a result of the new directive. One can see a certain logic in this. In all other cases, the legislation of the individual States is to be applicable.</p>
<p class="contents">One aspect of the overall compromise that Parliament was obliged to accept with some regret was that pilotage services remain within the scope of the directive. This was, however, made acceptable by the Council and Parliament’s joint and particular emphasis on the importance of pilotage services in terms of safety and the protection of the environment, and the fact that the competent authorities can, on grounds of public safety, continue to restrict pilotage to one single service provider. Parliament eventually managed to delete the limited duration of authorisation for pilotage services, for which the Council had provided.</p>
<p class="contents">I think Parliament broke new ground in managing to get the objectives of the directive extended by adding to them the creation of fair conditions of competition in and between ports. To this end, ports and the providers of port services are obliged to disclose to the Commission and to the Member States the financial relations between themselves and public undertakings. For its part, the Commission is required to draw the necessary conclusions from this with regard to removing distortions of competition, and it has already indicated its readiness to enact explicit directives concerning the degree to which public funding in ports is permissible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to note, by way of summary, that this outcome from the conciliation procedure is a great success for all of us in view of the wholly negative stance initially adopted by the Council. I would like, in particular, to thank the Italian presidency of the Council and the Vice-President for enabling us to take this problematic dossier to what I regard as a good conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Please permit me to make the following final observation. We are dealing here not only with single issues relating to ports. What is at stake here is ability of the EU’s ports to compete, being as they are crucially important as nodal points in the trans-European networks. We all share in the task of making these ports more efficient, and so I ask you to accept the outcome of the conciliation procedure and endorse it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me in particular to thank the chairman of the Conciliation Committee, Mr Imbeni, and the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, for the hard work they have undertaken on such a complex issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The House is being asked to vote on a compromise approved by the Conciliation Committee. I would like to say very clearly that the Commission supports this compromise; although I know that certain honourable Members are opposed to it, I would like to ask you to reflect before rejecting this compromise. I believe this compromise is essential to European transport policy.</p>
<p class="contents">This compromise does not mean a complete liberalisation of port services, as I have heard throughout the previous debate. Far from it. All it means is a small degree of openness so that certain types of service can be carried out by means of self-handling, that is to say, only using on-board personnel.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, every day we talk about wanting transport which respects the environment and which is sustainable, that we want to promote short sea shipping, so we cannot then vote the next day against a measure which is going to facilitate the development of this type of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like to say to you is that we must be coherent with the proposals we make. The proposal we are voting on, particularly in the form it now takes following the discussions in Parliament, following Parliament’s amendments, following the negotiations with the Council, is a very balanced and very moderate proposal, but it can clearly serve to promote maritime cabotage, something which is essential to guaranteeing a sustainable transport system in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had three years of negotiations and I simply believe that rejecting this initiative would cause very serious problems for transport policy in the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you of some of the aspects of the text which will be put to the vote on Thursday. The initial proposal was limited to rules applicable within a given port. Well, Parliament firmly insisted on the need to address the issue of competition between ports and this point, which the Commission accepted, has been corrected in the final text, in agreement with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s initial proposal referred to self-handling with on-board and land-based personnel. It is true; we opened up the issue of self-handling for companies with land-based personnel. Parliament raised two types of issue: one, the social guarantees to prevent social dumping, an issue which the Commission accepted, and two: restricting even further the margin of this self-handling and reducing it to on-board personnel.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment we are only talking about on-board personnel. It is obvious that this self-handling by on-board personnel is going to function with short distance transport. It is not going to function with the great trans-ocean forms of transport because of the type of goods transported and the type of ship used.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore talking about something that is key to the development of short distance transport. Parliament's position is therefore maintained and self-handling has been restricted to on-board personnel. And, furthermore, with the social guarantees I referred to earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">In the initial proposal pilotage was considered a commercial service subject to all the rules. Parliament proposed its exclusion and in the end we have reached an agreement which means a degree of openness with regard to pilotage. But, let us make it very clear that we are not liberalising the piloting service. What we are talking about is, for example – and once again we are talking about cabotage and short sea shipping – the captain who uses a route on a daily basis, or two or three times a week, who knows the route perfectly, being able possibly to obtain authorisation not to require pilotage. We are talking about a measure which is key to short sea shipping<span class="italic">. </span>This is not going to affect trans-ocean traffic in which the ship docks at the same port once, twice or five times a year. This issue only affects those ships which have regular routes, that is, once again, the issue of short sea shipping.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say, ladies and gentlemen, that the Commission has been enormously flexible throughout this discussion. We believe that some of the measures proposed by the honourable Members have improved the texts – I have not referred to them, because they were not controversial. Others, which raised or reflected problems, even of a political nature, we have tried to balance as far as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">What remains in the end is the minimum, but it is a vital minimum, and I would like to insist on this point, vital in order to be able to promote cabotage, essentially cabotage within the European Union. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I would ask for your support, for your vote, for this compromise proposal which was reached the other day in the Conciliation Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like once again to thank Mr Imbeni and of course Mr Jarzembowski for their work throughout this time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would be strange if this Parliament, which has been at the vanguard of opening up these services, came along tomorrow and said, for incomprehensible reasons – to me at least – that there must be an exception from this long line of action to open up all these services to competition and that the exception was port services.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day, as Mrs de Palacio said, numerous positions expressed by Parliament were accepted during discussions with the Council. Pilotage services, which are an exception, self-handling, which has been restricted to on board ship, competition between ports, where basically Parliament's position was accepted, while the Commission – at the beginning of the procedure at least – was against. Protecting employment rights, where there is an express provision in the directive that we cannot have a lower level of protection than that which exists in each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I at least honestly fail to understand why certain people continue to oppose what we have achieved which, it should be pointed out, does not make industry absolutely happy, especially the shipowners, who wanted something bolder. I, for my part, think that this compromise which we have before us serves the interests of industry to a certain degree in that there are other service providers – it breaks the monopoly and there is greater choice – and it serves the workers, because in this way new companies are being created and new companies mean new jobs. Consequently, it is a step forward, which is why we must support the outcome of the conciliation and vote yes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

German ports, at any rate, are currently enjoying impressive growth, and doing so without this directive. Things can evidently go the other way. This week, this House has had the great opportunity to make it clear that, far from us being the Council’s agent, our primary obligation is to people, citizens and workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you: at second reading stage, all of us in this House, by very, very large majorities, joined together in calling for three important things: we wanted the ports’ financial relations to be made transparent and put on a regulated footing, and that has, in part, been achieved. We wanted pilotage services in shipping not to be just any port service like tugboats or mooring, subject to the prevalent great economic pressure that there is in ports, and not to be subject to competition but committed to safety. Being a special public task, pilotage services do not belong in this directive, but we have not managed to keep them out of it. One very important point is that we wanted self-handling to be restricted to the ship and its crew, but with discretionary approval and with decent conditions in terms of social security and labour law. Let me quote once again: ‘Self-handlers shall be treated in the same way as other port service providers. To this end, self-handlers must adhere to the same standards of social protection and possess the same vocational qualifications as other service providers in the same, or a similar, port system.’ That is what the Council rejected; that is what we failed to achieve. We cannot, then, describe this as a fair compromise; it is more like kow-towing to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">If, then, you want the pilots, who guide ships safely into our ports, to continue to have obligations in terms of safety and the environment, then you have to reject what has come out of this conciliation procedure. If you want to deny social dumping a foothold in our ports, and want instead to enable qualified workers to operate under good social conditions; if you want social harmony to be maintained in our ports, then you have to reject this directive. I am all in favour of looking at these compromises to see if the glass is half full or half empty, but, in this instance, the glass is not half-full of water; it contains just a few drops for Parliament, and I can tell the Council that it cannot be in Parliament’s interest to start by taking up a firm position and then being satisfied with little. This is not just about the matter in hand, but also, in this instance, about our conception of our parliamentary function. That is why I strongly urge – as does my group – that we reject the whole thing.</p>

Not everyone is pleased with it. The result is a step forward in the European maritime sector. I should like to thank Mr Jarzembowski for the fact that he has still achieved a certain result.</p>
<p class="contents">It will not have escaped anyone’s attention that this topic has unleashed strong emotions; that is quite clear from the dockworkers’ demonstrations here in Brussels, and even in Rotterdam. I should like to touch upon those demonstrations. The demonstrators have made good use of their democratic right to inform us as MEPs fully and effectively. I welcome the idea of demonstrating to press home a message. However, it is regrettable if this degenerates into causing destruction, disturbance, threatening people and suppressing other views. I have first-hand experience of the uncomfortable feeling one is left with if one adopts a stance that deviates from theirs. This is very unfortunate. As a result, people are forced into excessive action and mudslinging.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, something has been achieved – a legal framework that allows for clear and transparent relations between ports, authorities and service providers, with transparency in the use of public funds to finance ports and the agreement to draft a clear guideline on the reconcilability of state support with European law.</p>
<p class="contents">Pilotage services have been included after all, together with the option of self-handling, which, to my mind, is too restricted. Shipping companies have acquired more entrepreneurial room, which they need in order to secure a good return on investments. More room means growth and employment. More jobs, that is the best social policy, in general. In Parliament, we have very little say in the quality of the work. We should, therefore, not turn this into our ambition. In the Netherlands, where a great deal of port work is done, progress is being made and industrial peace has been reasonably limited. In order to remove the concerns surrounding the enhanced self-handling possibilities in shipping companies, quayside service providers and trade unions, I have received written pledges from both the Social Affairs Minister and the Transport Minister, our former fellow MEP, Mrs Peijs, that they want to create new policy to put strict guarantees in place to ensure that Dutch labour law is observed in the ports. Pledges of that kind should also be possible elsewhere. In short, we are making progress, and the Liberals will be predominantly voting in favour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Meijer (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, seagoing shipping and ports offer more scope for abuse than many other businesses. They involve the handling of cross-border flows of goods between different states, not only within the European Union but also across the entire world. Those countries do not only differ in terms of legislation, but, above all, in terms of reward of labour, working conditions, safety and the extent of environmental protection. Such differences are eagerly seized on by those who see social dumping and environmental pollution as ways of winning a competitive battle.</p>
<p class="contents">For many years in seagoing shipping, we have known the phenomenon of flags of convenience, whereby ships of European owners are given a registration in a developing-world country. As a result, they pay lower taxes, need not comply with many rules and can hire crews at developing-world salaries. Enterprises in ownership of EU citizens compete with each other through the international jungle. The fact that to date, that jungle in the European ports has been kept outside of the door as much as possible is no coincidence. Without extensive battles fought by trade unions and without local port companies, ports of convenience would have taken root a long time ago. These are ports with an ever-lower level of pay, safety and environmental protection; ports that can offer only temporary jobs, which are dirty and unsafe and, above all, attract unskilled labourers; ports where much of the work can be done by people from the developing world who are not admitted to Europe for other on-shore work. In a competitive battle of this kind, ports that service a common hinterland will destroy each other. The winner will always be the most anti-social, the most environmentally-unfriendly, the most unsafe, and consequently, the port of greatest convenience.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union wishes to harmonise rules for port labour, these must be geared to eliminating unfair and dangerous competition per group of ports that serve a common hinterland. This problem is particularly acute for the ports surrounding the North Sea, from Dunkirk, in France, via the Belgian and Dutch ports to Hamburg, in Germany. Railways, rivers and canals connect those ports with largely the same industrial areas and with cities brimming with consumers. For a long time, those ports have been trying to steal each others’ customers by means of large government investments, low rates and a great deal of stealth. In the previous part-session, this Parliament stated that something should, in fact, be done about this by means of a port directive, one that would offer the highest level of protection for registered and qualified port labour across Europe, and which would prevent shipping accidents as a result of faults during loading, as happened with the Danish freight ship <span class="italic">Karin Cat</span> in February. A port directive of that kind would be in keeping with a number of recent environmental measures of the European Union that are aimed at making it more difficult to dump shipping waste and freight residues at sea and, in time, at keeping away single-hulled tankers from European ports.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, the Commission has proposed a directive that leads to the opposite. By hindering, or reducing, existing protection of registered port labour against unfair competition at Member State level, this competition is only set to increase. Maybe the port handling costs of goods will be reduced as a result, but these only formed a negligibly small part of the production costs in most cases anyway.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament corrected these plans both at first reading two years ago and at second reading in March. Admittedly, this correction did not go as far as the trade unions wanted, and scope for abuse remained, but the parties involved with different interests appeared to be able to live with this to some degree. That is no longer the case since the Council of Transport Ministers refused systematically last summer to adopt those corrections. During conciliation, the parliamentary delegation initially appeared determined to persist in the view previously adopted by Parliament. This applied not only to the groups of the Left, but I also heard this from Christian Democrats and Liberals.</p>
<p class="contents">On 29 September, most of those objections had suddenly evaporated. In exchange for a further study into competition and a text which juggles with the words ‘may’ and ‘must’, eight of the fifteen Members have surrendered what Parliament had achieved. The fact that a directive is coming into being was suddenly more important than its exact content. The ultimate proposal is very reminiscent of Spanish and Italian acts concerning monopoly ports with a small hinterland around the Mediterranean. The application to other parts of Europe will lead to more industrial disputes and abuse, particularly in the North Sea ports. On various occasions, port labourers in the present and future Member States have made it clear in great numbers that they find this unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these conditions, the directive is counterproductive and should therefore not be adopted. This proposal should be rejected on Thursday.</p>

The Green Paper on ports was clear, because it was determined to tackle competition among ports, particularly unfair competition and the implications of this unfair competition on the environment when new terminals are built. Ultimately, we ended up with a directive on competition in ports and the opening up of markets to new service providers. Examining what has come out of the conciliation procedure, we have to say that the balance is not favourable. It does not include the compulsory authorisations that had been requested for new service providers with regard to social, environmental and other requirements, such as safety. A definition of self-handling is missing, because reference is made to own crews, which leaves plenty of scope in current labour relations at most ports. Enough has been said about pilotage. Transparency too, so adulated by Mr Jarzembowski, is in our view, a step forward, but it does not come close to what we had previously asked for.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, the proposal is unacceptable, certainly bearing in mind the ILO treaties with regard to poor working and labour conditions, and safety. There is a considerable risk of these ports turning into ports of convenience. Taking all views into consideration, we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance reject this compromise as a proposal that fails to strike the right balance. Liberalisation is not a panacea and, as Mrs de Palacio suggested, rejecting the proposal does not pose any problems whatsoever to others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In view of the very close vote – eight votes in favour and seven against – we are not alone. Mr Jarzembowski has, however, brought all his considerable powers of persuasion to bear.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we were automatically in agreement with the search for increased efficiency in order to face the challenge of becoming competitive in a globalised economy, we did not want this to be done in any old way, with a single and final objective: the total liberalisation of port services. Technical, social and environmental security must in fact remain the objective to be preserved, whatever the reform implemented. Now, if pilotage has been, on the surface of it, preserved from unbridled competition, the freedom given to each state seems to us to be too great and to contradict the notion of public service, a characteristic that the services in question are acknowledged as possessing, whether by the states themselves or by the Court of Justice of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Where self-handling is concerned, social and environmental security could, in the same way, be impaired by shipowners directly employing their own equipment and their own staff, who would be inexperienced, untrained and employed on a casual basis. It is unlikely that employees’ social protection and the constraints of optimum security count for very much faced with the search for financial profitability obtained through cheap labour. Whereas the whole chain of services – pilotage, mooring and unloading – requires professionals skilled in these types of activity so as to avoid any risk of accident, self-handling would involve a levelling down of the services provided, as well as of professional qualifications and environmental security, and would also entail a social cost linked to job losses.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we reject the creation of ports of convenience and self-handling at terminals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Flanders, thousands of people are anxiously waiting this week to see whether they will have a job in a few months’ time. That, and nothing else, is the bottom line of the report we are debating again today. The fact is that, for thousands of Flemish dockworkers, liberalisation in this context means nothing more than unemployment and social misery. By blindly believing its own ideology and ignoring any serious consultation with the parties involved, the Commission proves once again that it could not give a damn about the subsidiarity principle with which the prophets of the ‘Europe of milk and honey’ have bombarded us since Maastricht. Indeed, in the context of this issue, the Commission is tampering with traditions which, for decades, have made the name and fame of the Flemish ports across the world. With Thursday’s vote on this report, Europe is at risk of wiping out tens of years of social peace in the Flemish ports in the name of an ultra-Liberal ideology, which is at risk of creating the opposite of what it intends to do.</p>
<p class="contents">The liberalisation of particularly energy and rail transport has shown in Flanders, for example, but also in Great Britain, that it can also adversely impact on competition, job quality and the provision of services. Liberalisation of this kind could have pernicious consequences for our ports, their competitiveness, their employment and their provision of services. However, it is not too late.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that on Thursday, all MEPs, whatever group or persuasion they belong to across the political spectrum, will consider the precarious situation of the dockworkers in Antwerp, Zeebrugge and Ghent, but also in the other European ports. I therefore hope that there will be a massive vote against this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What was the case where security was concerned is, unfortunately, all the more the case in the social sphere.</p>
<p class="contents">We all now know that crews are particularly mixed, both in terms of nationalities and also of social and geographic origins. In these conditions, self-handling amounts to introducing the social jungle of the maritime sphere into our ports. Naturally, the problem it presents is basically one of monitoring compliance with the social rules of both the recipient country and the port. Who will argue convincingly that, because they have stepped out into a port at which their ship has just called, two Filipinos, three Malays, two Argentinians and one African engaged in self-handling will respect the same social rules that apply in the country in which that port is located?</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, that is how dock workers – and not simply dock workers but also dock work companies throughout Europe – have realised that the desire was now to engage in competition through social dumping, that is to say by resorting to the social break-up of an entire profession, whether it be public or private. That is why we cannot agree to set the fox to mind the geese. What is necessary, rather – and all the populations would understand this – is that a genuine assault be made upon the anarchy that prevails when it comes to flags and crews reduced to slavery and that it be ensured that all of the rules are applied, rules that are totally circumvented by the majority of countries in the International Maritime Organisation which, as everyone knows, are pirate countries, no less than the shipowners who are nationals of them are pirates.</p>
<p class="contents">If the ability existed to restore order and also to harmonise the fiscal and social conditions in all our own countries – and this is valid not only in the maritime sphere but also in that of heavy goods vehicles – then, certainly, a directive such as this would acquire credibility, and it would then be possible to talk about fair competition. Unfortunately, it is, rather, a form of social break-up that you are proposing to us and, in these conditions, we cannot take the risk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We had approved this in Parliament at second reading, but it is not included in the compromise. A competent authority is entitled to apply for an authorisation, but it is not required to do so, and I see that as a key issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Both at first and at second reading, I worked hard to improve the article on authorisations, even with the help of the Commissioner in a number of areas. Both at first and at second reading, we managed to improve this licensing system. Despite this, Mr Jarzembowski, I have a feeling that we could have gone a little further during conciliation, and that we perhaps should have spent all of our time creating a better text on that score too.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, in any case, in favour of free port services. In my opinion, everyone should be able to offer their services there, but these free services should be counterbalanced by a licensing system which should be regulated in such a way that we can make our own demands in the areas of environment, public services and, last but not least, social legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Flemish ports, relations among dock workers, employers and dock installations have deteriorated a great deal over the past eighteen months. Whatever the result of next Thursday’s vote may be, this worsening situation will need to be addressed with or without a directive. I would therefore ask everyone involved to gather around the negotiating table in order to discuss the future of our ports and to ensure that it is not jeopardised, with or without a directive.</p>

I continue to think that it is a liberal directive that has one sole priority: the reduction of costs, to the detriment of security, employment and the quality of services.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the major problem lies with self-handling. Even with self-handling restricted to on-board crew and always assuming that, as remains to be seen, this will have no effect upon the social legislation of the Member States, ships’ crews or specially taken-on workers will, as you pointed out, be able to carry out loading and unloading operations in place of current qualified staff. Whether one likes it or not, self-handling amounts to allowing social dumping, even if it is now accompanied by references to security and to staff being qualified. Such a system would be dangerous to people because it would permit practices prejudicial to security: insufficient qualifications, ignorance of the locality and of instructions, a lack of understanding of the language and insufficient training. Any shipowner would, in this way, be able to call upon cheap labour, which would be dangerous for the ports and their environment. This problem also affects professions other than dock work, particularly those of the inshore and other pilots excluded in the first version and those connected with towing, which are subject to constraints in relation to the port authorities. I would add that, because the Council did not hold back the authorisations that had to be requested by the owners before having recourse to self-handling, the result will, as my fellow MEP Mr Savary said, be the introduction of the law of the jungle into the whole sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Uncertainty is in this way being brought to bear upon all the qualified staff who until now have contributed to port security: the dockers who fulfil a very important economic task in difficult conditions by preserving security; and nautical services such as inshore and other pilotage services, universally recognised as services of general interest. All these sectors should be considered as essential partners contributing to the objective of maritime security and sustainable development. The proposal submitted to us cannot but have serious social consequences in the ports, and where employment too is concerned. There has been no genuine consultation of the interested parties. We are today being asked to vote in favour of a text that is rejected by all the professionals working in the ports. This is, it has to be said, a curious conception of democracy. Yesterday evening, here even in Strasbourg, employee representatives again met the groups to explain to them their points of view and to sound the alert. I think we must not remain deaf to this alert. These people have arguments we have to listen to.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I am anxious, finally, to say that I think it is impossible to reflect upon this directive by removing it from the context of our debates on maritime security. Our Parliament has come out in favour of a temporary committee of inquiry on the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. We have had a lot of discussion in this House of the various measures in favour of maritime security and, Commissioner, you have put forward rational proposals. Personally, I never forget that, in the various meetings I was able to have on the French coast, all the maritime professionals always insisted, following the damage caused by the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, that security began in the ports. You spoke about coherence. Having said that, I find there is incredible incoherence in taking, on the one hand, positive measures concerning maritime security and, on the other hand, effectively destroying these with the decision on self-handling. In the interests of security, employment and the sustainable development of the European ports, we have to reject this document. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfair competition among ports should therefore be avoided, and we can imagine a directive to this effect, but it has not been drafted yet. However, the fight should not lead to a lack of security, social dumping and environmental pollution in ports. Self-handling that has been proposed in this forum, even in its watered-down version, constitutes a serious infringement of this. In this light, the European Parliament would have liked to make self-handling dependent on a real compulsory authorisation and omit the pilotage services from the competitive battle. It is therefore very unfortunate that neither the Council nor the Commission acted upon the compromise that was struck in Parliament. Despite two and a half years of discussion, the camps are diametrically opposed to each other. We are in favour of a breach in social tradition in our ports. After the ships of convenience, we are now also being faced with ports of convenience<span class="italic">. </span>This fear is not only present among port workers, but also among those who are concerned about social peace in our ports, which is being jeopardised by your directive, Mrs Miguélez Ramos. This push for liberalisation is currently presenting more risks than benefits in our ports. We will therefore vote against it, and do so emphatically. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If I compare this with the end result of the conciliation procedure, it is evident that the agreement with the Council focuses on elements other than those regarded as the most important by Parliament. By accepting commitments concerning studies into competition, we have actually attained competition within ports. This exchange is anything but fair. This agreement is an unfair distribution of joys and burdens across employers and employees. Other transport sectors have demonstrated the need for minimising the risks in the area of social maladministration. This has not happened here, although there is a need. I take the view that a general authorisation obligation would serve this purpose much more effectively. Given our aspiration to adopt sustainable transport policy and systems for businesses, staff and society alike, I am thus unable to support the result that the committee is tabling here today.</p>

<p class="contents">I am genuinely surprised by today's debate, because it appears that we are pitting the social Europe of the nineteenth century against a form of capitalism and the Mafia activities of the Chicago of the 1920s in our ports. And in fact what we want is precisely the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the twenty-first century. We want a modern and effective social Europe.

The Europe of the nineteenth century, the Europe which reflects the Chicago of the Twenties, is not my Europe. Perhaps some people want that. Perhaps that is what some people want to maintain. Naturally, we are not going to support it and we are going to vote in favour of conciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the Commissioner on having maintained the objective of modernising our ports, the will of the rapporteur and the will of certain parliamentary groups which have defended, despite the absolutely unacceptable pressure they have received from certain workers in European ports, the modernisation and competitiveness of our ports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Directive that is now in front of us following conciliation states that ports may introduce a system of authorisations, and then, in particular, for ports doing loading and unloading work themselves. The Jarzembowski report, which we adopted earlier at second reading, still states that ports <span class="italic">must</span> introduce a system of authorisations. A significant part of the compromise text differs from the text adopted at second reading. The difference between ‘may’ and ‘must’ has significant implications for ports and dockers in Europe. A non-compulsory authorisation system promotes unfair competition, which can harm quality of employment in the ports that do have a good authorisation system. Surely that was not the intention of this liberalisation. Second-class ports would remain, and the unfair competition resulting from this could harm quality of employment in the well-organised ports.</p>
<p class="contents">One point has always taken priority in my party, the Dutch Labour Party, and that is our minimum. The scenario of ports doing loading and unloading themselves must be well regulated by means of a good authorisation system that applies across the board. This was conceded in the conciliation procedure. There is now to be no compulsory authorisation system for self-handling. In short, genuine harmonisation on a key issue such as ports doing their own loading and unloading is out of the question, as a result of which there can be different regimes in different ports. It has thus become a bad example of liberalisation. It is remarkable, however, that the EU is able to lay down detailed rules for all and sundry in many situations, but has proved unable to do so in this case, where job quality is concerned. We have to explain that once again to those people whose interests are at issue here. It will surprise no one, therefore, having heard my speech, that my group has no choice but to vote against this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposed compromise is a cautious step towards opening up the market in port services and increasing transparency in ports. The compromise is not the best possible one, but is nevertheless an acceptable solution. Including pilotage services within the scope of the directive is problematic, especially in areas that are sensitive in terms of safety at sea and the environment. The compromise honed in the conciliation procedure is, however, acceptable in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of ports as transport hubs in the development of the transport system throughout the Union. Opening up ports to controlled, healthy competition and increasing their transparency will improve their competitiveness and levels of efficiency, which will increase the use of combined and maritime transport. Maritime transport is vital for overseas regions and it offers a more environmentally friendly alternative in congested areas.

You, Commissioner, have argued that we will, by means of this directive, influence transport policy towards sustainability. I would very much like to remind you what sustainability means. It was specified at Göteborg that sustainability is an equilateral triangle of the economic, the ecological and the social. Let me just ask you a simple question: in what way were you promoting sustainability when, by means of this directive, you are jeopardising safety in ports? It can make for worse damage to the environment and does nothing to improve the protection of it. In what way are you strengthening the social element when you allow self-handling, which means that the ship’s crew, who have been travelling on it for so long, now, in addition, have to load and unload it? Qualifications and the reduction of working time do not come into it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hatzidakis’ argument that new jobs will be created is crazy. I beg you, if the same jobs are done by people who already have other things to do, that reduces jobs rather than encouraging the creation of additional ones. It also goes against the Lisbon agenda if we want to achieve full employment by 2012, but keep going in the opposite direction. I have to tell you in all honesty, Commissioner, that I really would have expected you to look at these aspects from the right angle. What you said was completely one-sided, and, as you said, it indicates that you want to let liberalisation advance.</p>
<p class="contents">If that is what you see as your objective, then it is in order for you to just say so. Then it will be perfectly clear that we can never find a common denominator, because, for you, liberalisation means nothing more than cutting costs in the economic sphere. You may well claim that it is about that, but I do not, and nor does my group.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the port workers and the pilots, you have, in the course of the debate we have had – and Mr Jarzembowski knows this too – met some of our expectations, but not others. At the end, after the conciliation process, absolutely none of the people affected are on your side – none whatever! Yesterday, we were again visited by the port workers, whose 21 000 signatures make up an extraordinary amount for this occupation, and you do not even take note of it! That means, I believe, that this directive, rather than promoting safety and social standards and thereby putting competition on a single footing, is achieving the precise opposite. For that reason, we can do no other than reject it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In fact, this is a bad example to the world. We as Europeans are always trying to outdo others with our social standards. If this is adopted, however, we shall be promoting negative globalisation and social disintegration. Anyone who thinks that the present text still presents a chance of putting a brake on the downward spiral is mistaken. That will soon become clear, because competition between ports is ruthless. Without strict conditions, self-handling will be the kiss of death for ordinary dockers. This text is bad news for pilots, too. On the contrary, we want more compulsory pilotage. Risks are ever-increasing on account of the shipping routes becoming busier, and also of maritime personnel being less well trained. The <span class="italic">Tricolor </span>off the Flemish coast was a chilling example of this. There have also been more than 60 near collisions.

<p class="contents">None of the important changes adopted by Parliament at second reading of the Commission’s proposal can in any way be found in the conciliation document. For example, the right to demand on a national basis that collective agreements be adhered to has been completely disregarded. Furthermore, liberalisation now also extends to include the pilots.</p>
<p class="contents">If Parliament votes in favour of the proposal, the shipowners will interpret it themselves and be free to decide at whim whether to use seamen or port workers, just as entrepreneurs and shipowners will be able to sit loose to hard-won rights and collective wage agreements. Both will be free to choose whom they want to work for them, and they will be able to use unorganised and underpaid labour for loading and unloading ships, rather than use well-trained port workers who, through agreements, have secured their entitlement to the work and to proper conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The consequence will be unemployed port workers, together with ports of convenience consonant with our now seeing ships sailing under flags of convenience. Liberalisation is also partly responsible for undermining port security at a time when major investments are otherwise being made in securing the ports against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">In Denmark, it is not only the case of the 1 500 or so port workers that is on the agenda. It is the Danish model for agreements that is in danger. That is the principle involved in how far the EU should go in harmonising, and intervening in, wage and working conditions. It is quite conceivable that other groups of workers will be up for consideration. It is therefore important for a line to be drawn in the sand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am fundamentally convinced of the advantages of creating a clear, open and transparent common legal framework. I am convinced that competition between ports demands the continuation of a purpose-built framework and of certain rules, not least for the sake of the workers and of our environment. This, then, is the great objective towards which we are progressing together. Members of this House, led by the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, have got seriously stuck in to the readings and have framed a large number of amendments to make the objective a clearer and fairer one. A conciliation procedure is not a walkover, and I know from experience that you never come from one with a full bag of goodies. Nonetheless, we have to rigorously examine what has come out of conciliation, and each of us must carefully consider whether we can be satisfied with it and whether we can defend it to the people back home. As I see it, the Council has moved far too little. It is the Council that must take responsibility, and I have to say that I am particularly thinking of the German Government when I say that.</p>
<p class="contents">On Thursday, then, will be the hour of decision. Every one of us will have to face questions: What is now the real situation as regards balance? What about compensation payments and adjustments? Let me remind you of Article 12. I have to concede that, time and time again, I find myself admiring Mr Jarzembowski’s negotiating skills, but, even so, in this instance, I cannot forget the interests of many small ports, coming as I do from Cuxhaven, which is one of them. Some global players may be satisfied, but I am not. I do not want to leave it to the nation states to sort out the compensation payments in a way that is as yet unclear, particularly as nothing has been laid down. That may be just a point of criticism, but it is a decisive one. I admit that I am still struggling with the directive, and with myself, but will the people at home understand that?</p>

I wonder whether we all agree on the importance of ports in terms of organising European transport. I believe not, that everybody has a different approach. Mine is that ports are fundamental to the organisation of European transport, and I am not referring to maritime transport, but to transport as a whole and, essentially, road transport.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the questions arising from this organisation of maritime transport is – this question has been asked here – whether or not it is sustainable to try to regulate and liberalise ports. When we talk about whether it is possible to operate a sustainable transport system it is clear that, if we do not accept that one of the conditions for the sustainability of transport is a huge increase in the capacity of ports, we are moving in the opposite direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore argue that it is absolutely essential that ports take on an infinitely greater role than the one they play at the moment, and that the environmental contribution of that transformation would be so immense that it would allow us to a large extent to resolve the great over-burden, the enormous insecurity, which is much greater than anything that can be resolved in the field of ports, and the great pollution which is currently generated by other forms of transport. But we are divided on a directive which in theory pursues a reasonable objective, decided on by Parliament, which is to liberalise the various transport sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">I have defended Mr Jarzembowski on numerous occasions, saying that he is a constant, determined, efficient and intelligent Member of Parliament, but, on this occasion, I must say that his approach as rapporteur has been erratic and, as a result of this constant change in position, we have come to a situation of genuine confrontation in relation to a directive on which Parliament should be united.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore ask that, if this directive is approved tomorrow, we continue to improve it, and that, if it is not approved, we begin to work on the next one on the basis of all the information and with greater realism than we have demonstrated so far. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The amendments adopted by Parliament during its reading of the report were a serviceable compromise between those who want a total liberalisation of port services and those who think we should take account of our workers. Unfortunately, little remains of Parliament’s amendments, which means that European port workers will face an uncertain future if the compromise is adopted. If we accept the compromise, port workers will lose their jobs, simply because seafarers on ships calling at EU ports have been allowed to handle cargoes. In that way, the EU will lose a large number of jobs. We do not want ports of convenience, just as we do not want ships sailing under flags of convenience. In Scandinavia, we have seen examples of port workers refusing to handle goods from ships on which the working and wage conditions were not in order. Now, an attempt is being made to get rid of this solidarity by means of a bad piece of EU legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Those campaigning for liberalisation say that not so many people are in any case employed on modern ships and that the Port Directive will not therefore mean fewer port workers. It is, however, precisely because there are not especially many people employed on modern ships that we should leave it to the competent port workers to ensure that cargoes are handled properly. Parliament’s demand for certification has, moreover, been squeezed out of the wording of the directive in the course of the conciliation committee’s work. We are now therefore opening the door to poorly trained labour that may jeopardise port security.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about security in EU ports, there are two considerations to be borne in mind, namely the security of people who work in the ports and the security of the goods handled. I myself come from a seaport in Denmark, and I am very familiar indeed with the problems. We have solved them by cooperating with the larger neighbouring ports. We divide up the amount of goods and, in that way, ensure optimum use of the different ports, at the same time as preserving free competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I would call upon everyone to vote against the compromise, for where would the unemployed port workers go? What training opportunities do they have? To my fellow MEP, Mrs Langenhagen, who was in some doubt as to how she should vote, I have to say that she should vote according to her conviction and not follow group discipline. It is too bad that group discipline is allowed to decide these matters. There is, therefore, only one way, namely to vote in accordance with one’s convictions. If, moreover, the port workers are to be given help, we can give it them by voting against this bad document from the conciliation committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this regard, it is notable that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has already approved a law in the Spanish Parliament which allows for self-handling for this type of service on the part of any shipping or brokering company and takes it for granted that this crazy liberalisation will be approved by this European Parliament. I hope this is not the case and that the Spanish legislative is more prudent in the future and does not move forward ‘like those from Pozas’, as we say in Bilbao. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Commission’s aim was the liberalisation of port services, but little of that remains. A drawback of the proposal was the risk of social dumping arising. Parliament, and in particular the rapporteur, has been working actively towards eradicating the problems with the proposal. Such legislation as remains is evidently the maximum achievable, even though there is room for improvement. I asked myself, therefore, whether I should support this result or not. If I compare the result of the Directive with the status quo regarding the legislation on European ports, I conclude that it is better to adopt this proposal than reject it. In a nutshell: it does have its advantages, and the risk of social dumping is slight.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Member States are able to take effective measures to prevent problems, where that is still necessary, by means of legislation. In the Netherlands, a ports act is to be tabled, which will improve the situation for Dutch dockers. The main advantage for European ports is the existence of a legal framework that enables clarity and transparency in relations between port authorities and service providers. I also welcome the recognition of pilotage services as specialised services. I attach great importance to transparency in the financing of ports, which plays a necessary part in the creation of a level playing field with regard to state aid. I see this Directive as the beginnings of European legislation in this field, and envisage that, given productive dialogue between all the interested parties – port authorities, service providers and workers’ organisations – we can continue to work on improving the legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The fact that the compromise gives the Member States freedom of choice as to whether or not to introduce authorisations for self-handling – this form of subsidiarity – makes the whole authorisation system a hollow shell – this much is now clear to everyone. After all, if a Member State is not obliged to introduce an authorisation system, pernicious competition will inevitably follow, which will have a negative impact on working conditions, on the social protection of dockers, on safety in ports. Shipowners will very quickly seek out those ports that do not have an authorisation system. By that I do not mean ports in Italy, because they have an authorisation system, nor those in Spain, because they, too, have an authorisation system, but ports that have a rather casual approach to job protection and safety.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, if we want to open up port services to competition on the internal market, we must firstly and most importantly lay down rules for social and ecological etiquette that apply to all countries without exception. Secondly, there is the fact that this Directive gives the Member States free rein to cast pilotage services, too, onto the market. That is going much too far, in my opinion. Pilotage services have an essential safety function. This compromise will be responsible for pernicious competition via social dumping, and unsafe working environments in our ports. In addition, it is a slap in the face for all those dockers who have demonstrated against this Directive several times and who, furthermore, just this morning handed our own President of the European Parliament more than 20 000 signatures to make it clear that they disapprove strongly of this Directive. I therefore call on all those fellow Members who are still in two minds – from the Netherlands or Italy, perhaps – to reject this Directive, this unsatisfactory compromise, and to set to work on a satisfactory arrangement, one benefiting not only the ports, but especially the dockers.</p>

We cannot, therefore, support the text that has been proposed since, in addition to its emphasis on liberalisation, its position on the issues of self-handling and pilotage is far removed from that advocated by Parliament. In fact, on the basis of this position, by means of what is known as ‘self-handling’, the shipping company could provide one or more port services for itself, provided that it uses its own seamen and equipment. Furthermore, the proposal does not stipulate that authorisations shall be compulsory, and the Member States would find it hard to restrict these activities, except in special cases.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation will cause serious problems for the job stability of port service workers, will hamper the coordination of interactive on-board and on-shore operations and will help to create conflict and a breakdown in solidarity between the established workforce in ports and ships' crews. Safety problems might also arise for facilities and workers, since the seamen might not be familiar with the specific characteristics of the port.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament had suggested that pilotage services should be excluded from the scope of the directive, but the conciliation text states that the competent authorities may, for reasons of public safety, recognise the mandatory nature of pilotage and maintain the service themselves or award the service directly to a single provider. This means that pilotage might also be undertaken on a self-handling basis, with the potential consequences for maritime and environmental safety that this entails, and this is something we cannot accept.</p>
<p class="contents">With the various options given to the Member States for imposing more restrictive rules if they wish, there is a possibility that, in future, we will have ports of convenience, in which everything, or almost everything, is permitted, with the inevitable consequences for competition between ports and for maritime safety itself. Hence our vote against this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This week, the European ship has to decide which port to enter. To liberalise or not to liberalise, that is not the question as far as I am concerned. What is important is how we liberalise and whether we do it humanely.</p>
<p class="contents">The Conciliation Committee came to an agreement on this, and I admit that some of the sharp edges on which people can get hurt in a liberalisation process have been filed off, including by limiting self-handling to seafaring personnel. It is just unfortunate that it was not just that little bit more, then I, too, could have reconciled myself with the text.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been said repeatedly by fellow Members, there was indeed a majority in Parliament in favour of imposing compulsory authorisations for service providers and self-handling. The word was ‘must’. Unfortunately, Parliament’s lead was not taken, and the agreement did not move on from ‘may’.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Member States diverge in the way they use the possibilities they are given, there is of course a risk of distortion of competition. The fear of distortion of competition in itself can also lead to lax regulation. We do not like that idea, and therefore I do not agree with this draft text.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that St Nicholas is not due until December, but I sincerely hope that we can prevent the dockers from being left holding the baby, or in this case Black Peter, as early as this week. I have sympathy for those who earn their living in the ports. I shall therefore be voting against the draft. Whatever the result of the vote, I should like to address the Belgian dockers with the following request: do not in any event rest on your laurels, as not even the rejection of the text will mean that your problems are at an end. You know that a discussion has been underway for some time on the question as to whether the Belgian ports act – known as the ‘Major law’ – is in accordance with the treaty rules on the free movement of services. I strongly advise you good people to take control in this sphere in good time, before others have to set to work on it.</p>

I think that this European Parliament should be proud that every point of view has been heard and every point of view considered.</p>
<p class="contents">The original text was, quite rightly, heavily opposed and indeed heavily amended. It looked at ports through the wrong end of the telescope. Rather than competition between the ports it focused on competition within the ports – a little like single market legislation to increase competition within a supermarket rather than between supermarkets. It failed to tackle unfair state aids or the lack of transparency of accounts. In particular it threatened the successful United Kingdom model of ports, some of which, in my region, are amongst the busiest and indeed I would say the most successful anywhere in the world. To be fair, some of these deficiencies have been addressed, but conciliation failed to successfully address many key concerns. It failed to exclude self-handling or to ensure compulsory authorisations – the 'must or may' issue – and it failed, in particular, to exclude marine pilots from the scope of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this is not about what is in it but rather what is not in it. There was no real action, in my view, to tackle transparency or unfair state aids. This Parliament should also be concerned that there is no consensus either within Parliament or with society outside. I am aware of the wide range of views, both for and against. However, I am concerned in particular that we do not have the support of port workers themselves. British Labour MEPs are also very concerned that important British groups are objecting to this proposal, and we should all be concerned when British marine pilots and, in particular, British ships' officers are recommending that this proposal be voted down on safety grounds alone. I said at the beginning of the process in 2001 that this proposal should be rejected and sent back to the Commission. Given that our key concerns remain, British Labour MEPs are going to be consistent. We owe it to British jobs, the future of investment in our ports and above all safety to reject this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This project, known as self-handling, will allow ship owners to carry out any port service using their own personnel and equipment. It also opens the way for all sorts of abuse by the crooks involved in maritime transport. Indeed, the directive does not of course force ship owners to pay their personnel the current salaries of dockers, nor even to respect labour legislation. Ship owners can make workers, who are taken on without guarantees, work for low pay and subject them to whatever working conditions they want. This will result in secure employment in port areas being axed and an increase in the number of workers with insecure jobs, who are badly paid, over exploited, inexperienced, with all the threats that this entails for the environment and safety.</p>
<p class="contents">We reject this directive. Its enforcement would threaten all those that earn a living from port services; it would increase the risk of accidents and pollution. We also reject it because it puts workers from different professions – seamen and dockers – into competition with each other – in order to make conditions harsher for both groups, for the sole benefit of ship owners.</p>
<p class="contents">Opening up port services to competition stems from the same retrograde mindset as opening up rail transport, air traffic control, postal services or telecommunications to competition. We are opposed to it. Port services, like all services used directly or indirectly by the entire population, should be public services and protected from damage such as competition and the race for profit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must therefore vote against the Conciliation Committee’s joint text for a European Parliament and Council directive on market access to port services.

It should not be profitable to register ships in countries other than their own or to employ people under bad conditions. Competence in the ports and the safety of those who work in them must be guaranteed.</p>

Frankly, without the directive that we are about to vote on, there would be nothing stopping the individual Member States – as has been the case thus far – from adopting national legislative measures to open up the market in port services without any legal framework. I am one of those that have fought hard and I remain convinced that authorisation should have been made compulsory. We did not succeed in obtaining this, but we do have a directive that refers to subsidiarity, to what the Member States could have done, however, and that lays down reference criteria for authorisation which fully protect social, security and environment rules. Of course, this is true if an individual State wants to make authorisation compulsory. Without the directive, however, the Wild West would have been a lot wilder<span class="italic">.</span></p>

As regards what individual States could have done, I have the feeling that we have not yet reached paradise, but that we have probably climbed up from hell to purgatory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The key issue here is the self-handling at EU ports. As somebody who comes from an island Member State which exports 90% of its production, I am deeply concerned at the lack of mandatory authorisation included in this directive. It must be painful for the Commissioner and Mr Jarzembowski to see such wide-ranging opposition to this proposal as there is here today. However, they should withdraw this proposal, return to the drawing-board and ensure there is mandatory self-handling which would provide for prior authorisation and would include criteria relating to employment, the social aspects, professional qualifications and environmental considerations. There is no way around this. Therefore I appeal to you to show common sense and return to the drawing-board. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Neither the port authorities, nor the employers, nor the dockers are looking to change this system. It was achieved via social dialogue and, if necessary, is adapted via social dialogue to the situation of the various other Belgian ports. This social dialogue offers employers a guarantee that their requirements, too – as regards employment, social services, safety and quality – will be included in a social agreement. One result of this system is that the port of Antwerp is number one in conventional loading, and that is the most labour-intensive loading activity. Antwerp has earned that ranking despite the fact that its dock work is perhaps a little more expensive than in other ports, but, on the other hand, this dock work is very productive, very safe and of excellent quality. The shipowners are not demanding a different system.</p>
<p class="contents">How is the EU’s involvement perceived by the Belgian port authorities, the dockers and the Belgian politicians? In the first place, they do not see in it any improvement for them. The reverse is true. They are seeking in the Directive possibilities of preserving the present system as far as possible via Belgian legislation. Secondly, they find that all of this is being arranged a long way from their home territory. They are accustomed to proceeding via social dialogue. Thirdly, they believe that the Directive was based on the ports where the regime is least strict, where poorly organised, poor-quality dock work is carried out. Commissioner, the correct procedure would have been to subject European port activities to compulsory authorisations regulating the most important elements in the field of the social framework, safety, training, organisation of work and environment. A compulsory system such as this would have not only made self-handling possible, but also offered guarantees of a stricter operating procedure in all the European ports. The ports that already have effective regulations and a safe system are actually being penalised in favour of the much laxer attitude of other ports. We should have gone in the opposite direction. For all of these reasons, I shall be voting against the Directive: out of conviction. I am a confirmed European, but, in this dossier, European intervention is moving in the wrong direction.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a parallel has repeatedly been drawn between the problem of ports and port services and the problem of airports and airport services, and the issue of security has been raised as a crucial reason for rejecting the current text, essentially security relating to the issue of pilotage and also with regard to the issue of self-handling in general. I would like to say that I believe it is a mistake to compare air traffic with self-handling.</p>
<p class="contents">I do believe it makes sense to compare openness and competition in port services with that in airport services. At the time, this also provoked all sorts of arguments and it was said that it was going to jeopardise security in airports. This has not turned out to be the case. On the contrary, what we have seen has been greater activity and more opportunities for everybody in airports.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberalisation has been proposed and today aircraft maintenance services in airports are liberalised. At the time it was said that this would pose enormous risks in terms of aircraft safety.</p>
<p class="contents">There are currently companies which resolve certain issues themselves. Other companies, on the other hand, employ third-party service providers. There are various possibilities, and this reduces costs for aviation – and the honourable Members are the first to benefit, as are all we citizens of the European Union – and none of this has meant an undermining of security in aviation. What we have had is more activity, more employment and more opportunities. And that is what we are proposing.</p>
<p class="contents">Air traffic is equivalent to maritime traffic. On the entry to the majority of large ports, there is maritime traffic, which is controlled by means of totally modern systems. We are not talking about liberalising and implementing the various controls of maritime traffic in ports, nobody is proposing that. Let us not mix up things which cannot be mixed up. Let us make comparisons which make sense.</p>
<p class="contents">The liberalisation of the aircraft maintenance service has not in any way undermined the security of aircraft. Is any port authority, or any government of our countries going to take a decision which suddenly means that a ship hits a jetty or fills airports with inappropriate waste or that there is an accident?</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are operating within certain frameworks which guarantee the viability of a liberalisation of this nature, which allows greater competition and port activity, greater opportunity and capacity for ports, greater development of cabotage and therefore greater development of maritime traffic, in order to decongest other types of transport which are currently completely congested.</p>
<p class="contents">What is so worrying in Belgium? It has the legislation left by the previous Belgian Minister in relation to ports. They are not going to have to change it. They may have to make some modifications. And they will have to justify why pilotage, self-handling, is carried out. The reasons for which self-handling can be restricted are ‘safety considerations or requirements resulting from environmental rules’ (Article 10), amongst others.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, Article 16 states that ‘the provisions of the present Directive shall not in any way affect the national rules in the field of professional qualifications and training requirements, employment and social issues provided that they are compatible with Community legislation’.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I wonder whether we have read the same text. If we look at the issue of pilotage, it also says that – we know that pilotage has a very important component and that it therefore requires certain types of supplementary guarantee: ‘the competent authorities may recognise the obligatory nature ...’. It is true: they will be able to. If there is really a security risk, do you believe that any national authority is not going to recognise the obligatory nature of pilotage? Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we are talking about risks which do not exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue is the pressure from the dockers’ unions. This is another matter which is politically very important and is very respectable, I do not doubt, but let us remember that we are talking about pressure from a specific group, it is one of the examples always used in certain economics and sociology books, because they have been very well organised for a very long time. What we have is a problem of pressure or of relationships with these unions. That is another matter, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p class="contents">Do not mix it up with security problems, however. Let us not talk about something which is not the case. I could accept you saying to me: ‘there is a political problem, we need the support of the unions, they are against it and we cannot vote for it’. I would have no objection. I would say that that is politically entirely understandable, but do not tell me that it is a security problem. It is not. At least I believe there is no such problem, ladies and gentlemen. It is not a security problem, but a political problem. Let us call things by their name and therefore take on, each and every one of us, our responsibilities. Because I believe that if we deal with this political problem involving the dockers – which I believe not to be justified because there will be more work for them and more opportunities in our ports if we approve this directive – we will be able to achieve greater efficiency in our ports and this is crucial in order to promote cabotage.</p>
<p class="contents">How are we really going to develop more cabotage in the European Union if we do not improve the performance and efficiency of our current port services? Ladies and gentlemen, we have a deadlock here which is preventing us from going any further and we need this cabotage. In the next 10 years we need European cabotage to increase its capacities by at least 40% because anything which does not go by sea will go by road. We also need the railways to increase by 40%, but cabotage must take up at least 40%, even a little more, in order to take the burden off the roads.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the dockers are very respectable, I agree. However – and I would ask you once again to reconsider the issue – it is not a problem of security we are discussing here, but a problem of union forces. We are currently dealing with the problem of a form of transport which is genuinely sustainable over time, an efficient form of transport which we need in the European Union for our competitiveness and also for our citizens and for the development of all our countries and for the improvement of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much, Mr President, thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. Whatever the result is, we will continue working once again and I will continue to count on your support, as I do generally in relation to all the initiatives I present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
