In actual fact – and one is well aware of this through the debates currently enlivening the old Member States – the fear of social dumping brought about by enlargement is omnipresent, and, in my opinion, unfounded if adequate elements of a response can be found.</p>
<p class="contents">I would first of all like, as is unfortunately the custom in this House, to point out to the Commission that, if funding is not made available immediately in order to implement the recommendations contained in this report, it will go unheeded, however comprehensive it may be. The fight against all forms of poverty and all forms of exclusion is the prerequisite for putting Europe onto the road to social progress.</p>
<p class="contents">We had agreed in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that the responses required on the issue of social inclusion were not simply limited to the field of employment, but that they had to include other major social matters: access to education for all, without ethnic or social discrimination, in order to guarantee a common core of knowledge necessary for people to integrate effectively in society; access to quality health care for all: the fact that, even today, people can recover from cancer in one part of Europe and die from influenza in another will never be justifiable; access to housing for all, which is another of the themes of this report: council houses will have to be geographically spread out in an intelligent manner, in order to prevent any form of ghettoisation; the fight against all forms of discrimination, whether sexual discrimination in the workplace, racial discrimination or discrimination linked to disability or social circumstances, will have to be encouraged and supported.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has now to offer protection: in order to progress, it must primarily be able to protect its people. The basic principles of employment, housing, training and health care are the very foundation of what ought to be the construction of Europe, a Europe that serves Europeans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many of the recommendations are valid for all Member States and not just the new countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the report in substance, but I think we should make a clear distinction between European and Member States’ responsibilities. The first weapon in the fight against social exclusion is of course jobs, jobs, jobs. We therefore need to revitalise our economy and reform our social security systems to lead people back to the labour market and not keep them in the poverty trap. The more or less permanent exclusion of 10% of our labour force from the labour market is an absolute disgrace to our civilised society.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur rightly states that combating social exclusion is best done at local level. It is therefore worrying that in many countries – new and old, including my own – the financial position of local authorities is becoming increasingly serious. Local autonomy is meaningless without the necessary financial resources.</p>
<p class="contents">In fundamental rights policies and notably the fight against discrimination, the EU can and should play a key role. The EU has an outstanding track record on gender equality. It should be equally active in fighting racism and discrimination and it should be proactively defending and promoting equal rights and equal treatment for all.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the European Commission should be less timid. The European Union cannot turn its head and look away if blatant discrimination takes place, arguing that it is the responsibility of Member States. European values are universal.</p>
<p class="contents">The report highlights the importance of investing in children as the best way of promoting social inclusion. Giving children a good start in life and real prospects should be one of the key priorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his work and congratulating him on having made a distinction in the report between social inclusion and egalitarianism or corporatism.</p>
<p class="contents">When creating special conditions for certain social groups, we must never lose sight of the fact that all citizens must be considered equal. Positive discrimination is as worthy of condemnation as negative discrimination. It is a fact that certain social groups have more or fewer differences or problems. I fully support solidarity with these groups. I am convinced that the best way to achieve their social inclusion is to create equal conditions for all of them. Administrative exclusion and preferential treatment for individual groups is not a path towards social inclusion, but towards continued social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">If we take into account the number of disadvantaged groups mentioned, and rightly so, in the report – or in other words women, single parents, people entering the job market, older people, the poor, those suffering ill health, disabled persons, carers, disadvantaged children, children under threat due to a lack of parental authority, linguistic minorities, refugees, immigrants, Roma, other ethnic minorities, the homeless, alcoholics and drug addicts – it would not be much of an exaggeration to conclude that ordinary, non-disadvantaged citizens are a threatened minority in society.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that we will need to set up support programmes for those who have not succeeded in being included in a single threatened group. The report under discussion aims to fight exclusion, and I believe that – paradoxically – we have excluded 10 countries from the 25 Member States, all of which have equal rights, because they joined the European Union several years later. I firmly believe that, next time, the European Union will also tackle this type of exclusion, and that the next report on social inclusion will evaluate the situation in all the EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft report refers to the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. I am aware that the rapporteur wrote his report at a time when it was not yet obvious that the Constitution had been killed off. Since the people of France and the Netherlands rejected the draft Constitution for Europe, these references are groundless and should be deleted from the report. I thank the rapporteur for his good work, which is of benefit for the European Union and for my country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To reiterate a point made by Mr Cabrnoch and Mrs in ’t Veld, however, the report’s exclusive focus on the new Member States is a glaring error, since the problems it discusses affect the EU as a whole. I should like to cite just one example, that being my own country, Poland. Over 60% of judges in Poland are women, and given that this is a profession of considerable social standing, it is hard to see how there can be any talk of exclusion. Similarly, women account for over 60% of doctors in the country, and Poland has more businesswomen in managerial roles than any other country in Europe. This begs the question of why a distinction has been made in the report between the old and the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to alert this House to the fact that events of the kind we saw a few days ago in France, when Perpignan became a battlefield between Arabs and Roma, would be unthinkable in either Poland or a great many other new Member States. In my opinion, the cause of the clashes was social exclusion. What is more, acts of anti-Semitism of the sort that occur regularly in France and Germany would also be unthinkable in the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The primary cause of social exclusion is destruction of the social fabric, by which I also mean the weakening of the role of religion. Religion, the Catholic Church and other religious organisations play an enormous role in weaving the social fabric and preventing social exclusion. Once again, my own country is perhaps the best example of this phenomenon, as both the divorce rate and the suicide rate in Poland are among the lowest in Europe. This shows that social exclusion is not in fact one of the country’s most pressing social problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The modern-day state is taking on too many duties that it is incapable of performing. The report says that the Member States should mobilise non-governmental organisations, confessional associations and the Church to participate in combating social exclusion, and yet it must be stated quite clearly that the state cannot issue orders of this kind. The state’s primary task should be to avoid interfering in such matters.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point I should like to make is that the term ‘social dumping’ appears in the report. This unfortunate phrase, which I find quite intolerable, now appears to have replaced the term ‘healthy competition’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my country, Flanders, there is now evidence to the contrary, for we see the Flemish transport industry being dealt heavy blows by cheap transport companies from Eastern Europe, and there are other examples I could mention. I am at any rate delighted that this report on social inclusion in the new Member States, maybe quite unintentionally, puts its finger on a number of difficulties, and indicates the immense structural social differences between the new Member States, many of which today are still struggling to come to terms with the catastrophic legacy from Communist times, and the fifteen Member States prior to enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite many sound proposals and suggestions – we all hope that the new Member States will achieve a level of prosperity comparable to that of their western neighbours as soon as possible – we should not be blind to the fact that social integration of the new Member States may also compromise the cohesion of the whole of the European Union. Consequently, when no protective measures are taken in order to avoid the risks to which our economies are exposed, and to which I have already referred, including social dumping, the reinforcement of social cohesion in the new Member States must go hand in hand with stringent measures that rule out unfair competition within the EU as a whole. If we do not do this, then the European leaders have not at all understood the protests by the Dutch and the French people over the past few weeks, soon, undoubtedly, to be followed by the Luxembourgers and the Danes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a problem that affects not only the old EU Member States, but all Member States, albeit obviously to differing degrees.</p>
<p class="contents">Although much research has been carried out into social inclusion in Western European countries, the scale of this problem still tends to be underestimated in the new Member States, and these countries lack the tools to measure this phenomenon in a genuinely rational and objective fashion. In part, of course, this is a legacy of Communism, which was a system that attempted to eliminate social problems and to bestow transient joy on all its citizens by means of decrees. We are still struggling with the consequences of Communism and its ideology today, and all the countries that were subjected to this system face similar levels of social problems and unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Our countries are still lacking large-scale and complementary action plans to coordinate measures in the fight against poverty and social exclusion. The measures that are taken all too often resemble a chaotic struggle by public services to respond to problems that have emerged, and that have usually become urgent. There are a great many reasons why this is the case. Even if we leave those social groups that suffer social marginalisation as a result of non-economic factors out of the equation, the excessively high unemployment rate remains the most pressing problem, and its causes are deeply rooted in the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Unemployment in Poland affects several dozen out of every hundred people. The unemployed frequently cut themselves off from society, and so this phenomenon is one of the reasons behind the sharp rise in today’s most malignant social disease, by which I mean helplessness and passivity in the face of the simplest everyday problems. These are always early symptoms of addiction in the broadest sense of the word, whether it be to help from the state or from others, or even to drugs or alcohol.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the governments of the Member States can and must be called upon to take decisive steps to speed up the process of social inclusion and to develop instruments that make it possible to improve the living conditions of those most at risk. At the same time, however, we are all aware that substantial amounts of money will be needed to fund the majority of these measures. One can only spend the money one has, and not the imagined sums one would like to have.</p>
<p class="contents">Any debate on genuine social inclusion must therefore be preceded by a discussion on how economic growth can be boosted in the new Member States. Such growth would facilitate job creation, and more jobs and higher incomes would mean that social problems and poverty could be better and more effectively combated.</p>
<p class="contents">We will be unlikely to achieve our goals if we rely exclusively on public funding and social and welfare assistance. I therefore welcome the Commission’s assurances that it will cooperate more closely in the fight against social marginalisation. At the same time, I should like to encourage the Commission to be consistent in promoting greater liberalisation of the market in services. Such liberalisation will boost economic growth in Europe as a whole, or in other words in both the old and the new Member States, and hence reduce social problems. This is our only hope of effectively combating a problem that poses a threat to all of Europe, and I would stress the word ‘all’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report discusses social inclusion in the new Member States, yet it does not address the general social problems faced by Europe as a whole. Unemployment is a cruel fate for anyone, no matter where they live in Europe. It gives rise to many other related phenomena, be it mental stress, poverty or homelessness.</p>
<p class="contents">In one part of the report, the rapporteur draws our attention to insufficient workforce mobility. Yet Europe’s response to the mobility of unemployed persons is to impose what are known as protective or transitional measures. One of the serious reservations many old Member States had about enlargement was a fear of ‘economic migration’ and of the threat to jobs for their citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have seen to date indicates that none of the countries that adopted transitional measures have so far filed any complaints regarding violation or avoidance of these measures. The countries that did not impose transitional measures on our countries, on the other hand, have not yet experienced any problems with an increased inflow of cheap labour. Moreover, many countries are benefiting from this cheap, well-educated and multilingual workforce, rather than complaining about it. One such example is the granting of ‘green cards’ to computer experts, or the massive recruitment of nurses for old people’s homes in the United Kingdom. Social inclusion should not only be high on our agenda during the debate on this report; we should also apply this principle with regard to other reports considered by this House.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may, I should like to take this opportunity to mention the debate on problems relating to working time and compliance with the principle that all working time must be regarded as legal working time, and that all overtime should be properly remunerated. However we conceal overtime, we tolerate a situation in which one employee works from morning to night, while others have no chance of finding employment and become homeless. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Congratulations, Csaba!</p>
<p class="contents">In the new Member States, around five million people are out of work, and the number is increasing, particularly among older people, women, single parents and workers without adequate skills. People with disabilities are marginalised; their chances of employment and of a secure income are diminishing constantly. My colleagues Mr Cabrnoch and Mr Libicki are quite right to point out that such situations also occur in the EU’s old Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is apparent from analysis of the situation in the new Member States that the transition from an economy directed by the state to a social market economy makes major structural problems inevitable. There is work for all to do in ensuring that this problematic period is of only short duration. Unemployment and deficient education are among the major obstacles to inclusion in society. As the community of our Member States is founded upon social values, it must defuse this social timebomb.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mrs in 't Veld that job creation must have the highest priority; jobs, jobs, jobs, are what we urgently need. One way in which this may be accomplished is by decisive economic reforms that create favourable conditions for businesses. Financial incentives will have the same effect – tax breaks, wage cost subsidies and the cutting of social security contributions spring to mind. Small and medium-sized enterprises are in particular need of support, as is the case in all our Member States; they are potential creators of jobs and apprenticeships, for every single one of which we have to fight, for they are urgently needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The social partners have a crucial part to play in combating exclusion, supplementing the efforts of the public and private sectors, and dialogue between them must be stepped up. I see the foundation of trade unions and employers’ associations as a good idea, for both are needed. It is only when each has a large number of members that they will be enabled to take action, engage in dialogue and achieve a great deal. Exclusion is generally associated with inadequate education and training, and so these need to be improved, while, at the same, disadvantaged sections of the population need to be included. Let us use the experience we have already gained and involve businesses in this.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I would like to make is that the fight against social exclusion is made all the more effective the more the Member States and social partners share information – including both innovative and time-tested practices – with one another. Like our rapporteur, Mr Őry, I regard this as a priority objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we are to combat poverty effectively, we must create more and better jobs, and the quality of those jobs must be seen as no less important.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to highlight the need to use incentives to encourage local organisations to support efforts to integrate more people into the labour market. This activity is important, because as well as contributing towards economic growth, it will also help to ensure that development is characterised by solidarity. In many Member States during the change of regimes and systems, labour rules and the nature of the labour market have also undergone significant change.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, under a new social and political model, the fight against unemployment and for social inclusion also entail improving the quality of education and lifelong vocational training. Other important aspects of this debate are the notion that access to housing is a factor in social inclusion, and the need for effective support for bringing young people with degrees or other high-level qualifications into the labour market, in order to derive maximum benefit from the qualifications that they have acquired in the education system. Including young people in the manufacturing sector will also help to modernise the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hasse Ferreira and I would also like to highlight the proposal by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, which urges Member States to attach special importance to eradicating poverty, which affects women, children and ethnic minorities in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to attaching importance to competitiveness, the Lisbon Strategy also encompasses the European social model. In this context, the promotion of sustainable economic development, including the creation of more and better jobs, within the context of social cohesion, is key to ensuring that people of all States of the EU can be in a single market within a developed Europe that is characterised by solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The main factors contributing to social exclusion in many of the new EU Member States are high unemployment, almost no labour force mobility and problems relating to the social inclusion of people entering the labour market, women, older people, those suffering ill health, disabled persons and ethnic and linguistic minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Strong economic growth and more jobs are basic prerequisites for the permanent sustainability of social welfare systems. In order to boost such growth, I believe that the transitional measures in place on the labour market with regard to the new Member States must be abolished. No statistical backing has been found for the grounds upon which these measures, which are intended to protect the domestic labour markets of some of the 15 old EU Member States, were introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Education and vocational training systems that function effectively are further factors that boost growth. The number of people leaving education and vocational training early must be restricted, and it must be made easier to move from school to work, especially for those leaving school with low qualifications. Access to education must be improved for disadvantaged groups, and we must provide across-the-board support for life-long learning. A high-quality education system is one that is able to adapt effectively to conditions in a rapidly-changing labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States adopted measures to deal with the problems of poverty and social exclusion in the shape of seven key political priorities. Together with the implementation of this report, these priorities should contribute to an increase in the supply of labour. An accessible, sustainable and high-quality healthcare system will contribute not only to the fight against disease and vulnerability to social exclusion, but also to the maintenance of a productive labour force. Implementation of the content of the report on social inclusion in the new Member States can help improve quality of life in the EU Member States. I would like to join my colleagues in congratulating the rapporteur on his work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I feel that we share a common view on most of the problems you have raised. Poverty and social exclusion remain very urgent challenges for the whole Union. We have made significant, but not sufficient, progress since the Union’s social inclusion process was instituted following the Lisbon European Council in 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure Mr Mann and Mrs in ‘t Veld that economic growth and jobs that promote social cohesion are among the priorities for Europe’s review of the Lisbon agenda. Furthermore, enlargement has increased the scale of the challenge. We have also been encouraged by the high level of commitment shown by the new Member States. The Commission fully shares the view that this process must be accelerated and is thus grateful to Parliament for the strong political support it has given to the Union’s social inclusion process.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Mr Libicki, I should point out that from now on the new Member States will be fully integrated into the process. The current report relates to the period before the accession of the ten new members.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Őry and Mr Falbr highlighted the need for cooperation and partnership. I agree completely with this view. Member States are the key partners in implementing the Lisbon Strategy and their commitment to effective inclusion policies is a key factor for success. I equally share your view that the efforts of social partners and civil society are absolutely necessary in tackling the problem of poverty and social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Bauer rightly mentioned the poverty risk faced by women, in particular single mothers, and children. Parliament’s Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, as well as the Commission, strongly advocate the principle of gender mainstreaming, an approach which is very useful for addressing the specific problems of women, particularly as part of social inclusion policies. Hence I very much welcome the fact that many new Member States are already applying a gender mainstreaming strategy or including the gender dimension in some of their employment and social programmes. Even in those new Member States where this has not yet been achieved, the joint inclusion memoranda have highlighted the need to pay more attention in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Child poverty is an EU-wide issue which touches the whole range of employment and social policies. It very often occurs when parents are unemployed or good quality jobs are lacking, or – as some Members rightly pointed out – it may result from the exclusion of particular groups, such as the Roma.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is fighting against this phenomenon via the European employment strategy, as well as through specific policies, and rightly so. The fight will go on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
