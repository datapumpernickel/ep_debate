<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sophia in 't Veld, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span><span class="bold">−</span> Mr President, I would like to start by saying how satisfied I am with the cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament. Parliament last year set out very clear criteria for the transfer of PNR data to third countries. The Commission then put forward a very good package in line with those criteria, and the Council very swiftly adopted a negotiating mandate. I think this example demonstrates that, if the three institutions work together, Europe is a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, Axel Voss, Birgit Sippel, Timothy Kirkhope, Jan Albrecht, Rui Tavares and, more recently, Cornelia Ernst. Even if we do not agree on every single detail I think the PNR team has worked in a very constructive spirit.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I recommend in my draft report that this House gives its consent to the conclusion of an agreement with Australia on the transfer of PNR data. I think the recommendation will get wide support, and I am very happy with that.</p>
<p class="contents">However, that does not mean that all concerns and reservations have been met. There are still some doubts and hesitations. For this reason, some groups in this House will withhold their vote or vote against. I fully understand their objections, and I share most of their concerns. However, they know as well as I do that a ‘no’ vote will not stop the transfer of data. We are not voting on the actual transfer, we can only vote on the conditions governing the transfer of data. A ‘no’ vote, therefore, is purely symbolic. For that reason, I will also not endorse the GUE Group’s call for a consultation of the European Court of Justice, although I have great sympathy for that proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">We have assessed the draft agreement against the criteria that we set out last year and given a positive assessment on a number of points, in particular the limitation of the ‘purpose’ definition. It has been considerably tightened, and includes only the fight against terrorism and serious transnational crime. I think that is a very important achievement.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also ensured that the method of transfer will be ‘push’ exclusively. That is very important, also in view of future agreements. There are also some other positive points.</p>
<p class="contents">However there are also a couple of remaining concerns, as I said initially. The most fundamental point is that the necessity and proportionality of the mass collection and storage of data has been demonstrated only partially, and not sufficiently. Secondly, no justification has been given for the long-term storage of identifiable data of all travellers. The retention period of five and a half years appears to be fairly random, and was not based on any specific evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the appropriate legal basis for the agreement should be – or in any case include – Article 16 of the Treaties, on data protection. If you retrace the history of these agreements back to 2003, the purpose of this agreement has been, from the very start, exclusively to ensure that the transfer of data to third countries is in line with EU data protection standards. Therefore, the only proper legal base can be Article 16 and nothing else. If the purpose were exclusively police and justice cooperation, the EU could theoretically decide against the collection of PNR data by Australia. But it cannot, because it is a sovereign and unilateral decision by Australia to collect these data.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we need a political assurance by the Commission that the agreement remains the joint responsibility of the three EU institutions, each with its own role. If, in future, the European Parliament notes serious deficiencies in the application of the agreement, we expect the Commission to respond and to take appropriate action including, if necessary, the submission of proposals for the suspension or termination of the agreement. I would like to ask the Presidency of this House to see to it that these assurances, as expressed today and noted in the minutes, are confirmed by an exchange of letters with the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cecilia Malmström, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">−</span> Mr President, we have indeed travelled a long way on this. It was in May last year that we started to discuss the renegotiations of the PNR agreement with Australia and the USA. Considerable efforts and contacts and a good cooperation, including with our Australian counterparts, have been taking place during this time.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we have a proposed agreement that you will be voting on tomorrow. I think we can agree that we have worked hard on this. We have an agreement with very high standards which very much reflects the position taken by Parliament in its resolution and the mandate given by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">From the Commission side, we consider that this is a further improvement of the 2008 agreement. It has clearer language, such as the definition of terrorism and serious transnational crime, it is a further strengthening of police cooperation, with high standards of data protection and it ensures freedom and safety for international air travel.</p>
<p class="contents">It also recognises that information sharing is a fundamental component of the fight against terrorism and serious transnational crime. In this context, the use of PNR data is an essential tool but it recognises that such information sharing has to be undertaken in full respect of fundamental rights and freedoms. The data are transferred to the Australia customs service for the purposes of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences or serious transnational crime. In exceptional cases, PNR data may be processed for the prosecution of the vital interest of any individual, such as risk of death, serious injury or threat to health.</p>
<p class="contents">The Australian customs services will ensure that the relevant analytical information obtained from PNR is available to police and judicial authorities of Member States or Europol or Eurojust as part of EU-Australian security cooperation. The data is retained for five and a half years. After three years the data elements which could serve to identify the passenger to whom PNR data relate will be masked out. Such depersonalised data will only be accessible to a very limited number of customs services officials. The data will, as the rapporteur said, be transferred to the Australian customs service on the basis of the ‘push’ method only.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement applies without discrimination between passengers and prohibits all processing of sensitive data. It lays down provisions regulating rights of access, rectification, erasure and redress for any individual concerned. It prohibits decisions with adverse legal effects being taken exclusively on the basis of automatic processing of PNR data.</p>
<p class="contents">All data processing is subject to oversight by the Australian Information Commissioner, who has effective powers to investigate and monitor compliance with the terms of the agreement. All data processing is logged or documented for the purposes of oversight and auditing by the Australian Information Commission. Data may be shared with other government authorities of Australia only on a case-by-case basis and only for the purposes of the agreement. Onward transfer of data to authorities of third countries is allowed, subject to the same data protection safeguards as those applicable to transfers of data by air carriers to Australian customs services under the agreement, only for the purposes set out in the agreement and only on a case-by-case basis. The competent authorities of the Member States are also consulted when data concerning an EU citizen have been transferred to a country.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement will be reviewed one year after its entry into force. As regards suspension, in general suspension of agreements is regulated, as you know, by Article 289 of the Treaty. Under that procedure, the Council takes a decision on suspension on a proposal from the Commission, but a parliamentary resolution calling for a suspension signals serious problems with the current agreement and would certainly be a very important element in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the House, and especially the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs, for their very important cooperation. I think we can be proud of the result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The re-negotiated draft agreement contains safeguards on the transfer and processing of passenger name record data, including: the right of passengers to access their own data, the right to have it corrected and the right of passengers to resort to judicial redress or sanctions in the case of any breach of data security.</p>

Naturally I would like to see this helping to speed up our negotiations with Canada and the US, however I also hope that the agreement will become a kind of template for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">When faced with issues like this, we generally always look for the right balance and ways to prevent criminal activity while, on the other hand, seeking to secure the fundamental rights of the individual and to provide legal certainty without restricting everyday functionality. However, this also means recognising that fast, effective exchange of information and data is now essential in order to guarantee internal and external security. In other words, we need to establish a regulatory framework for how we deal with data. I believe that this has been achieved here, although – as the rapporteur has already explained – a number of issues are still outstanding. In particular, close consideration is required when it comes to the question of the legal basis for the agreement, because this may give rise to legal uncertainty in the future. Nonetheless, I believe that the various associated guarantees, such as the entitlement to inspect data, the right to make corrective adjustments or to impose judicial remedies, offer citizens sufficient protection and also ensure effective controls over state intervention in personal rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to be quite clear about one thing: in a mobile world where international terrorism exists, the exchange of PNR data is an effective way to combat crime and means more security for Europe’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is unfortunate that we have not been able to convince all groups of the need for this agreement. We would, however, be acting against the best interests of our citizens if we failed to exploit the opportunities available to us to protect them. After all, failure to vote in favour of this agreement means leaving our citizens with a lot less security in relation to data protection than would be available under the terms of the agreement. That is not what we have been elected for.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Ms in ’t Veld for her excellent, resolute approach to this matter and for the transparency that she has brought to the issue. I hope that her efforts will be rewarded tomorrow and that it will be possible for data to be exchanged without further delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Likewise, the use of this data, for example for border control purposes, is nothing new. Nonetheless, a problem arises here which is also familiar in other areas: in an increasingly mobile world with modern information technology, data is available in quite different dimensions than was the case 50 or even 30 years ago. This is also the reason why data protection is becoming increasingly important.</p>
<p class="contents">We have achieved a great deal with this agreement: a clear definition of potential uses, good data protection standards and clear rules for legal certainty and judicial remedy. The changeover from the pull system to the push system is also important. Data is not simply collected, but is sent to Australia. We have not been able to achieve all our demands, however. One of the major points at issue from our perspective is the five-and-a-half-year retention period. We would have liked to see a much shorter period.</p>
<p class="contents">So, what can we do about it? Do we vote in favour of the agreement or do we reject it? I would like to make two comments. We will never achieve one hundred per cent of our demands. So, we need to weigh things up. Data would continue to be transferred even if we rejected the agreement, however then we would have no clear rules on how this data should be handled. That is why I hope that this agreement will receive majority support tomorrow, despite many reservations. In relation to the forthcoming agreement with the US, I would like to state clearly: we want an agreement here too, but a 15-year retention period is a much longer time. I genuinely fail to see why we cannot change over completely to the push system here. We need to make improvements in this area. We want uniform standards for all agreements in relation to PNR data, rather than a patchwork of arrangements in which the rights of our citizens are dealt with in different ways. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a much better agreement because of the role of the European Parliament. I congratulate all those involved in producing an agreement that most of us will be able to vote for, despite some weaknesses. But the strengths include those mentioned: a much tighter purpose definition to limit it to terrorism and serious transnational crime, the fact that it is ‘push’ only and that the data protection safeguards on rectification and erasure and redress and also the data security provisions are good, with for instance an audit record of all access. So like other speakers I hope that this can become something of a precedent for the other two agreements, and I would draw the attention of the US authorities in particular to this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">My main difficulty with the agreement is the fact that it does not deal up front with the question of profiling. The European Commission has dodged this issue for years. I did a report two and a half years ago on profiling, just before the last elections. The European Commission keeps using synonyms and keeps falling back on this phrase (which is in the agreement): that it bans any decision which significantly affects or produces an adverse legal effect on a passenger solely on the basis of the automated processing of data. The whole question of profiling goes further than that, and we need to address it, use the term, define it, say what is allowed, what is not allowed and what the safeguards are. I do not think it helps for the Commission to refuse to face up to this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Naturally, people will disagree about what might be a better agreement. For me, however, it is important to point out that, when negotiating with third countries, we in the European Union must take care only to adopt legislation and negotiate agreements that are valid within the framework of our constitution and laws.</p>
<p class="contents">Having read it, I must say that the agreement with Australia for the forwarding of European PNR data is not compatible with European law or with the constitutions of the Member States. Both the national constitutional courts of EU Member States and the European Court of Human Rights have declared firstly that the retention and processing of personal data without specific cause is in breach of fundamental rights. Secondly, they found that any practice that randomly compares people and their behaviour patterns with suspect profiles is in violation of human rights. Thirdly, they held that the comprehensive monitoring of all citizens without any grounds for suspicion violates the presumption of innocence.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have on the table is an agreement that not only makes mass surveillance acceptable, but also infringes the fundamental principles of a democratic state under the rule of law. We in the European Parliament have clearly rejected the existing PNR data agreements for many years. I would like to know what has changed in the interim? There has been no change in relation to the long retention periods. Nor has there been any change in relation to the lack of suspicion when data is transferred. Opinions may differ in relation to what will happen if this agreement is rejected. We, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance believe that there are limits that must be observed when negotiating agreements with other third countries and partners. In my opinion we should not legitimise every proposal we receive, but should simply stick to our principles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course we have understood this, thanks to Ms in ’t Veld. The counter-arguments are more convincing, however. We still have no proof of the need to record PNR data. The mass of data, or so-called waste data, actually makes it harder to find potential criminals. Despite everything, what we have here is a willy-nilly approach to data retention, even when no suspicion exists, and this, as my colleague has pointed out, is prohibited, not just in Germany but in several other Member States too.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to register genuinely serious concerns that this agreement cannot be reconciled with EU law. That is why we requested a corresponding legal opinion, which we are also presenting for the purposes of the discussion and vote. Even though it is, of course, better to a certain extent to have some sort of retention period rather than none at all, I would ask you seriously why it is necessary to store data for five-and-a-half years. This makes profiling realistic and feasible, particularly since it is not completely and definitively excluded by this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">A word about the scope of the agreement: the Commissioner referred to the fact that serious cross-border crime does not exist as a criminal offence in Australia. It simply does not exist. Instead of a minimum mandatory sentence of four years, we would have been better served with a list of specific criminal offences.</p>
<p class="contents">Otherwise, our main concern is that this agreement will be used as the template for negotiations with the US, but not because the agreement is so bad, but rather because at least in Australia the data is processed by the customs authorities when it arrives there, while in the US, the responsible authority is the unknown quantity that is the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement turns innocent people into objects of suspicion on a wholesale basis and undermines elementary freedoms. My group wants nothing to do with this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to achieve this, preventive measures are necessary, particularly when it comes to the prevention of terrorist activities and international crime. This is precisely the reason why security authorities throughout the world gather and analyse PNR data. However, in order to ensure that data is no longer transferred, stored and used in an uncontrolled way, as has been the case up to now, but will, in future, comply with legal requirements, the European Union is concluding this series of agreements with various states.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is, as we all know, quite a complicated matter to reach a result with the US because we have a different legal and security culture, we have managed to hammer out a very good agreement with Australia. I regard a number of points as being of particular importance. For example, I believe that the parameters for application are clearly defined and restricted, namely the combating of terrorist activity and serious cross-border crime, that EU citizens in Australia enjoy full legal protection to a very high standard, that the push system is being followed, and that data protection is assured at a very high level. Last but not least, this agreement also enables passengers to be checked in quickly and securely on flights to Australia.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that this agreement can act as a benchmark for the other agreements that the European Union intends concluding with various states. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As long as we can be sure that the civil rights of our citizens are not violated by an agreement, Parliament will, in my opinion, also be happy to approve similar documents with partners from other countries, whether in North America or elsewhere. The negotiated agreement is basically fine. In the future, however, we should focus on a number of important areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We should try in future negotiations to reduce the period of detention, and it would surely be worth considering incorporating the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Commissioner, not only through Article 87 on police cooperation, but also through Article 16 on data protection. Last but not least, we must legislate for the option of profiling. The agreement with Australia may not mention the option of profiling explicitly, but nor does it prohibit it, despite repeated requests. At the same time, I would like to call on the Commission in future to request an opinion from the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights regarding such specific agreements. Despite its shortcomings, I believe that the agreement with Australia sets a good precedent, and that Parliament will also be able to approve similar agreements with other countries in the foreseeable future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What Australia really wants to do with the personal data of European passengers remains totally unclear. This Parliament has asked for a guarantee that Australia will not build profiles based on personal data for the purpose of singling out for different treatment passengers who are under no suspicion. We have not received that guarantee. Obviously, we did not receive the guarantee because profiling is the reason why the authorities – not just in Australia, but also in the United States and Canada, and perhaps in the European Union too, in the future – want to collect passenger data.</p>
<p class="contents">Why should that be? There is still no evidence that storing passenger data is helpful in the fight against terrorism. If investigation services want a particular passenger’s data, they can request it from airline companies. They are really not going to throw that information away once the passenger has disembarked. Therefore, no authorities anywhere need to store data for five and a half years. For five and a half years in Australia, that is for decades in the United States, and who knows how long the storage time will be in the European PNR in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I reject the rapporteur’s argument that this agreement with Australia will have a positive impact on our negotiations with the US and Canada. On the contrary, this agreement seems to be a sign of just how bad these agreements can get. Long retention periods, data transfer to other institutions, even foreign intelligence services, and the risk that Europeans might be refused entry into Australia on the basis of their profiles. No, this is not about the Greens voting ‘no’ as a mere gesture, for if this House were to say ‘no’, that agreement would be illegal and then the transfer of data would be illegal. That is also why we support the request for an investigation into the fundamental rights of the PNR. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This changes nothing in relation to the basic problem of data protection, however, because the storing of PNR data has nothing to do with the identification of suspects at border checkpoints. On the contrary, what will happen is that the data belonging to all passengers will be stored willy-nilly where no grounds for suspicion exist in order subsequently to identify risky travellers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is particularly problematic that this huge infringement of fundamental rights is carried out in the name of combating terrorism, even though there is no evidence proving that PNR data is of any benefit in the fight against terrorism. Experts actually believe that even those individual successful investigations put forward to justify the retention of PNR data would also have been possible without PNR. Thus, we should not regard it as progress that the push procedure is to be used to forward data to Australia, after all this is the only regulation that is even half-way compatible with EU data protection law.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, data protection will remain illusory, even in relation to the agreement with Australia. In general, we should put an end to the practice of passing on data where no grounds for suspicion exist. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would just like to mention one point that perhaps goes beyond the scope of this specific report – but which seems to have been relegated to the background in our discussions recently – namely the principle of reciprocity. In other words, we should not just provide but also receive passenger data from our partners. This is clearly a rather controversial question, and relates to the establishment of a European PNR system.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that opinions vary widely on this issue. Those who fear it and reject it are concerned that it will provide even greater scope for invasion of privacy. But I think that, within an alliance, if one fully upholds and respects relations with one’s alliance partners, but acts on an equal footing – and indeed equality is a condition for reciprocity – then perhaps one is in a stronger position in terms of human rights guarantees too.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no coincidence for example that in defence policy, too, an idea increasingly coming to the fore at present is that Europe as an entity should be defined more robustly and strengthened, within the alliance too, of course. I therefore think that we should give consideration to a European PNR system in the same way as this report was produced, by seeking consensus, but speed up the process.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all the more important because, if the Commission decides to proceed with this, and Parliament gives the go-ahead for the establishment of an independent PNR system, then we will have a great deal of work to do, though of course there is no time to go into the details here. I would be very interested to hear Commissioner Malmström’s opinion on this. We will certainly also need to create the appropriate organisational framework, but it would probably be a great help to Member States if data transfer requests were able to take place not only on a bilateral basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We know that it is difficult to strike a balance between security and data protection. These criteria are nevertheless important, and this recommendation for a draft resolution contains most of them. Some unresolved issues remain, such as the five-and-a-half-year retention period, but the agreement does ensure that citizens have access to appropriate legal remedies. In fact, data can only be collected and retained if this is necessary for the purpose of preventing and detecting terrorist offences or serious transnational crime. In addition, close monitoring of the agreement’s implementation is a further guarantee that Parliament will, if necessary, be able to propose the suspension or termination of the agreement. An agreement of this sort can serve as a point of reference for future agreements, for example with the USA, Canada, and the other countries that have approached the Commission on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I found this strange because, in my case, with my Portuguese name which is made up of five names – that is, two personal names and three surnames – I fell into all these categories, and some of the reasons for this were that I was acting in the service of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this story has a broader significance, which it is important that the public understand: namely, that we have become used to being investigated as if we were suspected of a crime, and what is happening with this new model of investigation is that we are investigated even when we are innocent and not under suspicion. At this point, when we are going to vote on the first PNR agreement, which is the first time that we are legalising this kind of transfer in Parliament, it is crucial that the public know this, and we have not been sufficiently clear on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, I am concerned about several things in this agreement, including the consistency of our arguments about the time for which data should be stored. We in Europe are talking about months, but according to this agreement the data will be kept for five and a half years. As for issues of proportionality and whether a proportionality test has been approved or not, in her explanatory statement the rapporteur herself says that this proportionality test has not exactly been proven. I would like to say here that I am very sorry not to be voting in the same way as the rapporteur, who is a colleague, and I have no doubt that she has major concerns about the freedoms, civil rights and privacy of the European public. Nevertheless, I still do not believe that this agreement sets a good standard for what other foreign countries will ask of us further down the line, and what we say to the Australians now, we will also have to say to the US, Saudi Arabia and Korea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Protection of personal data – and I think that we all agree here – is a very sensitive and important issue to European citizens and, as such, the European Parliament needs to fight – and it is fighting – to defend the rights of the European citizens that we have all been elected to represent.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope that negotiations on the agreement with the United States and Canada continue and end in the same spirit. Today’s approval of the agreement illustrates that, despite the differences between our and a third country’s legal system, it is possible to negotiate at European level and dubious bilateral agreements with individual Member States can be avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to stress that the European Parliament wishes to see a clear link between the agreement being negotiated with the US and the general agreement on transatlantic protection of personal data also under negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to express my serious concern at the fact that Article 16 of the Treaty of Lisbon on the protection of personal data – which is the appropriate legal basis – was not taken as the legal basis. May I remind the House that the European Data Protection Supervisor has also expressed reservations on this point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But with that freedom has come some dangers. In particular we have seen how a terrorist can strike with devastating effect and how criminals have great ingenuity in getting whatever they require. There is a need for governments in particular to try to protect their citizens. The difficulty is where you draw the line, in particular between security and data protection, profiling, etc. But I think that, on balance, we are getting that balance right. What we have is not perfect but is certainly a basis for improving matters as we go forward, particularly when we are talking about agreements with the US and Canada, etc. It is a start: it is not perfect but is a step in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the case of this agreement with Australia, it is also impossible to avoid certain doubts as to whether the handling of data on EU citizens by the Australian security services will conform to EU law. The fact that the agreement bypasses the well-known criteria of the European Parliament for granting consent to the signing of agreements with third countries on the transfer of PNR data, shows that the Commission has either failed to do its work in an entirely professional way, or is to some extent indifferent to the opinion of the European Parliament and thus to the directly elected legitimate representatives of the people of Europe, which is even more serious, in my view. I firmly believe that the European Parliament is determined to cooperate with all countries in the fight against terrorism, but this must not be at the cost of violating the fundamental rights of our citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the question of necessity, the Commission has held quite a lot of meetings with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to try to explain, with examples from the US and Australia, the necessity and use of PNR. These sessions have been restricted because they are, of course, sensitive. I know that US representatives have also met members of that committee. We on the Commission side are, of course, willing to continue those meetings and to provide further examples and explanations if you wish.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand your frustration concerning the question of profiling, Baroness Ludford. It is indeed rather frustrating, because there is no legal definition of this: that is the problem. We do not have a legal definition and we cannot invent one. That is something we need to address. That is why we have this non-automatic process, in order to adhere as closely as possible to our own standards. You might not like this, but it is the only basis on which we can move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">A question was raised about the Fundamental Rights Agency. We did ask them for an opinion, but they told us that it was beyond their mandate to give an opinion on an international agreement, so they could not do so. We have, of course, consulted widely in other areas, but we cannot get a formal opinion from the Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are discussing today is the result of international negotiations between the European Union and Australia. We tried to achieve something together. In a negotiation – as we know, because we are very used to negotiating in the European Union – you give and take. You will not get 100%, but everybody will try to get the maximum possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Australia is, like every country in the world, entitled to collect passenger name data from the passengers who land there. All countries are allowed to do that, which is why the Commission has proposed a European PNR system. We will discuss that at some other time. Like it or not, it is a fact. Air carriers can be forced to provide these data, which they have been collecting since the beginning – for decades – for commercial purposes. Those data can be requested by a Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Our task is to make sure that these agreements are as robust as possible when it comes to protecting fundamental rights, and as clear as possible when it comes to limiting their scope to what is absolutely necessary. We must also make sure that the freedoms and integrity of passengers are protected as much as possible, and that provision is made for redress, erasure, access etc. I think that we have achieved this, and the agreement is very close to the resolution that you adopted a year or so ago, and the mandate given by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">There will also be a review. The agreement will be reviewed by the authorities in Australia, where of course there are also concerns about data protection, and there will be reviews from the EU side. Again, we have not yet got 100% of what we asked for, but I think most of our concerns are addressed here. I believe that this is a good agreement that takes into consideration both our aim to fight serious organised crime and terrorism, and the need to protect the freedoms and fundamental rights of the passengers. Thank you very much for your collaboration and the good spirit in which this debate has been conducted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are politicians. We are not activists. Sometimes we face very different dilemmas. I think everybody in this House – and this has been expressed by every single speaker – is facing those dilemmas, but we have to take tough decisions. Sometimes it hurts, and it hurts all of us – even the ones who are going to vote in favour.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to Ms Sargentini, who spoke about the consequences of rejecting the agreement, saying that, if we reject the agreement, the transfer of data will become illegal and can no longer be transferred. That is true, but then what? Are we going to suspend air travel altogether? I recognise that this would fit in with another Green objective, namely that of reducing CO<span class="sub">2 </span>emissions, which is a good objective, but it is not very realistic. Frankly, unless you can provide a credible alternative, a ‘no’ vote is purely symbolic and cheap.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to remind colleagues that we have to stick together because this is only the first step, as my colleague Mr Kelly rightly said. This is the first agreement. It is also the first step in a long process. It is the first reversal of the trend of unrestricted collection of data, and we are facing other negotiations. We are in the middle of very tough negotiations with Canada and the United States. It is more important than ever that we stick together, that we show the rest of the world that Europe is united and that we do stand up for fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect I would very much like to echo in particular the words of my colleague, Ms Sippel, about ‘push-pull’. We have emphasised very strongly how important it is that this agreement concerns ‘push’ only and not ‘pull’. That was in Parliament’s resolution and we will stick by it in the agreement with Australia and in other agreements that follow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
