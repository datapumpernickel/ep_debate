There is a legitimate hope that the first European legislation on renewable energy will soon come into force. This European legislation will help to increase the share of renewables in the electricity market. I am firmly convinced of that.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive will help us, the EU, to achieve our voluntary target of doubling the share of renewables by 2010. It will make an important contribution to innovation in electricity generated from wind, solar, hydro and biomass. In this way, the EU will demonstrate that it is willing to shoulder its responsibility for climate protection and a sustainable energy supply.</p>
<p class="contents">Just a few weeks ago I would not have made these statements in this way, as the Council common position differed from Parliament's position on some key points and the Council was initially showing little willingness to change its position. However, tomorrow you will be voting on the result of an intensive and productive negotiating process. There are 10 compromises worked out with the Council in an informal conciliation process on Amendments Nos 1 to 11, but without Amendments Nos 2 and 4. This demonstrates that the Council and Parliament have really moved closer together in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point I would like to very sincerely thank the shadow rapporteurs of the other groups, in particular Mrs Ayuso González and Claude Turmes. They have devoted a lot of time and energy to this process and have demonstrated a willingness both to fight and to compromise. I also owe an equal debt of gratitude to the Swedish presidency, which successfully endeavoured to shift the Council closer to Parliament's position. Last but by no means least I would like to thank the responsible Commission officials who played a very important moderating role in the negotiating process.</p>
<p class="contents">As is generally the case with compromises, we can perhaps be satisfied, if not exactly enthusiastic, about the outcome achieved. I regret that we have not been able to set any binding national targets. Even more importantly, I regard the definition of renewable energy sources before us as quite simply wrong. In order to make it easier to achieve the targets, some Member States have insisted on including the biodegradable component of household waste in non-separated refuse incineration. This not only runs counter to Europe's objectives for waste avoidance and treatment, but it also gives the wrong message and discourages greater use of genuine renewable energy sources.</p>
<p class="contents">I nevertheless request that you vote for the compromises reached with the Council. On the one hand, the directive will, by virtue of the amendments secured by Parliament, lead to a significant increase in the use of renewables. On the other hand, I am firmly convinced that it would not have been possible to achieve anything further, even in the conciliation process.</p>
<p class="contents">Now let me turn to the key positive results. First of all, the Member States will have to gear their incentive measures to indicative national targets. If it becomes clear that the overall EU target – doubling the share of renewables – cannot be achieved, then the Commission can make proposals for mandatory targets.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, before proposing any harmonised support scheme, the Commission will have to report on the success of the various national systems in achieving an increase in the market share of electricity produced from renewable energy sources.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, once any harmonised scheme comes into force, investor confidence regarding investments already made must be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, access to the grid for electricity from renewable energy sources is guaranteed. This should not be jeopardised because of feed-in or transmission charges.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, proof of origin of electricity generated from renewables will guarantee transparency for the public.</p>
<p class="contents">We have enormous potential for renewable energy sources here in Europe. We must exploit this potential in order to discharge our responsibility for sustainable development.</p>

I would therefore firstly like to congratulate the Commission on this report, as well as the Council, in particular the Swedish presidency, and the rapporteur, Mrs Rothe, on the effort they have made to find the necessary common ground so that in the end this directive can see the light and, furthermore, that it may do so in a way which is reasonably satisfactory for the majority, although it is true that not all the ambitious objectives which Parliament intended on first reading have been taken up.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive for the promotion of renewable energy is a bet on our future and an investment in the environment. That is why it is important to offer a legal framework to those who have already taken that gamble and are investing in this respect. Specifically, it is very important to negotiate sufficient transitional periods for current aid to maintain investor confidence. It is important to give priority to electricity from renewable energy sources in terms of access to the electricity network and that they are not discriminated against in the imposition of transport or distribution tariffs, especially in the peripheral regions. In order to justify the need for this directive, we must bear in mind, on the one hand, the differing degree of competitiveness still existing between renewable energy sources and conventional sources and, on the other, the external costs obviated by this type of technology.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that we must welcome them and, like Mrs Rothe, I would also like to ask this House to approve the compromise amendments which have been reached after so much effort. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She and Mrs Ayuso González have both expressed certain disappointment at the result, but I would say to Mrs Rothe that she should feel relief that what looked possible at one time has not come about. She has made considerable progress.</p>
<p class="contents">It is eminently sensible to promote renewable energy because it enables us to fulfil our environmental objectives, creates jobs and ensures security of supply. The items enumerated by Mrs Rothe are targets, not yet mandatory. But I am pleased that we have the fall-back position should Member States fail in their duty. There is a definition which excludes the use of municipal waste, gives permission for successful support mechanisms to continue and thereby boosts investor confidence. My own country, the United Kingdom – the windiest country in Europe – has some lessons to learn from work in other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We need other measures as well as this directive. I know the Commissioner would agree on the need for a framework for energy support. We need research and development in the Sixth Framework Programme. We need to look at the single market to ensure that it does not contradict the aims of this directive and we need to make sure that renewables take their full place when we consider the Security of Supply Green Paper.</p>

<p class="contents">Where should we focus our attention? First of all, upon the target figure of 12%, to be obtained by 2010. It is, of course, very tempting to underline that it would have had a greater impact if it had been a binding target percentage, rather than an indicative target figure, as it is now. I personally am in favour of imposing binding target figures, as long as the prescribed target figures are realistic and obtainable. Also taking into consideration the many unknown factors in the development of renewable energy, it appears to me particularly sensible to determine indicative target figures on the one hand, but at the same time to give the Commission some scope to submit proposals containing binding target figures to the Council and Parliament if it were to transpire that results were inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area of attention concerns the clear delineation of waste originating from separate waste collection and waste originating from combined waste collection. Needless to say, I can only consider the incineration of separate waste and, more specifically, the biologically degradable component of industrial and household waste, as a renewable energy source. Opponents wrongly claim that the incineration of household waste would curb the use of so-called real renewables, such as wind and solar energy, increase CO2 emissions and undermine recycling policy and restrictions on waste production.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore proof of sound judgment that, in its definition of what are, and are not, to be regarded as renewable energy sources, the common position leaves room for different types of renewable energy sources and, more specifically, for the incineration of separate waste. I can fully identify with this position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I congratulate Mrs Rothe, who successfully negotiated on behalf of all Members of Parliament. Next, Mrs Zackari, who ensured there was flexibility during the Swedish presidency and who, in fact, steered the Council towards a compromise that was acceptable to Parliament, and finally, Mrs De Palacio, who represented all those in the Commission who fully support the cause of renewable energy sources, without whom Parliament would not have been able to reach the compromises made with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, we will take an historic step towards renewable energy sources in Europe, which will provide 22% of electricity in 2010. This is a large proportion. I am very optimistic, even though I am aware that the first steps taken towards a new technology are always the most difficult. This is because, on the one hand, production costs have yet to be optimised, but the costs will fall as soon as mass production is reached.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another aspect that we are very familiar with, as politicians – relations involving power. The lobbies change sides once the technologies assume a greater economic significance in our societies, and the example of Germany is a wonderful illustration of this. The unions in Germany, which were against renewable energy sources and in favour of nuclear energy some five years ago, have changed sides because there are now more supporters for renewable energy sources than for nuclear energy.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this directive has also ensured that our industries are world leaders in areas that still have greater potential than we ourselves do in terms of renewable energy sources. Think of countries such as Brazil or India where we will gain market share.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to announce that I am going to nominate certain members of certain governments for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry and in Physics. When they manage to prove scientifically how a tonne of tomatoes burns all by itself, thereby producing renewable energy, I feel that they certainly will deserve the Nobel Prize. If I understand matters scientific correctly, you need plastic to burn tomatoes.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to avoid these sorts of exceptions, I feel that the Commission has a large part to play in preventing public funds being spent on incineration. Public funds must be used to develop the right technologies, particularly methanisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Without it the part played by renewable energy sources in the energy production of EU Member States would be very low, although the important role played by wind power in Denmark cannot be underestimated. Other renewable sources of energy are difficult to find. The view of the Council, according to which the incineration of unsorted waste is considered to be renewable energy, is unsustainable. Hydroelectric power should be supplemented by forms of energy other than waste incineration. Parliament is sticking to its target of twelve percent of gross energy consumption being produced by renewable energy by 2010, but this is not far away, so achieving this target may be wishful thinking. The lack of funding for the Altener Programme indicates that the EU is not playing a major role in achieving this target. Achieving this target is thus entirely down to the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It reduces the dependence on imports from third countries, it can be generated locally and it offers prospects for regional development. But more than anything, it is clean energy. The European Union backed an ambitious wish list during the climate negotiations in November last year. Europe was prepared to take the lead, for the US could not be counted on then either.</p>
<p class="contents">The Sustainable Energy Directive offered a good opportunity to put our money where our mouth was. At first reading, the European Parliament had opted for binding objectives and for a strict definition, so that not everything could simply fall within its scope. Unfortunately, this approach fell on deaf ears at the Council, and the European Union, which had called for domestic action for two weeks in The Hague, cried off.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise that is now before us is the best that can be achieved. My sincere congratulations to the rapporteur. It is sound work. This compromise requires a broad base and that is what we desperately need in the times ahead, for Europe cannot take a passive stance and wait to see what is going to happen. In the foreseeable future, we will once again have plenty of opportunity of showing that we are serious about sustainable energy. We must now prove that we are prepared to face the challenge. First of all, a common European research agenda is needed if we are to develop the technology which will speed up the transition to a low CO2 economy and if we are to learn from each other. The Sixth Framework Programme for research offers the ideal platform for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, large-scale investments are required. Sustainable energy is often associated with small-scale solutions: a solar panel on every roof and a few windmills in every village. That is wonderful, but unfortunately not enough. Sustainable energy also requires large-scale projects, and this is why Government commitment is required. It is once again time to translate words into action in order to turn this Directive into a success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that she has carried out excellent work and, step by step, has led this process towards an increasingly positive outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Turmes that the decision which we hopefully will take tomorrow is an historic one. It means the European Union taking a highly significant step towards a different energy system, a system which gives serious consideration to the climate issue and the need to diversify the energy system and to ensure that an increased proportion of our energy comes from energy sources which do not have an adverse effect on nature or the climate.</p>
<p class="contents">A transition to renewable energy sources is an important step. In parallel, major efforts must be made to ensure that our energy is used more efficiently. We have established a target in the directive whereby at least 22 percent of electricity is to come from renewable energy sources. Like Mr Turmes, I am an optimist in this respect. If demand increases, we know that performance and quality will increase and costs fall. This is the rule of thumb for all new technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, such a development is conditional upon energy policy generally being developed in the right direction. It is conditional upon subsidies for fossil fuels, particularly coal, being phased out, external costs for various energy sources being internalised in prices and research receiving a considerable boost.</p>
<p class="contents">The development we are now seeing is vital for Europe. It is naturally also vital for the candidate countries and the developing countries. I hope that, within the framework of this programme and the EU’s operations as a whole, we shall be able to develop systems which support candidate countries and developing countries alike in moving in this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Admittedly, the negotiations with the Council and Commission were painstaking, but an outcome was reached. We were able to come to compromise agreements which will allow improvements to be made to the Council and Commission proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also reiterate that the aim of the draft directive is to create a framework to enable a considerable improvement in electricity production from renewable energy sources. This directive provides a response to several major concerns such as sustainable development, environmental protection and respect for the Kyoto commitments, but also with regard to diversifying our supply sources, reducing the European Union’s reliance on energy and, lastly, the creation of new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I would like to go back to two difficult points, which were raised at the beginning of our discussions:</p>
<p class="contents">- on the one hand, the issue of non compulsory national targets. The issue is whether the national targets should be compulsory. We must remain realistic. Setting indicative targets has never provided much motivation for Member States. The discussions have not enabled us to reach an agreement, however. Fortunately, several proposals plan to make them compulsory in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">- on the other hand, the issue of whether or not to include waste incineration in the definition of renewable energy. The Council insisted on including it but this step did not receive unanimous support. As I personally see it, this seems to run counter to the Union’s efforts in the field of waste prevention and recycling. It is to be feared that this use of waste would essentially justify their production, which does not seem to be a good solution.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I would also say that we must support the provisions laying down facilities governing grid access. In conclusion, Mr President, as a militant and strong supporter of renewable energy sources, I welcome the progress made, but I hope I have pinpointed the difficulties which still need to be overcome in a world where the market and the search for short-term reductions in costs and prices take precedence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that on all issues relating to energy, we must be aware that we must improve sources or otherwise we will make planet Earth uninhabitable within a few years. It is essential that we guarantee support for this type of source for a considerable period, thereby allowing our industry to make decisive and long-term investments in this energy alternative. Therefore, to ensure a stable framework for renewable energy, within the timescale proposed in the report – although a broader timescale would have been desirable – is a proposal which we all can and must support.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the goals which we have set for ourselves, despite the fact that we should have been more ambitious, I believe that the objective of 12% of energy coming from renewable sources by 2010 is something which must be broadened but, in principle, it is a good start. Furthermore, it is essential that, in the future, when this amendment is amended and the sector is more established, we set binding objectives for each Member State and we will thereby demonstrate that the European Union also takes its commitments seriously in the environmental field.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, I consider it essential and urgent that we reach a pact at European level in order to support this type of energy source. Lastly, although I know it is not easy, we must state that, if we do not act immediately, in a few years time the coming generations are going to be facing a ruined planet. Therefore, for the sake of solidarity, we must leave behind a much more habitable world, and a future like that urgently requires all these renewable sources of energy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a matter of concern for us all that mandatory targets have not been agreed upon, but the various UN conventions provide a model here. I am thinking of Rio, where as a correspondent I was able to follow things in detail and see how from little acorns great oaks can grow. Much as there is to criticise in the basic structure of Europe's institutions, by means of this twin-track approach we have given the Commission a chance to take the initiative and subsequently propose mandatory targets. As she is present, I would like to take the precaution of calling now on the Commissioner to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also possible to learn something from successful systems. Spain, Germany and Austria have arrangements and means of handling renewables that others could also adopt. This is not to say that the world should simply adopt the German approach, but rather simply save unnecessary additional expenditure which subsequently leads to excuses that it was not possible to reach the targets.</p>
<p class="contents">When the rapporteur says that proofs of origin will guarantee transparency, that fits in very well with my repeated demand that the European institutions should set an example by being completely transparent for the benefit of the public. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would once again like to express my respect and admiration for the excellent technical quality and knowledge you have demonstrated in your cooperation, your work and your amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the debate today and the vote tomorrow will conclude the discussions on this directive and that we will therefore be able to adopt a text at second reading without the need for a conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an issue on which – as we have demonstrated – we must work together. This proposal forms part of the Commission’s response to two great challenges. The first great challenge is the problem of how the European Union should take its Kyoto commitments seriously, how to genuinely implement measures – undoubtedly at a certain cost – which demonstrate our will to fulfil the commitments made on an international level. That is our first objective, but we must not forget another interesting element of this proposal, which is increasing the European energy supply, that is, increasing the security of our supply, not to mention issues which some speakers have mentioned relating to the technological capacities of industrial development and, therefore, employment and our presence in international markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is pleased to be able to say that we can support all the transactional modifications proposed by Mrs Rothe. Although I am not going to list them, I would like to refer to certain points which have been highlighted during the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the issue of biomass. It is a delicate issue and we will have to see whether we can finally include the production of electricity from the incineration of unseparated municipal waste within the scope of the directive. That is to say, including that biodegradable waste. You are aware of the Commission’s initial position but I believe that, for the sake of achieving an initiative, the concession made in this area is warranted in order to achieve this result.</p>
<p class="contents">Strictly speaking, this waste is of a renewable origin, and that is why the Council has defended its inclusion. Nevertheless, the Commission had not proposed it within the definition of renewable energy, since this goes against a key point, the objective of reusing and recycling waste, a crucial question in the integral treatment of waste proposed by the Commission within its sustainable development strategies. However, I must stress that the Commission believes that we must reach a compromise, a pragmatic solution in order to prevent a conciliation procedure and a delay.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore accept the proposals put forward by Mrs Rothe; however, we cannot accept Amendments Nos 12, 13 and 14. Furthermore, we believe that the proposals in Amendments Nos 2 and 4 are not necessary and we agree with and support the proposal in Amendment No 11.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am optimistic – some of the speakers such as Mr Turmes have said so – that, over the next few years, the increase in the use of renewable energy is going to lead to a reduction in costs and, therefore, it is going to make it easier to incorporate its use into our energy mix in a clearer and easier way. This is a key pioneering initiative. Some of you – such as Mrs Ayuso, amongst others – have said that today is an historic day. In a year and two months – since the Commission approved its proposal – we are going to have an approved directive. I must stress that the reduction in costs is going to allow for an increase in renewable energy for producing electricity, I stress that this is a truly revolutionary proposal in many respects because, although some have said that the objectives are only indicative, these may become obligatory in relation to certain mechanisms, and this is the first time, in a field such as this, that we have set indicative objectives State by State. This is an extraordinary political burden and, in this respect – I am sorry, Mr Caudron – I cannot agree with your assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">In the next few months, I hope to be able to propose an initiative for the extension, the genuine promotion, of the use of biofuels and the acceleration of its incorporation within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would once again like to congratulate Mrs Rothe on her excellent work, as well as all the Members and the Swedish presidency on your work on this initiative. I hope that, tomorrow, the vote in this House will allow for the approval of certain consensus amendments which will allow it to be adopted on second reading and prevent any further delay, even to the point of conciliation, in the resolution of this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
