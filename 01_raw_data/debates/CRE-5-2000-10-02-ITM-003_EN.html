<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">President. </span></span>  – Ladies and gentlemen, in the last few days, as you know, Jerusalem, other towns and the Palestinian territories have been thrown into a state of unrest, and there have already been many victims. Earlier today, helicopters bombed targets in Gaza, thereby making the situation worse. I should like, on behalf of the European Parliament, to express my deepest outrage at this new outbreak of violence, and to express our heartfelt sympathy with the families of the victims in their sorrow and suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when the peace process is at a crucial stage, making real but precarious progress, Ariel Sharon’s visit to the Dome of the Rock cannot be seen as anything other than provocation. As this sad state of affairs shows, the status of Jerusalem is one of the keys to peace in the Middle East. The city bears the weight of powerful symbols for all three monotheistic religions. Attacking such symbolism is tantamount to rejecting the will for peace and hindering the search for a solution that is acceptable to all parties.</p>
<p class="contents">We do, however, know that, on both sides, there are men of peace who wish to forge ahead. The joint visit by Mr Ahmed Qurie and Mr Avraham Burg, Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council and Speaker of the Knesset respectively, in this House during our September part-session proved this once again. On the matter of Jerusalem, they displayed an open-mindedness and a willingness to listen that gave us hope.</p>
<p class="contents">As this part-session of the European Parliament opens, I call on the international community to do all it can to piece together the threads of dialogue as soon as possible. The European Union has reacted already. I would like to see it increasing its efforts, and the European Parliament will play a full role in this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask you to observe a minute’s silence.</p>

Please allow me to propose, on behalf of my group, that this very important issue, which involves the responsibilities of the European Union, as you have correctly pointed out, be included in the debate which we are going to hold tomorrow in connection with the Biarritz Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in the Middle East will clearly be one of the issues dealt with at this summit, even though it is informal. I would also like to stress, as you have rightly pointed out, that there has been unacceptable provocation by a leader of the Israeli extreme right known for his extremist activities in the past. I also believe that we must address our Israeli friends in the frankest possible terms and tell them that a democratic and legitimate government, such as theirs, cannot use gunfire and tanks to fight children and youths throwing stones. This is absolutely disproportionate and in no way helps the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I believe that, after the visit – on your invitation – of the Presidents of the Israeli and Palestinian assemblies last month, we have sufficient moral legitimacy to address our partners in the Middle East in the strongest terms, while offering them our services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Since Mr Barón Crespo has raised the subject, let me make my point on the matter immediately. In my opinion, since Parliament issued a very timely joint invitation to the Speakers of the Knesset and the Palestinian Legislative Council a month ago, specifically in order to indicate its willingness to become involved in promoting the peace process, we cannot, as Members of this Parliament, remain silent today.</p>
<p class="contents">In words with which I identify completely, you described the tragic situation developing right now in Palestine and in Israel. I fully understand that, tomorrow, Mr Prodi, the Council, and ourselves, or some of us, will be speaking in the general debate. We cannot, however, possibly limit ourselves to dealing with this tragic matter alongside a number of other very important matters, thus making it possible for a first person to discuss the Charter, the next to discuss the French Presidency and the Biarritz Summit, a third to bring up the Danish ‘no’ vote in the referendum on EMU, and only then have a fourth, on the subject of the Middle East. This would not do justice to the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">My group and I therefore suggest that, tomorrow if possible, or another day if necessary, we look into finding a way to devote an hour to this extremely important subject, and to adopt a resolution. It this were to prove impossible, I suggest that we should at least have a question on the subject in our topical and urgent debate. In any event, I would expressly ask that we make it impossible for anyone at the end of this part-session to claim that Parliament as such did not follow up your splendid statement and declare itself in favour of a return to peace in Israel and in the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do not think that we can change the whole agenda, as we have a great many topics to consider this week. I also have last Thursday's events in Belgrade in mind, and would like to suggest that we should include the Middle East peace process in tomorrow's debate on the Biarritz Summit.

These people were received and cared for by that town, but quite remarkably, they claimed to have been dropped across the border by the French police. The police had picked them up in Calais, taken them from Calais to the Belgian border and had no qualms about subsequently dropping them off in Belgium. A very strange business, all the more so because, according to other witness statements, it appears that this is not the first time this has happened.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, this incident has been settled at the highest level between the French and Belgian authorities, and it appears that they found a way of discussing it. However, to my great surprise, I was informed by a Belgian that it is not just the French who get up to these tricks, but also the Dutch and Germans. When I asked him if the Belgians do the same thing, he confirmed this and said, now and again. This leads me to conclude that everyone still has the standard European reflex, namely to pass on their problems to their neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it is high time that we, as European legislator and as European Parliament, at least pressed for a European reflex. Just as Europe did too little during the oil crisis, it is also making its presence felt insufficiently with regard to this disturbing problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So far there are 79 dead and 2 unaccounted for. This was a truly dreadful and horrific accident in which the human factor – the negligence of the crew members – appears to have played a decisive part. Nonetheless, there are serious indications that Community law has been violated, especially as regards the registration of passengers and compliance with the safety standards set out in Community directives and I think we should therefore start by welcoming the reaction of the European Commission, which is already investigating whether or not Community law was complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">We here in the European Parliament must undertake as quickly as possible to examine the Commission’s proposals on safety standards at sea, especially the so-called <span class="italic">Erika</span> package, which contains the Commission’s proposals on safety at sea following the accident last year involving this tanker. I also think that we and the Commission should look carefully to see if the timetable for Directive 98/18 on safety arrangements for ferry boat passengers can be reduced, given that some of the provisions in this directive last until 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, there should be no derogations for Member States, such as the present derogation for Greece for ferry boats over 27 years old. I also consider that it is wrong for Greece to have a derogation as regards liberalising transport by 2004 because this erodes safety standards in Greece, in my own country, even further. I think that competition can help standards to improve. The European People’s Party has tabled a motion along these lines and I trust that all the political groups will agree to debate it, given that it concerns an extremely important matter. It concerns the death of 80 of our fellow human beings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that there are shortcomings in the application of regulations both, national and European, and the Greek government is addressing this matter with the utmost diligence.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the 65 ships which have been banned from sailing are concerned, we should, I think, clarify the fact that these ships would have been banned from sailing on 1 October anyway, even if 79 people had not died. These are two separate issues; the IMO regulations happened to expire on 1 October and, as a result, these ships were classified as unsuitable. That is why they have been banned from sailing, not because these people tragically lost their lives.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, Madam President, that this is too serious an issue for the opposition to capitalise on and it is too serious to be addressed in an urgent debate followed by a simple vote, which is why the Socialist Group will vote against entering it for urgent debate. This does not, of course, mean that we were not shocked by the tragedy or that, as a government and as the Socialist Group, we shall not do everything humanly possible to increase the safety of ships in the Aegean, which has three and a half thousand islands and a huge number of ferries and, however serious this accident, compared with the number of voyages made in the Aegean every summer, it is one accident out of a huge number of successful sailings.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said which, it is of course tragic, and the time has come to re-examine shipping conditions in Greece and in Europe in far greater detail; but this does not mean that Greek seas are any less safe than the seas of any other Member State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If you had been better informed, you would have known that your description applies to only approximately 20% of Danes who voted ‘no’, and then only on a rough estimate. For the overwhelming majority of those who voted ‘no’, the vote was about democratic legitimacy to make decisions concerning our economic policy. There was a specific desire to avoid a situation in which important decisions are taken on as uninformed a basis as that unfortunately underlying your own pronouncement. The Danish people want a far clearer demarcation line between what the EU is to concern itself with and what the national parliaments are to continue to decide on.</p>
<p class="contents">As early as December in Nice, however, majority decision-making is to be introduced in the social and labour-market spheres, as referred to in Articles 42 and 137. If, subsequently – and with Article 42 as a basis – the circle of people covered by Regulation No 1408 is enlarged, and if majority voting is introduced under Article 137 on, for example, the criteria for granting unemployment benefit, this would have major consequences for both social and labour-market policy in Denmark. We are the only EU country which finances its social contributions through taxation, and we regulate our labour market through agreements. That is simply the basis for the way in which we have organised ourselves. One reason for the ‘no’ vote on the euro is that we want the Danish Parliament to retain the power of decision-making in these areas and that we also want it to continue to do so after Nice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This centre accommodates refugees attempting to enter Great Britain, apparently attracted by more favourable reception conditions, and also because of the greater problems in entering at other borders.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to inform you that this centre processes an average of between 800 and 1000 refugees a day, from all over the world, particularly from Iran, Iraq and one region in Turkey, namely the Kurdish region, and the centre has received 16 000 refugees since opening eleven months ago. This is a direct result of the lack of harmonisation in the conditions for reception and the status of refugees in Europe. Admittedly, the French and Belgian case referred to earlier is an important one. This must not, however, be allowed to dull our determination. Instead, it should increase it. I have written to Commissioner Vitorino to this effect, in order to convey our determination to have a joint European policy on this, indeed our demand for this, before further tragedies have a chance to happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to congratulate you on your statement on the tragic events taking place in Jerusalem. I cannot say the same about your remarks to the Spanish press during your recent visit to Madrid, when you said that nationalism means war. Although that opinion was shared by the late Mr Mitterrand, I believe it to be narrow-minded and intolerant rather than open and democratic. To use the phrase from the dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy: "a nation is a group of people of the same origin who speak the same language, have a shared tradition, a shared territory and an awareness of the same destiny", and the same dictionary defines nationalism as "the devotion to a nation of the natives of that nation", and there is nothing more natural, more human, and more keenly felt by the citizens than devotion to one’s nation.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I accept that there is aggravated nationalism, extremist nationalism and violent nationalism. However, we cannot put all forms of nationalism into one pigeonhole. There are more than a hundred historic peoples in Europe who can be classed as nations, and there are millions of people in Europe who are nationalists and are devoted to their nation. Nationalism is also the devotion to and the defence of the nation state.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I ask you to respect the nationalists in this House, who are moderate, peaceful and democratic.

That is what Mrs Fontaine was referring to, because, as I have said, I witnessed the whole of her visit. If Mr Ortuondo, as a nationalist, is not involved in that type of nationalism, then he has nothing to worry about. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that the European Parliament has a duty to hold this simple vote which says what? Precisely that we are calling on the Commission to look at the larger picture, which is safety at sea in the European Union. Who can possibly be opposed to that? That is what we are calling for, that is what the motion is calling for. Is that so bad? I think we should all vote in favour and then get on with examining safety at sea in the European Union.

Those rights are very important, but one of the basic rights of the citizens of the EU is to have free movement for themselves and the goods which some of them may wish to carry. For the last few weeks many of them have been unable to enjoy these rights as a result of various disruptions at a number of border points, including the Channel ports, but inland as well. We were warned by DG II that there might well be difficulties today. Many of us, therefore, changed our travel arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">I saw members of the Commission this summer to ask them about compensation which is paid, where claimed and appropriate, to those who carry goods and are blocked from doing so. But under our regulations there is no provision whatsoever for citizens – either on tourism or business – to claim such compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">I asked for an urgency this week. I appreciate that there are many other urgent matters to consider. The Conference of Presidents turned down my request for this urgency, but this matter continues day after day, week after week. I ask you, therefore, to press the Commission to bring forward regulations as quickly as possible to give citizens the same rights as those that carry goods, in the event of them being prevented from enjoying the free movement to which they are entitled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Within the last few days the British Consul has discovered that in reward for his protests against being kept in solitary confinement, prisons guards have subjected him to three days' worth of beating and left him with severe facial injuries. Tonight we will be debating the Asia-Europe summit, and I have no doubt that the resolution we eventually adopt will emphasise our commitment to human rights.</p>

A junior staff officer in the German Army has since then been dismissed because of racist comments, and three police officers in Cologne have been suspended from duty for swearing at a Tunisian taxi driver, knocking him to the ground and kicking him. Two children were slightly injured in an arson attack on a hostel providing temporary accommodation in Wuppertal in which a Molotov cocktail was thrown at the building. A racist motive is suspected and further inquiries are being made in that direction. A number of people suspected of having committed this attack have already been arrested. In Düsseldorf, a group of up to 20 people attacked and injured a black person who had spoken out against vulgar racist comments and was consequently beaten up.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of all this, I can only repeat that these incidents are directly connected with racist policies. So there can no longer be any question of treating migrants or people whose appearance is different as criminals. Quite the opposite – it is precisely racist incidents of this kind that must be regarded as criminal acts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
