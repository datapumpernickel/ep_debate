<p class="contents">With this text, which complements the other three proposals, on family reunification, economic immigration, and the status of long-term residents, the Commission brings to a close the legislative work aimed at laying the foundations of a joint legal immigration policy, since we have decided not to table a proposal designed to cover all individuals not included under the previous proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that Parliament has responded to the Commission by adopting this report so quickly. This proposal targets migration by third-country nationals for the purpose of studies. This is a special type of immigration to the extent that it is temporary and lasts no longer, in principle, than the educational course itself. It also brings reciprocal benefits for both the countries of origin and the host countries, not to mention, of course, the migrants themselves, who profit directly from it.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal integrates immigration policy but should also be viewed in the context of Community action in the field of education. Clearly, our aim is to promote migration for educational purposes, above all by accepting the greatest possible number of third-country students into higher education. The proposal for a directive was devised in this spirit. The entry conditions anticipated in it were rendered as objective as possible, in order to guarantee the quick and easy processing of applications. They are also phrased clearly and thoroughly so that the Member States can combat attempts to abuse them. This is also, I believe, an innovative proposal which fits into the context of the growing internationalisation of education, especially the recognition of students’ right to move to another Member State to continue their studies, after previously being admitted into a first European Union Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal also covers the vocational training sector, setting entry conditions for unremunerated trainees such as those who come to take up a placement with a company. It is thus designed to complement the proposal for a directive on the admission of workers that covers remunerated traineeships. Following meetings held with non-governmental organisations, provisions on secondary school pupils and volunteers arriving in the European Community were introduced into our proposal. The aim is to facilitate exchange programmes for secondary school pupils. Encouraging the discovery of culture by pupils who will later be tempted to return as higher education students will reap enormous benefits for the Community. In addition, a provision regulating the admission of volunteers was added to the proposal, protecting such individuals from a potential legal loophole. It must be obvious that the Commission did not lose sight of public security considerations. The proposal contains a public order and security clause providing Member States with enough room to manoeuvre for them to take precautions against the terrorist threat, in particular. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Roure (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, by way of introduction to my speech, I would like to thank most sincerely all the shadow rapporteurs from all the groups. Thanks to the work we have carried out together, we can send a strong signal in this highly sensitive field. I would also thank the Commission for its support, which was particularly welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital that our countries offer an appropriate welcome to foreign students, just as it is vital to have a common policy on this welcome. In this way we can contribute in a positive manner to the training of future executives in third countries and increase cooperation with these countries in terms of education in order to meet the challenge of the internationalisation of teaching.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal for a directive would make it possible to achieve significant progress that we can all support. We would point out that a legal basis has at last been provided for volunteers. We would also point out that this instrument might enable us to catch up with the United States, where residential study programmes are broadly encouraged and facilitated. We are entering into a strategy that aims to increase cooperation with third countries in terms of teaching as set out, for example, in the <span class="italic">Erasmus World</span> programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The votes in committee allowed a few clarifications to be made and I shall now cite some of these. We would call for the introduction into the directive of researchers, who are no longer students but do not carry out paid work. We would also emphasise that we wanted to contribute to the fight against brain drain from South to North. Receiving third-country nationals for study purposes must not lead to an increase in brain drain from these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We would similarly like to see an improvement in procedural guarantees and we therefore propose reducing the deadline for notifying applicants of decisions on applications for admission or renewal from 90 days to 60 days. We also propose greater flexibility concerning the student residence permit. Where the study programme is shorter than one year but longer than nine months, like many programmes, it would be a shame not to grant a one-year residence permit to enable students to work during the holidays preceding or following the study programme in order to earn some of the money required for their stay, or to improve their knowledge of their host country for a few weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a directive grants students and unpaid researchers the possibility of working for a maximum of 10 to 20 hours per week. This right is essential in order to allow third-country nationals to boost their income in order to live decently. Furthermore, with regard to unpaid researchers, I believe it is very important for trade union representatives to be informed of their specific situation in order to be able to monitor compliance with the provisions of the directive. Withholding the right to work in the first year of residence or withdrawing the right to work if students do not make sufficient progress in their studies is unjustifiable and would tend to encourage illegal employment and exploitation of these nationals. Where there is insufficient progress in studies, attested to by the teaching establishment, the Member State could possibly have the option of reducing the number of working hours so that the student could devote more time to their studies. That is why I believe the amendment tabled to that effect to be satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">We have the concerns of some Member States about the possible effects of the right to mobility and the right to work granted to students. I understand these concerns, but the proposal for a directive itself contains responses to this, in particular with regard to the mobility of students, which is very clearly defined, with specific conditions, in Article 7. Thus, the proposed directive does not apply to the mobility of students wishing to exchange student status for immigrant worker status. This status, granted by a working residence permit, is the subject of the Terrón i Cusí report that we adopted in plenary last February. A change in status from student to immigrant worker is of course possible, but is outside the scope of the directive in question.</p>
<p class="contents">We would point out that the Commission is simultaneously for an open policy with regard to the admission of students from third countries, in accordance with the wishes of the Member States, and for a policy of firmness with regard to persons or networks which voluntarily abuse the system. I therefore believe, ladies and gentlemen, that we should seize the opportunity to send a strong message to the Council calling for it swiftly to reach an agreement on this important matter in order to ensure a welcome that is worthy of our Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, I should like to pay tribute to the great effort she made to reach a consensus across the political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">As stated previously, this Commission initiative supplements others regulating immigration for reasons of employment, self-employment or otherwise. It also supplements the directive on family reunification. In so doing it contributes to approximation of national legislation in this area, as recognised at the Tampere European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Students enjoy ever-greater mobility. They are always on the go, and third-country student exchanges certainly contribute to our cultural enrichment. It would therefore also be beneficial to promote exchange visits by European Union students to third countries, although this is not the aim of this directive. It is undoubtedly beneficial for Europe if third-country students undertake part of their studies here. Europe certainly gains, but it is also important to ensure those students receive the best training so that they will be able to make a useful contribution to the development of their countries of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">Whenever there is discussion of immigration from developing countries it is always stated that promoting growth and development is the best way of combating illegal immigration. I therefore share the concern expressed by the rapporteur. I believe the European Union must grant entry to immigrants wishing to study here. It is however essential for those students to return to their countries of origin on completion of their studies. They should be able to put the knowledge they have acquired to good use. We must not be party to creaming off the most able individuals from developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the entry requirements we are currently considering, namely specific requirements to regulate immigration for study purposes or for volunteering, we should take account of the circumstances of each Member State. This is stated in the Commission’s proposal. A monitoring system is called for, to help combat illegal trafficking networks and exploitation in the workplace. Consequently, I support the Commission’s proposal to grant Member States authority to order the expulsion of a migrant for reasons of public order, or to refuse to renew a residence permit. Immigration for study purposes needs to be regulated to prevent ghost centres from springing up. The latter could then set up illegal immigration networks.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to ascertain that the higher education or vocational training institutions are legally recognised. In addition, these centres should be in a position to guarantee quality learning for the students. In the case of apprentices, it is also important to ensure that they can gain practical experience in specialised centres or companies. Care should be taken to ensure that entry permits for apprentices do not become a cover for illegal employment. The centres need to be properly equipped too.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to residence permits, it is certainly appropriate to be able to renew a residence permit for student exchanges when all the conditions have been met. This would allow students to complete more than one academic year in the same institution. The period of residence granted could even exceed the duration of the studies, though as Mrs Roure stated, a limit must nonetheless be set. My group tabled an amendment providing for a period of residence of one year if the higher education course was of nine months’ duration. That is the usual length of an academic year</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, safeguards or restrictions applying to students who fail to make satisfactory progress in their studies must also be put in place. Failure to do so would amount to opening the floodgates to students whose sole intention was to come to work. There would be little incentive to make good progress on the courses of study. My group has therefore also tabled an amendment allowing Member States to reduce the period in which students may work if they do not make satisfactory progress in their studies.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has included in the report a number of amendments aimed at ensuring that this directive covers third-country nationals who are unpaid researchers. I am not opposed to the idea. It might however be appropriate to have a specific Commission initiative on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, it is certainly the case that unpaid research and vocational training could be dealt with in a similar way.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Coelho (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Roure for the work she has carried out, and to underline what Mr Oreja Arburúa has just said about ensuring that the measures we are about to approve benefit their intended targets and are not cynically exploited.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to remind you of the Lisbon strategy, approved at the European Council on 24 March 2000, in which the challenges facing the Union in the new knowledge-based economy were set out. In that strategy, mention was already made of emerging teaching, research and training needs, which must not be confined within the Union’s geographical borders. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that every one of these areas exerts a potential attraction all over the world, as befits Europe’s extraordinary cultural and scientific heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">It is thus the responsibility of the European Union and the Member States to implement policies which attract third-country students. We therefore welcome this proposal, which is another step towards approximating national legislation on admission and residence conditions for third-country nationals, the final goal being to create a comprehensive legal framework regulating admissions on the basis of the reasons for immigrants’ visits.</p>
<p class="contents">The internationalisation of education and the increased mobility of students is in line with the aim of developing quality education, as laid out in Article 149 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community. It helps in promoting inter-cultural understanding, energising European educational systems and attaining high-quality teaching standards. For all these reasons, I think that the Commission’s proposal is quite positive. It constitutes a forward step in strengthening cooperation with third countries and in developing that quality education. The admission of third-country nationals for the purposes of studies, vocational training or voluntary service has the peculiar distinction of being temporary and independent of the host State’s labour market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Offering young people from other states the opportunity to spend some of their formative years in Europe is something we should all be seeking to do, because we all stand to benefit from it. I do however believe that establishing clear, specific and common standards is crucial to the success of these programmes. This will avoid subjecting students to difficult procedures that could also be humiliating. The criteria for choosing a place to study or to undertake voluntary work should always be its appropriateness or excellence. The existence of entry or residence facilities should not influence the choice.</p>
<p class="contents">Clear rules and flexibility are certainly needed to allow a student to earn money legally in reasonable conditions for his or her stay. Common principles are called for, such as the Commission’s proposal. I believe this proposal is very helpful. We recognise that reasonable restrictions are required. In particular, this is to ensure that the students return to their countries and put what they have learnt to good use. They can also spread the new skills and approaches developed during such an experience. That is probably even more important. It cannot and must not be achieved solely through strict regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">I venture to suggest to the Commission that this proposal should be included in future generous and ambitious actions involving the countries of origin of such students. There needs to be scope for mobility, for example, to maximise the benefits the Union can gain from hosting these individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust no further difficulties or reasons will emerge that will prevent the Council from adopting the proposal on this occasion. I have in mind a threat to the security of Europe, for instance. The proposal needs to be fast-tracked through the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Roure deserves to be congratulated on her work. I commend this helpful report to the House and call for it to be endorsed by a substantial majority of Members. Hopefully this will be achieved for once, and a precedent set. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The most obvious example of this is the last report concerning the right to family reunification, the Fourtou report, in which the concept of family had become unrecognisable, such was the extent to which it had been extended and denatured.</p>
<p class="contents">In its frenzy to allow needy foreigners from all over the world into a Europe that it would like to be respectful of human rights and to have a humanist, not to say humanitarian, vocation, the Commission is planning the death of nations by drowning and suffocation.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted, however, that this report, even though it supplements the measures that have already been presented with regard to immigration for the purposes of employment and family reunification, does not take the same approach. It concerns students and school pupils who would enter the Union in order to study. In this regard, nonetheless, we need to establish the length of stay, methods of monitoring their studies, and procedures for non-renewal of the student residence permit.</p>
<p class="contents">This exchange and this form of cooperation between Europe and third countries is clearly a source of intellectual enrichment between students of the country of origin and the host country. Should we not, however, devote our efforts more to aid to development in less advantaged countries, in order to allow these countries to train their elite at home and keep them there, in order to prevent brain drain, which, unfortunately for them, is often inevitable?</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, this would require a genuine cooperation policy with disadvantaged third countries and a sea change in immigration policy in Brussels. Sadly, we are far from achieving this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, this is a very timely report. We know the importance of the entry of third-country nationals for temporary periods of study, which brings enormous benefits and advantages for the host country and the student alike.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of students undertaking such international exchanges is greater than ever and demand continues to grow. This must be welcomed by all sides, apart from the previous speaker. Indeed we need to put into place measures to ensure that the European Union continues to remain a centre of excellence in this field. I congratulate the rapporteur on this report. It sets a broad framework to encourage third-country nationals to enjoy the best educational facilities available in Member States without over-prescribing and over-regulating. Common practices to facilitate the movement of third-country nationals can only be a good thing.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am afraid certain elements of this proposal are problematic for my country, the United Kingdom. Colleagues will be aware that the United Kingdom and the English language have a magnetic appeal for huge numbers of students, not just from European Union countries, but from all over the world. Whilst this is welcomed and understandable, it creates special challenges, not least of which are the proposals here and how they affect the national minimum wage in the United Kingdom. The national minimum wage is one of the greatest steps forward in the United Kingdom since 1997. It requires employers not to take on third-country nationals unless they are paid at least the going rate for the job. Unfortunately aspects of this report, referring to volunteers, undermine the minimum wage in the United Kingdom, which seeks to protect the rights of both migrants and nationals, ensuring that those engaged on a voluntary basis, without adequate conditions of service, are not there in place of a full- or part-time worker.</p>
<p class="contents">The concerns are specific to the United Kingdom. In general the report is balanced and sensible. I shall be voting for it in the hope that the UK will be joining later on, as in other cases. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Europe of the future must become a land of exchange, of meetings and mixing. What could be more important than knowing our neighbours, their culture and their language? In any case, that is what we say every morning. For fifty years, we have been building a multicultural Europe, not a one-sided Europe. Our Europe, that melting pot of cultures, languages and people, is possible thanks to free movement and study programmes. Furthermore, we would like to build a Europe based on knowledge and lifelong learning. However, a knowledge-based Europe can only exist through exchanges, in particular exchanges with third countries. As the Nobel Prize-winner Octavio Paz so rightly wrote, ‘every culture is born of mixing, meeting and confrontation; quite the opposite, it is isolation that destroys civilisations’.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to Mrs Roure’s excellent report, we have the privilege of enabling young people from all over the world to come to this old Europe of ours in order to learn a language, study, or hone and share their knowledge. As Mrs Roure so clearly pointed out, knowledge-sharing is a source of enrichment both for immigrants and for countries of origin and host countries. By allowing easier, more homogenous access for students, researchers and volunteers, we are also allowing Europe and our fellow citizens to enrich and share their knowledge and experiences. We cannot, therefore, close our doors to all these people who wish to learn, share and understand. All the conditions must be met in order to allow third-country nationals to come to Europe to train or hone their knowledge, because knowledge is the only thing that increases when shared. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
