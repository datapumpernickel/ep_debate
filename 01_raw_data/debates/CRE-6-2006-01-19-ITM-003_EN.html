It is particularly timely, since I have just returned from a visit to Gaza, the West Bank and Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">I had three objectives for this trip: first, to lend support to democracy-building in the run-up to the Palestinian elections. There is an important Election Observation Mission there with your colleague, Mrs De Keyser; secondly, to underline the importance of European Union financial support to the Palestinian people, and, thirdly, to thus raise the visibility of a number of EU projects, notably in Gaza.</p>
<p class="contents">I spent a whole day in Gaza. The security situation there is very complicated, it was not easy to go in but in the end it was a good day and I hope that the images brought to the Palestinian people show how much we, the European Union, are standing by them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a critical moment in the Middle East. In both Israel and the Palestinian territories, there have been tremendous changes in the political landscape. I hope that these elections will bring about two leaderships that are ready and able to inject new vigour into this peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">I made it clear to both Israelis and Palestinians that the Commission will continue to offer its support to all those who seek peace by peaceful means. That means in particular that whatever the composition of the new Palestinian Government, there must be full respect for the principles enshrined in the Interim Association Agreement and in the Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan that we agreed with the Palestinian Authority. These principles include respect for human rights and the rule of law, and thus a clear commitment to the roadmap.</p>
<p class="contents">The Palestinian Authority has given the international community assurances that the elections will take place free from violence and intimidation and according to international standards; we can only hope that this will come true. President Abbas has also made it clear that acceptance of the Oslo Accords and the roadmap forms the basis for participation in the future government. I think it was important that he gave such a clear message.</p>
<p class="contents">Acting Prime Minister Olmert, whom I also saw, assured me that Israel would facilitate the holding of these elections. His government took a difficult decision, in the context of an Israeli pre-election campaign, to allow voting in East Jerusalem. I welcomed that decision and I hope that this constructive spirit will help resolve any other remaining logistical and practical aspects of the elections. Within the security constraints, it will be very important that Israel does all it can to allow free movement for voters and candidates in the Palestinian territories up to and including polling day.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is supporting the Palestinian elections with the biggest Election Observation Mission – 240 observers, including 50 of your colleagues. I visited the Observation Team led by Mrs de Keyser, and was most impressed by her dedication and professionalism and that of her team. I was also impressed to meet the Chairman of the Central Election Commission, Dr Hanna Nasir. Thanks to the sustained support of the European Union – with which the Commission has been involved since 2003 – the CEC has established itself as one of the most credible and respected institutions in the Palestinian territories. During my visit, I announced another EUR 1.4 million to help with voter registration and polling activities, which brings our support for the election process to EUR 18.5 million, which is a large amount of money to try to make these elections free and fair.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the purposes of my visit to Gaza was to raise the profile of the important work we are doing, providing urgent assistance to make Palestinians’ ordinary lives more bearable. We are improving the health system, building schools and repairing roads, making improvements as regards solid waste, sewage waste and electricity grids. Much of that will be to the benefit of the Palestinian people and I hope they understand that it comes from the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I inaugurated some public works programmes and also announced the launch of four new energy and environment infrastructure projects in Gaza worth EUR 20 million. We are working with all possible speed, but the security situation is not making our work any easier.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet revitalising Gaza’s economy is essential. What I saw only strengthened my conviction on that, and I will continue to press this point in the Quartet – there will be a Quartet meeting on 30 January in London, after the Afghanistan conference – and with Israel. We must continue to improve free movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza. So, I have relaunched the procurement process for a EUR 25 million cargo terminal at the airport. We visited the airport, and we know how important it is to open it up, not only to the region, but also to the world, to help facilitate Palestinian trade once it has been reopened. We will only be able to go ahead with the project once there is an agreement between both sides. We therefore strongly support Jim Wolfensohn with the whole scope of the project that he has outlined since the opening of the Rafah crossing.</p>
<p class="contents">We will not be able to step up travel in and out of Gaza without properly managed borders. I visited the Rafah border crossing and I must say that General Pistolesi and his team at the EU Border Assistance Mission are doing an excellent job. I was moved to see that Europeans are helping ordinary Palestinians to move across the border with Egypt for the first time in many years; this maintains the great dignity of the Palestinian people. They are very happy. I spoke to two women who expressed the hope that things might slowly get better. Therefore, we will provide a further EUR 3 million package of support for the Rafah border crossing. We are carrying out customs duties there, so it will provide scanning equipment as well as training for the Palestinians.</p>
<p class="contents">I made it clear to both my Israeli and Palestinian counterparts and interlocutors that the European Union is contributing substantially to creating the conditions for a two-State solution. Like everyone involved, we face major challenges, but we are in it for the long haul. We want to make a long term commitment. I clearly reiterated that. We have been a consistent and reliable partner for both sides. But to make progress, both sides must move.</p>
<p class="contents">Israel should take steps to implement the agreement brokered in November by the Quartet Special Envoy Jim Wolfensohn on improving movement and access – the port, the airport, the link between Gaza and the West Bank and movement within the West Bank. And the Palestinian Authority must take charge of law and order and public finances. It must take serious steps to relaunch its reform programme and respect its commitments under the Interim Association Agreement and the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan.</p>
<p class="contents">At this critical juncture, our message is very clear: there is a need for negotiations; all action threatening a two-State solution must cease; and imposing law and order and fighting terrorism are important.</p>

We are grateful for the Commissioner’s commitment, both personally and representing the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">These elections take place in a highly challenging environment, which we certainly acknowledge. But the importance the European Parliament attaches to their successful completion, and indeed to the peace process, can be seen in its having again authorised the largest observation delegation of 30 elected Members, which I am again proud to lead jointly with Mrs Napoletano from the PSE Group. Indeed, many Members present here today will be in Palestine next week.</p>
<p class="contents">The current situation in the Middle East represents a failure of diplomacy nearly a century ago. The only democracy to date in the region is Israel, born of a genuine desire to create a Jewish homeland. T E Lawrence of Arabia – who is a distant cousin of mine – wanted that too, but he also had a different vision for the region. A recently discovered map he drew in Versailles shows <span class="italic">Arab</span> kingdoms, not British and French dominions.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, however, we welcome the return of Europe in a different guise. In her spending commitments for the Palestine Authority, could the Commissioner envisage funding a new chamber for the Palestine Council? As colleagues know, democracy is my watchword. At the Egyptian elections, which we witnessed last year, we saw intimidation of voters, including those supporting Dr Ayman Nour, leader of the secular al-Ghad Party. The European Union rightly says that his subsequent sentence at a show trial to five years’ hard labour by the same judge who put Saad Ibrahim in jail for three years sent negative signals. I should like to ask the Commissioner: what is the negative response from Brussels?</p>
<p class="contents">The Middle East is a region of fundamental strategic importance and a source of danger. The London bombers last July came from my constituency in Yorkshire. But the key to stability is democracy. I am also proud, as a Vice-President, to represent the European Parliament on the Delegation to the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly. But I also believe that the European Union needs a dedicated programme of democratic engagement in the region, and I look forward to hearing from the Commissioner what her plans are in that regard.</p>

I should also like to send my best wishes to Prime Minister Sharon, as well as to Mrs Livni, for the important tasks she is taking on within the Israeli Government.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in the Middle East is constantly changing. In Israel, Deputy Prime Minister Olmert seems determined to take forward the process begun by Prime Minister Sharon, in view of the elections on 28 March. In Palestine, the imminent elections – the outcome of which is by no means clear – bring with them the important news that Hamas is standing in the national parliamentary elections for the first time.</p>
<p class="contents">We are faced with a dynamic situation, but one that is vulnerable to further setbacks. The extremely fragile peace process – one might say that it never got off the ground in the way it was designed to in the Road Map – may be ruined once and for all by the escalating situation in the entire area, from the difficulties in stabilising Iraq to the alarming position taken by the Iranian leadership, the fragile situation in Lebanon, the role of Syria and the turbulent situation within Egypt.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to the Palestinian elections, I do not wish to sidestep that most thorny of issues – that is to say, the issue of Hamas. Regardless of the outcome of the elections, Hamas will play a key role in relation to the institutional representation of the Palestinian people. I will refrain from doing or saying anything that might increase the support for, and influence of, Hamas and I will instead try to emphasise the fact that if a movement aspires to the highest echelons of political and institutional representation, then it must be willing to play the democratic game, starting with respect for international law and an end to violence.</p>
<p class="contents">From that point of view, I see it as a positive development that Hamas candidates have signed the code of conduct, even though there remains a general feeling of concern at the climate of violence in which the elections will take place, particularly in Gaza. I should, however, like us to be more appreciative of the pluralism that is emerging in Palestine, which is also symbolised by new, secular electoral lists, bearing witness to the need for democracy, transparency and efforts to combat corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">The state of Israeli-Palestinian relations also has a bearing on the situation within Palestine. That is another reason why Israel should stop the settlements in all the territories and refrain from acting in such a way as to jeopardise the chances of resolving the conflict, beginning with East Jerusalem, where a real annexation policy is being pursued. The voting agreement in East Jerusalem is therefore – as you said – a positive development, even though we are well aware of its limitations, having observed the Presidential elections. Nevertheless, it still has huge symbolic value.</p>

These elections may be six months later than planned, but that is a drop in the ocean for the generations who have longed to exercise their democratic rights.</p>
<p class="contents">With a EUR 18.5 million contribution to support the electoral process and the deployment of a skilled observation mission, including an experienced delegation from this House, the EU is showing the Palestinians the path to effective democracy. It is a critical time for stability in the Middle East. It is crucial for the Palestinian Authority to acquire more democratic legitimacy. Only with effective, functioning democratic institutions can the Palestinians lay the foundations for their own state, living in peace with Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">Some think legitimacy impossible with a black-listed terrorist organisation competing in the polls, but Hamas has rebranded itself as a change and reform movement and has maintained a state of calm in the run-up to these elections in spite of Tuesday’s killing on the West Bank. It has built popular support, perhaps as much as 40%, by providing numerous social services in an atmosphere of pessimism, anger and joblessness. Muhammad Abbas’s ruling Fatah faction would also be hard pushed to meet our level of legitimacy with the legacy of cronyism and corruption. Only this week the EU suspended EUR 35 million in aid to the Palestinian Authority, and rightly so, because the necessary benchmarks have not been met.</p>
<p class="contents">Change and reform are positive words, but they need to be accompanied by concrete deeds. In recent months, Hamas has made gestures towards moderation and its infamous Israel policy was not included in its election manifesto. But if Hamas wants to work with the EU it must be ready to push the peace process forward. That can only happen if it lays down its arms, drops its charter calling for the destruction of Israel and recognises the Jewish State’s right to exist. As Javier Solana has indicated, the taxpayers in the EU will not be in a position to sustain political activity conducted along violent lines.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a test for the leadership skills of Ehud Olmert as he takes the helm after Ariel Sharon’s stroke earlier this month. How he manages the challenges to law and order in Gaza, particularly as settlers step up their violent efforts to prevent eviction from the West Bank, will set the tone for the talks we hope will materialise after these elections. But the threat of unrest should not stand in the way of democracy and we welcome Israel’s decision to facilitate voting in East Jerusalem, where Palestinians have been virtually annexed, split from their families by a separation barrier condemned by the International Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Moves by Israel now to comply with international law would be a tremendous confidence-building measure and an important step on the road to stability in the Middle East. With the threat of nuclear developments in Iran hanging over the region, steps must be taken now to demonstrate that respect for international law is alive and well in the Middle East. UN sanctions against Iran will only gain real legitimacy in the region if Israel is made to turn around its defiance of Security Council resolutions, a defiance unmatched by any other nation. Otherwise arguments of double standards will only add fuel to the fire.</p>

The hope could be dashed very quickly, however, because events on the ground do not give much cause for optimism. In fact, in Jerusalem, right at the heart of the conflict, the situation is very worrying. We, here in Parliament, are concerned that the Commission should have decided not to publish a report on the situation in Jerusalem, which was a report agreed to by all of the Union's services working there. I believe that the situation in Jerusalem may represent a great obstacle to the creation of a viable and credible Palestinian State and become a <span class="italic">cause de guerre</span> for the two parties’ most extremist and violent factions, which want to hinder progress towards peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I believe that the Commission should take measures to hasten progress, which has been incredibly slow, and to put an end to all the tortuous and bureaucratic procedures in order thereby to improve the quality of life of the Palestinians within the context of Mr Wolfensohn’s plans. As you will have seen, some progress has been made in Gaza but, in reality, little real progress has been made with any of the projects, whether those relating to the port, trade, the passage of goods or the free movement of people. </p>
<p class="contents">The Palestinian Authority is in a very difficult situation. At a time when we are, in some quarters, seeing the idea of a Greater Israel replaced with that of a Greater Jerusalem, the people who truly champion peace and who advocate a State with a single military power rather than illegal militias, which are incompatible with peace on the Palestinian side, have few arguments to put forward unless we make quicker progress towards improving the quality of life of the Palestinians and can in some way slow down the expansion of settlements on the ground.</p>

<p class="contents">The crisis in relations between Iran and the West, the continuing political instability in Iraq, the crisis in relations between Lebanon and Syria, which needs very careful handling and, of course, the situation in the area of Israel and Palestine are intensifying our concern and creating a rather disappointing climate.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis over recent days in relations between Iran and the West has taken its ugliest turn. The possibility of military intervention against Iran would be disastrous and must be prevented, because another war in the area would create a chain reaction for security and peace, and not only for the area of the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in occupied Iraq is still permanently destabilising. The recent disclosure by the former US Secretary of State Colin Powell, that the USA had made a mistake in its assessment and that Saddam did not have nuclear weapons, shows the real reasons for the military presence of the USA in the area. The conclusions are, I think, obvious.</p>
<p class="contents">The parliamentary elections due to take place in Palestine on 25 January, with which I shall be involved, will be carried out under the shadow of the pre-election period in Israel itself, where elections are to be held two months later, and will place Israel in a new, post-Sharon, era.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the Palestinian Authority is working ceaselessly so that free and democratic elections can be held and the democratic opinion of the Palestinian people can be demonstrated once again.</p>
<p class="contents">The Legislative Council and almost all the political parties in Palestine want Hamas to take part in the elections, so that it too can shoulder some of the responsibility for legislative work. This is expected to result in milder policies and, ultimately, disarmament.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the election process in East Jerusalem, it would appear that the matter has been arranged in the same way as agreed by the Palestinians in 1996. This too really is something to Israel's credit. Nonetheless, I have my doubts as to the extent to which the Israelis will consent to a democratic and fair pre-election strategy being held in East Jerusalem as well, given that, generally speaking, it is hard for elections to be held under occupation.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall mention just one incident which took place just yesterday: the Palestinian People's Party candidate for Jerusalem, Fadwa Khader, was arrested during a pre-election meeting by the Israeli occupying army and is now in jail for no reason.</p>
<p class="contents">Elections to the new Palestinian Legislative Council will constitute the prospects and, once again, the proof that the Palestinians can operate democratically. We, as the European Parliament and as the European Union, have already done a great deal, as the Commissioner said, but we need to continue to monitor developments in the area very carefully and, at the same time, to exert pressure in all directions for substantive talks which will lead before the end of 2006 to important progress and, very soon I hope, to a final solution to the problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In mid-November last year, I had the privilege of taking part, as a Member of this House, in a major international conference on democratisation in the Middle East, on which Mr McMillan-Scott has just spoken. The event was held in Arbil, the capital of the autonomous region of Kurdistan in Northern Iraq, where experts from Europe had the time, in absolute safety, to join with members of the Kurdish Government and Parliament in discussing, very frankly and openly, the prospects and problems associated with the development of democratic states under the rule of law right across that region. Iraq is thus fortunately much more than simply the rather depressing arena for incessant and appalling terror attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also in Iraqi Kurdistan that the European Union is being presented with an outstanding opportunity to make a substantial contribution to the urgent task of reconstructing Mesopotamia. I would very much like to hear from the Commissioner whether she shares with me this vision, and, if so, precisely what the Commission is already setting in motion in Northern Iraq, or what it is preparing to do there.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I can tell this House that our Kurdish counterparts in Iraq are looking to make contact with our Parliament. Will the Middle East become democratic?

I should like to assure the Commissioner that she has our full backing for any measures she takes with regard to Gaza. We are delighted that the issue of East Jerusalem was cleared up during the meeting held by the Israeli Government last Sunday. We are also delighted at the news that weapons have been banned on the day of the elections in Gaza and the West Bank. We are closely following the latest developments in connection with Hamas. We are aware that we must apply the same standards and the same criteria to Hamas as to the armed wing of Fatah. The Delegation for relations with Israel is prepared to welcome General Pistolesi to Parliament, and to offer him our full backing for his activities. We will also be very happy to support the Commissioner in any steps she takes to bring pressure to bear on the Israelis to meet their promise to safeguard the free movement of persons, goods and information and, of course, to lend their full support to the Rafah Agreement. We are also making preparations ahead of the forthcoming debate on a definitive solution to the issue of East Jerusalem and its borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I should like to remind the Commissioner that a delegation of Lebanese parliamentarians, two of whom were members of Hezbollah, visited our Parliament yesterday. They strongly urged the EU to help Lebanon, and the thrust of their message was, without a shadow of a doubt, ‘save us from Syria’. We all know, however, that the main problem in the Middle East today is neither Palestine nor Syria, but Iran. I should therefore briefly like to comment, if I may, on a number of precautionary steps that we might consider taking with regard to Iran. For example, we should think about banning Iran from participating in the football World Cup to be held in Germany. We should consider suspending technical assistance from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the present resumption of Iran’s nuclear programme. I would suggest to the Commissioner that we should think about banning Iran Air planes from landing in Europe, and about ways in which we could restrict the movement of high-ranking Iranian representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, Commissioner, I should like, if I may, to make a very personal comment, speaking as someone born in the former Czechoslovakia. As a graduate in Arabic studies, I have been greatly alarmed in recent months, weeks and days at Russia’s growing ambitions in the Middle East. I am not talking merely about Iran, but also about Syria, Yemen and Iraq. We now have a unique opportunity to enlist Russia as a partner, and to tell the Russians that if they are capable of reaching an agreement with the Iranians, then they should go ahead and prove it. We should take Russia seriously as a partner, and we should tell them that if they can back up their words with action, then they should do so. If not, then they should not interfere in the Middle East, since such interference is dangerous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I appreciated the relative optimism of your opening words, Commissioner, but I think that things which go without saying are better said and I would like to help strengthen the grounds for optimism. The media are taking the view that, in the present situation, the disappearance of Ariel Sharon presages disaster and that the outlook is quite frightening. Indeed, Sharon seemed to be the only person capable of seeing through the astonishing process of unilateral partition that he had devised as a preparatory stage to peace.</p>
<p class="contents">I really would like to stress that this is no time to panic. Contrary to the impression given by the media, great men do not make history on their own: institutions and situations have their part to play. On the Israeli side, there have for a very long time been two political obstacles to any prospects of peace.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that in the eyes of many Israelis and of Ariel Sharon, all processes of the Oslo, Taba or Geneva kind fail to take adequate account of the imperative of Israeli security. The second is that Israel’s largest right-wing group, Likud, has never, ever, in any way agreed to make the slightest concession whatsoever on its vision of Israel’s future, a vision of Biblical Israel, ‘<span class="italic">Eretz Israel’</span> or ‘Greater Israel’, on the pretext of exchanging land for peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Before he was taken ill, Ariel Sharon had removed both those obstacles. He had removed the first one by making visible and beginning to carry out a plan aimed at achieving peace gradually by partition. Many of us in this Parliament, Commissioner, do not like that plan. Too much violence, not enough talks, and a Palestinian state much reduced in size into the bargain. It is the only plan there is, however, and it has won over many Israelis, because it was the first to marry the absolute imperative of security with the prospect of peace.</p>
<p class="contents">The second obstacle was removed because Ariel Sharon had the extraordinary courage to break with Likud. Even if Sharon has gone, a large new party has been born representing a section of the Israeli right that is willing to move towards peace because its mind has been put at rest. Tomorrow, that party may be the dominant force in the Knesset and join with other forces from the centre and the left.</p>
<p class="contents">The party’s doctrine and that of its leader Ehud Olmert are not focussed on negotiation, but only on withdrawal from the occupied territories. We know that. Nevertheless, Commissioner, the partisan mechanics of the Knesset can only move in the direction of deepening the split with Likud and of rapprochement with the parties of Amir Peretz and Schlomo Ben-Ami: Sharon or no Sharon, the necessary break has been made and the inevitable will follow.</p>
<p class="contents">The Israelis sense this and are showing it in the polls. Not only must we not over-dramatise at this time, we must stand firmly behind this process, because even though the Palestinian community is strongly influenced by Hamas it will quite obviously follow. Peace, Commissioner, is today’s promised land and Moses, too, died before he could enter it.</p>

Jerusalem, which is also the Palestinians’ city, is part of the solution. Jerusalem is absolutely central. If Israel annexes the whole of Jerusalem, the key to peace will have been thrown away, and not only in that particular area but also in terms of relations between the Arab countries and the West. Bishop Michel Sabah’s words were in accordance with the conclusions of the European Council of 7 November 2005. Here was a clear statement that Jerusalem should be kept as an open city, and for the Palestinians too, and a request that Orient House be reopened.</p>
<p class="contents">This, however, is where the West’s double standards really come into their own. Israel is completely indifferent to the EU’s statements, for the Israelis know that none of the foreign ministers take their own words seriously. We even maintain Israel’s major economic privileges, despite the fact that they are expressly conditional on Israel’s observance of human rights, and the Council has just arranged for its own report on Jerusalem not to be published. At the same time, the EU is trying to buy its way out of anything to do with the Palestinians, for whom, in conjunction with Israel’s policy of apartheid, the EU and the United States are becoming entirely responsible. The fact is that Sharon wanted to call these walled-in enclaves a state, which would mean that Israel no longer had responsibility for the Palestinians under international law. Palestine would have no chance of creating a healthy economy on those conditions and would forever be dependent on others.</p>
<p class="contents">Matters will undoubtedly end badly unless miracles now take place in Israel and the people of peace and justice acquire power, not only in Palestine but also in Israel, or unless a miracle almost as remarkable occurs and the EU at long last begins to take its own words and international law seriously and makes use of the resources to which Europeans quietly have access. Nothing will happen as long as the Council and the Commissioner do not even mention the settlements and the Wall and do not say a word about a proper state. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The fact that the EU is also sending many millions of euros to the Middle East is also justified in this connection – including the EUR 1.5 million you mentioned for the Palestinian elections, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to ensure, however, that the results of such democratic elections are accepted by all sides, even if the election winners include political forces – such as Hamas – that we perhaps do not like so much. If the EU wants to be an honest broker in the Palestine conflict, it must speak out much more strongly in favour of the two-State solution. Persuading Israel to offer the Palestinian territories the necessary space for democratic and economic development will be an essential step in this direction. Only a genuine improvement in the Palestinians’ living conditions will make them turn away from political radicalism and terror.</p>
<p class="contents">If the EU is to be able to play such a valuable role as mediator in this very problematical geopolitical area, however, it must not become a front-line state or party to the conflict itself. That is why I would like to take this opportunity once again to warn against full accession for Turkey to the EU. That would put the European Union on the front line with Iran, Iraq, Syria and also, indirectly, with Palestine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Two elections will dominate the developments in the Middle East in the coming months. The Palestinian election is significant because it is expected to yield a pluralistic result. Hamas will participate in that election and is expected to do well. This is the time for the European Union, among others, to convince and encourage everybody on the Palestinian side that there is only one way: the politically and democratically chosen way, which is incompatible with armed struggle or with terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, the old and new guard of Fatah will find their distinct way of expressing themselves during the legislative elections. That is why the elections have to be free and fair: free from any restrictions on behalf of Israel and free from any manipulations from inside. The Palestinians must be able to campaign and vote freely in East Jerusalem. I hope that the international observers, including our own parliamentary mission, will be able to do their jobs freely, without hindrance and intimidation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Israeli elections are also very interesting because there is now a renewed hope generated by the decision of Ariel Sharon to leave Likud and form a new political movement, joined by others, including Shimon Peres. The opinion polls have been indicating that we may now have, at long last, a stable Israeli Government in a truly pluralistic – rather than a multi-fragmented – Knesset.</p>
<p class="contents">From the opinion polls it is obvious that Israeli public opinion is adhering to new ideas, giving hope to a pluralistic, realistic, secure, peaceful future, without the wooden positions of the past. Alas, the illness of Mr Sharon is of consternation for all of us, but let us trust Israeli society.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the Middle East, we cannot ignore, have to be vigilant and alert to any external interferences from factors such as Iran, Hezbollah and other interconnected factors. It is imperative that the assassins of Rafiq Hariri are finally brought to justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Progressive, moderate forces in Palestine need to block the way to all the forces feeding the blind violence and clashes, to say no to the forces denying the existence of the state of Israel. It is these extreme Palestinian forces that are materially undermining the very prospects of the creation of a Palestinian state.</p>
<p class="contents">All the political organisations have their place in the political system in Palestine. However, they have their place without weapons, without paramilitary approaches, without terrorist action. There needs to be – and I am calling today for – immediate intervention by the European Union and by you, Commissioner, for the release of the Palestinian parliamentary candidate in Jerusalem, Mrs Fadwa Khader, who was arrested and is now in jail. She needs and we call for her to be released immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to touch on two major issues which relate to peace in Palestine and the Middle East: you referred to one, Commissioner, which is the drastic economic and social situation of the Palestinian people living in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Your contribution is indeed important if this situation is to be rectified.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there cannot be peace with poverty, with despair and with the marginalisation of the Palestinian people. This poverty, this marginalisation is the best ally of the extreme paramilitary organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue relates to the unacceptable tactics which the Israeli authorities continue to apply to the occupied Palestinian territories, especially East Jerusalem. The illegal settlement is continuing, as are the de facto annexing of territory, the building of the wall and the compulsory purchase of Palestinian property.</p>
<p class="contents">On 7 November, the Council of Ministers took certain decisions on East Jerusalem. On 12 December, the question of East Jerusalem was discussed again. I believe that the European Union should take immediate measures to respond to these unacceptable Israeli tactics. We should not feed the radicalisation of extreme Palestinian organisations any more and Israel bears a great deal of responsibility here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I expect the elections next week will result in Hamas being elected and represented. Europe must decide how to deal with them. We cannot exclude them, and indeed the Israeli Government must be encouraged to accept the will of the Palestinian people in respect of who they select as their representatives, no matter how difficult that may be for them – and I quite understand that it will be difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to engage with Hamas after the elections on a conditional basis to encourage complete abandonment of violent means in pursuit of its political objectives. The Israeli Government must come to realise that missiles, demolitions, apartheid walls and assassinations will not guarantee or bring it sustainable peace. Political engagement with the enemy is necessary, otherwise there will be no peace. Most of all, Israel’s current government must realise that a sustainable peace is not possible without a sustainable Palestinian State.</p>
<p class="contents">A ‘Swiss cheese’ Palestinian State on the West Bank, with the Israelis controlling the cheese and the Palestinians controlling the holes, will not work and will not deliver peace to Israel in the long term. What has been absent up to now is a mutual respect for each other’s rights and for each other’s humanity. We must work to ensure that those two aspects of a political solution in the Middle East are developed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Benita Ferrero-Waldner, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, may I thank the honourable Members for a very broad and interesting debate. The Middle East is a subject on which one could speak for hours, but I shall take up the most important points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Mr McMillan-Scott raised the issue of funding a chamber for the Palestinian Council. We will have to await the outcome of the elections and see what government will be formed – I shall come back to the question of Hamas shortly. Then we will have to consult the Palestinians themselves to find out their demands and to see where we can support them. It will depend on that common vision whether we can support such a chamber. I do not rule it out completely, but it is really up to the Palestinians to ask for that.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, you also asked how we could help the democratisation process. I think our Neighbourhood Policy and the action plan would be the best basis for such further democratisation, for the rule of law, which is one of the major issues and one on which we insist very strongly.</p>
<p class="contents">For a year now we have had much better relations with the Israelis; on the one hand because Prime Minister Sharon kept his word on the withdrawal from Gaza – which was a step forward – and, on the other hand, because of the action plan, in which the Israelis are highly interested. I had a lengthy talk with Prime Minister Olmert on that subject. They are very interested in doing something.</p>
<p class="contents">On your third question, I would say that we are very preoccupied about the sentence on Mr Ayman Nour, the leader of the main opposition party in Egypt. The Commission was very supportive of a Troika statement issued by the European Union immediately after the sentence. We will follow up the case in the Council meeting of Foreign Ministers on 30 January and then in our current negotiations on the action plan with Egypt – negotiations which, it must be said, are not easy.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to Hamas, I know one of the crucial questions is what the government will look like after the elections. The polls show a possible share of the vote of between 30 and 40% for Hamas. Accordingly, I have very clearly stated that we will work with any government that will seek peace by peaceful means and will also respect the principles incorporated in our two major agreements. One is the interim association agreement. As I have already said, there is democracy, the rule of law, the basic principles that we all hold up. Secondly there is the action plan, in which there is a clear commitment to the roadmap.</p>
<p class="contents">President Abbas himself made it very clear that the acceptance of the Oslo Accords and the roadmap forms the basis for participation in the future government. I know that the Israeli Government is very clear and adamant about certain things it demands of a future Palestinian Government. We will of course work with both parties on these issues, because we know how sensitive and crucial they are in order to make progress on those issues on which we all agree: the free movement of people and goods for the Palestinians, where I have announced the possibility of going forward with the airport; where we are starting the procurement procedures in order to make it possible to get more access for people and goods. At the same time, it is also important to see how a government can be formed in Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with my Cypriot colleague, Mr Kasoulides, that an interesting situation is also arising on the Israeli side. With Prime Minister Sharon incapacitated at the moment, acting Prime Minister Olmet has taken over in a pragmatic, pro-European way – that is clearly what he stated – but in a way in which he can hold up the security question, which is the overriding question for every Prime Minister in Israel. Hopefully, things will go in the right direction. I do not want to interfere in any of these processes; we are still two months ahead of the Israeli elections. The important thing is that there is a leadership in the future that is able, capable and willing to go on with that.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with those who say that, as very clearly stated in the Quartet, we also have to speak out very clearly on the question of settlements, on the separation barrier. The Council’s report – it was a Council decision, by the way – has not been publicised, but it has already been covered in the press, so everybody knows what it contains.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the important thing for us will be to work very closely with both sides because, as many others have said, the Palestine-Israeli conflict greatly influences the stability of the whole region. The situation in Iraq and the upcoming difficult situation with Iran do not help to improve the stability of the region.</p>

Extremist factions must therefore understand that no nation may be wiped off the map. This was attempted in the past, even in Europe. Fortunately, such attempts proved unsuccessful, although they did lead to unspeakable suffering and to tragedy on an unprecedented scale. At this stage in the history of the Middle East, we should be focusing on the elections in Israel and the Palestinian Territories. Let us hope that the results of the elections will allow both peoples to move closer to a peaceful solution. The European Union should now concentrate on the political context. The Neighbourhood Policy, infrastructure, education, and social issues are certainly important, but the key to a permanent solution lies in politics. Unless the political situation is resolved there will be no progress along the road to peace in the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
