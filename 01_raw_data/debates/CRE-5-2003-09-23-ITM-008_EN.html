<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andersson (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, we are concerned here with the Commission’s Communication on Adequate and Sustainable Pensions and with an analysis of whether, in their first Strategy Reports, the Member States have complied with the three overarching aims of the common pensions policy. The first of these is whether pensions are adequate and whether we have set future pensions at a level sufficient to prevent poverty and provide a reasonable standard of living. The second is whether pensions are economically sustainable in the long term so that future generations do not have an unnecessarily large economic burden placed upon them. The third is whether pensions are sufficiently up-to-date to cope with the new situation, characterised by atypical jobs and more and more women in the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that the Commission’s communication is sound. The Commission has carried out a sound analysis. In Parliament, we have tried to distance ourselves from the national debates on various national changes to the pensions systems. We have tried to stick to our task at EU level, namely that of setting up objectives for the common strategy we are to have at EU level. The Member States must themselves deal with the purely practical proposals for the pensions systems.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a number of viewpoints. First of all, there must be a balance between social and economic considerations. It is important for economic development that we have sustainable pensions systems. That applies especially to those countries that are involved in cooperation in connection with the euro, but also to other countries, so that we obtain sustainable economic development. It is at least as important, however, for us to address the social aspects that affect people’s living standards. We must ensure that people have a comfortable standard of living in later years, not hugely different from that they enjoyed when gainfully employed, and that they do not end up in poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Pensions systems still reveal a lack of equality. Women’s pensions are not as large as men’s. In some cases, that has to do with the pensions systems, but the main reason is women’s position in the labour market. Women have, to a larger extent, lower paid jobs, part-time work and a lower level of employment. That means that the Lisbon process is the most important thing in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation for those who have atypical jobs is not satisfactory either, especially when it comes to the supplementary pensions on which the two sides of industry are agreeing. There is good reason to address these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The absolutely most important thing if we are to meet our commitments in the future is that we obtain growth and full employment. It is therefore important for us to link these aims to the Lisbon process and to the employment and economic guidelines and for us to take a global view. We very often talk about solidarity between our generations here and now, and it is important that there be solidarity right now between the generations. In view of demographic development, it is, however, at least as important that we talk about solidarity with future generations so that we ourselves – and I personally belong to the generation born in the forties – do not indulge ourselves too much now with the result that future generations of earners have to contend with unreasonably high costs when we become pensioners. We must ensure that that will not be the case with the new pensions systems. We must show solidarity with future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">What caused most discussion in the committee was the actual and/or statutory pensionable age. We are not interfering with the statutory pensionable age. It is paradoxical that the elder portion of the population is becoming healthier and healthier – which is a good thing – at the same time as it is working less and less. We are today working less than we did thirty years ago. There are many reasons for this. If something is missing from the Commission’s communication, it is perhaps an overall picture of how the actual pensionable age is to be increased. We are concerned here with financial incentives, but we are also concerned with matters such as lifelong learning, the organisation of work and problems involving the working environment, so that older people can also remain in the labour market. We must change working life in such a way that people can remain actively in work and not be excluded from it.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall then also address the subject of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to thank all those who have helped us obtain a broad, if not complete, consensus in the committee. We have enjoyed sound cooperation in the committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report on adequate and sustainable pensions touches on one of the most burning issues in the hands of all the governments.</p>
<p class="contents">Reforms in each country are, of course, a national responsibility, but I would say that we are turning a blind eye if we fail to look at the European dimension and the need for cooperation, not only because there is a very close economic dependency between the economies of the Member States, but also because our analysis has resulted in convincing conclusions that the causes of the crisis in the pension systems are precisely the same in all the countries. They are demographics, longer life expectancy, the new working models and the new family models.</p>
<p class="contents">Using the open method of cooperation was the first important attempt made at European level for the countries to cooperate with each other. We agreed on three lines of approach. The first concerned the economic viability of the pension systems. The second concerned adequate pensions, meaning a dignified standard of living for pensioners, which is something Mr Andersson insists on in his report. And the third is the adaptability of the pension systems, so that they take account of changes.</p>
<p class="contents">The reference in the report to the link between pension systems and the labour market is important, and I shall explain how the Commission is meeting the demands made in the report with a series of initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the question of increasing the actual retirement age. It is clear, on the one hand, that it is important and necessary to change the age limit, for reasons of sustainability and, on the other hand, that this cannot be done on its own, without flanking employment policies which will help elderly workers to remain in the labour market, because today, due to the culture which exists in the labour market, the reality which has existed for many years, it is very difficult for elderly workers over 55 years of age to find work easily. Within this framework, both the European strategy on employment and the European Social Fund are being called on to play an important role.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important issue is that the Commission, on the orders of the European Council, is continuing to apply the coordination method. In 2005, we shall move to a new report on the monitoring of the systems, while the Social Protection Committee will examine the contribution of social systems to the extension of working life.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are constantly monitoring the indicators to which we committed in Barcelona and we have agreed on the need to increase the actual retirement age by five years by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">To come back to what Mr Andersson said about the gender dimension. The gender dimension is most important in pension systems, especially in the private sector. I should like to remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that in the private sector there is no equal treatment of men and women, while account is mainly taken of the gender criterion when calculating pensions.</p>
<p class="contents">Two more points: the issue of enlargement, on which we have constant communication with the Member States, so that they can also integrate the issue of mobility. The report refers in detail to how we can overcome the obstacles which exist in the labour market in Europe and with mobility, which is an issue for which we have drawn up a ten-year action plan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commissioner has stated that the pension schemes are in crisis, and I share her view. The costs of pensions will put pressure on the Stability Pact and, in a previous term of office, I occasionally referred to this as ‘a bomb under the EURO’. Many countries are taking measures for that reason, and because of many of these measures, women are hit harder than other groups in the population. As a result of a lower participation rate in the labour force, a higher percentage of women working part-time, the lower incomes and the slower rise in income (due, among other things, to maternity leave), many women receive lower pensions than men, on average. According to the report by the Commission, this difference varies from approximately 16 to 45% depending on the Member State in question.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the issue of equal treatment. In this context, I should like to make a reference to America. There is a judgment by the Supreme Court that stipulates that calculating contributions towards, and payments of, supplementary pensions differently on the basis of gender-based actuarial factors is in contravention of the Civil Rights Act. Hopefully, this view will be generally held in Europe too. The fact that, according to a recent hearing, it transpired that women no longer live all that much longer than men at all, should be added to this.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to draw your attention to a regrettable fact, namely that the Commission has never implemented Parliament’s proposals to force Member States to make arrangements to deal with the problem that parts of the pension rights accrued during marriage are at risk of being lost in periods when one of the partners decides to care for the other. I should also like to urge Member States to ensure that people continue to remain part of pension accrual schemes during maternity leave or care leave for children or other dependants. This is already the case in a number of countries, and I think that those countries set a good example for other Member States that have not done this to date. Member States should promote the individualisation of pension rights, without abolishing the derived rights of the surviving spouse and children. As I have stated before, it is an all-embracing problem, in fact, whereby, often, women are at greater risk of losing out than others. I therefore agree that we should promote labour mobility and in the light of this, I should like …</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you, Mr President, I notice that my three minutes are up.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I hope that the Commissioner will particularly take the position of women into consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that the same thing will happen in tomorrow’s vote.</p>
<p class="contents">I am equally pleased to pay tribute to Commissioner Diamantopoulou for having endeavoured thus far and for continuing to make every effort to ensure that the reforms which the 15 Member States are attempting to carry out do not bring extreme poverty for the elderly, who are already too poor and, in many of these States, whose only source of income is their pension.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I would like to advocate a different course of action to fulfil the commendable desire to provide secure, funded pensions in the future. It is absolutely vital that we stop the wastage taking place in the different pension systems of the States of Europe. It is absolutely vital that we reduce the cost of labour, which is so great in many of our States as to make it difficult for European States to compete on the world market economy. In Italy, for example, each worker carries pension costs of 34%, in Switzerland, contributions of just 10% lead to pensions which are just as respectable as Italian pensions, and, in Portugal, for example, the figure is 7.6%. This means that we must investigate where it is that the money is being wasted, where the inefficiency lies and where changes need to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I would like to say that there are two ways of paying debts: there are debtors who, when they have to pay the debt which has fallen due, do not show up and run away; then there are others who do without a summer holiday and give up their car in order to pay their debts. The debtors are our 15 States and the creditors are people – pensioners and elderly people – who live off their pensions. We must not bury our heads in the sand but endeavour to pay off the debts we have incurred with the elderly people of today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This excellent report by Mr Andersson is the culmination of a legislature of the European Parliament during which we have brought our agenda into line with the agenda of the citizens. This is an important legislature because the European Parliament, also following excellent communications and excellent initiatives from the Commission, has introduced the issue of pensions into the Community agenda for the first time.</p>
<p class="contents">We are extremely happy that at the end of this legislature progress has been made on a philosophy which has radically increased the appreciation of this phenomenon. It is no longer just a concern inspired by financial considerations or the balance of public finances. We now have a doctrine, a strategy, which together with this important issue, we have enriched and supplemented with the objectives and needs of the European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore pleased that this report and the Commission's Communication have analysed the strategies of the Member States, taking account of financial viability of course! Perhaps in this way we are also demonstrating that we are responsible politicians. There are basically two categories of politician: there are irresponsible politicians, who only think about the next elections, and there are responsible politicians who think about the next generations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Andersson report is thinking about the next generations, but is also thinking about bringing things up to date so that social security, pensions, fulfil our objectives and combat poverty. It also thinks about modernisation and categories of workers, particularly women, who face such risks in the new social order and the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">What does the Commission tell us about the situation of our Member States? We can see that there is a will, but we can also see that there is sometimes apathy and a lot of prudence; and I would also add that there is fear of reform in the Member States, perhaps because the population is afraid that reform may in fact be an excuse to talk about cuts in their social rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore very important that we help to overcome these fears amongst the population by presenting reforms which are not just cuts, but which are aimed at satisfying their current and future needs within a more secure, fair and equitable framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, the Socialist Group will support the Andersson report and the work of the Commission because we believe that in fact the changes proposed are not frivolous, or opportunistic, but that they respond to our social commitment to this generation of workers, to these citizens, and also to those who will live in Europe in the next generation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How countries organise their pensions systems falls within the sphere of national competences, but I think that the report, with its objectives of adequate, sustainable pensions and flexible pensions systems may provide inspiration and give rise to sensible debates at national level. I also think that an interesting conclusion has been reached, namely that, in general, there is a high degree of redistribution and solidarity in the Member States’ pensions systems, but that women are disadvantaged in many countries because of their special position in the labour market. Something needs to be done about this, and I am pleased about the strong emphasis placed here upon the need to press for something to be done about the matter. I therefore very much agree with the overall conclusion of Mr Andersson’s report. On the other hand, I disagree with a number of the amendments before us from the left side of the House where the investment of pensions savings in shares and bonds is clearly seen as an evil in itself. It is true that there have been problems with pension funds, which have suffered large losses in connection with the large falls in share prices, but I do not think that the answer is to stop introducing savings schemes for pensions. On the contrary, I think that better control of the risk in connection with pension funds’ investments must be ensured and that there must be stronger supervision on the part of the authorities. That is also something we can cooperate on at EU level in order to guarantee better risk management. We are all, of course, getting older, and it is not too much to ask that each of us take joint responsibility for saving up for old age and help ensure that future generations do not have unreasonable burdens placed upon them, for it is also a question of distribution between the generations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With this in mind he recommends a sufficient level of minimum guarantee pensions and increasing the employment level among women in a bid to promote equal opportunities. I and my group agree with these parts of the report. Mr Andersson even indicates that he is anxious to ensure that a balance is struck between social and financial concerns. Unfortunately, this undertaking is contradictory and causes the rapporteur to call into question fundamental social principles in the name of financial criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed the vote in the committee was not unanimous. We did not vote in favour of this report in the parliamentary committee because it supports the Commission's proposal to raise the retirement age. In so doing, it aligns itself with the liberal approach, manifest at many European Councils in the past, which advocates greater flexibility and increased working time. We are opposed to this kind of reform, which imposes increased working time and yet does nothing to resolve the employment issue. The report claims that the Member States have taken measures that are heading in the right direction, which is to say towards increased working time. Given that a majority of workers in France, Austria and Germany have demonstrated that they reject a move towards increased working time and funded pension provision, do we wish to settle the European debate on pensions without public involvement?</p>
<p class="contents">With my group's support, we are tabling amendments that seek to reflect these aspirations. In them, we of course oppose raising the statutory retirement age and extending the contributions period. We are also opposed to funded pension provision, which provides no guarantee of an income and undermines the principle of solidarity inherent in pay-as-you-go schemes. We propose that contributions be calculated taking into account how hard the work is and the number of dependent children. Finally, we propose studying new ways of financing legal pension schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">The argument of increased life expectancy is used to broach the issue of funded pension schemes; this does little to mask the financial appetites of multinationals in favour of this option. There are other ways to resolve the issue of financing in the long term that are more viable and characterised by greater solidarity. We propose, for example, extending social security contributions to all revenue, with the amount adjusted depending on whether the companies are creating jobs or not. These proposals do not appear to me to be entirely irresponsible.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would say that faced with mounting criticism of the choices made in this field by Europe's Heads of State or Government, what matters now is to listen to the demands that people are making and not to go against them, unless we wish to see the people of Europe grow even more disaffected with the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the fact that we are gradually applying the open coordination method to pensions. It is not so much a debate as a beginning. I do not know what we should do in the long term with regard to the accessibility, financability and modernisation of pensions. The proposal offers, among other things, a number of guidelines. In my view, the benefit of the Commission proposal is that it gives a good insight into what is going on and that it contains a first set of measures. However, as I have already stated, they are long-term measures. Mr Cercas may well make a comment with regard to the next generation, but that is precisely the problem that we will be facing. In the short term, we are having to deal with a labour market that is silting up in many parts of Europe and the solution of getting people to work for longer is not effective in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Ainardi has already pointed out that there are a number of problems in a number of Member States, including France and Austria. In the Netherlands, 20 000 people have taken to the streets in protest against the largely Liberal Christian-Democratic government that has thought out all kinds of measures to encourage the participation of the elderly in the labour market in the long term. For example, by cutting back on early retirement, the early retirement scheme (VUT), extended unemployment benefit (WW), general unemployment benefit and similar schemes. In this connection, it has, by the way, left no scope for circumventing these measures. This means that people are currently protesting against a government in the Netherlands that is intent on taking measures of this kind. As I stated before, 20 000 demonstrators have taken to the streets in protest.</p>
<p class="contents">Short-term policy is the missing link and, in that sense, the report by Jan Andersson is, in fact, a shallow report for problems of this type. I am stating the facts as they are. The report is not a disaster. It is a first step. In the coming period, however, something should be added. And this will bring with it all kinds of problems. I agree on increasing the effective pensionable age, but, at the moment, we should just see how things pan out, and alternatives will therefore need to be developed to ensure that short-term and long-term policy are balanced out more effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In one sense, we tend to forget what it was like at the end of the 19th century when the elderly, the sick or the unemployed had no protection whatsoever until a miserly amount of money was introduced in the late 1870s to try to give some protection to older people. Fortunately we, as a society, have developed in our attitude towards giving future protection to the elderly, those in need of pensions and the most vulnerable within our society.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing that we have all recognised in the past is that we have not made proper provision for the future needs of changing demographics, a reducing workforce in certain cases and limits in taxation expenditure. We are now faced with what appears to be a sudden problem on account of the large population. But if you ask an anthropologist or anyone involved in any of the sciences, this was highlighted 15 years ago as an issue to be dealt with by 2015. It is only now that we are beginning to take action on it.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I would point out that Mr Andersson has put forward a balanced proposal in his report. He has looked at creating solutions to the problems that we now face. In fairness to him - and I do not agree with everything that he says on most occasions - he has also brought forward short-term, medium-term and long-term priorities that must be carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">In Ireland we have a system whereby we are now putting 1% of GDP towards our future pension requirements every single year. It gives a guarantee to those people who will need pensions in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">One area we must look at is ensuring that the pension is set at a proper, reasonable standard of living to allow people to have independence and freedom of choice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is why I should also like to extend a warm thank you to Mr Fatuzzo for his contribution. In my view, it is a little bit of a mixture of the best that the Italian and Swedish cultures have to offer. Milan meets Malmö, if you like. As far as I am concerned, this work should be kept more or less unchanged. It is extremely regrettable that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left should have tabled these amendments. I have to say, I have listened with great interest to Mrs Ainardi, who reminded me of Louis XVIII who returned after the revolution and of whom people said that he had learned nothing and forgotten everything. I find it even more deplorable that Mr Bouwman appears keen to associate himself with this statement.</p>
<p class="contents">We are facing real problems in Europe in the area of pensions. Naturally, we could maintain the pension system, but the best way of eventually destroying it is to do what has been proposed in the amendments by the GUE/NGL Group: to act as if nothing is wrong, while the system does show up inadequacies. After all, when this system was agreed upon, the average lifespan was 63 years, two years under 65. Fortunately, the average lifespan is quite a bit longer now. In the light of this, it is unacceptable for us to say that we could carry on as we are for ever. Mr Andersson is pointing in a certain direction, and this direction receives our support. Pension schemes are slightly different in every country and cannot be compared, but the worst thing is that some people are behaving as some did on the Titanic who, when the ship was sinking, thought that nothing was wrong. This is dangerous. I hope that the majority of this Parliament – and I have every faith in them – want to distance themselves from attitudes of this kind and want to commit themselves to the people who really matter. After all, poor people will not gain in any way if there is no money left in the end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank the Commission and the Council for their joint report. It really does provide an excellent overview of this very important subject. I hope that you, Mr President, can pass on a request to DG I that maybe one of these days they could organise a daytime debate for an important social dossier such as this one. We are supposed to be building bridges back to the citizens. This is a subject that matters to many millions of citizens. It is a shame that it is tucked away in a night sitting once again.</p>
<p class="contents">The Andersson report really underlines the need for both the employment strategy and the Lisbon strategy to begin to deliver in several important respects: continuing gross gender inequality in terms of access to and participation in the labour market is reflected in gross gender inequality in pension entitlement. Even if we achieve the Lisbon target of 60% for labour market participation by women, the target itself acknowledges the fact that women's participation will continue to be less than men's. We therefore need to consider flanking measures along the lines suggested in the report by, for example, promoting the individualisation of pension rights and urging Member States to guarantee continuity of membership of pension schemes during parental leave or leave to take care of children or other dependants.</p>
<p class="contents">A second problem highlighted by Mr Andersson, and one that we really have to redouble our efforts to tackle, is the need to raise the effective retirement age, not the statutory retirement age. There is some confusion in certain quarters on that. There is now a widespread early retirement culture within the Union. Sustained long-term efforts will be needed to change attitudes and tackle that culture. But there are few signs that we are even beginning to make a start in doing that. The joint employment report from the Commission for 2002 reported that only four Member States have put in place fully-fledged national active ageing strategies. The same report showed that the efforts of most Member States to provide education and training to older age groups are still woefully inadequate. The Commission must, in its next round of recommendations examining the achievements of Member States against the set guidelines, make the strongest possible recommendations against Member States who continue to fail to deliver in these and other important respects.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point of the report I should like to emphasise concerns atypical workers. Their insecurity in the labour market - and many of them are women - will be reflected again in continuing insecurity in their later years, in the decades ahead, unless something is done to lessen that insecurity. It is a terrible shame that several Member State governments - my own included - have set their hearts and minds against the proposed directive on temporary employment agency workers. The longer it is delayed the more the earlier directives on part-time and fixed-term working will be undermined, as temporary agency working becomes the favoured choice for employers for whom the word 'flexibility' means squeezing the maximum out of labour for the least possible reward. Temporary agency working would become an ever-growing bottom tier in a two-tier labour force. In the end the whole of European society would face the consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope even at this late stage that the governments concerned - including my own - might see sense and help us put in place a sensible piece of legislation to reinforce the point that flexibility can actually be a positive concept for both employers and workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Without pensions, benefits and other forms of social assistance, poverty levels in the European Union would exceed 40%. Any modernisation of state social security systems must, therefore, take this fact into account. This has not happened in most Member States introducing such reforms. The stubborn resistance of workers to measures threatening their fundamental rights in this regard is well-known. The cases of France, Portugal, Germany and Greece have already been mentioned here.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report, however, not enough is done to avoid these positions, which lead to the impairment of rights and welfare cover. Hence the set of proposals we have tabled, of which I would like to highlight the following:</p>
<p class="contents">- a reference to the growing difficulties faced by pension funds in the wake of the worldwide stock market slump, which provides ample proof that the growing risks of the financial market have an adverse effect on the adequacy and sustainability of funded pension provision;</p>
<p class="contents">- a critique of the antisocial nature of most reforms recently implemented by certain Member States, which have reduced state pensions considerably and attempted to raise the retirement age;</p>
<p class="contents">- a note on the importance of adopting strategies for reforming pension schemes at European and national levels, promoting full employment along with social rights which strengthen and reinvigorate state pension schemes by broadening their financial bases, by ensuring that employers comply with their financial obligations, and by enhancing pay-as-you-go mechanisms;</p>
<p class="contents">- lastly, a rejection of all attempts aiming to weaken or replace state schemes based on the principles of pay-as-you-go and solidarity, pointing out that, in order to guarantee pension schemes in the long term, it is vital to broaden the scope of their eligibility criteria and investigate new ways of financing statutory pension schemes, in particular by extending welfare contributions to all financial returns and establishing modulation for companies on the basis of the number of jobs created. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I particularly commend the rapporteur on the way he has worked hard to absorb amendments from colleagues from different parties, who also care strongly about this issue. Indeed I am grateful that he has seen fit to accept five of mine: on defining the objective; to provide adequate and fair incomes to older people and prevent poverty in old age; on defining the gravity of the problem; on the importance of promoting pension portability; and, in particular, on the disgrace that certain EU institutions continue to discriminate against allowing older workers to apply for jobs - a point I have raised on several occasions with Commissioner Kinnock with, I regret to say, only bluster in response.</p>
<p class="contents">Because the rapporteur has accepted so much it would probably be churlish of me to lament his non-acceptance of my amendment declaring that secure, inflation-proof pensions for public sector workers, such as Members of this Parliament, are seen as increasingly unfair by those in company schemes that depend on stock market performance in the real world. I believe we should show that we recognise this. It is, after all, the reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, his report recognises much that is a problem. It also seeks to focus attention on what needs to be done. In the next 50 years the number of over-65s will double from 25% to perhaps 50% of the population. In rural areas, including large parts of my own constituency of the West Midlands, the percentage could be higher still.</p>
<p class="contents">His report deserves support from across this House. He certainly has mine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly there is a need for both. It seems to me that one of the key issues here, at least in relation to poverty in old age, relates to women. All the statistics show that because of intermittent work, breaks in their employment record, family care commitments etc. they by and large end up in a poorer situation than men. Add to that the fact that they also survive longer than men, and the result is greater numbers of older women than men after a certain age.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need for us to address the question of funding of pensions. As Mr Crowley has mentioned, in Ireland we have introduced a reserve fund where 1% of GDP is set aside each year, and there are some billions in this fund now; in fact there is so much money in it that people are beginning to fight over how and where it should be invested. Nevertheless it is an attempt to ensure that there is a fund there for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We are fortunate in that we have a demographic lag of about 20 to 25 years, so that the bulge that is hitting the rest of Europe at the moment will not hit Ireland for some time yet. Nevertheless we expect it will arrive.</p>
<p class="contents">Another attempt to deal with this issue is the introduction of personal retirement savings accounts, where individuals, with the assistance of their employer, can open an account and put money in it which will provide some pension funding for them at a certain point. The difficulty is that the financial institutions which are given responsibility for selling these products are in many cases resisting them because they cannot make enough money out of the categories of people that they are aimed at, mainly the lower income section of the workforce. There is a need to address that issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The point I am making here is that there is no need for us to be unduly pessimistic providing we make the policy choices now about what we are going to face in the future. It is not enough for us to wring our hands, it is not enough for Member States, as Mr Hughes has pointed out, to oppose the temporary agency workers directive – which provides some degree of security for certain categories of workers – and then pretend that they are going to do something serious about pensions, when in fact they are undermining the possibility for many thousands of people to have sufficient contributions, even for a State pension.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, there really is a need for some joined-up thinking in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Savings systems, which are dependent in one way or another upon the capital markets, constitute a much more unstable project.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country of Sweden, which has been singled out as a model in certain quarters, we have moved in the direction of a capitalisation of pensions arrangements and of greater dependency upon the capital markets. With the victory for the ‘no’ side in the Swedish referendum on the euro, we have obtained slightly greater freedom when it comes both to economic and to pensions policy. I believe it was precisely that which the Swedish ‘no’ voters wanted: greater freedom of action, and solidarity as a feature of development in Sweden. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to begin by saying that retirement, while still being a technical/legal and economic/actuarial issue, has become an issue of the greatest media interest and has won the status as a central issue within policy in general, and within social policy in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Back in 1950, the age of sixty was regarded as the threshold of old age; the age of 65 implied retirement from active working life, and not to have a will drawn up by the age of seventy would unquestionably have been considered recklessly irresponsible. We can conclude from this that the population of our current society, which has doubled by the end of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first, includes many people of a very advanced age, who until recently were classified as ‘old people’, and those older people have a strong social image, they are real, they have active lives and have good reason to hope to continue living.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this context, a long-term perspective is necessary in the field of pensions and, despite the fact that dealing with pensions and pension policy are essentially the responsibility of the Member States, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the European contribution appears to be necessary, both in the exchange of best practices and in increasing consensus, and in the common regulation of certain aspects necessary in order to ensure the possibility of transferring pension rights of all types and their viability.</p>
<p class="contents">Pension systems through public schemes linked to income – first pillar – through private professional schemes – second pillar – and individual retirement pension funds – third pillar – must offer Europeans the opportunities to maintain their standard of living following retirement.</p>
<p class="contents">A system which prevents or hinders the free movement of people must therefore be excluded, as must the European citizens’ fear of ageing or physical or psychological deterioration. In the face of the weight of the third pillar, fear must be alleviated and business interests excluded. The viability of the pension system must be guaranteed, and it must respond to changes in society and in the ways in which production is organised: the greater presence of women, an older active population and atypical forms of contract. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In seeking to increase the effective retirement age, in wishing to extend time at work, in proposing even to replace pay-as-you-go pension schemes with funded pension provision, the rapporteur vindicates and harmonises the attacks on workers. The rapporteur is cynical enough to observe that the increase in the number of pensioners and their increased life expectancy will put considerable pressure on pay-as-you-go pension schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">Should we therefore wish for lower life expectancy and for a fall in the number of pensioners so as to save money? If the fruits of productivity were distributed differently, with a little less being given to employers and the wealthiest members of society so as to enable workers who have spent their lives making them rich to grow old with dignity, there would be no problem in providing an increasing number of pensioners with a proper pension. However, your economy does not serve to satisfy the needs of a majority as best possible, but to make a minority rich more effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is good that Parliament is taking an active part in the pensions debate, because pensions and how we pay for them will be one of the biggest social and economic challenges of the decades to come.</p>
<p class="contents">Old age these days no longer means poverty, because statutory public pension schemes and the private occupational pension schemes and private insurance policies that supplement them are a guarantee to many Europeans that they can maintain their standard of living even after retirement. The generation gap must nevertheless be narrowed by means of vigorous pension scheme reforms, so that increased pensions do not become a burden on the shoulders of younger generations.</p>
<p class="contents">Four factors will jeopardise state pension schemes if no reforms are made. These are the ever-increasing life expectancy rate combined with low birth rates, substantial long-term unemployment and people entering employment late in life. The baby-boom generation is beginning to retire in this decade and by 2050 the number of those in receipt of a pension in relation to those of working age will have doubled. In some Member States pension schemes paid for out of public funds are estimated to rise to one fifth of GNP.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, European pension schemes have, in the main, achieved their social goals. To strengthen pension provision, however, the priorities are that the age of retirement must be raised, the range of supplementary forms of finance must be increased, and there has to be an increase in long-term private savings. At Community level we need coordination in the taxation of occupational pensions to make it easier for people to move from one country to another and comprehensive internal market legislation for institutions offering occupational retirement provision. At European Union level we can play a part in defusing the pensions bomb by promoting the development of cross-border personal pensions and savings schemes. I hope that Parliament will, on the strength of this excellent report by Mr Andersson, also play an active role regarding these matters in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the pretext of the ageing population, it is promoting an increase in the retirement age, an extension of working life, cutbacks in pensions, the dissociation of pensions and wages and increased financial contributions by workers. At the same time, the European Union and the Member States, with the recent reforms, are using pensions to support the profitability of big business. They are reducing employer benefits and offering them the resources and reserves of the pension funds, promoting the spread of professional pension funds and forcing workers to rely on private insurance schemes, thereby exposing their pensions to the risks inherent in the financial markets.</p>
<p class="contents">We support a different policy, where pensions will respond to modern social needs. We and the workers are calling for a reduction in the retirement age and working life, for pension funds to be financed from the national budget and for an increase in employers' contributions, coupled with a reduction in employees' contributions. This sort of social insurance system can only be imposed by the workers, by fighting against the choices of big business and the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
