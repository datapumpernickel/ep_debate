<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gröner (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, we have indeed got through the agenda rather faster than usual, but youth has, I think, caught up with us. Our future lies in young people and one can see how much a society values them by how many possibilities it offers them and how closely it involves them in plans for the future. A dynamic society must offer its new generation prospects and security, both in terms of material things and social acceptance and in terms of a sense of cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad to see that the Commissioner, too, took a different estimate of the time. The White Paper on a New Impetus for European Youth saw the light of day in November 2001 after much consultation with all concerned and two long years in which to mature; we do now need to think about how we can keep it alive. I think that the Commission, the Council and Parliament are all on the right path here. We need to integrate the 75 million young people between 15 and 25 in a European Union that will soon include 25 Member States, by bringing young people and youth organisations into the political arena. As rapporteur for the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and through my work in connection with this White Paper, I have followed the discussions that have taken place over the last couple of years and listened closely to what young Europeans have had to tell us. My conclusion is that young people want to be taken seriously, and we should not disappoint them by failing to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">We have succeeded in boosting youth policy among young people, youth organisations, non-governmental organisations, political representatives in the EU and the Member States. If we see the White Paper as being about open coordination and mainstreaming, then the Commission’s communication on the follow-up is more about participation and information. Young people must be integrated more, and at an earlier stage, so that they can participate in representative democracy at the regional, national and European level.</p>
<p class="contents">We particularly need to show our interest in integrating young people now as we approach the European elections, but unfortunately we are discussing this important matter at a late hour in a House that is almost empty. Young people communicate on the Internet and the Commission has therefore opened a youth portal but this falls far short of what is needed, which is information that is local and has been specifically developed for them. They need to experience equal opportunities and non-discrimination, for example in youth councils made up of equal numbers of young men and young women. Where no such councils exist, we need to set them up. Formal and informal education have to be networked with youth work to a greater degree. Youth programmes are already allowing hundreds of thousands of young people to meet and these, together with the thousands of voluntary work projects, lead towards social skills and a European outlook. If we want to make Europe the most competitive, knowledge-based economic area in the world, we must make every effort to ensure that no young people are excluded. Those who are considered to be disadvantaged – female immigrants, girls, and young men – and on the fringes of the European Union and of society, are the ones whom we most need to integrate.</p>
<p class="contents">Regional cooperation, culture and sport all serve as a bridge to help overcome prejudices and solve the problems of tomorrow. In November 2003, the Council stipulated some common objectives. The first evaluation of the new action lines’ implementation will be carried out at the end of 2005 and the Commission will then draw up a progress report on the basis of the reports submitted by Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The first European Youth Week took place last year and was widely supported. Under the motto ‘overcoming exclusion’ we are now starting to work on the ‘Youth’ action programme and in other new areas and are trying to ensure that they are equipped with sufficient financial resources both to meet the growing demands of globalisation and to create spaces in which young people can concern themselves with future European policy. With the broad synergy that we have achieved between the Commission, Parliament, the political groups and even Member States, we should succeed not only in speaking to young people but also in integrating them. It is our goal to keep the momentum going, to support young people and strengthen youth policy in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That committee was right to adopt the report unanimously, because it is an excellent piece of work. It is the work of someone who knows young people, who likes young people, and who would like young people to be much more involved than they are at present in this Europe which we are in the process of constructing.</p>
<p class="contents">We laid the foundations for this Europe, which we are in the process of constructing for and with young people, with the famous White Paper, which proposed common objectives for two priority areas, namely the participation and information of young people. Moreover, it was young people themselves who identified these two priority areas as the key elements in any future policy to be pursued both at European Union level and at Member State and regional level. I welcome Parliament’s support for the proposals aimed at ensuring that the participation of young people at all levels of democratic life and at developing accessible, appropriate quality information become a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">These proposals, as Mrs Gröner has said, form part of a broader approach which is aimed at developing projects which are specific to youth policies and at the same time improving the extent to which the interests of young people are taken into account in the context of other policies. With this in mind, we are preparing proposals for action lines concerning voluntary activities which, as you have quite rightly said, are one of the preferred ways in which young people can become involved and assume their responsibilities as citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I believe that the creation of a real European voluntary service, with a critical mass and therefore with visibility, will give new impetus to our youth policies. In order to get there, however, we will also need new funding, because young people are not rich. We have to help them to put their idealism into practice. In this sense, the new financial perspectives are the ideal framework in which to find an answer to our questions. Moreover, I have also suggested guidelines for a future ‘youth’ programme funded in such a way as to ensure that it can reach the critical size. This political communication which I am currently preparing is due to be submitted to the European Parliament before the elections, if all goes according to plan.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Mr President, that the parliamentary initiatives which have been launched for and with young people provide an excellent response to what we frequently hear at grass-roots level, where the refrain is constantly repeated that Europe does not pay enough attention to youth policy. Well, I would like to see lots of young people, and lots of those who are responsible for policies with young people as their main theme, read the own-initiative report by Mrs Gröner and the European Parliament, so that they can see for themselves that that is not true. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that participation and information for young people is an issue of the utmost importance and I have always said, since I joined this Parliament, that it is the young who are important, not those of us who are not so young, because they are the future of Europe and it is in them that we must invest and apply all our efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a lot of contact with young people and I truly believe that they are much more receptive than adults or the elderly. We must take advantage of this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the new poll by the Eurobarometer for the coming European Parliament elections, an average of just 30% of the population is expected to vote. This seems to me a ridiculously low figure and we must make a great effort to increase it. It is not enough for all of us to sit here saying how very worried we are; we must really prove this through action. It is furthermore clear that we are doing something wrong. I will tell you an anecdote, ladies and gentlemen, concerning a situation in which I was involved right here this very afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">You are all perfectly aware that 2004 is the European year of education through sport and, although it is directed at all European citizens, it is in particular directed at young people. Nevertheless, this afternoon I went to see a visiting group of young Spanish students from the south of Spain, from Andalusia, from my region, and in the brief chat I had with them I asked them whether any of them could tell me what European year 2004 was. Not one of them – not one of the 30 young people in the room – could answer me. When I told them, they were rather surprised because they all realised it was something directed particularly at them. This is a sign that perhaps we are doing something wrong and we must correct it as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">To do so we need greater cooperation between youth organisations and public authorities. We must work hard to achieve this and I believe that the report by Mrs Gröner is an initial step towards providing more information for young Europeans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the future young people will have greater responsibility as the age structure of Europe’s population alters and the proportion of young people diminishes. The Commission’s communication on objectives relating to the participation of the young and providing them with information is an important step forward in the strengthening of cooperation at EU level in youth policy. It is gratifying that the draft Constitution also recognises the importance of involving young people.</p>
<p class="contents">Our rapporteur, Lissy Gröner, who with very good reason personifies Parliament’s youth policy, has once again done an excellent job. I, for my part, also want to thank the Commission for the work it has done for young people. The large-scale consultation process that preceded the White Paper relating to youth policy was a considerable effort that eventually inspired youth organisations to work at EU level. Now we have to ensure that support for the involvement of these organisations continues and that the results of their work are also visible in the Community’s youth policy. I am pleased that there was general agreement with my proposal to increase appropriations to youth organisations in this year’s budget, and the multiannual action programme to finance youth organisations now being finalised is also welcome as it at last guarantees a legal basis for them.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur’s call for young people being encouraged to take part in the first European elections of the enlarged EU is of primary importance. To make young people more active with regard to voting, alternative ways of casting one’s vote still being developed should now be exploited. The young are avid Internet users and voting this way could draw more young people to the ballot box. Although the procedure has many shortcomings in terms of election secrecy and freedom, it should not be totally ruled out. At least young people might become more pro-active in their voting habits if electronic ballot boxes introduced in a few Member States were located in places which are popular with the young.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement will highlight the importance of pluralism in the European Union and, likewise, that of intercultural learning. The future youth programme will make it easier for young people to come into contact with one another and therefore help overcome prejudice. I wish in this connection to stress that intercultural learning should not just mean investment in cross-border cooperation between Member States.

If we extend the parameters to include those aged 30, this figure will clearly be even higher.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, in Italy and in other countries of the European Union this is the only age group that actually enters the labour market on a permanent basis. One basic view is that young adults are no different to adults, but they are adults in a different way. They therefore have rights and duties, some of which are different to those pertaining to other citizens and some are similar. On the basis of exhaustive and extensive research, the Gröner report proposes a commitment that is also a challenge: to increase the participation and information of young people in politics. The information that we must manage and provide for them must be clear and specific. Achieving the participation that we are hoping for will not be easy, but learning to participate and learning to provide information is the best approach to developing the awareness of active citizenship that not all adults are putting into practice. If we agree that those who do not have a past do not have a future, then the only choice we have is to pass on the founding values of our past to young people, who are our future. In this way, these updated and revised values will be the seeds for tomorrow’s growth.</p>
<p class="contents">We are totally in favour of the European Youth Week because it also symbolises the priority commitment that is being given to a new drive for European youth that can count on several assets, such as intercultural learning, environmental protection, sport and art, to give just a few examples.</p>
<p class="contents">We are redoubling our efforts as adults on social exclusion and xenophobia because it is not words but practical deeds and actions that have the greatest educational impact. Thus, working on young people and for young people also becomes a way to work on ourselves and we should thank young people for this opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As per the title of the Commission's White Paper on the topic, youth policy can certainly be given a new impetus. I am pleased that the Irish presidency has also taken up the challenge contained in the White Paper and that youth issues form an important element of the presidency priorities. Indeed, Ireland will shortly host a major conference involving youth ministers and young people themselves, and which will have as its main theme 'young people in politics'.</p>
<p class="contents">Colleagues are all aware that in a few short months the citizens of Europe will have an opportunity to cast their votes in the elections for the European Parliament. Recent surveys of public opinion and interest in the elections are, I have to say, disturbing, particularly the low numbers of young people who say they intend to vote. After the ten new countries join, the number of young people between the ages of 15 and 25 will rise to 75 million. Many of these young people will be able to express their political will as first-time voters in the European elections. The rapporteur identifies participation and information as key areas for development in the context of EU youth policy. These are both key in the European elections, and we as public representatives have a vital role to play in informing young people about Europe and what it is doing for them, and encouraging them to make their voice heard.</p>
<p class="contents">In each of our Member States we need to take a hard look at ways of improving the active participation of young people in political life. This goes beyond voting in elections, and includes membership of political parties, political movements and various non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">We must strive to convince our young people that they can make a difference and that they can bring change to our society. A failure on our part to do so will lead to levels of apathy which will gradually erode all our democracies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have never had three minutes’ speaking time, and now I – the representative of the Italian Pensioners’ Party – have been given this length of time to speak on a report that concerns young people.</p>
<p class="contents">I support and agree with the report on the participation and information of young people. A short while ago, however, when I was listening to my fellow Members speaking about the reports on the budget and other subjects – I do apologise – but I nodded off. In my state of drowsiness two questions popped into my head: Are young people really different to the elderly? Are the elderly really different to young people?</p>
<p class="contents">It is said that young people want love, but old people also want and need love. Young people want to have money, but old people also want to have and need to have money. Young people want to travel and dance, but old people also want to travel and dance.</p>
<p class="contents">No, there must be some difference! In 45 years of working for the elderly, I have heard them say many times – and I regret this – that growing old is terrible. As a result, I am sure that the European Parliament has not just thought about young people but also about elderly people and has prepared several different reports and communications for them. I will have to listen to them all in the final months of this parliamentary term because I am sorry to say that, to date, very few have been presented.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also been thinking about other matters. Is it right to get young people more involved in political life and in the decisions that affect them? Is it right that young people are the best placed to draw up regulations and laws that concern them? Are women the best placed to take decisions concerning their problems? Are old people the best placed to take decisions concerning their problems?</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think so, Mr President. The answer that I came up with will surprise you. I agree that young people must take decisions and have power over everyone and over everyone’s lives. How else could I justify the fact my daughter Elisabetta Fatuzzo, at 32 years old, is at this very moment preparing to give a speech on Lombardy television, on the subject of pensioners and the elderly? This would not be possible if we thought that old people were better at talking about old people than young people are, and vice versa.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call on the Commission to make every effort to ensure that Europe continues to help young people and draw them closer to Europe so that they are also in a position where they have more say in matters concerning men and women of all ages. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
