<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lehne (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this second directive on money laundering in Europe has a long history. You know that legislation on money laundering in the Member States of the European Union has its roots not so much in the will of the national legislatures but rather in the fact that back in 1991 the European Union brought in the first money-laundering directive, which acted as a catalyst for a string of national money-laundering laws being adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the 1991 directive only set a minimum standard. This minimum standard provided that drug-related offences should be included in the list of predicate offences, and with regard to professions that were obliged to take part in the fight against money laundering, only banks and providers of financial services were covered by compulsory provisions. This led to major differences in transposal in Europe. There were Member States that went well beyond this minimum standard, and other Member States that only implemented the minimum standard. Back in 1995, the European Parliament's then Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs organised a major hearing on this. The outcome of that hearing was that the differences in transposal were leading to major problems in combating money laundering in Europe, as cooperation between the Member States was not functioning adequately either. For us in this House, the result – and there were two reports on this, one in 1996 and the other in 1998 – was that we called on the Commission to bring forward a second directive in order to raise standards in Europe, and in particular to extend the list of predicate offences and the list of professions covered.</p>
<p class="contents">At that time we suggested that the professions covered should include dealers in luxury items, casinos, auctioneers and also solicitors, notaries and other providers of legal advice. The Commission then brought forward its proposal in 1999, but we considered that at least as far as providers of legal advice were concerned, it was not sufficiently sensitive. As you know, since the Charter of Nice at least, citizens have the right to legal advice and representation, and this is also rooted in various national constitutions. This can only be effectively guaranteed if those citizens are also in a position to give their legal adviser any information safe in the knowledge that this will be kept confidential and that their legal adviser will not phone the public prosecutor the next day and pass on this information. That is why Parliament was concerned to preserve this right at first reading, while at the same time effectively combating money laundering in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This then went into the conciliation procedure, and I believe that the compromise which emerged was a good one. The Council gave ground on the Member States being allowed, in accordance with their own legal traditions, to let legal advice continue to be covered by the obligation of professional secrecy. On the other hand, Parliament also gave some ground, by not demanding that this arrangement should be made compulsory, but that it should instead be at the discretion of national legislatures. Article 6(3) therefore gives all Member States the option, depending on their own national legal traditions, of providing for the obligation of professional secrecy to be observed in the area of legal advice.</p>
<p class="contents">Exactly the same procedure was followed for other contentious points, and some excellent compromises were reached on those too. The subject of tipping off, in other words a ban on information given to one's legal adviser being passed on to others, has also been solved by means of a compromise under Article 6(3), that is to say by means of a discretionary arrangement. The issue of what should be done with information received in this way and which is in the hands of the public prosecutor's office has been left at the discretion of national legislatures.</p>
<p class="contents">To put it simply, all the parties involved finally said that they were not 100% satisfied with this compromise, nor was it ideal, but they could live with it. That is exactly what a good compromise is about, and I would therefore like to recommend to this House that it should accept the proposal that has emerged from the Conciliation Committee, thus making a substantial contribution to strengthening the fight against money laundering in Europe. Against the background of the present situation, and the need to combat terrorism, this is an important factor. On the other hand, we have accordingly also managed to ensure that our citizens' fundamental rights have been preserved without any need to interfere with mature national legal traditions which in some cases are of a constitutional nature. All in all, a good compromise then, please vote for it.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rothley (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I represent a minority. The new Recital 16 says that there is an obligation to report suspicions "if the legal counsellor is taking part in money laundering activities, the legal advice is provided for money laundering purposes, or the lawyer knows that the client is seeking legal advice for money laundering purposes". That is going too far. That is why I am voting against this. It would destroy the integrity of advice. It also has a second implication which has not up to now been the case under our existing legislation: in all three cases the legal counsellor or lawyer would be committing a criminal offence. He would therefore also have to denounce himself. That is totally unheard of anywhere in the world. I am fairly sure that even in the Stone Age there was no law saying that. For some inexplicable reason, the Commission has felt moved for the first time ever in law to adopt a legal provision whereby one must denounce oneself.</p>
<p class="contents">I certainly cannot vote for that. Lessing comes to mind, who said that if enlightenment is only a small light glimmering in the darkness, there is at least still some hope in the world. You have made the same mistake as with the OLAF legislation, which in the end has even penetrated into Members' offices. You will be stopped there. This could not stand up to constitutional scrutiny. When we were debating the OLAF legislation, I said that the European Union as a whole had had a rush of regulatory blood to the head. We seem to have a similar phenomenon again here. I also regard it as a matter for great regret that the legal profession has shown so little backbone on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ludford (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, one of the biggest gaps in the anti-money laundering regime has been that it only applied to financial institutions. As successive international reports have made clear, lawyers and other professionals become vulnerable to exploitation as unwitting accomplices in the washing of dirty money from criminals and terrorists as banks tighten up, which, I am glad to say, they are at last having to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I regard the outcome of the conciliation on this directive as satisfactory if it is interpreted in a common sense way. That means that lawyers, accountants and tax advisers must, outside a strict definition of legal privilege, report transactions that are suspicious, in other words, that they have reason to believe their client is involved in money laundering. This is the only feasible interpretation.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a huge amount of hype on this directive aimed at protecting lawyers' vested interests and not, I am afraid to say, individual rights. This has delayed the finalisation of the directive for an unnecessary six months. Parliament has not exactly covered itself with glory.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope all Member States will declare that they have no intention of invoking the option to exempt lawyers from the ban on tipping off clients that the authorities have been alerted. We need to make sure that our legal and financial systems are not exploited, rather than concentrating on the position of the lawyers themselves and their own self-interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the Radical Members of the Bonino List will not be able to vote for this report because it has two shortcomings: the first concerns the joint text itself which gives the Member States’ the right to use information obtained through proceedings combating money laundering for other types of investigations as well. This point introduces the danger that, in actual fact, the investigating authorities might use investigations into money laundering to obtain special powers as a way to get round the rules, so to speak, a way to get round the normal protection rights governing information obtained during proceedings on other issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point on which we have reservations is more general: it is the recommendation that the fight against money laundering should be seen as the priority. In our opinion, if we are to win the battle, if we are to strike at the profits of criminal organisations, our most urgent priority should be to legalise drugs. This text was adopted on the wave of events following the attacks of 11 September. We must not forget that Afghanistan, which we are currently attacking with military force, is responsible for 80% of the world’s opium production. Well then, maybe a policy of legalising drugs would be a more effective way of reducing the power of the drug barons than pursuing their capital throughout the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The money-laundering directive imposes a string of obligations on credit and financial institutions, with the result that money launderers have simply switched to other sectors, hence the need to extend the scope of the directive to other professions. Whilst we of course welcome more stringent measures, they should not lead to a watering down of the obligation of professional secrecy for various professions, and above all for lawyers, notaries and tax consultants.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rothley is right in saying that the text before us is chipping away at the principle of <span class="italic">nemo tenetur se ipsum accusare</span>, no one is bound to incriminate himself. However, that is the very compromise that we think is workable, and we believe that the need to balance professional secrecy on the one hand and the need to bring criminals to book on the other has been solved in an acceptable way, and we shall therefore be voting in favour of this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Because of your commitment, we have been able to see off the attack the Council and Commission were making on the fundamental rights and rights to defence of Europe's citizens. It is not acceptable for defence counsel, solicitors, tax consultants and notaries simply to be turned into part of the public prosecution service. It is also evident that the battle to maintain rights to defence is not over yet.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive still has to be transposed into national legislation, and we must continue to argue that it should not be subject to an excessively narrow interpretation at national level, thus restricting citizens' fundamental rights and rights to defence. However, I can also assure you that I will be making representations to the appropriate Austrian authorities to make sure that precisely this does not happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Delegations in the conciliation procedure on the proposal for a second money laundering directive have given their support to this compromise proposal, and the Commission is duly appreciative.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like in particular to thank the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, and also vice-president Provan for co-chairing the conciliation meeting, for their determined efforts to reach an agreement which, as I have said, is very much welcomed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal to update and extend the 1991 anti-money-laundering directive – which Parliament called for as early as 1995, as was mentioned quite rightly this morning – has raised difficult and sensitive issues of which the Commission is fully aware. Not least, the involvement of the professions in the anti-money-laundering defences has attracted the attention of many people interested in this subject and, in particular, Members of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that the joint text agreed in the conciliation procedure constitutes a good compromise, taking account of the legitimate concerns of both Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against money laundering is an essential aspect of the fight against serious and organised crime. Since the tragic events of 11 September, it has also become an integral part of the fight against the financing of terrorism. The proposal before us now, to strengthen the European Union's anti-money-laundering defences, has aroused great interest in the world outside the European Union, not least in the so-called financial action task force which is in the process of updating its 40 recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">So to sum up, I commend the joint text to Parliament and I look forward to the earliest possible adoption and implementation of this important new directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
