<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Glase (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Posting of Workers Directive was enacted in 1996 with the aim of eliminating obstacles and uncertainties concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services. It did this by providing greater legal certainty and making it possible to identify the working conditions that apply to workers temporarily working in a Member State other than the State whose legislation governs the employment relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">As provided for in Article 8 of Directive 96/71/EC, in the current communication the Commission summarises the results of its review of the implementation of the Directive in the 15 Member States and of its practical application, in order to decide whether the Directive needs to be revised. The communication shows that implementation of the Directive has, generally speaking, been satisfactory, although it should be noted that the United Kingdom and Ireland have no specific implementing provisions and that Luxembourg was the last Member State to complete transposition, which it did only 13 months ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reiterate that five years of highly problematic debates were needed before the Posting of Workers Directive was adopted in 1996. It has now been shown that difficulties have arisen, in that the directive requires the businesses to which it applies to comply with the laws of a State other than that in which they are established, laws which are sometimes not readily accessible or comprehensible. These problems need to be resolved at national level, as they are problems related to the transposition of the Directive into Member States’ legislation, which can result in difficulties in monitoring compliance with it.</p>
<p class="contents">In its communication, the Commission summarises the problems involved in transposing and applying the Directive, which are more practical than legal in nature. It has, in consequence, set up a group of experts – made up of civil servants from the Member States – with the objective of finding solutions to the problems described, such as ways of improving access to, and exchange of, information on national rules and legislation or of collecting required information in a standard form. The Committee is still of the opinion that this directive is a necessary one, and expresses the hope that the problems brought to light may be speedily removed, particularly in view of the fact that, on 1 May this year, 10 new countries will be covered by the Directive. We have to ensure legal certainty for the workers posted by enterprises participating in the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Committee wishes to point out that it is essential that the implementation of the Directive be monitored in order to assess the effectiveness of the legislation, and that this will be made even more important by EU enlargement. It also calls upon the Commission to submit better and more concrete data on the implications of implementation at national level, to lay down clear definitions of such things as the status of employees, minimum wages and overtime and to prevent the improper posting of workers, which is a consequence of unfair competition and social dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">We also call on the Commission to examine the provisions regulating liability in the case of subcontracting in with the Posting of Workers Directive. There is a need for comprehensive enquiries and surveys in the 15 – soon to be 25 – Member States if we are to have an exact picture of the situation that makes comparison possible. The Committee also believes that the Commission should support the group of experts and that this work should involve the collective bargaining partners, the European Parliament, the governments and parliaments of the Member States and the social partners.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee calls upon the Commission to cooperate closely with the social partners in detailed research with the aim to producing proposals for the improvement and simplification of the present Directive, which must give especial priority to the effects of EU enlargement. As the large number of demands made upon the Commission and the Member States makes any delay undesirable, my view, as rapporteur, is that the demand made of the Commission by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, that it submit a second report on the implementation of the Directive by the end of this year is not one that the Commission will be able to comply with.</p>
<p class="contents">Although, for this reason, I am unable to endorse Amendment No 1, I do want to put the case for the Amendment No 4 from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, and to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their good cooperation.</p>

It was clearly visible in the draft report on the implementation of that directive and was indeed highlighted in the discussions that led to its adoption in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. The Commission clearly shares this interest and agrees with Parliament that this directive continues to be an essential element for companies and workers alike.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the practical operation of the directive and its implementing legislation, we all agree that it is necessary to improve cooperation between the administration of the Member States on the one hand, and the dissemination of information on the applicable terms and employment conditions for workers and service providers on the other hand.</p>
<p class="contents">My services will evaluate the existing difficulties there will be cooperation between my services, a group of government experts and social partners. We will discuss it in the liaison forum, which has been scheduled for 10 February, and will try to find practical solutions to political problems.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the accession countries are concerned and the rapporteur has already underlined the importance of the implementation of this directive in these countries they have to transpose and implement this directive by 1 May. The Commission will prepare a report on the implementation of this directive in the course of this year; we hope to present it by the end of 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the need for legislative action, I am aware that some of you do not share the view held by the Member States' experts and the Commission that amendment of the directive is not necessary at this stage. Even though I am not convinced that substantial amendment of the text of the directive is necessary at this stage, I can assure you that my services will pay close attention to the arguments raised by national administrations and the social partners in their respective contacts. Also within that context, the Commission will take the necessary initiatives to ensure thorough consideration – together with the Member States' experts and the social partners – of the issues raised by the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Within the context of the free movement of people, the report focuses on the posting of workers in three possible circumstances: posting within the framework of a contract signed between the company of origin and the receiver of the services; secondly, the possible posting of workers to a workplace or company which belongs to the same group; and thirdly, the posting of workers from a temporary work agency based in a Member State which provides them for a employer acting in a Member State other than that of the provider.</p>
<p class="contents">Any of these circumstances can cause a variety of problems for posted workers: probably the first to spring to mind concerns their working conditions; hence the importance of Directive 96/71/EC, which is a catalogue of minimum rules for Community law protection, although it is insufficient, since it does not cover rules or aspects such as Social Security.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the rapporteur has identified the problems correctly: unfair competition, differences in social protection and, therefore, harm for workers, the need for a clear definition of the Workers’ Statute. We should, however, and this has also been mentioned, add possible abuse in posting and the problems stemming from subcontracting and generally from new forms of externalisation, decentralisation or deconcentration of production or, if you like, from the new forms of productive organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, Commissioner, I believe we are faced with an opportunity, or perhaps the need, for a common core of obligatory minimum standards for all cases and as a minimum guarantee, below which the working condition or the provision of services is illegal when the legislation of the State in which the service is provided offers less protection than that of the place of origin of the posting.</p>
<p class="contents">Without a guarantee of this kind, in the territory in which it may take place, I believe that the possibility of abuse and fraud are within reach of irresponsible employers. What is worse, we could be inviting them to commit this fraud or abuse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That happened, unfortunately, with the European Works Council, and it is, equally unfortunately, happening with the Posting of Workers Directive now. This is astonishing, for both of these acts to which I have referred send out messages to workers and the public, signalling that we do in fact have such a thing as a European social model. That is what makes it regrettable.</p>
<p class="contents">When the Committee was debating this, the Commission even sought to persuade us that all the problems with the Directive had nothing to do with Europe, but largely resulted from defects in transposition at national level. We do not believe that to be the case. The way in which the Directive is implemented can hardly be described as satisfactory when there are hundreds of appeals pending before national and regional labour and social security tribunals. Even though these are national courts, it goes to show that there is something lacking in the Directive itself and that there is inadequate legal certainty. Rare though it is for us to criticise the Commission for this, it is for this reason that we believe that your report oversimplifies matters, and the same criticism can, alas, be levelled at the rapporteur. Nevertheless, Mrs Glase, there was outstanding cooperation, and I cannot be other than grateful to you for having accepted nine out of the ten amendments that I tabled on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to agree with Mr Pérez Álvarez, who pointed out that abuses persist and that employers are still exploiting workers, and, extraordinarily enough, we see not only in Germany but also in other countries how very creative employers can be when it comes to getting round the law. What that means is that the only thing this House wants to argue about is the timescale, and I can be quite frank in telling you that we are not talking about giving the Commission one month more or less to draft a new and thorough report. We have learned from experience, though, that if we give you 14 months instead of 12, it will take you 22 or 26, and so, as we need to exert a certain amount of pressure, we have decided to ask for 12 months. This is regrettable, as we otherwise agree, but I will conclude by saying that I am convinced that this is a deadline you can meet if, in carrying out the analysis, you join with the social partners and the European trades unions, who already have the necessary data, with details of the deficits and abuses, ready to hand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know from my conversations over the past years on the largest building site in the centre of Berlin that the people we are dealing with here are the working poor. Building workers from the United Kingdom, Portugal and many other European States have built a railway station and office buildings for businesses and the government without having a regulated working day, on unequal pay in comparison to their German fellow-workers, not to mention not having sickness and accident insurance.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it the case, then, that the Posting of Workers Directive is the wrong instrument, or is it just used wrongly? The Glase Report gives that question a clear answer: the Directive is the proper instrument for guaranteeing equal pay for equal work at the same place of work, but the way in which the Member States apply it is atrocious. I believe that this is primarily the result of the lack of effective sanctions. Even if it is found that a Portuguese company’s workers do not enjoy the same pay and conditions as those of the German firm next door, and this is confirmed by the Labour Office’s inspections, nothing happens. In a matter of a few weeks, the company is back in Portugal, where the imposition of a fine in Germany is of interest to nobody. This is where businesses make a net profit by circumventing the law, and so fines must be enforced on a Europe-wide basis; the Council decision to this effect is long overdue. We thank the rapporteur for adding her support to this amendment. It must no longer pay to circumvent the rules; black sheep must be branded. Only thus can the public lose their fear of eastward enlargement and of the social dumping that they believe will result from it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that it is very significant that we have concluded that further research is needed. I think it a shame in itself that this further research was not carried out in parallel with the discussions that were held with the Member States, because that might have saved some time. Now that it is like this, however, I do think that Mrs Glase is quite right when she says that that is not to be expected with the proposed amendment. Therefore, I think that it is simply not possible.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are dealing with here is a very important directive. Why is it so important? We must look into the past to find the answer to this question. There have been two important periods. There was the period in which a good few people from the United Kingdom, in particular, came to work on the continent; and there was the period in which a good few people, chiefly from Eastern Europe, came here to work. Both periods gave rise to a good few problems. At that time, Germany still had a genuine social policy. I have the impression that that has now been somewhat diluted, but at that time it was still being conducted. It was then that the legislation on posted workers was conceived, and this matter at European level evolved from that.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that the practical implementation is far from ideal, but we must recognise that this is ultimately a matter for national governments. We can urge them to do much better – and it is also my opinion that the priority accorded to this matter is completely inadequate – but I should also like to sound a note of caution. Recently, I happened to be on a mission in the east of the Netherlands, and we saw that the new enlargement will cause new problems there, to which implementation of the idea and principles of this Directive would present an eminently suitable solution. If we fail to implement these, we can indeed expect a problem or two; not because people want that, but because there are always people who are on the lookout for loopholes in legislation and perhaps go on to exploit these, and that then produces all manner of undesirable repercussions. I think, therefore, that we have to be extremely careful over the next two years. I think that the Member States must improve the practical implementation of the existing Directive, but I also think that the Commission – and we, too – must advocate that this matter be well organised, because otherwise we shall endanger the actual, practical implementation of enlargement in the sphere of labour markets. We must not forget this, because it is a serious risk.</p>
<p class="contents">This problem is being grossly underestimated, and that worries me. The failure to implement these types of rule is not considered terribly important in the long term, but it leads to the decline of social systems. It also results in a general waning of respect for the law, because people will think that if it is possible to make a mockery of the rules in this sphere, this can be done elsewhere, too. This is dangerous ground, therefore, and it is clear that we must pursue this topic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
