<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schnellhardt, (PPE-DE) </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, as you just said, this is the second reading for the directive on the awarding of the eco-label. The European eco-label is, it has to be said, a product of the internal market. Its function, partly in response to the increasing flow of products across borders, is to label products and services which have a high level of environmental compatibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Its function, on the one hand, is to provide information to consumers from one country to the next and, on the other, to increase awareness within industry and among citizens to recognise and promote environmental issues. And this is of major importance when it comes to the daily shopping trip.</p>
<p class="contents">I am of the opinion that the meaningfulness of a European label which is tailored to the European internal market is beyond dispute. However, it is often a long road from the conception of a good idea to its practical implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is precisely the case with the eco-label whose main claim to fame at present is, unfortunately, its virtual anonymity in most States. I think that only a very small minority of citizens have ever actually seen it and for this reason my report has paid greatest attention to the wholly inadequate preparations for the label.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the weaknesses in the current eco-label regulation which have given rise to today’s unsatisfactory situation? I think that a key problem lies in the cost structure of the label. The test procedures which companies and their products must go through in order to obtain the label are long and costly. We are therefore advocating that the stipulation of testing requirements should look to keep test costs to an absolute minimum, although this must obviously not be misinterpreted as a qualitative watering down of testing requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as the cost of test procedures, the on-going fees which must be paid to the European eco-label system are also highly significant. Here, too, we envisage a reduction in costs for SMEs, firms in developing countries and enterprises involved in other aspects of European or international environmental legislation. In this regard, I should cite, for example, EMAS and ISO 14001.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to a reduction in costs for certain enterprises, the report also envisages a maximum fee. In this we are following the example of almost all the national labelling systems, which also have this ceiling. The purpose of this approach is to make the labelling system equally attractive to large consumer goods manufacturers and service providers. Let me make something perfectly clear at this point: this is not a present to the large multinationals, as is being mooted in some quarters, but an important step towards the label exerting a wide influence in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also clearly understand that without a certain amount of financial impetus for the European label we will not make any headway. In my opinion, we should take on the responsibility for this financing.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point in this second reading is the regulation of the relationship between the national eco-label and the European equivalent. At first reading we were still advocating the gradual abolition of national labels in favour of the European eco-label; it is not without good reason that we have abandoned this position. In some States national labels are well established and enjoy public recognition. This is the case, for example, as regards the Nordic Swan in Scandinavia and the Blue Angel in Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">In my estimation it would be nonsensical and contrary to the spirit of subsidiarity to abolish these proven labels in favour of an as yet unestablished European label. Our approach should be different. We must ensure that the co-existence of national and European labels is coordinated and in this regard the working plan provided for in the common position, which we have supplemented in various respects, but which I think will meet with approval, is extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">The eco-label regulation treads the fine line between economic and ecological interests, one group wanting above all to enforce stringent environmental requirements, the other with an eye on the marketing aspect of the label. Both groups, however, have one thing in common: they want the eco-label to succeed. I believe that the regulation which we are considering today has found a solid compromise between the interests of all the groups involved and I am convinced that the constructive proposals of our House will also be acceptable to the Council and make for a highly successful European eco-label. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whilst I found this observation quite persuasive, it is, of course, dangerous and misleading because nothing which we are currently doing in Europe in terms of the economy or the environment can be seen in isolation from potential global developments. And it goes without saying that this also applies to the awarding of an environmental label in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Take the failed WTO negotiations in Seattle, which have opened our eyes as to the difficulty Europe faces in making itself heard by third countries when it comes to its progressive social and environmental standards. If we re-commit today to awarding a European environmental label, we must also consider that this will send a clear signal to third countries that it will be present on our products in developing countries and, of course, that others can and will follow suit.</p>
<p class="contents">The environmental label must and will signal to third countries a whole range of important environmental concepts: that adverse effects on the environment can be reduced in the manufacture of certain product groups; that common goals for environmentally friendly consumption should be promoted; and that the relevant international standards must be observed.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic globalisation has already made it possible for developing countries to share in the prosperity of rich countries and will continue to do so in the future. However, one thing must be made clear from the outset, and the common position before us does just that: the same rules must apply for all states. If the production plants in a country are required to meet the criteria for the environmental label, then this applies to all the production plants where the product in question is manufactured. If we can achieve this, then we will have globalised an important environmental principle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The eco-label may have suffered thus far from a lack of acceptance, but a working plan which allows for coordination with the national labels can only increase acceptance.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposal in committee to automatically award the eco-label to products and services which already carry national labels and which satisfy the requirements of the European label did not, unfortunately, achieve a majority. It would have afforded the opportunity to disseminate the European label even more quickly and effectively. An important issue is the involvement of non-governmental organisations and associations. It is essential that expert opinion and protection of consumer interests have some influence on the awarding process. This can only benefit the status and merit of what the label stands for in terms of ecology and the consumer. </p>
<p class="contents">The aim of our amendments is to increase the participation of associations. There is much to be said on the question of fees. We need to introduce a system which covers the costs and it is therefore not right at this stage to fix maximum fees, which would seem premature until such time as we know the actual costs involved. In this regard I would disagree with Mr Schnellhardt because it seems to me that even though the well-known national labels do give rise to costs, suppliers are still happy to acquire them. It is right, however, that there should be a cost reduction for SMEs and for products from developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, we must succeed in establishing the European label in Member States which do not have their own label. If the common label has a function at present, it is that of filling the environmental label gaps in Europe. The path which we are taking is the correct one, but a recognised common European label is not yet in sight and a major effort is required in this area.</p>

We know from the Nordic Swan and the German Blue Angel that the eco-labelling of products is an extremely significant and powerful tool for getting consumers to change their purchasing behaviour and to shop in an environmentally friendly way. That is, of course, what we all want, namely to be able to shop in an environmentally friendly way and so influence producers and the development of society in ways which favour ecologically more sustainable products and services. </p>
<p class="contents">I think that the Council’s position is fairly commendable, and I am also satisfied with the amendments from the committee and from Mr Schnellhardt. I consider, however, that the proposal needs to be reinforced in certain ways, above all when it comes to the role played by consumer and environmental groups and the co-existence of different eco-labelling systems. Those who argue the case for having only the one eco-labelling system are making a big mistake, I believe. I am totally convinced that, wherever there are well-functioning eco-labelling systems, it will be possible also to introduce the EU flower that much more easily and more quickly. It is about getting the consumer to look for and to choose eco-labelled products. Once purchasing behaviour has been altered, it is extremely simple. The key to success lies, to a very large degree, in the credibility of the environmental and consumer groups and in the good opinion in which these are held. If these groups are involved in the right way, eco-labelling will also develop very much more quickly. </p>

It has also been altered a great deal since its first reading by the European Parliament. Happily, all these changes are, on the whole, improvements. Those of us in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left believe that we have obtained a relatively good hearing for the views we already held at the first reading. </p>
<p class="contents">For us, the following principles were important when we assessed the proposal in the course of the journey. First of all, this common eco-label should not replace or get in the way of national eco-labels which are, in fact, at present functioning significantly better than the EU flower symbol when one considers both the number of labelled products and the extent to which consumers are familiar with the various labels. It is therefore especially important that the idea of prohibiting national eco-labels has been abandoned. I also believe it is important to realise that there is nothing to prevent the existence of parallel eco-labels. In Scandinavia, which perhaps has what is at present the most efficient eco-labelling system, there are now already a number of eco-labels complementing, and operating fairly well alongside, each other. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we want the environmental movement to have a decisive influence over both the awarding of labels and the criteria for receiving them. Our experience shows that the labels would, in that way, be given greater credibility. Moreover, this system functions excellently where it has been introduced. We are therefore especially pleased that the idea of a more commercial form of organisation has been abandoned. I also think it is good that the idea of a graded eco-label has been done away with. It is easier just to have the picture of a flower. A graded system, like the one that existed originally, would probably cause more hassle than it would be worth in terms of additional information provided. We are also pleased that the proposal is to cover the service sector, too. </p>
<p class="contents">All in all, we think that the common position and the amendments which have been submitted, including the amendments from the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, make this into quite a good report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When I congratulated her on this, she looked rather guilty and admitted that the green bottle now contained normal detergent, as the alternative product was not only more expensive but needed four times as much and even then it did not get the dishes clean; by refilling the container, she could both do the washing up effectively and impress eco-warrior friends. The moral of this story is, of course, that to compete in the mainstream market, eco-products must give a performance close to their alternatives. Only then can these products move out of the niche market they already have and into the mainstream. The eco-label should not be associated with mediocrity.</p>
<p class="contents">The German Blue Angel and the Nordic Swan have led the way in eco-labelling. To scrap these successful schemes now would be to throw away the baby with the bath water. In the long term, I can see the merits of the single European eco-label, but this must not be imposed on those with existing schemes. A single scheme has advantages for business: for example, only one registration fee and inspection, standardised packaging, and advantages for consumers who will not be confused by a plethora of labels.</p>
<p class="contents">Eco-labelling is moving on from forest products and detergents to computers and household appliances, but why stop there? Services such as tourism and clean taxes could register. In addition, groups of similar small business could possibly cooperate and register together.</p>
<p class="contents">In the United Kingdom, we have a flourishing ethical financial services sector, offering savings and pensions which invest from a green perspective. These should not only qualify for an eco-label, but be allowed to sell their products without hindrance throughout the EU in a single financial services market.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, first of all, I wish, of course, to thank the European Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, in particular the two rapporteurs, Mr Schnellhardt and Mr Poggiolini, for the very constructive work which has been carried out in reviewing the regulation on eco-labelling. </p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a revised Community programme for awarding the eco-label is mainly aimed at making the programme more effective and more open and at improving the methods used. It ought to make the programme more attractive to manufacturers, distributors and consumers. In particular, the proposal accords greater responsibility to the bodies responsible for eco-labelling and to various interest groups when it comes to establishing ecological criteria. The Commission considers that these objectives will be fulfilled thanks to cooperation with, and interest on the part of, the European Parliament and the Council. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the relationship between the Community’s eco-labelling programme and the national eco-labelling programmes is better and more clearly defined in the current proposal. The proposal also reinforces the interested parties’ role and participation. This applies, in particular, to various interest groups and to the environmental bodies dedicated to eco-labelling. Their participation is crucial if the present voluntary instrument is to be favoured and made more widely available in the correct way. It is one of the few European instruments which will, in fact, be able to play a key role in supporting sustainable consumption. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendments tabled by the European Parliament, the Commission considers that these have helped improve the exposition of the regulation. With regard to Amendments Nos 1, 4 and 8, which propose active participation on the part of environmental and consumer organisations, the Commission shares the view that their support and participation is crucial if eco-labelling is to be balanced and credible. We are therefore able to accept these amendments. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 7, which relate to certain aspects of cooperation and coordination with national eco-labelling programmes, the Commission is convinced that common supporting activities are important, particularly with a view to making the Community’s eco-labelling better known. We are therefore able to approve these amendments, too. Amendment No 5 proposes four ways of making the fee structure more flexible and easier for those who apply to be accepted. The Commission supports this overarching objective. After all, eco-labelling is, of course, voluntary, and the fees ought not to be so high that those who make the most effort in the interests of the environment are prevented from applying for the eco-label. Amendment No 6 concerns fee reductions for small and medium-sized companies, as well as developing countries, and emphasises that these should be appreciable. The Commission is able to support this amendment, too. To summarise, the Commission is therefore able to approve all the amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This applies, for example, to Amendments 7 and 8. These are only available in English, which is totally unacceptable.
