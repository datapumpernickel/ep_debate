<p class="contents">I took on this role with determination, with passion and with an overriding desire to accurately reflect the beliefs and the positions of the majority in this House to the greatest extent possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would like to tell you that I have always been able to feel proud of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may, I would like to thank in particular the Secretary-General, Mr Julian Priestley, and all those working here who have helped me with their extraordinary degree of motivation and friendship.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for the unfaltering support you have given me, and I would hope that my successor can enjoy a Presidency that is as active and happy as that I have had the fortune to experience myself.</p>

Under your guidance, the European Parliament has accomplished an impressive political and legislative career. You yourself have carried out the work of a pioneer, both externally and in the EU itself. Well before the start of the crisis in Afghanistan, you drew our attention to this issue, and you had already embarked upon the fight for the improvement of the situation of women in this country.</p>
<p class="contents">Your role in the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights should not be underestimated, and this is an issue of relevance to all European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">At Laeken, we once again used the model for a Convention of which you, personally, were one of the architects. In many respects, you have prepared the European Parliament for the new phase that is opening up in inter-institutional relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would also like thank you most warmly for the excellent degree of cooperation that has been apparent between Parliament and the Council during both our Presidencies. Thank you very much.</p>

At this time, I would like to make particular mention of your great sensitivity, evident in your constant rejection of any form of violence, especially terrorist violence. Your speeches, Madam President, have been moderate in tone but clear and incisive in substance, and they have encouraged and sustained all the democratic Europeans in their fight for peaceful coexistence amongst their citizens.</p>

<p class="contents">Madam President, you are one of a distinguished line which includes Louise Weiss and Simone Veil. Louise Weiss, Simone Veil and Nicole Fontaine: these are three great Presidents of our European Parliament. Today we ask ourselves the following question: what were the outstanding qualities of your Presidency? The first is that you have always put the concept of the Community, action by the European institutions, at the centre of your policy, and indeed you continue to do so; this means first and foremost the European Parliament, which you – and this is my second comment – have consistently represented with great dignity, both in public and at the summits. The fact that the Laeken photograph shows you between the King of Belgium and the President of the French Republic is testimony to your powers of persuasion.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly – and here you were an example amongst so few – you spoke out against any form of terrorism, obviously in particular against the terrorism in Spain, but also throughout the world. Extending an invitation to Commander Massoud was one of your great decisions and in so doing you, as it were, anticipated subsequent events in Afghanistan. That is why we have every reason to thank you so warmly today! You were of course always a full Member of our group, even as President, but now, when you stand down as President in January, you will be coming back into the fold of our group and you will then take your seat alongside another former President of the European Parliament – whom we hold in equally high esteem – José María Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado. We will be delighted to have you, as well as Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, working alongside us on a day-to-day basis. We welcome you very warmly back into our group and we thank you most sincerely for your convincing work, our dear President, Nicole Fontaine.</p>

<p class="contents">It is obvious that our political group, the Socialists, did not elect you to your post. But today, in the name of this very political group, I would like to thank you for your Presidency...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... and say that you are very welcome in our midst, for, at the end of the day, each and every one of us here is a European politician working for a noble cause which, today, is at an historical turning point. I believe that, during your Presidency, you have, more than anything, shown a commitment to the cause of freedom and democracy, not only outside the EU but within the Union, and for this reason I would like to thank you.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, this has already been said but it cannot be stressed enough, you have played a part in the fight for freedom and democracy versus terrorism, which at this present time is the global scourge. And you have also fought to ensure the EU moves forward, and it is increasingly accepted that it should be equipped with the constituent process used in each of our countries, that is to say, a debate that is open and democratic. I think we should also praise your support of the Convention as a method where the two pillars of democratic legitimacy are combined. Thank you for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the issues on which our opinions differ, Madam President, you have always had the courage of your convictions. We, on the other hand, have had the courage of ours. But in any case, I think that this has also helped in advancing the cause which unites us in this House, the fight for democracy, for a European Union that is democratic, that represents not only our peoples but also our citizens.

We were proud to do so then and I am proud today after your record in office of two and a half years. You have been an outstanding representative of this House who has earned the thanks and support of everyone here.</p>
<p class="contents">You took over at a very difficult period when relations had been fractured between the two key institutions of the Union, the Commission and the Parliament. I believe you have succeeded in restoring an effective and substantial working relationship which is so necessary at the heart of a proper functioning Community method. I thank you for doing that. It was a strategic act of considerable European importance, not just European Parliamentary importance.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been impressive improvements under your Presidency in our work rate with regard to co-legislation and that is due to good management of our agenda. You have been an impressive defender and promoter of the Charter on Fundamental Rights and we salute you for that. You have brought a very special conviction to the fight against terrorism and in doing so you have brought dignity to the democratic purpose of this House. You strongly promoted the case for a Convention. One year ago, 11 months ago, 10 months ago – yours was an isolated voice. Today your voice is the common currency and we salute you for that.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been controversies during your Presidency and I agree with Enrique Barón Crespo that you indeed had the courage of your convictions. For my part I have always believed that you acted in those controversies without fear or favour. That for me is a measure of the enormous personal integrity and strength which you have brought to your task.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course as a woman you have brought not just the quality of being female but also femininity to this task. You represented that large section of our community in Europe which is so inadequately represented, not just in electoral politics, but in so many spheres of public administration and public life.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for what you have done for this Parliament. Thank you for the strength and for the <span class="italic">élan feminin</span> which you have brought to your High Office and we wish you good luck and good fortune in the future.</p>

In particular, I would very much like to say that our Group has been truly proud of you every time you have stood up for human rights in the world. You always immediately took a stance in situations in which people’s lives were under threat. I remember that case in which Ghanaian children died in the hold of an aircraft. They sent a message to Europe which said how difficult the situation in Ghana was. You showed no hesitation in promptly adopting a position on the matter. You also invited Commander Massoud to Parliament last spring, just as if you had foreseen what was coming, and you boldly appeared in public beside him. I am quite sure you also jeopardised your own personal safety on many an occasion in this way, and it is for this kind of courage that I wish to express my sincerest thanks. The European Parliament, which has always been keen to act as the European Union’s moral conscience, has actually managed to acquire a human face during your term of office, and that face has been yours, for which I thank you. You have also bravely reflected the majority view in this Parliament in situations in which that has not been very easy. I remember when we were discussing here Austria’s new government: you put in words what the majority in this Parliament felt, that our hearts were not entirely in it. That cannot have been easy for you either.</p>
<p class="contents">But now things are changing, there are going to be new faces, and I want to wish you all the very best for the future. Perhaps, as someone in my Group has already called out, you would have been a sparkling presence in the newly set up Convention. You are just the sort of person I would have liked to see leading it. At present I am not sure if I am happy about what has been done, but I wish you well in any case.</p>

The reason for this is that, as far as we are concerned, for democracy to function properly, the pluralism characterising our societies must be properly expressed. I am, however, speaking completely from the heart when I say that both my group and myself truly appreciate and have a great deal of respect for your Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">You have given us proof of your impartiality, your respect for all political sensibilities, even minority opinions, and your ability to avoid political discrimination. This has not always been the case in this Parliament. Your attitude in this regard is worthy of a special mention.</p>
<p class="contents">You have also been able to adopt difficult positions, for which you deserve credit, when the fundamental values upon which the European Union is founded have been called into question. A great deal of courage was required to adopt such positions, which you proved to have. Although, generally speaking, we have not always supported your public statements, because they put forward the majority view of Parliament, which, unfortunately, on too many occasions is so different from our own, you have nevertheless been able to give a dignified image of Parliament. One of the highlights of your Presidency has to be the outstanding Sakharov prize ceremony that you so wanted and that you were able to expand on through your wise words in your speech at the Laeken European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of this, and for the excellent degree of cooperation between us, thank you very much!</p>

I totally agree with all the very many well-deserved, fine compliments which have been paid to you by the leaders of the other Groups here today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency of the European Parliament has to reflect the views of all its Members and I am more than satisfied that you, Mrs Fontaine, have worked exceptionally hard during your term of office to ensure that all our views were represented on the many occasions on which you had to fulfil this responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to wish you well for the future. You have represented us all with very great dignity and at all times showed great respect for all the Members of this Parliament. You have spoken out clearly on our behalf when clear statements were needed on the fight against terrorism and the protection of human rights. This is an area of major importance for this Parliament and an area in which we are gaining international respect.</p>
<p class="contents">It was a pleasure and a privilege having you as our President for the last two and half years and for me personally, as someone who supported you unequivocally on the important day at the beginning of your term of Presidency, I am very happy to say that you have succeeded beyond all my hopes and expectations.</p>

I recommended you and also voted personally for you, because I thought it important to break with ten years of cartel agreements between the two largest groups. Previously, the post alternated between the two large groups, and within the large groups it alternated between the largest sub-groups. If there were a qualified candidate from a smaller group – from the independents or from the smaller sub-groups in one of the large groups – the person concerned would have no chance of being elected. It was also an outstanding Vice-President who could conduct the very difficult votes to the satisfaction of all MEPs. In my speech of recommendation, I looked forward to your being a fair representative of us all and, with the open election campaign we now have between Mr Cox and Mr Martin and the three other candidates, the break with the cartels of the past has been confirmed.</p>
<p class="contents">The break with the major coalition has also made for a very good atmosphere in the Conference of Presidents. Now, all the chairpersons have the same opportunity to present their arguments. Agreement and disagreement cross political divides. No one knows the outcome of meetings before they have been held. In the past, your predecessors could look at Mrs Martens from the Group of the European People’s Party and Mrs Green from the Group of the Party of European Socialists and, if these people looked down, the proposal was abandoned and, if they looked up, it was adopted. The cartel was so far-reaching that, on one particular occasion, it led to the appointment of an official to Parliament in opposition to the consensus reached by the group chairpersons. The person concerned was only elected because it was a particular sub-group’s turn to be given a titbit in terms of the administration of Parliament. This happened even though Mrs Green was on that occasion opposed to the election of this person and then had nonetheless to vote in favour of it. I should like to thank you for your cooperation in the far more open period that has just gone by. It is by setting good examples that we can help ensure a Parliament in which the best candidate for each post always has at least a fair chance of being elected or appointed.</p>
<p class="contents">May I also thank you personally, Madam President, for your resolute efforts on behalf of human rights on every occasion on which these have been an issue. Thank you, and good luck in your next job.</p>

This is a group of variable geometry, composed of strong individuals with strong opinions, which very often are completely different to one another, to the extent that they are often in total opposition. I will therefore not be so audacious as to express my opinions other than on my own behalf. But I would like to think that my choice of words will be shared and accepted by each of these Members.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that your Presidency has been characterised by a great deal of elegance. In my opinion, this is a virtue that is becoming so rare, particularly in political circles, that it deserves special mention. Your Presidency has been characterised by elegance, by the dignity that you have managed to maintain at all times, on your personal behalf and for this Parliament that you represent. It has also been characterised by an independence of spirit, the concern expressed by you that some would possibly say has not been felt in all areas, but which has in any case, in my opinion, been expressed with a great deal of sincerity. You also have the ability to detach yourself, in your role as President, from any political in-fighting, to detach yourself from the concerns arising from your own personal convictions to respect those of others. For these great virtues you have displayed, Madam President, I would like to thank and congratulate you.</p>
