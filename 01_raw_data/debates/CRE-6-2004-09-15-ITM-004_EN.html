Guerrilla fighting is spreading and the number of terrorist acts is rising. Last Sunday, 600 attacks of this type occurred. The position of the interim government is weakening, and there is a risk that the political process outlined in Security Council Resolution 1546 will be brought to a halt. Elections are meant to take place by 31 January 2005. If they do not, the constitution will not be adopted and a final, permanent government will not be appointed in early 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">This means we are currently at a turning point, and that either Iraq will take action to abide by the timetable outlined in Resolution 1546, or the entire reconstruction of the country will be brought to a halt. This leads to the question as to how to proceed.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the military coalition should not be weakened, as the socialists wish, and troops should not be withdrawn. Instead, the military contingent should be increased, as the present number of around 200 000 soldiers is quite inadequate to stabilise the situation in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the UN’s role in Iraq should gradually be stepped up, and it should go beyond its current role as midwife to the democratic process.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, and as set out in the motion for a resolution on Iraq by members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, it is important for the European Union to be extremely active in its support for the transformation of Iraq in various fields, on the premise that Iraq is our joint responsibility, the joint responsibility of all Europeans and that of the entire European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to provide political backing, supporting the measures taken by the interim government, and later by the permanent Iraqi authorities. Expert support is also needed, in creating police forces, for example. Humanitarian and financial support on a far greater scale than this year is required too.</p>
<p class="contents">A democratic Iraq should not be held hostage to last year’s arguments in Europe. Mr Bot said that Iraq is a divisive issue. It should not be, and a line should be drawn under the arguments of the past year. Iraq’s future requires all of us and the entire European Union to be fully mobilised, as was and is the case for reconstruction in the Balkans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is now urgent to try to bring a stop to the chaos and violence, even if it is difficult to talk of peace and democracy when every day is marked by kidnappings, murders, guerrilla attacks, terrorist ambushes and air bombardments. Europe is being called upon to act and Parliament itself must take a more active investigative and steering role in such a decisive matter of foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, therefore, that the Presidency of the European Council should resolve to take part in an international conference on Iraq as soon as possible with a view to the multilateral management of the crisis, which should involve the United Nations, the major world powers and all those countries with an interest in the region, that is, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Syria. To promote this path to restoring peace, Europe needs to take strong, united action that is clearly in favour of dialogue with the Islamic world and strongly against terrorism and all kinds of violence.</p>

<p class="contents">Today, faced with the political and military disaster of the occupation, we cannot even demand or envisage the withdrawal of the occupying foreign troops and we avoid the need to identify those responsible for the current situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I see no political realism. The evidence says that a mass uprising of the people is under way against the occupying powers and against a government that does not represent the country. The terrorist presence cannot hide that fact. Indeed, as Mr D’Alema said as well, it is the presence of foreign troops that is attracting and causing the terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">If it does not make a stand, Europe is in serious danger of finding itself in a few months’ time not only facing an even more widespread disaster but also of being jointly responsible for it. Under these conditions, the elections planned for January 2005, if they take place, will be neither free nor fair. Condemning terrorism without saying who and what created the whole situation means we are hiding our heads in the sand.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we should send out a different signal to public opinion in the Arab and Islamic world and also to public opinion in Europe, the major part of which is hostile to the war, calling first of all for an immediate halt to the bombing. Otherwise we all shall miss a great opportunity to contribute to justice and peace and to influence the international situation for the good. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FI)</span><span class="bold"> </span>Mr President, it is obvious that Iraq and the world are better places without Saddam than with Saddam. It does not help to blame others in this difficult situation; instead we should look ahead. Mankind has to answer the question of what we are to do with tyrants, despots who kill their own people or those of another country. Human suffering, whether it is in one’s own or another country, is always the same.</p>
<p class="contents">There was no help from the League of Nations when Stalin attacked Finland. What is the role of the United Nations today? To maintain world order we need a revamped UN. We need a UN with a Security Council and a UN on which there is also a seat for the EU. Before we can do this, however, we need a common EU foreign policy. Now, the issue of Iraq has split the EU, and the EU cannot play the role we should be able to in securing world peace, or peace in Iraq, because we are so divided.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for us to help Iraq on a wide front in this difficult situation. We must do all we can to combat terrorism, including its causes, as otherwise tomorrow we will find bombs in our own homes. We must do all we can to help Iraq to develop democracy, to develop civil government. Now is not the time to hide our heads in the sand.</p>
<p class="contents">I am disappointed that the resolution makes no mention of prohibiting the death penalty. The Iraqi constitution should definitely contain a mention of the prohibition of the death penalty, as the protection of life is a basic value, the starting-point for everything. Finally, this is an opportunity to show the international community and the EU whether we are capable of leadership and keeping overall control of the situation, or whether we are just content with discussing the politics of the day.</p>

Their continuing captivity is causing serious injury to the European Union itself and its contribution to the reconstruction of Iraq. We must all strengthen our cooperation and join our voices to obtain their immediate release.</p>
<p class="contents">Iraq is sinking deeper and deeper into violence and instability and is now lacking even fundamental security. Every day, the political process of transition to free elections, as provided for in UN Security Council Resolution 1546, is being undermined. The departure of the international and European aid workers will be a defeat for the international community and, more importantly, for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Last June we all welcomed unanimous Security Council resolution 1546 marking the start of the political process which would result in free elections and a new democratic constitution. Despite the legalisation of the occupying forces as a multinational force by the Security Council, the occupation continues; it is a fact of life and the source and main reason for the continuing conflict. Under these circumstances, who truly believes that the timetable set out in Resolution 1546 will be adhered to, who believes that it can guarantee smooth political process, who believes that the UN can play the leading role in Iraq? The European Union must play its own autonomous role, make its own analysis of the security situation and proceed with its own analysis of the role and composition of and prospects for the multinational force.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2004 Commission communication is important, just as the role of Commissioner Patten is important. However, I fear that they cannot be implemented. The European Commission and the Council of Ministers must proceed at once to draft a report evaluating the security situation in Iraq, just as an international initiative must be taken to convene an international conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, however, quite clear that, despite a declared common European feeling, Europe – and the Council in particular – will do nothing for the four European citizens who are being held hostage right now by the terrorists.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe – and the Council in particular – will do nothing to make these four European citizens stop being considered just Italians or just French; stop being just journalists, doing a job assigned to those who feel they have a duty to report the truth; stop being just international aid workers, doing a job assigned to those who feel they have a duty to work for the common good; and start being adopted simply as children of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This observation, though bitter, is not intended to be one of resignation, and in fact I continue to call insistently for the immediate release of all the hostages, without making them undergo any further ordeals, and for support for all efforts to achieve this outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">With its people, its volunteers and its solidarity, including in peacekeeping or crisis containment operations, Italy has always done its utmost for the good of the population in the Italian areas of activity. The two Italian women volunteers, like so many others, are there to help, to protect the weak and to do good. That is why we want them released, together with all the other hostages.</p>
<p class="contents">We also ask that the body of Enzo Baldoni be returned and, in this respect, we ask for his family to be shown pity as well. We must not now allow the ideal that those two young women embody to be held in check, for there is a real possibility to build a sense of the common good and brotherhood within the Iraqi mind. Those two women and the two journalists are genuine representatives of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

OK, so we want free elections, but what about Iraq’s female majority?</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality organised a hearing with Iraqi women, at which the hope was expressed that we would provide outside help, highlighting painful issues as we did in Afghanistan, and that women could be involved in the process of democratisation. For that reason, we women in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament want this aid with reconstruction to be tied to the stipulation that women be fully involved. No matter what the terror, hope must not be allowed to die, and it is through women and children that it lives on – the hope that they will again be able to work as police officers, as politicians, as doctors, and as university professors, as they did under Saddam, dictator though he was.</p>
<p class="contents">That, I believe, is why we must not forget, while demanding the immediate release of the hostages, that Iraq’s women, too, have to be set free. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU must, however, play a part in that process, in these turbulent and dangerous times for all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, the direction taken by European cooperation with Iraq is consistent with the process of reconstructing the country and restoring democracy. We must, now more than ever, be conscious of the thin line separating internal security and external security. Consequently, new approaches to cooperation are needed that go beyond bloody-minded unilateral acts, which are no longer acceptable and are little more than representations of outdated debate, as has already been said in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Nowadays, when anything can be deemed a target, it has become even more necessary for our alliances to remain firm in that fight. No effort must be spared against the endless horrors of terrorism. Europe must set an example of firmness in condemning terrorist attacks against civilians, the police, soldiers of the multinational force and civilian hostages. Parliament must bring all of its political weight and influence to bear to ensure that those hostages are released immediately. We are speaking about appalling crimes that have yet to be punished.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also support the Interim Government’s intention to press ahead, in spite of all the difficulties, with preparations for free and democratic elections in January 2005. When time appears to be against the Iraqi people who want to be able to prepare the route towards democracy and the dismantling of terrorist networks operating in the country, we have no doubt that the EU and its Member States share this commitment to support the Iraqi people in reconstructing a country that is secure, democratic, unified and prosperous, a country at peace within its borders, a country that wants to re-establish working relations with its neighbours and with the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Parliament must not waver in the face of the complex nature of these times. We must remain firm in our societies, our alliances must remain solid and loyal and, most importantly, our actions must form part of a concerted struggle for the peace, stability and prosperity to which Iraq and the Iraqi people are unquestionably entitled. After all, Mr President, nobody wishes to see this fail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I realise that although the EU’s role is modest for the time being, it can nevertheless help determine the quality of democracy in future. My questions are concrete and I should say beforehand that I welcome the proposal by the President-in-Office of the Council to perhaps send a fact-finding mission to Iraq later on this year. My first question is about spending EU funding in Iraq itself. It appears to me that for practical considerations, it has been decided to spend these monies mainly via the existing, traditional channels in a bid to make the greatest possible impact. However, as a result of this, it looks as if minorities, and I am particularly referring to the Assyrian minority, which accounts for 10% of the population and mainly consists of Christians, are at risk of falling by the wayside. That would be harrowing, because they also suffered the effects of Saddam Hussein’s arabisation programme, and are now also suffering repression in the Kurdish region. Could the Commission, and also the Council, say a little more about how the funds will be spent, particularly where this minority and other small minorities are concerned?</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the draft constitution, in which Arabic and Kurdish are recognised as official languages. Assyrian, however, is not, despite the fact that more than 10% of the population speak it. What role can the European Union play on this score in order to guarantee the positions of minorities and also in respect of minority languages in the new Iraq and Iraqi society? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to say that after everything that has happened, we would do well to look ahead instead of heaping reproaches on one another. I think that that is what we should do, because our ultimate goal is not to leave the Iraqi people in the lurch. That is why we need to constantly remind ourselves of what our goals are.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I think that we have to ensure that the political process is completed, as has also been clearly explained in Resolution 1546. I also think that the European Union is determined to make a constructive and effective contribution to that effect. We could, for example, help to ensure that everything in the election process runs smoothly and that all Iraqis can actually take part. We could help install a legal government, and ensure that, once that legal government is in place, it is also supported by effective administration. In short, I think that we must seek to introduce in that stricken country the values we regard as so important. Democracy, something that Iraq has lacked for so long, springs to mind. I am also thinking of human rights and respect for them, and I can tell you that that also includes women, something that was quite rightly pointed out earlier. I am thinking of respect for minorities, including the Assyrian minority, which is another of that country’s problems to which sufficient attention will need to be paid. I am thinking about the establishment of a constitutional state and the way in which we, the European Union, backed by our extensive experience, with the contribution we can make to restoring a true, independent, legal body with judges who truly render judgment, with everything that is involved in this and what is important, can train these people and give them guidance. Someone has also pointed out the importance of the neighbouring countries. This is a view that I readily support. As I already stated in my first intervention, during my meetings with the Prime Minister and ministers during my visit to Iraq, I noted that the European Union will gladly accept an invitation to take part in the next conference of neighbouring countries. After all, as has been said several times on this platform, stability in Iraq also means stability in the region. Peace and democracy in Iraq will also rub off on the neighbouring countries. I think that we should do our utmost, firstly, to ensure that peace and democracy are in place in Iraq itself. Therefore, once we have managed to bridge the differences of opinion which existed, we as European Union should also be able to make our presence clearly felt in Iraq. I know how much this is appreciated and wanted by the present government. I therefore think that we cannot avoid our responsibilities and that we must actually follow the clear trajectory that we have mapped out. The Dutch Presidency will ensure that this is done. I have clearly set out those goals. I have also explained that we have sent an exploratory mission, that we will now send a follow-up mission and that, based on this, we will very shortly state how we can give substance to this. That is our aim, and I hope that I will be able to report on the results at the end of our presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
