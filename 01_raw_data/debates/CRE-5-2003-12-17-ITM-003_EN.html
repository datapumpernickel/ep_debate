<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Antonione,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the embargo on the export of weapons to the People's Republic of China was adopted by the European Union in 1989 following the events in Tiananmen Square. The embargo permitted only exports not associated with repressive activities or with activities violating Human Rights, to be examined on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="contents">China believes that the embargo is now out of date and that the level of cooperation in all sectors between China and Europe, as well as the rapid changes underway in the People's Republic of China, are such as to justify it being lifted. This fact is being more and more frequently and vehemently stressed on every possible occasion, both multilateral and bilateral, by our Chinese interlocutors, who have recently pinpointed the lifting of the embargo as a short- or medium-term priority in China’s relations with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of the implications, were the embargo against China to be lifted, the European Code of Conduct would, in any case remain applicable, the result being that, in reality, weapons exportation would not vary substantially.</p>
<p class="contents">The matter of the possible lifting of the embargo has, in recent months, been discussed in the European Union but consensus has not been reached on whether this revision is appropriate. The European Union acknowledges that, between 1989 and today, the political situation in China has evolved significantly and that important changes have taken place in the European Union's relations with China, including the quality of political dialogue. Indeed, with the establishment of the EU-China Dialogue on Human Rights, an important vehicle has been created in which both sides can exchange opinions and develop projects aimed at fostering tangible improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, and the Chinese are placing particular emphasis on this, the Chinese Government underwent a complete change at the Party Congress held last year and today's leaders declare that they had nothing to do with the events of Tiananmen Square. Nevertheless, from the standpoint of the European Union, whose public opinion still vividly recalls the events in Tiananmen Square, the issue is considered highly sensitive since serious problems relating to respect for human rights persist in China. Indeed, economic liberalisation and the country's gradual integration into the international community are not being accompanied by similar political liberalisation and China still has a long way to go before reaching the human rights standards considered normal in our societies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union's policy on the matter is under intense scrutiny and non-governmental organisations and public opinion expect tangible results. Moreover, it should also be pointed out that Beijing has rejected the idea of making the lifting of the embargo dependent on tangible progress in human rights. In any case, the necessary conditions for lifting the embargo are not yet in place in the European Union: this was clearly explained to our Chinese counterpart during the recent European Union-China Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, moreover, clear that there are differing positions within the European Union on the subject and, in particular, on the stance to be taken in the face of repeated requests from the Chinese. The matter will therefore have to be further discussed in depth in the future. Decisive impetus has been supplied in this regard by the European Council of 12 December 2003, which called on the General Affairs and External Relations Council to review the question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would add some additional remarks even though it is obviously not an issue on which the Commission takes a lead, given the way in which the CFSP is operating. Nevertheless, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China recently said during his meeting in Harvard in the US that China's reform and opening-up aims at promoting human rights. The two are mutually dependent and reinforcing.</p>
<p class="contents">This is encouraging language showing that they present human rights in a context which is linked to their general orientation of where they want to go and they do it on their own initiative. But we should not jump to conclusions and the reality on the ground is the real yardstick in measuring progress, also in an area like this.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen some real change but also there is still good reason for keeping up a systematically organised dialogue with China on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been systematically doing this through the years. The issue here of course is that a number of Member States are favourably disposed towards considering a lifting of the arms embargo and have also made that position public. These Member States believe that there is no longer a technical need for the embargo as arms sales to China are already covered by the EU’s 1998 Code of Conduct, or that the issue should be considered in the overall context of our relations. Other Member States believe that lifting the embargo is premature. They underscore the need for further progress in human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week’s European Council referred the issue to the first General Affairs and External Relations Council under the Irish presidency. The Commission fully supports an in-depth political discussion of this matter. Developing a clear EU line on this question at the highest level is important.</p>
<p class="contents">Factually speaking, lifting the embargo would have few practical implications for European arms exports to China, since the 1998 EU Code of Conduct prohibits arms exports to countries which have not forgone using arms for internal repression or aggressively against another country. It is in fact the Code of Conduct which applies in this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, and given the high political and symbolic value of the whole matter, any consideration of this should include an updated political assessment of how far things have moved on the human rights front since 1989. We are naturally interested in Parliament's views on that question so the Commission welcomes the discussion here today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that the Council representative made it clear that the Council currently maintains the line that the arms embargo must be retained. You described the situation, Commissioner, but I urge you to be cautious. The 1989 European Council was right to impose the arms embargo after the peace demonstrations in Tiananmen Square were put down in such a bloody fashion. Commissioner, we too believe that there have been improvements in the human rights situation in China since then, but they have not been sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Only recently, on 13 October, the Council reconsidered the situation in China and, just as Parliament had done in the same month, noted that the current human rights situation in China, as regards fundamental civil, cultural and political freedoms did not meet even the international standards recognised by China. That being so, although we want progress in China, we should wait before it is achieved, and so it would send completely the wrong message if the embargo were to be lifted at the present time. On the contrary, we should be telling our Chinese friends that they need to make perceptible progress where human rights in China are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a second reason why we should do this. You will be aware that presidential elections are to be held in Taiwan on 20 March next year, and the People’s Republic of China has, over recent weeks, been adopting a positively hostile stance towards Taiwan. As long ago as 23 October, this House stated its view that China should withdraw the rockets it had stationed in the coastal provinces opposite Taiwan and should commence peaceful dialogue across the Strait of Taiwan, which amounts to a flash point. That is the second reason why lifting the arms embargo makes no sense whatever.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that we will not now send the wrong message, even if only by editing what we say, in the belief that we can lift the arms embargo because everything is laid down in the code of conduct. On the contrary, I believe that the tensions and the human rights situation, which is still unsatisfactory, mean that we have to maintain it.</p>

<p class="contents">I should like to add a couple of things, however. Everyone who has had the opportunity to visit China on several occasions over the past ten years – as I myself have done – will know that a tremendous economic dynamic is discernible there, with substantial regional differences, and with what could almost be described as rigid capitalism at internal level, which gives rise to numerous major social problems. A society developing in this way also needs a political system capable of handling this. There is clearly an enormous tension between that economic freedom on the one hand, which leaves insufficient room for shaping at the social level by the social players such as the trade unions and others; and the political level on the other, which leaves no room for political democracy. We are, of course, all watching that whole process with bated breath. China is no small player. It is large and powerful both in economic terms and in terms of population size.</p>
<p class="contents">When trying to look at that region from a geopolitical point of view, therefore, do not just look at it in relation to Taiwan. Naturally, that is one point, but much broader factors affect that region. China naturally wants to become a global player, little by little. It is trying to launch a charm offensive: after all, it knows fine well that a great many people are intimidated by its enormous economic power, and it is trying, as it were, to be a positive player at global level. In order to do so, it must effectively make more room for democracy and respect for human rights in its own country. It is not yet managing to control that tension very well, and some do not even want to control it or are themselves engaging in something that we do not think possible, which is having freedom on the one hand and a lack of political freedom on the other. Nevertheless, we, Europe, have an enormous amount to gain from helping China take on this new role.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, all fellow Members are rightly saying ‘no lifting of the arms embargo’: that gives out the wrong signal. At the same time, however, ladies and gentlemen, let us put it in a wider perspective and make clear that we genuinely desire that in-depth dialogue with China – that goes for the Council, too – and that we also want to help with that process. It is fundamental that China assume a role in the world and that that role is compatible with the international legal order. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The lack of respect for human rights is, for me, the main reason why we should not here and now remove the European embargo on the sale of weapons to China. Last weekend, the Council agreed that consideration should be given to whether the embargo should be removed. We do not believe the time is ripe. It is of course true that there has been progress in China since the massacre in Tianamen Square in 1989, and it is also a fact that the political dialogue between the EU and China has improved, but there is still cause for considerable concern about the Chinese lack of understanding of human rights and of the state governed by law. We know that there are violations of fundamental freedoms, that torture and arbitrary imprisonments take place, that the Chinese authorities do not respect minorities and that many executions occur – more than in any other country in the world. We also know that China has deployed rockets pointing over the straits towards democratic Taiwan and that there is now increased tension across the Straits of Taiwan.</p>
<p class="contents">Are we to close our eyes to the fact that a dictatorship – China – is threatening one of the foremost democracies in the Far East, namely Taiwan? When it comes to human rights and democracy, Taiwan is exemplary, while China gives every cause for alarm. Are we now to be involved in helping the Chinese to rearm? That, we believe, would be a really bad idea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The arms embargo is an instrument of political pressure, and what that means is that any response to the question as to what has changed in China must be political in nature. China still has Tibet under military occupation; it is still threatening Taiwan; it is still failing to respect human rights. There is no prospect of democracy there. You can do business with China – so go on doing it! Selling nuclear power stations to China makes no sense and is dangerous, but that is another issue, one that we will have to discuss with the German Federal Chancellor.</p>
<p class="contents">What I am getting at is that it would not only be wrong to express a desire to lift the arms embargo, but that it is also wrong to say at all that there is at present any question of doing so. To do so would mean that we would simply be telling the Chinese, ‘You are making a wonderful job of things. Carry on arresting people for speaking their minds; it doesn’t bother us a bit. We are prepared to do any kind of business with you!’</p>
<p class="contents">There is, secondly, another point, namely President Chirac and Chancellor Schröder – two Heads of Government whom I do support in certain political situations, such as over the war in Iraq. The terrible thought occurs to me: has a similar strategy been used to buy partnership with China? It is inconceivable that we should think it possible to buy Putin by saying nothing about Chechnya, and the Chinese by supplying them with weapons, just in order to have a common position on the Security Council. That would be terrible.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say, in conclusion, that President Chirac and Chancellor Schröder have said that they want the constitution, that they want to be Europeans, that they want simply to strengthen the European Parliament. But of course! Only if Parliament agrees to it can the Council lift the arms embargo, and this is meant to be done by means of a jointly agreed code of conduct. What this means is that the removal of the arms embargo is neither possible nor permissible without Parliament’s consent, and I rejoice that, at present, none of the political groups want that done. Terrific!</p>

Those millions of people are not aware of this, and neither, I expect, are those who elected the Schroeder government. It is a proposal which, indeed, should not even be on our agenda at all; I am glad to say that the decision does not have to be taken today, but it appears to be almost implied that it will have to be taken tomorrow or the day after.</p>
<p class="contents">Technical details and form aside, a decision such as this could only be taken by a Europe which has abandoned the promotion of democracy and the rule of law as points of reference in its international policy – and, therefore, in its security and defence policy – once and for all. The promotion of democracy and the rule of law are not points of reference for this Europe, they are not points of reference, most importantly, for the Europe which sets itself up as the Europe of peace, the Europe of Chancellor Schroeder, the Europe of Jacques Chirac; it is the Europe of shame over China, Russia and Chechnya – this is the Europe that can debate this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

China is a vast country with a trained and productive workforce, but it is not a democracy and remains essentially an authoritarian, one-party, Communist State – although Marxism plays little part in its political or economic thinking at present.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I welcome China's cooperation in the fight against international terrorism and its rapprochement with India, whose territory it still occupies, having traditionally been an ally of Pakistan, whose atom bomb it helped to build. China is also helping to put pressure on North Korea against that country's quest to build its own nuclear weapons. Nevertheless, I am critical of China's inhumane treatment of North Korean refugees, who are sent back to face torture or even execution.</p>
<p class="contents">Red China, however, remains a serious threat to Taiwan, which has been a model of democracy, prosperity and good governance. There is an irrational fear on the part of China of Taiwan wishing to pursue a course of self-determination and independence, perhaps because the model of pluralism and democracy is what is most unwelcome to the Communist Party bosses.</p>
<p class="contents">However, given China's attitude towards Taiwan, Tibet and its own dissenters – ranging from the peaceful practitioners of Falun Gong to the pro-democracy activists who were imprisoned so brutally after Tiananmen Square – I support maintaining the EU arms embargo. After all, the Taiwan Straits remain one of the world's most dangerous flashpoints and the USA is obliged to intervene to protect Taiwan militarily in the event of hostilities. Therefore, we do not want to do anything to further escalate the tensions in this region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swoboda (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, a debate on the removal of the arms embargo on China has a natural tendency to produce crudely-drawn arguments and discussions, and, as I believe that certain Members are over-simplifying matters, I will try to introduce a few nuances into the debate. Right at the very start, I would like to say that I regard the removal of the arms embargo as neither advisable nor wise. There is no doubt in my mind that I am opposed to it.</p>
<p class="contents">China, though, must be considered in a rather more subtle light than it has been from the standpoints we have adopted so far, and in this I am, for once, closer to Mr Tannock than to other Members who have spoken today. China is a large and – let us be frank about this – capitalist economic system with a single-party state clamped over it. It is trying to enable its people to have a share in the world’s growing prosperity, and the greatest danger lies in whether China will manage to maintain the political structure of a common state and to meet people’s social needs. The fact is that China’s biggest problem has to do not with arms but with increasing hunger and poverty in sections of its population. It certainly also has the major problem that it has in one country different cultures, languages and ethnic groups, and it has not so far succeeded – I might add that it is not alone in this – in giving these diverse cultures and ethnic groups the space that will alone make it possible to maintain the country’s political unity.</p>
<p class="contents">So, although China does not need our weapons, it does need our sympathy and support in what is a difficult process of development. I would not wish major responsibility in a problematic large state like China on anyone in this House. That is, I think, another reason why the resolution rather misses the mark by considering the Taiwan issue in what are admittedly the right terms – of China becoming a threat – but to the exclusion of all others. In one respect alone I am closer to President Bush than to Mr Cohn-Bendit, and that is in the belief that he is right to warn Taiwan, too, against taking ill-advised action. I am not talking about whether or not such actions might be justified, morally or otherwise. At times when crises are brewing, there are courses of action that may perhaps be justified from an objective and abstract point of view, but can nonetheless play a part in making hostilities or a crisis situation more likely.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not for this House to warn only one side against taking unilateral and perilous courses of action; rather, it should also urge the other side to be sensible and hold back, to endeavour to leave the way open to peaceful agreement. That, I believe, is the one important message that is, lamentably, absent from this resolution. Hence my conclusion that the answer to the removal of the arms embargo is ‘no’. China needs all the help and support we can give, but not where armaments are concerned. We should be urging both parties in this hotspot, China and Taiwan, to be cautious in the action they take, and reminding them that we live in times in which peaceful, rather than warlike solutions must be found. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU should therefore not sell weapons at all, especially not to countries that are in danger of using them in wars. Given that logic, we should not, in the first place, sell weapons to the United States, but not to China either. My ‘no’ to arms exports to China is not only directed against China, but is the expression of a general principle. Everything that has been said in this House about China is true, but there are also positive things. For example, a dialogue has been opened with representatives of the Dalai Lama, about which the Dalai Lama himself is very hopeful. Such a small step is obviously not enough to change the general picture. It would therefore be quite wrong to remove the arms embargo against China, but do not forget that there are also other countries to which we should not sell weapons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We are dealing here, unfortunately, with another Franco-German initiative, but not one that is intended to restore these two countries to their position as the engine of Europe in a positive sense; instead, where this issue – like others in the recent past – is concerned, it leads other Member States to suspect something that is more and more a Franco-German conspiracy rather than a Franco-German partnership. The manner in which Germany and France collaborate on this issue or on the Stability Pact is not, in fact, one that I regard as desirable, and it is unfortunate that, in recent times, we increasingly see these two countries acting in what is a very egotistical fashion, even though they are actually meant to be taking seriously their responsibilities to Europe as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">It has already been said – and this is where I agree with Mr Swoboda – that we have to take a very nuanced view of China. I was back there again only recently, and when, on the one hand, you see the economic developments, which are very dynamic, and, on the other, the willingness – behind the closed doors of conferences at any rate, but also more openly – to discuss every issue with great frankness, then it becomes apparent that people in China are thinking. The situation there is not set in stone; instead, particularly in the political sphere, the leadership is already endeavouring to give some thought to how, on the one hand, to maintain the country’s stability – and that is a legitimate objective – and also, on the other, to how the dynamism that is present in the economic sphere can also find a political expression, for it is in politics that little progress has as yet been made. Nor is the time yet ripe for anything to be removed, as what caused the arms embargo to be imposed has not yet gone away. We have not forgotten Tiananmen Square, nor has there been any change in the political framework conditions that led to it.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also been said, on the other hand, that Taiwan is under threat – a country that is actually, from the point of view of the One China policy, itself Chinese territory. How can one threaten one’s own territory with rockets like these? That is something to which China ought perhaps to give some thought. In any case, it is not Taiwan that represents a threat to China; rather, the reverse is the case. Both these considerations – human rights and the threat to Taiwan – should cause the Council to pause for a moment before even considering removing the arms embargo. To do so would send completely the wrong message. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Chancellor Schröder wanted to curry favour with the Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao. In the hope of improving the climate for exports, he rashly added his voice to those calling for an end to the embargo, thereby pressing amateurishly ahead without consulting with other states. On this I am in absolute agreement with Mr Cohn-Bendit. He is not so much Confucius as confused!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Back in 1989, the embargo was a response to the savagery with which the democracy movement was put down; today, it is among the most important instruments bringing political pressure to bear in favour of change in the People’s Republic of China. Those who think in merely economic terms are blind in one eye. I can tell Mr Swoboda that Amnesty International is talking in terms of 1 500 executions carried out every year, with hundreds of thousands of people in jail, maltreated, tortured, and waiting in vain for a fair trial. Conditions for the Tibetans, Mongols and other minorities remain intolerable and our keeping quiet about them will do nothing to improve matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1999, I have been chairman of the European Parliament’s Tibet Intergroup. All those who have addressed us, and all those of our guests who know China well, leave us in no doubt that, where human rights are concerned, there has been hardly any progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also thinking of Taiwan. For weeks, Peking has been threatening a military attack in the event of Taiwan deciding to hold a referendum on formal independence.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the initiative taken by the Commission in scrutinising the planned sale of a German nuclear power station to China.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The export of usable goods is subject to the European Union’s approval; I am glad to see Mr Cohn-Bendit agreeing with me on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Two things are necessary: one is that the Member States should maintain their restrictions on arms sales, and the other is that we should get to grips with the actual facts about the People’s Republic of China – at national level, at Community level and, it is to be hoped, eventually in early 2004, at the international level at the Human Rights Convention in Geneva.</p>

It seems that it is the French and German Governments that are the main supporters of lifting the arms embargo on China, as well as the controls on exports of dual-use nuclear technology. Given their track record over the past year, there are grounds for suspicion of any foreign policy initiatives that originate from these governments.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it very worrying that in certain areas France and Germany seem to prefer the idea of a strategic partnership with countries such as China, rather than the United States. I am thinking of proposals relating to the Galileo project which have military implications.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is it that the European Council has decided at this time that there is any reason to re-examine the EU's arms embargo against China? What particular positive developments in China have prompted this action? Of course we all want to see improved relations with China, but not at the expense of our own security. China still has a long way to go in introducing democracy and respect for human rights and convincing us that it wishes to be a peaceable partner in the international community.</p>

The Vice-President at the time, Mr David Martin, undertook to inquire and refer the matter to you, but since you are now in the chair I shall ask you directly.</p>
<p class="contents">It is becoming increasingly the case that although a time is set for the vote, it is delayed day after day. It seems unreasonable and incompetent to expect people to be here on time and then not to operate. Although today it is only seven minutes over, we had no previous business to delay us! Even if we have previous business, surely voting, which is so important in this House, should always take place punctually, with absolutely no leeway whatsoever. Everything else should be subjugated to it. I would ask you to look at this matter urgently.</p>
