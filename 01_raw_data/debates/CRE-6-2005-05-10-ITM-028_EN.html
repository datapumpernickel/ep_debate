<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">María Esther Herranz García (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I am extremely pleased with the draft report to be put to the vote tomorrow in this Parliament, because it takes up — with some amendments, it is true — each and every measure I proposed in the initial draft.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the broad support achieved in the Committee on Agricultural and Rural Development, I hope that this report will now receive the support of the immense majority of Members of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has presented an amendment to the report urging the European Commission to present a legislative proposal as soon as possible. The announcement by Commissioner Fischer Boel, who is here with us, that the reform of the sector would be postponed has caused great malaise amongst producers, a malaise which I would like this European Parliament to reflect.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner’s announcement is a symptom of the lack of importance attached to such a significant sector as fruits and vegetables, and I would remind you once again that the fruit and vegetables sector represents 17% of the European Union's final agricultural production, a fact that the Commission has apparently not taken into account at this crucial time when the financial perspectives are being negotiated for a period of seven years.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Commission's attitude leaves much to be desired and if I have understood the messages communicated recently by the Commissioner properly, the Community executive may include the reform as a section of a general proposal for the implementation of a single common organisation of the market for all agricultural products. I believe that, if we do this, we will not be mixing like with like, since, until now, the fruit and vegetables sector has been given special treatment, which generally speaking has been positive, although it is occasionally necessary to introduce important changes.</p>
<p class="contents">Producers of fruits and vegetables originally experienced a degree of frustration as a result of being considered as a separate sector, with no right to direct aid. Today, however, the special system, based on the existence of operational funds, co-funded by the growers, has provided them with a means for better adapting their production to the needs of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the system has certain failings — which system does not? — and although it needs certain modifications aimed, in particular, at increasing the competitiveness of producers, it would be a mistake to include fruits and vegetables amongst all the other agricultural sectors. This would mean dismantling the whole philosophy upon which the progress made so far in the sector has been based.</p>
<p class="contents">I would insist that I wish to reflect the discontent communicated to me by certain professional organisations at the postponement of these legislative proposals. It is urgent that we carry out a reform in order to introduce new mechanisms, mechanisms for managing the market in order to deal with the difficulties being faced by certain parts of the sector and which will be accentuated following the negotiations in the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">A swift system for dealing with crises, controlled by the producers’ organisations, would enhance their role as managers of the market, which furthermore should serve as a draw for individual producers which have not so far found it beneficial to join these groupings. 60% of these producers do not belong to these groupings.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft report that I have presented to the European Parliament in fact proposes an alternative to the crisis management system in force, which would consist of the introduction of so-called ‘safety funds’, managed by the groupings themselves, intended to finance withdrawals at times of serious crisis, reductions of production in the event of market saturation, and also the implementation of a system of insurance for incomes. If properly organised, this ‘box’ should become the instrument that the producers’ organisations currently lack for dealing with the ups and downs of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also contains certain measures which are urgently required in order to respond to certain problematic situations, such as, for example, low membership of associations in the new Member States, and it also provides responses to the particular problem of soft fruits, for which a whole series of measures are proposed with a view to improving both a system for fresh fruits and vegetables and the system for processed fruits and vegetables, without forgetting the need to extend the campaigns promoting production, placing emphasis on Community origin.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission communication on the common market organisation in fruit and vegetables had three aims. The first was to describe how the Commission had started the simplification process; the second, to present a Commission working document analysing the principal figures of the sector, the implementation of the producer organisations and the related operational funds and budgetary aspects; and the third, to stimulate a debate in the Council, the European Parliament and within the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the content of your report, let me begin with the role of the producer organisations. They are and will continue to be the key element in the common market organisation. I welcome your suggestions aimed at strengthening their role in the management of markets and the concentration of supply, notably concerning mergers, transnational producer organisations and specific measures focusing on the new Member States. We should also consider the possibility of introducing new products and new categories of producer organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to crisis management, I should like to draw your attention to the communication on risk and crisis management in agriculture of February 2005. In addition to the horizontal measures for crisis management proposed in this context, we will evaluate the need to provide specific tools in the fruit and vegetable sector. We will specially consider the proposal for creating mutual funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning processed products, the Dutch presidency conclusions stated that the Commission should carry out an impact analysis. That was to include a possible shift from the current regimes to an approach based on objectives and instruments already used in the CAP reform. The Commission will, therefore, wait for the outcome of the impact analysis before proposing any alternative for processed products.</p>
<p class="contents">Following enlargement of the European Union, the Community is studying the situation concerning red fruits. Once the studies are finished, we will consider the appropriate measures, both in the framework of the common market organisation and vis-à-vis imports from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with you about the necessity of promoting fruit and vegetable consumption, taking into account the positive effects on public health. I would also like to mention our horizontal instruments in the CAP for promoting these products. The fruit and vegetable sector is one which has benefited from this.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the increase in imports of fruit and vegetables from third countries, as WTO members, we cannot adopt measures inconsistent with our international obligations. The most effective way to respond to market signals is to focus on quality. We will carefully consider the possibility of introducing special labels of origin for processed products made exclusively from European raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard the compatibility of rural development instruments and the CMO operational funds, I can assure you that we will provide for measures which allow producers to benefit from both instruments, but avoid the possibility of double financing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I also welcome her remarks with regard to good impact studies into the fruit and vegetable sector in order to be able to choose a sound approach which will enable us to work in a more market-oriented manner, and also her remarks with regard to the requirement that it should be possible to label products from Europe effectively so that there is no doubt as to their origin. That, in itself, is a sound approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also add a small critical note, because impact studies lead me to the conclusion that, in Europe, certainly after the EU’s enlargement, it has become more difficult for European fruit and vegetable growers – who generally work without subsides and in a market-oriented manner – to keep their heads above water. The extensive concentration on the demand side in the form of supermarkets is not backed by reinforced producer organisations in the sector itself. If the sector wishes to survive in Europe, it has to be able to work under the conditions that apply to import products. Labelling is crucial in this respect, and the Commission should devote more attention to this aspect in future plans.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is no denying that a huge number of growers in the ten new Member States have problems integrating in the European market. It is vital that this problem be addressed more forcefully by setting up producer organisations and by ensuring that the growers in the new countries are also able to gain a foothold in the market compared to huge supermarket chains.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, if there is less bureaucracy, it is more likely that the money for these funds will be spent wisely. It is unacceptable that, as is at present the case, 25% of the money should go unspent. It is crucial that the Commission should look into this without delay in order to ensure that the money can be spent as yet. If it cannot be channelled directly to producer organisations, then the budget that is left over, in the light of major frost damage in large parts of Europe and other natural disasters, including drought, can still be spent in the sector in order to ensure that it survives these difficult times. In any event, I should like to thank the rapporteur and the Commissioner for a reasonably constructive attitude. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Here are our responses, the responses agreed by Parliament and by the parties in question. We now hope that they will be taken into account both in terms of time and in terms of substance. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind the Commission that the report calls clearly for a legislative proposal to be presented before this summer with a view to enhancing and improving the role of producers’ organisations fundamentally in the management of the market; the future of this sector lies in the market, and the market is the future. We must not forget that the fruit and vegetables sector is dynamic, but at the same time very fragile, and there is great instability in the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, we want a reform that takes account both of Parliament's report and of the demands of farmers themselves and, above all, that it be maintained and serve to improve agricultural income.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are following the Doha Round negotiations very closely, with a view to introducing these agricultural products as sensitive products. Furthermore, it appears that the Commissioner has put forward the idea of replacing numerous COMs with a single COM or a single legal text. It goes without saying that we disagree with this, given the risk this decision poses to the sector, and given the insecurity that this announcement alone has created right away.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by thanking the rapporteur for her willingness to reach this consensus, not just in the committee, but also here in Parliament, and I hope that the Commission will show goodwill in terms of the future, since that is what the sector is impatiently awaiting.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It accounts for 17% of agricultural products and only receives 4% of agricultural resources. At the same time, it employs a sizeable section of the agricultural and manual workforce.</p>
<p class="contents">We already have the draft proposal to revise the common market organisation from the Commission which, I think, benefits processors, but not small and medium-sized farms. However, I think that today's proposals do not help either; they do not improve the situation, given that the assessments contradict what is being proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the decoupling of aid from production for fruit and vegetables is being proposed, while agreement is being expressed with the mid-term review of the CAP, the core of which is the decoupling of aid from production.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, agreement is being expressed with the WTO and, at the same time, it is being proposed that fruit and vegetables be kept out of WTO negotiations. Producer groups are being extolled but, at the same time, it is estimated that they do not function well, it having been found that only 40% of production passes through them and that they only take up 25% of resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, I would say, the fact is being concealed that producer groups function as intermediaries between farmers and wholesalers and industry, giving the latter benefits such as cheap raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor is the proposal for a cofinanced fund a solution, given that farmers will be left to pick up the bill for the various crises and the repercussions from the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">On balance, we believe that both the review of the CAP and the negotiations with the WTO will be at the expense of the income of small and medium-sized fruit and vegetable farms, while wholesalers and industry will benefit, securing fruit and vegetables at even lower prices and reaping huge profits. That is why it is unfair and we cannot vote for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Poland has 450 000 farms producing red fruit. Last year, red fruit imports from Asia caused a disaster. Prices fell to a point where fruit was no longer even picked. Another year like that will spell the end for 200 000 farms. At five persons a family, that will mean a million people with no income this autumn: an unjustifiable social disaster. A farmer who loses his land and therefore his work also loses his home because he sells the land on which his house is built. He also loses his roots because he has to move far away to the town to look for work. However, there are no jobs to be had in the towns in Poland. Officially, 20% of the population are unemployed. Driven from their homes by an irresponsible economic policy, the sad truth is that farmers are highly likely to turn to crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Another consequence will be massive emigration to the west and a realisation that the idea that the European Union was based on the principle of Community preference was a colossal lie. If you want the Poles to reject the European Constitution, carry on importing red fruit from Asia, but have the honesty to tell the Polish farmers that no one is interested in their fate. At least that will be clear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Polish farmers have voiced objections to production quotas, and complained that they are finding it difficult to sell their products. In the limited time available to me, I should like to touch upon an issue which may be minor, but is nevertheless of great importance. Fruit and vegetables in the EU are over-priced. In addition, fruit is overripe and tasteless. We should improve the quality of our products and ensure that there continues to be a rich diversity of varieties, especially as far as seasonal fruit is concerned. In Poland it is still possible to buy extremely flavoursome varieties of apple that I have never seen, and undoubtedly never will see, in Brussels. I only ever eat tomatoes and cucumbers in Poland, because they lack any taste in the old EU. We should offer cheaper and fresher fruit and vegetables to our citizens, whilst ensuring that fruit and vegetable growers are paid a decent wage. We should not allow the abundance of local fruit varieties to be diminished. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although we have already spent a year working together, we have unfortunately not succeeded in putting right the mistakes made during the negotiations on the accession of the new Member States. We all appreciate that decisions require time and thought, but we are also aware of a great many urgent matters that will brook no delay.</p>
<p class="contents">One such matter is the much-needed regulation of the fruit and vegetable market. It is a matter of great importance to the new Member States that protective measures are put in place on the markets for soft fruit and apples. European producers are facing enormous problems and suffering tragic consequences as a result of the influx of soft fruit such as strawberries, currants, raspberries and cherries, from China, Morocco and Serbia. Polish producers and processors have been particularly hard hit, as Poland produces around 50% of all soft fruit in the European Union, as well as being a major apple producer. Following a number of interventions on the matter by myself and other Members, I am delighted that the President of Parliament and Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture have turned their attention to this issue, with the latter having taken a very professional approach to the problem. The end result of this has been that the Commission has also taken the matter seriously, and has sent a delegation to Poland to carry out on-the-spot investigations. I hope this delegation will complete its work before the fruit-buying season starts, and that we will manage to provide the necessary assistance and take the necessary measures before it is too late.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the report Mrs Herranz García has presented to the House merits particular attention, and the Commission should therefore draw the right conclusions from it and get down to work without delay. If we were to put off dealing with this problem, we would merely be running away from much-needed solutions and making matters even worse for many farmers and European producers, as well as giving rise to misunderstanding and disquiet among the public. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If this statement or intention of yours is true, then I believe that you are consciously leaving the CMO in fruit and vegetables out of the revised common agricultural policy and exposing these products and producers to numerous financial and international risks.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mrs Garcia, whom I have to congratulate, constitutes a correct basis for you to submit your proposals by the autumn at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also emphasise certain particularly important issues, such as:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Commission must immediately propose realistic proposals for producer groups within the framework of a simplified system and regime, so that they include the characteristics of each region and there is balanced use of the resources available in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is room to improve the threshold system for processed products, although any changes here must not affect the existing balances between the Member States. I believe, Commissioner, that your proposals for fruit and vegetables will not be confined solely to making arrangements for or changes to processed products.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, special attention must be paid within the framework of your international negotiations. Low outside protection for fruit and vegetables already needs to be taken into account under the special arrangements for which provision is made for sensitive products and when regulating a methodology for <span class="italic">ad valorem</span> equivalents for duties.</p>
<p class="contents">The CMO in fruit and vegetables, with the operational programmes, the existence of a fund and the mandatory formation of producer groups, constitutes an operating standard for the markets in agricultural products. Do not disappoint the producers who have made sacrifices in order to adjust and adapt to this model.</p>

Never in the field of vegetable and fruit cultivation has so much been said to so little purpose. However, I would draw Members’ attention to paragraph 46, which reminds the Commission that imports from third countries do not always provide the levels of safety and quality that the European consumer has grown accustomed to: hence the need to guarantee that third country products meet the same safety and quality requirements as European Union products. Roughly translated that means that non-EU countries can produce their goods cheaper, and this must be stopped at all costs. That is crude protectionism and seeks to preserve the EU fruit and vegetable market as a cocooned environment, controlled by suffocating bureaucracy which outside competition must never be allowed to penetrate.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is regulations that Mrs Herranz García wants, even on pot herbs and parsley! Rhubarb gets a mention as well, but I shall resist the obvious joke, except to say that unlike the EU, the industry does not want to talk rhubarb, it only wants to grow it!</p>

<p class="contents">I hope that you will communicate to the Commission the clear and firm message that this Parliament is against the postponement of the reform of the fruit and vegetables sector, announced by yourself a short time ago.</p>
<p class="contents">The fruit and vegetables sector is active in practically every country of the European Union and it suffers from the same problems everywhere. The current COM has proven to be effective, but it needs to be improved and a new system must be introduced that is more effective at managing crises and specific measures must be implemented for products that are subject to strong import pressures. That is not protectionism.</p>
<p class="contents">I am from Castilla-La Mancha, which is a great garlic-producing region. Garlic is an example of a product that has to deal with ferocious imports, mainly from China, which threaten the survival of many farms.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that the report takes up measures in favour of this category of products and at the same time advocates a simplification of the import system in force, in order to prevent the irregularities we are witnessing as a result of the existence of three different formulae that operators may employ, as they wish, thus promoting fraudulent practices about which the sector has on occasions complained to the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with the raft of proposals included in the report to improve the competitiveness of the sector and to take the best possible advantage of the budget available, which is underused year after year as a result of the lack of flexibility of the current COM.</p>
<p class="contents">The failings of the system, such as a large amount of bureaucracy, the legal insecurity of the producers’ associations and the Community's lack of generosity in terms of incentivising the concentration of supply, are the main reasons why the system implemented in 1996 has become inefficient.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that funds are not being used properly, and I hope that this problem will be resolved by means of the new proposal.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this sector, it is especially important that producers act jointly, as it is an essential condition for market success, but it requires the development of organised cooperation. However, the degree of organisation is very low in the ten new Member States, and forming producer organisations (hereafter PO’s) is a long and tedious process.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore vital to support PO subsidy, and especially to encourage the formation of PO’s and provide additional support for newly-formed PO’s. For this reason it would be necessary to increase the current ceiling of contributions in proportion to sales revenue from 4.1% to 6%. It is of crucial importance to coordinate market measures (first pillar) with rural development (second pillar). The European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund allocations would not sufficiently finance infrastructure and investment development, therefore, rural development funding should be made available to PO’s.</p>
<p class="contents">The fruit and vegetable sector in the new Member States requires restructuring. There are many old orchards, especially apple orchards, which have an impact on the EU market by driving the prices down as a result of poor quality produce, creating a crisis situation on the European fruit and vegetable market. Therefore, it is important that the EU gives support to clear and restructure old plantations. Just like the case of the school milk programme, subsidised by EU funds, a scheme promoting fruit consumption in schools should be introduced in order to stabilise the fruit and vegetable market.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many strategically important products that are not able to receive market support within today’s framework. In the case of berries, sour cherry and mushrooms, stronger crisis management measures are warranted. They need to be included among processed products, and we must also appeal for the protection of sweet corn against Chinese imports. I thank Commissioner Boel for her letter, and I hope a solution has been found. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU studies of the candidate countries in its annual reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet although the Commission noted in its studies that the EU would gain as many as 19 new varieties of fruit and vegetables with the accession of the new Member States, and that this would increase the EU’s self-sufficiency in food and please consumers, no changes were made to the organisation of the market on the basis of these facts. This means that we are faced with a bizarre situation whereby a special support mechanism exists for a variety of plum, whilst nothing of the sort exists for apples, despite the fact that the latter account for 32% of all fruit picked, which makes them the most popular type of fruit. Support mechanisms are in place for nuts and bananas, but there is not a single one for any of the huge variety of soft fruits, which by their very nature have an extremely short shelf life, and are therefore subject to price fluctuations.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to remind the Commissioner that yet another season is passing us by without any sensible solutions having been found. The policy applied to the 15 old Member States remains more advantageous than that applied to the 10 new Member States, and it would appear that the Commission is merely pretending to take action, rather than coming up with practical solutions. In a bid to win time, a special team of inspectors has been sent to Poland. This is an unfortunate game to play in view of the urgent need to stabilise the fruit and vegetable market and to secure the existence of thousands of producers and their families, in particular in the new Member States. What is more, it is a risky game to play in view of the fact that consumers are the ones who have to suffer the effects of price fluctuations, and put up with poor-quality fruit that has had to be imported from third countries and poses a health risk. There is, however, a very simple solution. The new Member States can provide a guaranteed supply of high-quality soft fruit and apples. Supporting the former should therefore be made a matter of priority, <span class="italic">inter alia</span> by placing restrictions on imports, unless, of course, people wish to take an entirely different approach to European solidarity, and use the common agricultural policy to cover additional quotas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I congratulate the rapporteur on having confronted the difficulties in this sector and for having put forward some suitable solutions. I am sure that the Commissioner will take the concerns expressed by Parliament into consideration. The fact that the amendment that I tabled for introducing labels of origin for processed products has been accepted is a step forwards. Indeed, it is not only the textile industry that is suffering from Asian competition: the origin of processed agricultural products needs to be made transparent so that consumers can find out from the label where the products they buy come from. This proposal is particularly important for the processed tomato sector, which is a leading sector of the Italian economy in terms of both domestic production and exports.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2004, a large proportion of the tomatoes in our fields were left unharvested: the huge amounts of processed tomatoes arriving from China at rock-bottom prices and without any health guarantees have thrown the sector into crisis. Chinese preserves are reprocessed in Italy, often mixed with Italian products and then resold as if made in Italy, so that the consumer cannot recognise their true origin. Labelling will be an essential guarantee of quality and transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Committee on Agriculture adopted the proposal on the need for immediate reform to address the recurrent market crises in the fresh fruit sector. Several parties are calling for reform to strike a balance between supply and demand and to manage surpluses. I hope the Commissioner will consider the need to shorten the time frame: the two-year period she has mentioned is too long.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by recalling that the fruit and vegetable sector is heavily penalised compared with other areas of agriculture: it receives only 4% of Community resources and requires cofinancing contributions that are too onerous for producers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to stress the importance of revising the common market organisation (CMO) in fruit and vegetables as soon as possible, as the European Commission promised to do in its communication of 10 August last. There is in fact a consensus for keeping the common market organisation in its present form. It is not therefore necessary to overhaul it completely. However, the crises that occurred during the last marketing years, in south-west France for example, showed the urgent need to adapt the CMO mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">In the matter of crisis management, first of all, we need to be able to respond quickly and effectively to overproduction crises. A surplus of 5 to 10% in supply brings a 30 to 50% slump in prices. It seems to me, therefore, that the ceiling for authorised withdrawals should be raised to 20% of production.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as the budget is concerned, I would point out that producers are making great efforts. They produce 15% of the value of European agricultural output but receive only 3.5% of aids. For my part, I believe the budget made available to producer organisations must be increased from 4.1% to 6% of the value of production marketed.</p>
<p class="contents">The quality of local produce is essential and it must be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, regarding the relationship between producers and the distribution sector, I propose that the European Union should encourage the joint trade organisations recognised in each Member State to devise codes of good conduct to avoid sudden collapses in prices paid to producers.</p>
<p class="contents">I will close on the external dimension of this matter, which is crucial. It is essential that the level of market opening should be controlled and regulated: Community preference must be maintained, fruit and vegetables must be included in the list of sensitive products and there must be reciprocity in the opening of agricultural trade, including plant health aspects; these, finally, must be the European Union’s demands at the Hong Kong ministerial meeting in December 2005 and in bilateral trade agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the past, intervention by way of market withdrawals failed to improve the sector’s stability, and so, in 1996, the reform of the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables introduced a new instrument in the shape of what was termed the operational funds, thus transferring resources from intervention to a modern and forward-looking instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now for us to come up with progressive instruments for the fruit and vegetables sector. We cannot work on the basis of a ‘return to old-style intervention’, still less to developing and extending it, or of a crisis management system existing to deal only with crises in the market. As I understand it, a modern crisis management system should also bear the brunt of crises brought on by the weather, for example, by supporting multi-risk insurance. This is something we should think about.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not enough, where processed products are concerned, simply to plead the cause of production thresholds, which are antiquated and obsolete, and of processing aid. Why do we not also give thought to decoupling aid in the fruit and vegetable processing sector? Now that decoupling characterises the whole of the reform of the common agricultural policy, it ought also, for the sake of consistency, to apply here.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has decided to proceed with the simplification of the common organisation of the market in fresh fruit and vegetables and with the revision of the COM in processed fruit and vegetables, both in 2006. As regards fresh fruit and vegetables, the requirements of a modern market organisation are, today, largely met. I am persuaded that the common organisation of the market in processed fruit and vegetables is in need of fundamental reform. More good approaches are required. Here in Europe, there is a need for a fundamental debate on this, and a market-oriented sector needs indications as to the way it should go in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are very few producer organisations in the new Member States, with the figure in Poland currently standing at around 1.5% of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Member States should receive more assistance to ensure producer groups that have been provisionally recognised remain in existence and are properly managed. There is also a need for specific financial support instruments. Furthermore, permission should be granted for the setting up of organisations of various groups of producers, such as producers of fruit for processing or of vegetables for processing. At this point, it should also be pointed out that a characteristic feature of the soft fruit market is its high price sensitivity, due to fluctuations in production and the growing volume of imports from non-EU third countries. Uncontrolled imports mean that European farmers, including Polish soft fruit producers, are currently facing disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">What are needed are measures to ensure long-term stability in this market. These should include an increase in the number of checks carried out on imported goods, which would also prevent any influx of low-quality products into the EU. The issuing of certificates of origin should form a mandatory part of these inspections, and the Commission should consider introducing import quotas for these sensitive products. All that the Commission is proposing, however, is to carry out studies and to take other measures that it has not explained in any detail. In other words, it is proposing to sit back and wait. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As an MEP from Poland, a new Member State, both I and many of my colleagues have been taken aback by the sudden change that has become apparent in the EU’s overall approach to the economy, and in particular to agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">Before we joined the EU, we regarded it as a closed structure and a closed market, to which we could only gain access with great difficulty. Now that we are in the EU, we hear of nothing but liberalisation. We are supposed to liberalise our markets in fruit and vegetables, sugar and milk and everything else under the sun, and open them up to the rest of the world. We joined a different EU to the one we are in now. Poland produces half of all soft fruit in the EU, including cherries, currants and raspberries, and Polish Members of this House have called on the Commission on several occasions and via a number of channels to put protective measures in place for the soft fruit market. Each and every time we were told that this would not happen, because the market needed to be liberalised, and that we must open up our market in order to show solidarity with poor countries wishing to export goods onto our markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Solidarity is a fine word, and we Poles are particularly aware of its value. Yet solidarity must not mean inflicting other people’s poverty upon us. We cannot allow our farmers to go bankrupt and fall into poverty so that other people can sell their products in the EU. A particularly good reason why this must not be allowed is that there are serious concerns that liberalisation is of greater benefit to speculators than to farmers from poor countries. I continue to believe that it would be a good idea to put protective measures in place and to impose restrictions on imports of fruit onto the EU market. I support Mrs Herranz García’s report in full, and I very much appreciate the work she has put into drafting it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have listened carefully and I can assure you that the Commission will analyse this final report very closely before presenting proposals for the fruit and vegetable sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency’s conclusions of November 2004 recognised that the path undertaken with the 1996 reform should be continued in the fresh fruit sector also. However, the Commission was also asked to carry out an impact analysis on all aspects of processed fruit and citrus. That analysis will be available at the beginning of 2006. For the sake of coherence, the Commission decided to present a global proposal covering both fresh and processed fruits.</p>
<p class="contents">On crisis management, in the framework of the communication on risk and crisis management in agriculture, as well as the horizontal options identified in this context, the Commission considers that specific needs should be looked at on a case-by-case basis in the context of the CMO reviews, even for the fruit and vegetable sector. Accordingly, the Commission will consider carefully the creation of a mutual stabilisation fund based on public and private co-financing.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to soft fruit, the Council has also requested that the Commission carry out the appropriate analysis of the new situation in the European market resulting from enlargement and, if necessary, bring forward proposals specifically to address these issues. The Commission has already started the analysis of the soft fruit sector in the new Member States. Officials from the agriculture and trade directorates have just come back from a visit to Poland. When this study is finished, we will analyse the results and, if necessary, appropriate measures will be taken in due course.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the WTO, we cannot adopt protectionist measures considered obstacles to imports. The most effective and efficient way to respond to market signals is to focus on the quality of our products and improve the competitiveness of our sector. We could do that using two different tools. As I have already said, one involves strengthening producers’ organisations, so that we prevent producers from competing against one another; and the second, the possibility of strengthening our promotional initiatives, which could be helpful.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you raised the issue of the import of fruit and vegetables from third countries, in particular red fruits. Third country imports have to meet the standards that we apply in the Community. Member States must check products entering into the Community and should notify the interception of non-compliant products to the Commission through our rapid alert system.</p>
<p class="contents">Based on the information that we have, provided by that system, only three interceptions of fresh and frozen fruit, which did not meet our standards, took place in the period from January 2002 to April 2005. Given the large quantity that is imported, it is my opinion that this is a very small amount.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the introduction of special labelling of origin, I can assure you that I will be positive in my approach to that.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only stress the great importance of this specific sector to the Member States, both from an economic and a job-creation point of view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
