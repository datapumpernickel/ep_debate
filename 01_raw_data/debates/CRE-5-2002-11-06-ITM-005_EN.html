<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at its meeting today the Commission adopted a series of measures which, within the framework of the Euratom Treaty, are aimed at achieving a Community approach to the management of nuclear waste and nuclear safety. This package consists of a communication, a proposal for a directive defining the general principles and obligations in relation to the safety of nuclear installations in the European Union and a proposal for a directive on the management of radioactive waste. The package is supplemented by a draft Council decision authorising the Commission to negotiate an agreement between Euratom and the Russian Federation on the trade in nuclear material.</p>
<p class="contents">I will comment on the reasons for, and the timeliness of, the proposal. Ladies and gentlemen, the broad debate on the Green Paper on the security of the energy supply has highlighted the problem of the security of supply in Europe and the role played by nuclear energy in relation to it and our environmental commitments with regard to greenhouse emissions within the framework of the Kyoto agreements and Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, nuclear energy is currently faced with two challenges, two problems mentioned during this debate: the safety of installations and the treatment of nuclear waste. Despite the fact that the Euratom Treaty provides for important measures guaranteeing a high level of safety, above all with regard to non-proliferation, that is, the appropriate use of fissile material and radioactive material, the current situation is not as ideal as we would like. Firstly, I must point out that in the various States of the Union there is no equivalent application of nuclear safety standards. Secondly, it must be said that, in the negotiations with the candidate countries, we are demanding that the candidate countries comply with certain obligations and behave in a certain way, in the field of nuclear safety, which cannot be compared with anything in the current countries of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore faced with a situation in which there are significant disparities within Europe. To a certain extent we are faced with a surprising situation. We may, as I have pointed out on other occasions, have complete and detailed legislation on the quality of bathing water in the European Union but, nevertheless, we do not regulate the levels of security required of nuclear installations within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">But furthermore, as I pointed out, in view of enlargement and the concerns of the European citizens, we must act quickly and decisively. We are creating – and there is no other way of putting it – a situation of asymmetry between the candidate countries and the Member States of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">What is our intention through these proposals? Simply, a new Community vision of nuclear security and the treatment of radioactive waste. The first relates to increasing safety in nuclear power stations and the issue of their dismantling. We are talking about a proposal for a directive that is not yet approved since its legal basis is Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty and that obliges us to submit this text to a committee of experts, consisting of experts from the different countries of the Union; it is still awaiting this procedure, and then the proposal will be approved definitively so that it can be communicated to Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, the proposal we are presenting today has three fundamental axes. Firstly, it proposes common rules for nuclear safety; secondly, a Community system for controlling the application of these common rules and thirdly, it guarantees the existence and availability of the funds necessary for the dismantling of nuclear installations.</p>
<p class="contents">The common rules are based simply on the rules of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the headquarters of which is in Vienna, but our proposal provides for something completely innovative. That is that these rules, which within the framework of the Atomic Energy Agency are simply recommendations, thanks to the proposal for a directive, when they come to be adopted – as I hope they will – will become Community rules, and will therefore be binding on all the countries of the Union, with the legal force that Community law always has.</p>
<p class="contents">But furthermore, they are able to evolve and take up the results of the negotiations held over recent years with the candidate countries, negotiations which have allowed these common rules to be developed, which must be complied with, not only by the candidate countries, but also, in the Commission’s opinion, by all the countries of the European Union without exception.</p>
<p class="contents">The second fundamental axis consists of how, once we have these common rules, we will control their effective application. How can we guarantee to all the citizens that the required standards will be complied with in all the nuclear installations of the European Union? Well that is very simple, ladies and gentlemen, there will be two systems. Firstly, control is required of all countries. Independent control authorities already exist. The control of installations will still be a task for the national competent authorities of each and every Member State of the Union. The innovation is that we are establishing a system of auditing crosschecks, promoted and coordinated by the Commission, which will guarantee the appropriate application of the Community rules within the different Member States of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">But, furthermore, the third element of this proposal for a directive is the definition of Community rules for the creation, management and use of funds for dismantling nuclear power stations, with the aim of guaranteeing that the funds are sufficient and available. I would insist that we believe it is essential that these funds are available when they become necessary. We therefore propose a series of elements, but essentially the externalisation of these funds or an equivalent means of guaranteeing their availability to prevent them from, for example, in the event of bankruptcy, being included in the bankrupt assets and therefore not being available for their objective of dismantling the installations when the time comes.</p>
<p class="contents">The second directive, ladies and gentlemen, will contribute to the creation of new habits in the management of irradiated fuel and radioactive waste in the Member States of the Union. We are not just talking about highly radioactive waste, about waste from reactors, from nuclear power stations or from reactors used in research, but also about radioactive waste from other types of application such as medical or industrial applications, low intensity waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we propose a timetable with limit dates so that all the countries of the Union will have appropriate installations prepared and available for the underground storage of high activity waste, because that is currently the safest technology for the storage of that waste. In the case of waste of a lesser intensity, there are other types of storage, but in those cases we also propose the availability and establishment of appropriate locations. In this regard I would like to congratulate, for example, Finland on having already taken decisions with specific and very immediate dates and timetables, which seems to me to be extremely important. I congratulate Finland on the speed of its action. But unfortunately other countries are not in such an advanced situation and we therefore propose a limit date.</p>
<p class="contents">We are establishing the possibility that the underground storage of this radioactive waste can be carried out in a manner which involves cooperation between different Member States of the Union. We are therefore confronting this thorny problem once and for all.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we believe that this solution, while it is the most suitable today, cannot be considered sufficiently satisfactory and, in this regard, we propose that it is necessary to continue research into the treatment of radioactive waste in order to reduce or possibly even eliminate the existence of this waste.</p>
<p class="contents">The final proposal, Mr President, is a draft Council decision allowing the Commission to negotiate an agreement with Russia relating to the trade in nuclear material. This trade has created friction with Russia for some time, for various reasons. Enlargement will mean the incorporation of five new States, with twenty-two reactors, in some cases with early closure scheduled; but, in any event, for some time, these reactors will present us with a problem because the current restrictions, in accordance with the Corfu Agreement, will prevent the supply of fuel for these reactors. In order to deal with this problem we therefore have to negotiate with Russia. All of this must take account of the protection of the European Union companies that carry out enrichment, the protection of consumers, but also the new difficulties the situation may present from the Russian point of view. Furthermore, this may open up the possibility for us – and let us hope this is the case – to be able to demand and promote the speedy closure of the oldest nuclear reactors in Russia, some of which may clearly at some point cause problems and which are very close to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in conclusion, this package of proposals as a whole is aimed at increasing levels of safety in nuclear power stations and installations within the European Union, which now has fifteen Members, but which will later have twenty-five. Increasing the availability of funds in order to guarantee that when the time comes the dismantling necessary to return sites to their original state can be carried out, in other words, so that those places where there are currently nuclear installations may be totally decontaminated, free of all risk.</p>
<p class="contents">We must increase transparency so that the citizens know that, within the European Union, there are a series of rules and levels of security that are guaranteed. And we must confront a thorny problem, the problem of waste, above all high activity waste, but also other waste originating from medical or industrial applications. We must also try to make progress on resolving the issues, difficulties and differences we have with Russia, but which also affect the future Member States of the Union.</p>

I am convinced that the peer review to which you refer is necessary for nuclear safety.</p>
<p class="contents">You did not, however, state, Commissioner, whether countries will definitely be able to refuse to receive waste they do not want. The ability, in the future too, to be able to refuse other countries’ nuclear waste has been one of the disputed points.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the agreement concerning Russia, we know that a debate is under way about what is waste and what is nuclear fuel. Euratom and the Commission have been convinced that Russian standards and administration do not in any way fulfil our requirements. What will the agreement in question look like? Will you be able to guarantee that we too shall not be exporting what is referred to as nuclear fuel under unacceptable conditions? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to radioactive waste, I would like to mention a specifically Danish problem. We have no nuclear reactors of our own, but we do have waste – 200-300 kg of highly radioactive waste – from the time when we thought we were going to make fuel elements.</p>
<p class="contents">If we must dump it in Denmark, as the current rules state, it will cost a very, very great deal. If, on the other hand, Denmark were allowed – under new rules, as indicated by the Commissioner, particularly on cooperation between different countries – to add its 200 kg or so of radioactive waste to the many tonnes of highly radioactive waste from the big countries, I doubt that anyone would object to its doing so. This would be advantageous overall to the economy of the EU, although naturally it would be subject to the recipient country in question being happy to receive it. That is not an option available to us at present, since each country is obliged to take back its own highly radioactive waste. This makes no sense in the case of small countries, which have only a small amount of medical and other waste.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, firstly it is being demonstrated here that there are no double standards. In other words, what we are doing is converting into Community law – or making a proposal that they become Community law – the rules and standards which, in the negotiations, it has been agreed to require of the candidate countries. We have demanded that the candidate countries comply with them and what we are going to do is simply demand that the current countries of the Union do the same.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would like to point out that in 1999 the Council gave its opinion on the need to establish maximum requirements and guarantees in relation to nuclear installations within the European Union. And I would like to point out that the Laeken Council asked for periodic reports on the state of the nuclear safety situation in the Union. These proposals are a response to that.</p>
<p class="contents">To respond to a question which was asked earlier, Article 15 lays down, on the one hand, that the Member States must inform the Commission every year of the measures adopted in application of the requirements and that every two years the Commission must report on the general situation within the European Union to Parliament and the Council. In other words, that there are national annual reports by the States to the Commission and the Commission, using these reports and so-called ‘peer reviews’, controls between equals, produces a report every two years to Parliament and the Council on the development and safety of nuclear installations, not only of nuclear power stations, in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue that has been raised is whether the countries can refuse to receive nuclear waste they do not want. Of course, provided that it is not their own. In principle, all countries are obliged to take responsibility for their own nuclear waste. This is the rule that binds all of us at the moment. And that rule will remain as a basic principle, which does not mean that if two or three countries voluntarily reach an agreement to share installations or storage facilities, they cannot do so. We are opening up the possibility – thinking specifically of certain European Union countries, small in size, which have very significant geological difficulties and therefore difficulties in creating the necessary infrastructures on their territory – that they may possibly be able to seek agreements with a third country. And if they do not reach them the waste will have to remain in their own countries, that is clear. Nobody is going to be obliged to receive waste from third countries, nobody. What we are proposing is that the different countries can reach agreements amongst themselves on joint storage, but always on the basis of voluntary agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the agreement with Russia, it is not a question of negotiating anything with regard to the export of material by the European Union. We are proposing the opposite. The situation, very briefly, ladies and gentlemen, is that at the moment Russia is supplying nineteen power stations in candidate countries with fissile material, which involves activity in a series of Russian industrial installations, revenue and technological and industrial development relating to this activity. The technical characteristics of the installations in those countries mean that the best supplies naturally come from where they have always come, that is to say, from the Russian industry. That is the situation of the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, with regard to the situation of the current fifteen Member States, we have a limit, in order to guarantee security of supply, on the volume of imports originating from a single country. That maximum limit, imposed by the Corfu Agreement, is 20% of the necessary nuclear fuel. We clearly stand at around that figure, more or less. But if 19 reactors from the candidate countries are incorporated, we will clearly exceed that limit. That is the problem we have to resolve.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, what we are saying when we refer to the agreement with Russia is that they are selling fissile material to a series of countries which on entering the European Union may have problems if the current rules are not changed. What we want is, in exchange for that negotiation, to also reach an agreement with the Russians on an improvement in nuclear safety in Russia and, specifically, the closure of the first-generation Russian nuclear power stations. This is a second element which, in the context of this negotiation, we want to introduce into our relations and our structured energy dialogue with Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to funding, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has today approved an increase in the margin for Euratom loans. This measure would make EUR 2 000 million available. At the moment we are almost exhausting the existing line. It should be made very clear that this new margin does not mean that there will be many more active appropriations. The majority of appropriations have already been used and even paid back by the borrowers of the loans. But what is required, according to the rules of the Euratom loans, is to open new facilities, to increase the margin so that funds may be available for the dismantling of power stations, in Lithuania or Slovenia for example, or for improving safety in those power stations. In fact, we believe that the Euratom loans are an appropriate instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I would like to say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that here and in the Commission I have said repeatedly that the European Union must become more aware and take decisions in relation to the cost of dismantling certain nuclear power stations in the countries of the East, in certain countries which are going to be members of the European Union. We all know that the closure of power stations is going to be speeded up and that no fund has been set up for dismantling, that they have no money for dismantling. This is a very complicated problem. There was talk of a donors’ club to fund that dismantling of those power stations, but the reality is that the funds generated by that donors’ club are very meagre, if not non-existent. This is something that I have pointed out, that worries me enormously and that we will have to confront.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the question of the Swedish example, I am not going to insist on the issue of joint storage. I have explained what our approach is. With regard to Denmark, this is a country which does have difficulties, but Lithuania, for example, also has a very serious problem owing to its size, its geological make-up and its situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In short, this safety problem particularly involves the countries of the East. This debate cannot therefore ignore public opinion.

However, I should like to make one comment and raise one question.</p>
<p class="contents">I have had the opportunity to study the texts that you are presenting, Commissioner. I must admit that these texts, particularly those on nuclear safety, are meaningless, because you are not proposing any real European standards. You are promising future directives and perhaps you could tell me when these future directives will materialise.</p>
<p class="contents">Another weak point in your proposals is that you are basing your comments on Article 31. However, Article 31 relates to radiation protection. The Article 31 radiation protection working group is meeting today in Luxembourg. I have spoken with these experts. They tell me that they do not feel qualified to assess the directives that you are proposing, because these are directives in the field of nuclear safety. This view is also shared by Francis Jacob, the counsel for the prosecution in a case currently before the European Court of Justice, between the Council and the European Commission. Why are you convinced that Article 31 is the right one? To sum up, in your midday meeting with Mr Giscard d’Estaing, did you discuss what would be needed, in other words, the reform of the Euratom Treaty under the Convention? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have two questions. Firstly, Madam Vice-President, are you prepared to shape information policy on atomic energy in such a way that full information is given, with the utmost transparency, as regards dangerous incidents and safety measures, and to demand of the other countries that they should do likewise? Will you also see to it that the controls carried out, as well as the controllers' reports, will be made available to the public, so that they may be sure that everything is being done properly?</p>

How have the candidate countries received this proposal? Amongst other things, with the sensation that they are not going to be discriminated against. Because I must say that some candidate countries were saying to us: ‘You make demands of us, but you, what do you control and how do you know that in all the countries of the Union these rules you are demanding we comply with are being respected?’ And, for the future, they were very worried about the reports they were going to have to present periodically. How could they be required of them and not of everybody else?</p>
<p class="contents">Amongst the countries of the current Union, in general, I would like to say that it has received a fairly positive response. Some countries have problems with certain specific aspects, but, in general, I have the impression that it has not been received negatively, but that there is a constructive and positive approach. Furthermore, they are aware of the situation created by enlargement and also the need to provide the citizens with more information and transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to Mr Turmes that I fully share his consternation at the tragic air crash in Luxembourg, as well as the fire on a coach in France, both issues relating to my portfolio, transport. All I can say is that the Commission, in collaboration with all of you, is trying to increase and improve safety systems as far as possible. We do not yet know what the causes of these accidents are, but in any event what we are trying to do is to prevent as far as possible any similar event from happening, using all systems, both management and technological systems. We are all dismayed and we all share in the pain of the families of the victims.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to future directives, I would say to the honourable Member that what we propose are procedures. It is true that we have not gone into the details. But the honourable Member knows that all of this is in the texts of WENRA (the Western European Nuclear Regulators Association), which brings together all the safety bodies of the different countries of the Union, precisely so that these standards can be required of the candidate countries. And to this we should add the recommendations of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which, I will insist, are going to become Community law and will therefore be enforceable within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Legal basis: Article 31. I would like to say something in relation to radiation protection. Firstly, I draw a different conclusion to that of the Solicitor-General, Mr Jacobs. Why is the problem of safety being raised? Well, precisely because of the ionisation that may be produced. In other words, one of the aspects is precisely to prevent – and this is why safety measures are taken – these situations of ionisation. We believe that the issue of radiation protection is entirely relevant. Why are we looking for storage sites and systems for controlling radioactive waste? Precisely in order to prevent ionisation and radioactive contamination. In other words, for reasons of radioprotection. I am going to say to you that this is an issue that we have debated in depth within the Commission and that, of course, the Commission’s legal service is in full agreement on using Article 31 as the legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">We have in fact held a working meeting with Mr Giscard d'Estaing, but we have not raised the issue of the review of the Euratom Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the information policy, Mr Swoboda, I believe that if we really hold a debate every two years here in Parliament and in the Council which considers the reality of each country, and which involves a vision of the whole Union – there are already national debates on the situation of the nuclear installations in the different countries of the Union – so that those countries which do not have nuclear installations or which only have research or university installations may also be aware of what is happening in their own installations and in those of their neighbours, we will have taken a great step forward. Because the issue of nuclear safety goes beyond borders and we are all aware of this.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that by holding an in-depth debate every two years, which is well-prepared and well-executed, in the Council and in Parliament, we will contribute to providing the citizens with transparent information via yourselves and via the debates held here.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the timetable, today, at the meeting of the Security Committee, the proposal has been presented to the group of experts and the intention is that in two months time the report will have been produced. As soon as this happens, I hope that the Commission will approve these proposals and we will send them to the ESC, to Parliament and to the Council for their final approval. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must, however, keep a cool head. When legislation is being drafted everything must be based on scientific and technical facts, and not political passions. The International Atomic Energy Agency is an expert organisation whose level of competence is trusted globally, and it is important that its expert opinion is heard in these connections as well. I hope that the Commission will not now create another super-regulator to function alongside the IAEA in the monitoring of these matters, because the IAEA is very important worldwide. It is, however, important that standards of safety attained at Union level are so high that we can also demand the same from the applicant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I should nevertheless like to ask the Commission how it intends to take account of national regulators in preparing this package of directives.

I would also like to reiterate that I remain a fervent supporter of the railways.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, my first point relates to the nuclear industry. I am rather surprised that we were able to read the various proposals you have outlined in <span class="italic">Le Monde</span> before you came to present them to the House. This is a matter of some regret, all the more so because, personally speaking, I am far from convinced – and I have the impression that you yourself are far from convinced – by a number of your proposals, particularly your proposals regarding deep land disposal. You are well aware that this is a key issue. You know that, for the time being, no solution to the problem of waste management has been found, that there are currently no techniques which will enable us to reduce the radioactivity of radioactive nuclear waste. And yet, in 1974, when France launched its major nuclear energy project, anyone who would listen was told that, in thirty years’ time, these waste problems would be resolved. Today, 30 years later, these problems have still not been resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I feel that your proposals are – to an extent – misleading the public. Ultimately, you are trying to suggest that, with these decisions, you are going to make nuclear energy in Europe safe. Yet this is completely untrue.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Commissioner, how do you justify the fact that further financial assistance is being given to the nuclear industry – when, for example, the nuclear industry has already cost the average French citizen a great deal of money – and when no solution to the problem of waste management has yet been found, and when we know how difficult it is to find even limited resources to spend on renewable energies? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would therefore like to congratulate the Commission on doing as the Vice-President has suggested, and adduce another weighty argument in favour of Community-wide standards. The sooner we have Community-wide standards, the sooner we will have the chance to let them have an external effect, in, for example, Russia and the Ukraine, which is most important and in our interest. That would, in addition, be the best way to support the IEAE.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam Vice-President, I would like to ask you a question related to that. Could you briefly describe where the Commission's proposals on the line taken so far in negotiations with the candidate countries are leading? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to say that, in making this proposal, what I am doing above all is following up a decision of this Parliament, and I am delighted, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to be in agreement with Parliament and to be able to comply with an almost unanimous request by this House. That is the first thing I wanted to say to you.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, some of you may be suspicious of other kinds of hidden intentions – second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth intentions. But there are objective and unquestionable facts. If they are approved – as I hope they will be in the coming months – these proposals will increase the guarantees that nuclear safety in all the power stations and installations of the European Union is at the highest and most suitable level. We will increase the guarantees that the problem of nuclear waste will have a solution, at least in relation to its appropriate storage, with maximum time periods. We will increase the guarantees that the funds necessary for the dismantling of the current more or less contaminated installations will exist and will be available when needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, as far as the citizens are concerned, we will increase what we have to increase, I believe: guarantees, confidence, information, transparency. That is the objective reality. All the rest is interpretation. I am telling you that that is my intention.</p>
<p class="contents">You have mentioned renewable energy. Ladies and gentlemen, I only wanted to say that my first proposal was to promote the generation of electricity based on renewable energy – this had not been done before – with quantified objectives for the different States of the Union. Then I presented a proposal on biofuels. I have presented various proposals on energy efficiency, in particular one on buildings which is very ambitious. I would like to say, ladies and gentlemen, that in no way have I ignored the issue of renewable energy and energy efficiency. Quite the opposite. I have thrown myself into it from the outset. But that does not mean that it is not necessary to make improvements in the safety of nuclear installations – not only of power stations, but also of university, research and all types of installation – throughout the European Union and improvements in relation to information and the safety of waste management in the European Union in all respects.</p>
<p class="contents">Third question: <span class="italic">Le Monde</span>. I would like to make it clear to the honourable Member that it is not me who carries out leaks, I can guarantee that. What is more, on some occasions I have been the victim of them, but I do not carry them out on principle, of course. This morning this package on nuclear safety was approved and now I am presenting it to you.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to technologies, a package for research and its promotion is proposed. There are areas of research – for example what is known as separation and transmutation – which may provide solutions. It is not guaranteed, but they may provide solutions. It is because the results of this research are not guaranteed that, in the meantime, we must resolve the issue of deep underground storage. But there is research, and its outlook is very positive.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that in this way we are increasing safety, guarantees and information to citizens. It is not a question of creating a new research body. Quite the opposite, it is the national authorities – and the controllers – who will have the responsibility for research throughout the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the problem of unfair competition within the internal electricity market, Article 11 and the corresponding Annex, which clearly establish that the funds for dismantling can only be used expressly for the purposes laid down, that is, when the time comes, for the dismantling of the relevant energy installations, something which is unfortunately not the case today in several countries of the Union, but rather these funds enter into the general assets of the companies and can therefore be used for any operational purpose.</p>
