<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Skinner (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, the first question to be asked about this report is: Why do we need this directive? It is very interesting when you look at the statistics because the exact reasons become clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost 10% of all occupational accidents involve falls from heights. One in ten of those involves permanent invalidity or death. Across the European Union in any one year there are approximately half a million falls from heights in the workplace. 300 000 of those result in absences from the workplace of more than three days and 40 000 result in serious injury. Unfortunately, 1 000 are fatal.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of these accidents – many of which can be avoided – come about because of the poor use of scaffolding or ladders. In the UK, the Health and Safety Executive, the body looking at accidents in the workplace has estimated that some 30% of all prohibition notices in the United Kingdom are issued for unsafe scaffolding alone. In fact, 90% of all accidents on ladders come about because of the misuse of ladders. These are statistics gathered by industry groups and others and not because of equipment failure.</p>
<p class="contents">Figures published recently by the European Agency for Health and Safety in Bilbao suggest enormous variations between Member States in the incidence of falls from heights. Such variations suggest that health and safety levels are not the same for all workers across the European Union. That is why we need to establish minimum requirements with a view to protecting workers from falls from heights.</p>
<p class="contents">The current cost, both in personal terms and those of the workers and families affected and in terms of economic costs to industry and the social and health protection systems, warrants legislation in this area. Billions of pounds are spent caring for workers who have been injured or become ill. This can largely be avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">The background to this proposal suggests additional reasons for having this legislation. This is an amendment to an existing directive on the general minimum requirements for work equipment at work. A proposal to include scaffolding in an earlier amendment to the directive was rejected by Parliament, thanks to many of my colleagues on the other side of the House. The directive finally adopted covered only two specific types of work equipment: mobile equipment and equipment for lifting loads which are very important areas in their own right. This directive will rectify this serious omission. If we do not include falls from heights, the only certainty is that there will be more and the rate will increase. If Parliament rejects this addition, then it must hold itself responsible for the consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s original intention was to present a proposal for a scaffolding directive. However, because serious falls from heights do not occur only from scaffolding, the scope has been widened to include protection for workers from all manner of falls from heights. Although falls from heights occur in circumstances where ladders and scaffolding are not present, the main focus of the proposal is on scaffolding, ladders and rope access, as you will see as you read.</p>
<p class="contents">The current rules in many Member States apply only to the building industry, so another important factor is that the scope is extended to other sectors. Also it is important to stress as some seem mildly confused about this, that this proposal is based on Article 138, previously Article 118a, which laid down the minimum requirements for ensuring a better level of protection for workers health and safety.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not dealing with the construction, the concept or the design or work equipment, but with the risks to the health and safety of workers using the equipment. It does seem to me that there are some people in this House who are a little bit dim in grasping that.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of working at heights and having this directive is clear also. Some have questioned the validity of this legislation and they are free to do so. However, contrary to what has been suggested, this proposal does not merely suggest training people to use ladders, nor does it outlaw the use of ladders. What it does is provide for safe use of ladders and other equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">I wonder whether the critics of this report have ever worked on construction sites as many of us have. I wonder whether they would accept that there are many people who know exactly what this legislation can bring about.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, concerning the amendments tabled, which I have only just seen today, I welcome Amendments Nos 22 and 25: Amendment No 22 as a second choice if Amendment No 5 falls and Amendment No 25 as a recital as it hits the tone of my report very well. However, for consistency’s sake and with regard to the framework directive which is the basis of this whole legislative approach, I cannot accept the others at present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All of this means that we have a text which enjoys broad consensus, and not only amongst the two main Groups, since this consensus has been forged through constant communication with social operators, entrepreneurs and workers, via the trade unions. I believe that consensus is necessary in a field in which the safety, health, integrity and the very lives of workers are at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">Very recently I was going for a walk around my town, Vigo, in Galicia, in the north west of Spain, when I happened to see a large works sign. The works involved the renovation of an old square in the town’s historic quarter, and the sign said: “This company respects the law. It uses safety equipment and devices. If you are not familiar with them, do not enter the site. Inform us of any situation of risk. Please help us to fulfil the legal obligations for protecting the safety and health of workers”.</p>
<p class="contents">I mention the contents of this works sign and the advice, legal requirements for third parties and those with an interest in the works, because I believe that it represents a summary of the requirements of a good policy on health at work. A good policy on health at work must begin by being preventive and the idea of prevention must to a large extent include awareness, not only on the part of workers and employers, but also on the part of society as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, every day we hear news of accidents at work. We know very well there is no such thing as zero risk, but we are also aware that society must not cease in its efforts to prevent risk being turned into accidents. When an accident happens, the responsibility may perhaps fall to the employer, because they have still not been convinced that money spent on safety is an investment. Or perhaps it may fall to the worker, because they ignore the risks, or because of a lack of caution, or because adequate measures or precautions have not been taken, mainly in activities such as construction, in which the temporary nature of works and of the sector itself – a bridging sector, between primary activity, mainly agricultural, and the industrial and service sectors – require even more precautionary measures. Or it may perhaps fall to the administration itself through the insufficiency, and therefore ineffectiveness, of the inspection, advisory and control services responsible for informing, advising and, where necessary, penalising non-compliance with the employment legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Health and safety at work, especially where the risk is very high, is the responsibility of society and of all the sectors concerned, and the whole of society must assume its fair share of responsibility and commitment. The employer should consider money spent on safety at work as an investment. The worker should take full precautions, demanding and arguing for the use of preventive and protective mechanisms, as well as the good practices of companies.</p>
<p class="contents">States and governments should amend the measures for the promotion of preventive actions, for the inspection of the measures to prevent accidents, and also for the replacement of the administrative and political methods for combating accidents at work. The old model of penalties, which has shown itself to be insufficient and ineffective, should be replaced with a method providing stimulus and incentive, by intensifying action in all companies or activities with the highest number of accidents, and also by offering benefits and advantages to companies with the lowest number of accidents and the highest spending on prevention and awareness.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission and the Council should set minimum conditions which may seem strict to some, but which will allow working conditions to be improved and the health and safety of workers to be protected, harmonising legislation in a market operating with the free movement of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, European citizens will see Europe as being closer to them, a Europe that addresses their problems, concerns and interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Negligence in work organisation, a lack of appropriate equipment for personal and collective safety, the low level of training and the high number of self-employed workers are the main causes of the high level of injuries and deaths in the workplace. The risks inherent in the building industry are even greater when compared with other, similar sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last 50 years, business activity has increased apace, and immigrant workers and sub-contractors are used to a great extent. Apart from the aspects that have already been mentioned, the problems of communication and organisation are getting worse, and there is a tendency for the safety of everyone on building sites to be neglected, and for responsibility to be watered down. It can never be stated too strongly that all the directives relating to the health and safety of workers and particularly the definition of responsibility contained in Directive 89/655/EEC are in force. These state that the employer, the owner of the site, is responsible for any accidents that happen there, and also for preventing them. The person responsible for the safety of the site is obliged to carry out a risk assessment and to ensure that checks on safety equipment used by everyone with access to the site, regardless of their job, employment status or length of service, have been carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">The risk assessment has been carried out at a snail’s pace in the European Union, and this second revision is a positive sign that we really want to support and encourage. Even looking at the matter from a purely economic point of view, it is extremely worrying to note that in the European Union, in 1996, out of every 100 000 workers, 4 229 took more than three days’ sick leave as a result of accidents in the workplace. In that year, four million seven hundred thousand accidents took place. Although fatal accidents have decreased by 13%, which is to some extent linked to Community action between 1994 and 1996, there were still 5 549 deaths in 1996. It is estimated that the damage caused to the European economy in that year was around 146 million working days lost. It is particularly relevant to the debate on the directive that I mentioned earlier that, although the construction industry does not have the highest number of accidents, it does have the greatest number of fatal accidents, comparable only with the road haulage sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe cannot at the same time consider itself to be the world’s leading social model and yet allow people to count for little and for their lives to be reduced to mere statistics. Men, especially young men under the age of 25, are the main victims of accidents in the workplace, but the probability of death as a result of an accident increases with age and is highest for those between 55 and 64 years old. This probability is highest in smaller companies – with up to 50 employees – and for self-employed workers, for whom the accident rate stands at 73.1% of all accidents in the workplace. This illustrates the need for measures to be adopted in professions with a high turnover of workers: measures which focus on young people’s qualifications, multidisciplinary solutions involving training and qualifications and the quality of SMEs in some sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the famous survey conducted in 1907 in the United States, when identification, compulsory registration, cause of death, the employer’s age, the worker’s age, name, circumstances and the accident itself were studied to establish costs and duties enabling workers to be better protected…</p>

On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I should like to say that, overall, we regard the result as progress. The main features of the rules we are proposing to introduce in this area seem to be clear and, at the same time, appear to take due account of the fact that businesses will have to be able to make the rules work in practice and on a day-to-day basis. For we need to remember that, however commendable and laudable the purpose behind what we are adopting, the consequences will not necessarily always be as we hope, and our objective must therefore always be to formulate rules which are as simple and precise as possible and to ensure that there is room for the flexibility needed in the labour market. I believe that our rapporteur, Peter Skinner, has striven to find this balance between the desire for clear rules and the need for flexibility and diversity. He deserves a lot of thanks for this, as well as for his method of working. aimed at building consensus. However, I believe that it will also be important in the future to work on reducing the risk of accidents by acquiring greater knowledge of how such accidents happen. How many accidents are we talking about? When do they occur? How do they happen? What can we do to prevent them? I believe that the work begun with the European Agency for Health and Safety in Bilbao will make a positive contribution to a reduction in the accident figures as we find the answers to these questions and use them constructively. This is a proper path to go down: the authorities cooperating with the two sides of industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It concerns the use of ladders, scaffolding and ropes, working at heights, and, from time to time, alongside dangerous drops. The background to this report is, of course, the many accidents which have occurred in the past and the inadequacy of directives to date. This is why it is useful and necessary to have this report, although it has been a long time coming. However, all credit to Mr Skinner for finally managing to complete it.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, it is a problem report in a way, not because it is causing something to be done, but because the sector we are dealing with is extremely diverse. It covers people working in the service sector, maintenance sector, painters, window cleaners, etc. Working at heights is not always for long periods of time but often for short spells. This means that the definitions we use should be specific rather than vague, and that the provisions we make should be enforceable, which is far from always being the case. I have already indicated that some descriptions are vague, including those describing “short duration” and “low level of risk”, for example, whilst the assessing of risks involving only a couple of people has been over-regulated. We have managed to discuss some of these instances within the committee and these sections have been deleted from the report, which has led to an improvement. I welcome the progress made and we should be able to continue in the same vein.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us examine a number of aspects, such as scaffold bearing surfaces. Needless to say, they should be securely fixed but it is not always possible to brace them against movement, as long as they do not slip. Mobile scaffolds must be prevented from moving about, but this cannot always be legislated for sufficiently. You cannot have red lights everywhere. Portable ladders must be anchored down and be solid, but they must remain serviceable. This is why we have proposed requesting split voting for a number of amendments. In this way, everyone will have the opportunity to propose improvements on the vulnerable sections of the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet, the rapporteur himself reminds us how urgent the matter is when he quotes a figure of 500 000 accidents per year in this sphere alone, leading to at least 40 000 cases of seriously injury and around a thousand deaths. As the rapporteur is careful to point out, however, building firms are opposed to regulation of any kind and, as a result, the report carefully avoids implicating them.</p>
<p class="contents">Technical defects in scaffolding and other systems do cause accidents in the workplace, but the main cause is production rates, working hours and poor conditions. The report asks for employers to make arrangements at least to limit the carnage, if not to put an end to it. If emergency measures were to be agreed, forcing employers to make such arrangements, then I should immediately be all in favour of them. I doubt, however, if that would be possible, so respectful is this Parliament of employers’ interests. Meanwhile, capitalist exploitation continues to exact a heavy toll among tens of thousands of employees in terms of their health and, sometimes, their lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course, we are aware of the greater or lesser sensitivity towards these issues shown in the positions adopted within this very Parliament and elsewhere, and of the concerns raised regarding legislation which is more stringent or would involve greater costs for businesses. However, as the rapporteur points out, we must consider just how much a worker’s life and health is worth. In effect, occupational accidents continue to be the scourge of the world of employment in all the countries of the European Union, although there is a higher incidence in certain sectors. This can certainly be explained by the many factors which contribute in various ways to increasing or reducing the size of the phenomenon, but we are now faced with an indisputable cause of injury, which is present in all the Member States, and which is sadly responsible for as much as ten percent of all occupational accidents, namely falls from heights.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be said that the Economic and Social Committee’s opinion certainly laid out, clearly and precisely, not only the scale of the problem but also and above all the solutions to be adopted: Mr Skinner has not failed to build on this foundation, taking as a starting point the need to consolidate the relevant terminology used, to improve the way work is organised and to provide specific training and information for the workers involved. It must also be pointed out, however, that the solution should nevertheless be implemented via the preparation and issuing of more precise, and more stringent guidelines on prevention by the Commission, making it possible, among other things, to overcome the problem of the fragmentation of responsibilities in this area and, at the same time, to provide, along with more binding controls, for a system of incentives, particularly where small- and medium-sized businesses are concerned, to ensure that occupational safety rules are implemented efficiently and effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Perez Alvarez has already gone into this. I am not happy on every count. A certain amount of amendment will be necessary prior to the second reading, but the PPE-DE Group is prepared to accept the report overall. The report in its present form even takes account of objections raised by small- and medium-sized enterprises, and calls for experts to be involved, but, of course, only where the setting up of ladders and scaffolding equipment at the workplace is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">As is surely the case with all legal texts at national – and at regional level for that matter – some of the phraseology might raise a smile, if you can call any of it a laughing matter that is. The smile certainly drained from my face when I read the European-wide statistics on accidents in the workplace, and on hearing them just now. I do not intend to go further into the facts and figures, as we have already heard a great deal on that score. But there is one fundamental point I would like to make. Safety measures are not the only things that cost. Continued payment of wages, sick pay, invalidity, widows’ and orphans’ allowances are a drain on business and on the national economy. This is how productive a moderate social policy is. Preventive action is also better, cheaper and more humane than a social policy that deals with the consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no good shutting the stable door when the horse has bolted; you need to make sure it is shut to start with. ‘But what about subsidiarity?’, goes the common cry. This principle is not meant to render Europe completely inert! I like the definition provided in Q<span class="italic">uadragesimo anno</span> the best: subsidiarity – gives right of way in cases of doubt to smaller living entities and to solutions reached by social partners, in the face of State, or – I might well add – EU rulings. But if the smaller entity is unable to perform its tasks in the interests of the public good, then the larger entity must step in. This explains why so many European minimum standards were laid down in the EU Treaties in the eighties, when Christian Democrats and Conservatives had the monopoly on power in Europe; in other words, it is a Christian Democrat affair.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, health and safety regulations have been organised at international level since the industrial revolution in the 19th century. The great Conservative British statesman Benjamin Disraeli was one of the pioneers of health and safety regulations. Continental Europe took its cue from England, adopted these laws and also enshrined them in international conventions, doing so from the very outset. In view of globalisation and Europeanisation, there is without doubt a need for the European social dimension in the 21st century. We want to Europeanise the economy. We have the single currency. It cannot be the answer to deal with social policy at a purely regional, or even provincial, level. Minimum standards mean subsidiarity. Each country can frame its own health and safety regulations provided that European minimum standards are observed.</p>
<p class="contents">We PPE-DE Group Members are opposed to European maximum standards. In Germany the picture is completed by legal acts introduced by the social partners. There are German standards and health and safety regulations for the workplace. We also have statutes such as legal acts governing professional trade associations, not to mention the accident prevention law. Incidentally, it is all very well for people to be critical – for stylistic reasons among others – of the fact that we have a whole host of detailed regulations. I tell you this though; a fraction of these practical regulations would do the citizens and workers of the Member States a greater service than reams and reams of fancy talk and great ideologies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore urgent that we establish harmonised standards at Community level so that we can have comparable data and assess the results of preventive policies in each European State, community or region. We must do this to ensure that we do not have first- or second-class workers, or lower, but that all workers are protected by safety regulations and requirements of the same quality.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also the case that we need more site inspectors so that companies will sufficiently respect the regulations, but it is just as true that the public institutions and companies must begin by setting an example in all of this. Nevertheless, even today, many activities and workplaces of public bodies do not have the required plans for prevention of work-related risk that are laid down in Community directives.</p>

<p class="contents">It is a question of how the European Parliament should be spending its time and be seen to be spending its time. It is a question of what Parliament should be looking at as its priorities. It is a question of whether it should be for the Commission and for the European Parliament to prescribe the fine detail of people’s working and waking lives.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a problem in the UK, but not confined to the UK. The EU is seen to be interfering. The European Parliament is often seen to be interfering even more. It is not seen as focusing on the big issues. Our constituents ask us why they should vote for anybody at the European elections. They ask: what are you doing for us? What shall we answer? We have the opportunity to tell our people that we do care about the big issues that they care about, that we can help deliver a better peace, security, prosperity, environment and quality of life – issues that can genuinely be helped best at a European level. Or we can answer that the EU, through the Commission and Parliament, is about deciding whether or not it should be legal for one person to stand at the bottom of a ladder holding on to it while another person climbs up it. This is the issue that we are discussing today.</p>

I think that this proposal reflects no credit on the European Union or on this House. I think if the European Union – and indeed if the European Parliament – wishes to be taken seriously by the people of Europe then this is exactly the sort of legislation which it should cease to enact because we all know that health and safety and workers’ safety is a priority for all Member States, and so it should be.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is no justification for a Europe-wide standard on this issue. There can be no reason why Member States, acting in a uniform way, would necessarily be able to tackle this problem more effectively than individual Member States and, above all, there can be no reason for taking such a close interest in ordinary aspects of people’s working lives.</p>
<p class="contents">It can make no sense to legislate on how Europeans are permitted to climb ladders. This should not be the priority for this House. It is too great a level of detail for this House to involve itself in and it will merely lead to the ridiculing of the European Union because this is just the sort of interference which is deeply unpopular with many citizens across the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of engaging in this sort of interference, we should be addressing those issues where it is constructive for Member States to work together and develop some common standards. A common and uniform and centralised standard on how you climb a ladder is not necessary and it is an undesirable interference with the way people run their work environment. We can trust the people of Europe to decide for themselves how they climb ladders.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is not necessary to conduct a risk assessment every time it is proposed to use a ladder. As anyone working in the home can tell you, ladders are used very commonly and very frequently and, yes, there are accidents but I do not believe this kind of directive will ever eliminate those accidents. All it will do is add yet another layer of European bureaucracy and red tape to be dealt with by a business community already suffocated by the weight of red tape.</p>
<p class="contents">As my colleague has said, it is time for a change. It is time for this Parliament to start addressing the issues which are of concern to the citizens of Europe and to stop addressing itself to detailed questions where it can be of no assistance in actually securing worker protection. In fact, all it is doing is bringing itself and the European Union into disrepute and burdening European businesses with a layer of cost and bureaucracy that they can ill afford. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They seem to be engaging in a self-fulfilling prophecy. They deplore the fact that the European Parliament is regarded as involving itself in trivia and generating red tape and yet they spend their time issuing press releases describing very important pieces of health and safety legislation as nothing but trivia and red tape.</p>
<p class="contents">It is hardly surprising that the British media project the sort of image that they describe. This is a very important piece of health and safety legislation, building upon the corpus of such legislation that we have adopted at European level over the last twenty years. It is not trivial for the families of the 500 000 people who fall from heights at work every year. 300 000 of those accidents are serious enough to cause the employees to be absent from work more than three days. 40 000 of those falls are very serious and 1 000 result in deaths. Try to explain to the families concerned that this is a trivial issue. It is not. It is a very important issue and survey after survey, including those in Eurobarometer, and surveys of SMEs including by the last British Government have shown that SMEs themselves recognise the importance of good health and safety legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I deplore the fact that the consensus we have had in this important area of policy has been broken in this way by a small minority in the EPP. It really is absolutely deplorable and we should all – right across the political spectrum – make it clear that we will not tolerate that sort of behaviour from that minority.</p>
<p class="contents">It is described as bureaucratic. But read the directive itself, read the proposal. Is it onerous? Is it burdensome? Does it require detailed voluminous risk assessments before work is carried out a height? No, it does not, it is a very easily understood, readable, implementable directive and it should be described in that way. It should be described as making a valuable contribution to preventing injury and deaths within the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stenzel (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, first of all I would like to say that my delegation intends to back the Skinner report on the Proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending for the second time the Directive concerning minimum health and safety requirements. The key issue of health and safety protection for workers is a matter of concern to us all. No one is prepared to expose themselves to the accusation that they are anti-social, and it is undoubtedly justifiable to have minimum regulations in the European area. It also accords with the EU Treaty, and so we will give the rapporteur the respect due to him.</p>
<p class="contents">But I am at a loss as to why MEPs manoeuvre themselves time and again into predicaments where they either face the accusation of being of an anti-social disposition, or else risk becoming a laughing stock. I certainly cannot see why mature adults should be dictated to on how they should climb ladders, or get down them, or why a risk assessment should have to be completed before a ladder is used; or why there should be an instruction to the effect that, two people should not climb a ladder at the same time, if at all possible, or even one stating that time spent up a ladder should not exceed half an hour, or – a peculiar refinement – 25% of total working hours.</p>
<p class="contents">The Skinner report will go down in parliamentary lore as ‘the ladder report’, and the people of the European Union will justifiably ask themselves whether we do not have anything better to do than produce legislation on things they take for granted, which should in fact be a matter for in-house experts and have no place either in an EU directive or an associated report produced by the codecision-making Parliament! In fact this is not the first time that a report with a social component has contained such absurdities. When MEPs have to rack their brains over matters such as the physical constitution of Europeans, in order to establish standards for the average size of tractor seat, or the conditions under which panicled tomatoes – the Austrian word is <span class="italic">Rispenparadeiser – </span>can enter the market, this shows an MEP’s job description, but also the raison d’être of the European institutions, in a poor light, to say nothing of the fact that such detailed provisions and over-regulation can become counter-productive. The same applies to national legislation on protection for workers, incidentally.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite all the financial incentives, protective measures of this kind are apt to deter employers from taking on apprentices, thereby contributing to youth unemployment rather than helping to alleviate it. In addition, however, the Skinner report raises the fundamental question as to what Europe should do and what it should not do. In other words, it is about competences and the judicious application of the subsidiarity principle.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot, and must not, evade the issue any longer. This is not just because of the Intergovernmental Conference and the organisational form of the European Union, which must find a satisfactory solution in view of the forthcoming enlargement. This issue has to do with the acceptance of the Union by the people, which is the subject of much complaint. We need more Europe where internal and external security is concerned, more Europe when it comes to looking after our interests in the global competition, in currency policy and in the completion of the single market. But what we do not need is a Europe that makes inroads on the autonomy of governments, regional administrative bodies, and lastly, the individual, and which takes away the individual’s right to an opinion. I therefore intend to use this report as an opportunity to highlight the demand for a debate on competences after the Intergovernmental Conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sacrédeus (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, let us be absolutely clear about the fact that there is no one in this Parliament who wants anything other than the best. Let us make it clear that no one in this Parliament wants anything other than that the number of accidents, especially fatal accidents, should fall in all workplaces around our splendid continent and in our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us, however, at the same time make it absolutely clear to one other – and I am addressing a number of speakers here – that different answers can be arrived at to the question of what is the correct level of political decision-making at which to make these important decisions. After listening to Mr Hughes, to the British Labour Government and also to others in Britain, I am extremely confident that they are deeply committed to finding answers to these questions. After listening to Mr Menrad, I am very confident that the German Christian Democratic Party is thoroughly engaged with these issues in Germany. I can guarantee that all seven parliamentary parties in Sweden, especially my own Christian Democratic Party, are concerned about the matter. I can also assure you that public opinion and the trade unions are very committed to the issue and want to enact laws which will lead to a very significant reduction in the number of deaths due to industrial accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">What is it, then, which leads us to believe that it is at the level of the European Parliament, representing countries with more than 15 national parliaments, that the right forum for decision-making is to be found? In the light of the subsidiarity or proximity principle, allow me to express my doubts about the extent to which this issue is suited to being dealt with specifically in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 14, paragraph 4.2.2, for example, reads as follows: ‘Before portable ladders are brought into service, their feet shall be prevented from slipping by securing the stiles at or near their upper or lower ends, by any anti-slip device or by any other arrangement of equivalent effectiveness. As a priority, ladders should be secured firmly using all possible means. Ladders used for access should be long enough for their uprights to protrude sufficiently beyond the access platform. Ladders in several sections shall be so used as to ensure that they are secure. The holding of the ladder by another person as a safety measure shall not be allowed.’</p>
<p class="contents">This text is well meant and perfectly in order legally. I can absolutely assure you that, at home in Mora in Dalarna, where I live, as well as in the Swedish Parliament and also in all other national parliaments, these matters are being carefully looked into. In view of the subsidiarity principle in the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam, is it right of the European Parliament to legislate at this very high level of detail? Instead what we ought to be doing is aiming for a directive which specifies our objectives. In that way, we can allow the Member States themselves, their people and their elected representatives in national parliaments and governments to be responsible for the existence of regulations ensuring that working life does not involve unnecessary risks. Allow them to determine how to frame the rules so as to fulfil the requirements of the directive in the best way. National legislation is being enacted in this area to add to the existing national laws. The two sides of industry are also extremely active in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">We Swedish Christian Democrats shall be voting against this report on the basis of the subsidiarity principle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This has led to a document that has clearly won considerable approval, which is quite an achievement on this very important political issue. This text is a good answer to Mr Bushill-Matthews’ voters and what Europe does for them. It is something concrete and it concerns people is every day lives. Using the enterprises’ language, I should like to say that this directive is based not only on social solidarity and social justice, but on competition issues as well. That is why we try to help applicant countries to develop and implement health and safety policies.</p>
<p class="contents">These health and safety policies are the Commission’s first priority in the social agenda. Apart from undertaking the specific commitments set out in this agenda, we are starting to prepare a communication on health and safety and future strategies for health and safety. The European Parliament has many new ideas and we expect your contribution to this communication.</p>
<p class="contents">If we turn to the current text, this is the second amendment of Directive 89/655 EEC concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for work equipment. It aims to prevent falls from heights by setting minimum requirements for the use of the relevant work equipment such as ladders and scaffolding. Falls from heights account for more than 10% of occupational accidents and one in ten of such falls results in permanent invalidity or death. This is a particularly serious problem, which is costly for business and society and which, more importantly, causes suffering and human tragedy for the people directly involved and their families.</p>
<p class="contents">The current proposal is a very important step towards doing something concrete about this. I welcome your broad support. It is obvious it is something more than bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Since my reply must deal with the technical details because of the rules of this procedure, I have to stick to the written text. On your amendments and the ideas behind the amendments, we are happy to accept Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 9, 11, 15, 20 and 22 as they stand. On the text of Amendments Nos 10, 13, 14, 18, the Commission agrees with the principles behind the changes proposed and can agree with most of the texts put forward. However, we do propose a few changes or additions, mainly to be sure that we take account of all possible situations and do not create any unintended holes in the safety net we intend to provide with this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 10, we agree with the inclusion of a reference to a prior risk assessment, but would prefer different wording in order to specify the circumstances for the use of ladders. Similarly, on Amendment No 13 we share the desire to ensure that there is no implied obligation to use mobile platforms, but we believe that this is best achieved by the original wording with the possible addition of the phrase “of adequate dimensions”.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, Amendment No 14 will improve the directive, but in order to avoid any risk of a different interpretation in the future, we would prefer a slight change to the wording, which would include retaining the requirement to prevent the sections of a multi-section ladder from moving relative to each other. This is because even slight sudden movements that do not threaten the security of the ladder may cause the worker to lose balance and fall.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with the main idea behind Amendment No 18 and the references to the securing of the decks and the prevention of unintentional movement. However, we must oppose the reference to “load-bearing surfaces” as they will cause confusion over what is meant by “deck”. We also must oppose the reference to planks forming the scaffold deck as this implies that scaffolding systems that use prefabricated boards are not covered. Likewise Amendments Nos 16 and 19 need only slight modification to avoid difficulties in interpretation later on.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 21, 23, 24, 25 and 26. This is not a question of a political disagreement but simply that Amendments Nos 6 and 7 change accepted standard texts while the other amendments repeat what is stated elsewhere. We must endeavour to keep Community legislation as straightforward as possible and avoid any inconsistencies in the overall framework. This is especially important in the field of health and safety where businesses sometimes have in implementing rules because of their complexities.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendment No 1, the issue is already covered by the text. In the same way, the definition of “collective fall protection safeguards” given in Amendment No 8 is not necessary. These safeguards have already been mentioned in the basic directive and there is no risk of confusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Also Amendment No 21 is unnecessary as this area is already covered by Directive 92/57/EEC and it refers to a specific paragraph. Here again, if we repeat something that has already been defined, it is a potential for conflicting interpretations. Amendment No 5 is covered by Amendment No 22, which is accepted as it stands. Amendment No 6 covers training, which is already incorporated in Recital 7, and research, which is beyond the scope of this directive. Furthermore, Recital 7 uses a standard form of words. There are thus several reasons for not accepting Amendment No 6. Amendment No 7 advocates a change in Article 2(3). This is established standard wording and the Commission therefore cannot accept a change to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 23 cannot be supported by the Commission as the issue of health and safety committees in enterprises has been appropriately addressed in the framework directive and according to it, detailed regulation is a matter of subsidiarity for all Member States. Amendments Nos 24 and 25 must be rejected because training is already adequately covered, especially following Amendments Nos 16, 19 and 22. In spite of its simplicity, the Commission cannot support Amendment No 26 as we prefer to specify the circumstances for the use of ladders.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I am happy that we agree on all main issues and our differences lie in a few technical points. I repeat my appreciation of your extensive work and it will improve the protection of workers in this field. We will improve the protection we intend to provide with this initiative.</p>

I am particularly pleased with the comments she has made. I hope that Parliament’s amendments will be adopted tomorrow as I am sure they will be, despite the elements in this Parliament which do not seem to want to join in and that we will have an interesting discussion with the Council. I wonder if the Commissioner would join me in deploring the way in which this report has been treated, with parts – notably the ladders – being isolated and suggestions made – by Mr Bushill-Matthews for one – that this is something that is futile if not childish.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I hope you will agree that this is a Treaty obligation for us all to look at. The basis is Article 138, which was previously Article 118a – and if I am right, we must look into the costs – administrative and otherwise – for small-to-medium-sized businesses, as laid down in the Treaty already. This is a small-to-medium-sized-business-friendly piece of legislation, but more importantly it is friendly to the workers who have to use this equipment. That is why the legislation is there and is to be applied across the European Union. If only Mr Bushill-Matthews had been here when I first started, he would have heard some of the arguments which I wish to place before this House as to why it is important to have EU legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a great problem when you do not hear the arguments, but you merely come in with your own loaded thoughts. Indeed, it is a great shame, and I hope that Mrs Villiers will come back some time and perhaps pay a visit to our committee so she can hear some of the debate about this report as well – because I noticed that she disappeared soon after she made her point – maybe we will read about that in the papers as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say to Mr Bushill-Matthews, who is here, that the journalist on the <span class="italic">Daily Mail,</span> to which you sent your press releases on this report, rang me back and asked me about a specific amendment that contained your phraseology and your words, which he said was the nonsense part of this whole directive.
