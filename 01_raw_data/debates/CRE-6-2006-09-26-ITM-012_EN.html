<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Camiel Eurlings (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, we are bringing to the final debate this report on Turkey at a special moment. This report is preceding the European Commission’s progress report, and therefore provides a unique opportunity to influence and enrich the stance of the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not mean, however, that there would be so much need to influence the Commission on this point, because the report as I have presented it to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and as I present it now here in this sitting, has been prepared in very good cooperation with the European Commission and with Commissioner Rehn himself. I also think of Mr Rehn’s words when I presented the report in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, words of welcome which were very clear.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted the report by a large majority: 54 votes to 6. The report has been described as fair but tough: fair because it is based on facts and is constructive; tough because, unfortunately, there is reason for criticism of at least a strong push from Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic conclusion of the report is that we, as the European Parliament, regret that there is a slowdown in reforms. We had expected at the start of the negotiations in 2004, when we made a decision, that the impressive reforms of 2002-2004 would continue. Unfortunately they have slowed down. That is not to say that nothing has happened. I compliment the Turkish politicians on their ninth package of legislative reforms and the many proposals that were adopted by Parliament. I also compliment the Turkish officials for their professional work in the negotiations so that the first chapter could be provisionally closed.</p>
<p class="contents">So why then is there criticism? Because we would have liked to have seen more progress in the mainstream of further political reforms. I will mention a few vital areas. Firstly, on freedom of expression, we as a Parliament have already criticised some parts of the new penal code. Although it was a big improvement, some articles raised doubts – Article 301, first and foremost. Some people have been set free. However, the reconfirmation of the sentence of Mr Hrant Dink proves, as Ali Birand, the famous journalist, also stated so clearly, that Article 301 has to be changed or repealed. I ask the Turkish Government and the Turkish people to see the need for this. It is important for the freedom of the Turkish people, it is important for the image of Turkey in Europe and the wider world.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, a lot needs to be done as regards freedom of religion. I was in Turkey a few weeks ago. Until recently, monasteries and churches have been taken away, and the new proposed law on foundation, as the Commissioner said, is not good enough. So please let this stop. Give back the properties to the religious minorities and change the proposal of the law on foundation so that if they cannot be given back, then at least there is a good compensation for the minority churches.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, the training of clergy must resume. Since 1971 seminaries are closed, and for a country that wants to be European, it is very important that it should be as easy to build a Christian church in Turkey as it is to build a Turkish mosque in the rest of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We said we want priority for these reforms because that is the European spirit. We ask it as a Parliament, and Turkey signed, in the revised accession partnership, a commitment to achieve the short-term priorities before the end of 2007, and then we as a Parliament asked Turkey to do what was agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">A third situation that worries us is the situation in the south-east. We strongly condemn the PKK and any terrorism. We strongly condemn it – there is never any excuse for terrorism; but at the same time we ask Turkey to try to find peaceful interlocutors, try to find a political way and invest in the social and economic development of the south-east.</p>
<p class="contents">A last major point: Cyprus. It was agreed at the start of negotiations that there would be no formal recognition ceremony by Turkey of Cyprus but that there would be an Ankara Protocol as a kind of normalisation of relations. The protocol was signed, the Council asked for it to be implemented before the end of 2006, and it is now a matter of credibility – also for the credibility of our institutions – that Turkey fulfils its commitments and implements a protocol before the end of 2006. As a Parliament, we also make it very clear that we want to see more efforts in the northern part of the island in terms of trade regulation. But once again, Turkey cannot just sign up to this: it should do what it promised to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall finish with one last point – I shall try to make it short. There was a vast majority in the committee for the basic line of the report and I thank the Members for it because with it we are giving an important signal. There was unease, however, because of an amendment on the Armenian genocide. Allow me in two sentences to make my position clear. In paragraph 50 of the report, as rapporteur I tried to put forward a position that is both strong but also realistic. It says that recognition as such is formally not a criterion, but for a country on its road to Europe it is indispensable to come to terms with its past and therefore we want committees, research, open discussion. I think that is a line that is strong but fair and beyond criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that, with an amendment from Mrs De Keyser, another text has been voted in as well. It is of course the responsibility of every Member of Parliament to vote as he or she pleases, but if you ask for my opinion, the text in paragraph 50 is the best text and the one that takes us the furthest.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been speaking for too long. I want to thank Members once again for their support up till now and I just want to say that I hope, as the rapporteur for Turkish accession, that this signal – a tough but fair signal – will be perceived by Turkish politicians and the Turkish public as an encouragement to restart the reform process, to vigorously support those people who want it, so that I as rapporteur can be more positive in my next report than I have been here today.</p>

Finland, the country holding the Presidency of the Council, will naturally take into consideration the views expressed by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In early November, the Commission will be bringing out its annual report on Turkey’s progress in the negotiations on its accession. The European Council will examine this report very carefully. In today’s debate, I would like to focus attention on a few points in those negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency shares the European Parliament’s concern regarding the reform process in Turkey. Turkey must accelerate the implementation of political reforms and the reform process generally. Full and effective implementation is vital to ensuring that the reforms are permanent and ongoing. We need concrete results.</p>
<p class="contents">We share Parliament’s concern regarding the slow progress that Turkey has made in the crucially important areas of fundamental freedoms and human rights. Although the situation in Turkey has improved compared with five years ago, the country needs to continue making tangible reforms, especially in the areas of freedom of expression, freedom of religion, cultural rights, women’s rights and action against torture and ill treatment. Most of these issues have been described as priorities in the Revised Accession Partnership, and Turkey must implement the appropriate action without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, the Presidency is awaiting the adoption of the Ninth Reform package regarding Turkish law, whose purpose it is to provide answers to some of the problems that I have just mentioned. The new laws must be fully compatible with EU standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council expects immediate action from Turkey on the matter of freedom of expression in particular, in order to avoid in future the kind of legal action that has been brought against people who have expressed non-violent opinions. As regards religious freedom, we expect legislation on the rights of the non-Muslim minorities to be fully implemented without delay, in accordance with European standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Parliament, we are concerned about the situation in South-East Turkey. The Presidency has condemned the recent bomb attacks in various places in Turkey, and regards them as senseless terrorist acts. Terrorist acts can never be justified. This is a multi-agency issue which we are following carefully as part of the reform process. Turkey quickly needs to evolve a comprehensive approach in order to reduce regional inequality. The aim here should be for Turkey to provide better opportunities for all its citizens, including the Kurds, and to strengthen the country’s economic, social and cultural potential.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the Copenhagen criteria, Turkey’s progress in the accession process is being judged within the context of the requirements of the Negotiating Framework, which include the implementation of the Additional Protocol to the Ankara Agreement. Progress here is essential for continuing the talks. Turkey must apply the Protocol fully to all the Member States of the European Union and remove obstacles to the free movement of goods, including transport restrictions. The initiation of talks fundamentally connected with this issue will depend on how Turkey discharges its contractual obligations towards the Member States. If it were to neglect these, this would have an overall impact on the progress of talks.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress is being monitored with regard to all the essential issues which were mentioned in the declaration of 21 September 2005 by the European Community and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">A spirit of enterprise and determination will need to continue if the European Union’s standards and membership requirements are to be met. This determination is not just required of the applicant country, but also of the Union itself. This is why I want to say very clearly that Turkey’s accession process is very important to us and the Finnish Presidency will do all it can to ensure that progress can be made in negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union supports Turkey in its aspirations to membership, but progress in the accession negotiations obviously depends very largely on Turkey’s own actions. The accession process will continue while Turkey continues its process of reform and discharges its obligations accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Straight after that we are both leaving for Sofia, in Bulgaria, and Bucharest, in Romania, to communicate today’s decision and the content of Parliament’s debate to these two future EU Member States. I regret that I have to serve two masters, but the last debate overran slightly and I am afraid that I have no alternative. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in the previous debate Mrs Lehtomäki made a statement on behalf of the Council on the future of enlargement. Like President Barroso, I welcome the statement and reiterate the Commission’s commitment and our policy of a consolidated enlargement agenda, which covers south-eastern Europe apart from Bulgaria and Romania. It covers Turkey and Croatia and the other countries of the western Balkans. We are cautious about any new commitments, but we stick to our existing commitments to the countries of south-eastern Europe<span class="italic"> pacta sunt servanda</span>. They have the prospect of joining the European Union once they meet the conditions, as promised for the countries of the western Balkans at the Thessaloniki Summit in 2003. While we prepare internally for a new institutional settlement, the gradual and carefully-managed accession process continues with these countries of south-eastern Europe. We cannot take a sabbatical from our responsibilities for peace, stability, liberty and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect the EU Member States to be able to agree on a new institutional settlement in 2008; hence the new institutional settlement should have been born by the time the next member is likely to join. If Croatia, which is likely to be the next new member, pursues reforms with rigour and results, it should be ready to join the Union around the end of this decade.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me thank Mr Eurlings for his report, which includes useful elements for the assessment of Turkey’s progress towards accession. I also thank the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee for their contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey’s accession is a matter of constant debate. It is true that the momentum for reform has slowed down in Turkey in the past year. However, we should not lose sight of the progress accomplished in the last decade, nor of our commitments towards Turkey. The goal of the negotiations started on 3 October 2005 is full EU membership of Turkey, and by its very nature it is an open-ended process with no automatism.</p>
<p class="contents">This commitment stems from a solid understanding that integrating Turkey into the EU is of mutual benefit. In its own interest, the European Union needs a democratic, stable and increasingly prosperous Turkey. Turkey’s strategic significance was once again illustrated by its decision to take part in the UNIFIL mission in Lebanon.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past twelve months, there has been a lack of progress in the reforms. It is important that new initiatives are taken and that tangible progress is still achieved before the Commission presents its report on 8 November.</p>
<p class="contents">First, freedom of expression is the cornerstone of the reforms. Journalists, authors, publishers and human rights activists still face judicial proceedings for violations of the notorious Article 301 of the Penal Code on the vague grounds of ‘insulting Turkishness’. In July, the final ruling of the Court of Cassation in the case of Hrant Dink established jurisprudence on that notorious Article 301, which violates European standards. Thus, despite the acquittal of novelist Elif Shafak last week, freedom of expression remains under threat in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">The judicial proceedings have a chilling effect and damage the important work carried out by journalists, intellectuals and activists. I have repeatedly expressed my concerns about this, most recently last week to Foreign Minister Gül. Frankly, I am rather tired of repeating myself endlessly, but I shall continue to do so until the end of my term, unless this shortcoming is corrected. I cannot even imagine a Member State in the European Union which does not respect such a fundamental principle as freedom of expression. It is now high time for Turkey to amend the restrictive articles in the penal code and bring them truly into line with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This matters also as regards the internal debate on Turkey to which the rapporteur, Mr Eurlings, referred. An open and constructive exchange of views is needed in Turkey, including the most sensitive issues. That is necessary both for the democratic process in Turkey and for facing tomorrow’s challenges, as well as for Turkey’s reconciliation with its neighbours, including Armenia. Reconciliation is a principle that is both the origin and the outcome of the European integration process. I therefore urge Turkey to continue to take concrete steps in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to freedom of religion, I fully agree with the rapporteur and the Council on this important matter. The Law on Foundations currently debated in the Turkish Grand National Assembly should address the shortcomings. Restrictions applied to property rights, management of foundations and training of the clergy must be lifted.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also Muslim minorities that face discrimination. The Alevi, a community of 15 to 20 million people, face legal restrictions on establishing places of worship and receive no financial support from the State religious authority.</p>
<p class="contents">In the south-east, the spiral of violence undermines positive developments witnessed since emergency rule was lifted some years ago. Terrorism is our common enemy. Turkey and the EU unequivocally condemn the PKK, and I deeply deplore the loss of innocent lives in the attacks that have taken place throughout the year in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">However, a policy based merely on security considerations is not sufficient to address the problems of the region. The south-east faces an aggravated socio-economic situation, due not only to security threats but also to high unemployment and poverty. We expect Turkey soon to adopt a comprehensive strategy targeting all the needs of this region: economic, social and cultural.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the obligations which Turkey needs to respect. We expect Turkey to implement fully the Additional Protocol of the Ankara Agreement. That means that Turkey should remove obstacles to the free movement of goods, including those on means of transport, which are in breach of the Association Agreement. Hence Turkey should open its ports to vessels under flags of all Member States, including the Republic of Cyprus. As set out in the Negotiating Framework, progress in the negotiations also depends on Turkey meeting its obligations. Let me reiterate that Turkey’s obligations under the Ankara Protocol are not linked to the ending of economic isolation of the Turkish-Cypriot community.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft report rightly calls on the Council to make renewed efforts to reach an agreement on the trade facilitation regulation concerning the northern part of Cyprus. The Commission fully supports the serious efforts of the Finnish Presidency to overcome the stalemate on the trade regulation, thus helping the Council and the EU Member States to live up to their commitments. It is also appropriate to underline the continuation of the constructive commitment by Turkey in finding a comprehensive settlement on the Cyprus question, acceptable to both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, based upon the principles on which the EU was founded.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, it is in our mutual interest for Turkey to pursue its democratic, societal and economic transformation with the goal of joining the EU. If Turkey succeeds, with our consistent support, it can become an ever-sturdier bridge between civilisations, at a moment when the relationship between Europe and Islam is the greatest challenge of our time. Turkey is an important benchmark in this regard and it matters for our own future and for the future of our children and grandchildren.</p>
<p class="contents">While the Commission is prepared to support Turkey through the process, it is ultimately up to Turkey to carry it forward. The extraordinary parliamentary session convened last week to accelerate the adoption of the ninth reform package is a welcome step in the right direction. Yet a more resolute reform process is needed for Turkey to progress on the path to EU accession. In this process, we should remember that – as Prime Minister Erdogan suggested – the Copenhagen criteria should be called the Ankara criteria, since they are there, in the first place, for the sake of Turkish citizens and their rights, not merely to please the EU.</p>

Unfortunately, the report as it now stands has, on account of the opponents of Turkish accession to the EU, become a cause for disappointment for many of us, including reform-minded Turks, those Europeans who want Turkey as an ally, and not least women in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur for women’s rights, I have seen that Turkey is definitely making headway in the area of women’s rights, partly as a result of pressure from the EU in general and the European Parliament, in particular. The enlargement strategy is effective in encouraging reforms in candidate states, but it only works if those reforms are also recognised. As Mr Eurlings’ party in the Netherlands likes to put it, ‘we need sweet after sour’, in other words we need light after dark.</p>
<p class="contents">The Eurlings report fails to recognise Turkey’s achievements to date. It is negative, not only in terms of substance, but also in its tone. That is a sure-fire way of sabotaging reforms in Turkey by undermining public support for them and by equipping Turkish eurosceptics with a powerful weapon for the forthcoming elections in Turkey. What we really want, surely, is for that criticism to be translated into action, for that will benefit everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">We could turn things on its head and mention reforms that have been successful, acquaint ourselves with the first steps that Turkey has taken in order to come to terms with its past and promote further attempts, but I urge you to remove acknowledgement of genocides as a condition for membership, for that does not form part of the Copenhagen criteria and has, in all fairness, never been put to any of the other Member States. All references to a privileged partnership should be deleted, for the objective of the negotiations is that a reformed Turkey should become a Member State. If these changes are made, we can keep the Turks in Europe, welcoming this secular state with its Muslim people as our ally in the fight against terrorism and extremism. If we fail to implement these changes, we will leave reformers in Turkey, millions of men and women, simply out in the cold. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to extend the warmest of thanks to Mr Eurlings for the very well-balanced report he has presented. A good deal of the criticism expressed by one or other group today has been raised by members of the group for the first time in this report. This, too, should not be forgotten, for example in connection with the issue of the media.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to establish that the negotiations are under way and that both sides need to contribute constructively to these. We agree that the prospect of EU membership should be extended to Turkey, but we need to make it clear – as the Commissioner also said – that the pace of the reform process has slowed since 3 October. It is right and necessary to point this out, and to do so on the basis of a number of specific questions relating to human rights, minority rights and freedom of expression and religion. It is also important to make it clear that these are the preconditions for progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament stated in a decision at the start of negotiations that the political criteria should be met at the start of negotiations and not at the end.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of things about this debate are bothering me – this is almost a problem of mentality – for example, that it is not permitted to mention facts in case this is taken as a criticism or misinterpreted in Turkey. Such negotiations cannot be conducted unless the facts are indeed mentioned. Only then can we make progress. After all, our job is to take our citizens with us on this path. If the conditions are not met and the facts are not clearly stated, we have a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Only those who meet all the criteria, including the political criteria and the preconditions for the negotiations, can join the EU. This means that implementation of the Ankara Protocol must be set in motion once and for all, an endeavour that has failed up to now. The Cyprus issue must be resolved this year, as stipulated, and cannot be postponed further, as to do so would mean no one taking us seriously any more.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, it must also be stated that the EU’s capacity to cope with enlargement is of vital significance. This also means that the financial perspectives under the negotiating mandate do not permit negotiations on the chapters with financial implications any earlier than 2013. That, too, should be made clear, as these provisions in the negotiating mandate show that the EU currently lacks the capacity to cope with enlargement in view of its financial possibilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Turkey is a key partner in a crucial region. It is, now more than ever, evident that we must tie Turkey to the European Union and that we must support the reformers in that country. Turkey has committed itself to an operation by the United Nations Force in Lebanon. In that respect, we must assist Turkey to play a positive and constructive role in that region. We need a partner there as a matter of priority.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiation process is the best way of developing a better and stronger relationship with Turkey, and, while we know that the negotiations will take some time, we remain of the opinion that a critical, yet constructive, dialogue is the best way of bringing that process to a successful conclusion. Consequently, this House’s reports must be balanced and should not lose sight of the end goal, namely membership. We must build on the progress that has been made in recent years, whilst acknowledging that delays have hampered that progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group has tried, by means of a series of amendments, to make the report more balanced in a number of areas and, in response to what Mr Brok said, our group should not, of course, automatically accept what the Committee on Foreign Affairs produces. The process is not served by speculation about alternative forms of association; that is our permanent objection to Article 71 in the report. We should leave you in no doubt about that.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations are being held with a view to full membership. That is, fortunately, something that is clearly formulated in the Eurlings report, on which we are agreed, and I am in no doubt as to Mr Eurlings’ intentions in that respect. What is clear, though – and I share Mr Brok's view on this – is that the present institutional frameworks will be unable to cope with the accession of new Member States following the accession of the two we have been discussing today. That too has, fortunately, been clearly spelled out in the Eurlings report: without the necessary reforms in the framework of the institutional process, we will not accept any further decisions about enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn to the two key points in the report. First of all, with regard to the Armenian genocide, I share the view which Mr Eurlings has adopted in this respect. After all, the compromise that we had struck in the negotiations is namely exactly what we need. It is an appeal to the Turkish Government to recognise this genocide, and to have a good internal debate in Turkey, but without stipulating this as a condition for EU membership. I hope that tomorrow, we will manage to remove this section from the report. This whole issue does not, strictly speaking, form part of the Copenhagen criteria, and that is how it should stay.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as for Cyprus, we agree that the Ankara Protocol needs ratifying. At the same time, we also think that we should do something to help the Turkish Cypriots in Cyprus more. This evening, our group will again be discussing the voting list and, on that basis and on the basis of tomorrow’s vote, we will pass our final judgment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament’s special role inside the accession process is surely to promote the growth of parliamentary democracy in Turkey. Our criticism should be constructive, designed to encourage Turkey’s path to modernisation and not to block it.</p>
<p class="contents">We are correct to stress the existing impediments to freedom of expression, but we should not put up spurious blocks to the continuation of the process that we have started. We must pace the reaction, try to be consistent and, above all, be fair, especially on Cyprus and Armenia.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey’s candidature is a defining moment for the Union. Should there be a train crash in Cyprus there would be two trains involved. One of them carries the efforts of Turkey to create a viable form of European Islam, where the Prophet meets the Enlightenment. The success of that mission will drag both Islam and Christianity far away from the terrible certainties of the 14th century. The second train carries European efforts to develop a strong common foreign security and defence policy, a task towards which Turkey will make an extraordinary contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps the involvement of Turkey’s troops under French command in Lebanon will prove to be a turning point in the life of CFSP and a welcome sign of things to come.</p>

I am not talking about the many critical paragraphs in which the Turkish Government is urged to do more and to implement reforms more quickly. An appeal has been made, with good reason, to the Turkish Government to remove the infamous Article 301, which has led to dozens of trials involving writers and journalists, from the criminal law as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem I have with the report is the few paragraphs where the report is losing total control, particularly the paragraph in which the recognition of the Armenian genocide is considered as some sort of condition for accession, and the Cyprus paragraphs, in which Turkey appears to be the only guilty party. The original report, as submitted by the rapporteur, was critical, yet fair, and we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs have managed to reach sound agreements during our discussions, which means that the report can be improved with many amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Where we went wrong is that in the closing stages of those discussions, clauses were added to the report by means of all kinds of oral amendments, which brought imbalance to a previously balanced report. Whilst this may have been a huge success for a number of lobby groups, this has considerably changed the report for the worse. What we want, what my group wants by tabling a number of amendments, is actually to return to the original Eurlings report, which was, in our view, both critical and fair.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore pleased to hear and also read in the interviews with the rapporteur in the Turkish press that he, on the basis that ‘a fault confessed is half redressed’, is prepared to support the attempts to restore the report to its original form. I will therefore be counting on his support during tomorrow’s votes.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is it so important that the report should be critical and, at the same time, fair? I very much want the European Parliament to continue to play a role in the reform debate in Turkey by supporting those groups and those people who, day in and day out, are fighting for the same things that we are. It is those very people who in the last few weeks have come up to us and told us that this report, in its current form, is of no use to them. It is only benefiting those in Turkey who are opposed to reforms, and I do not want to see Parliament helping those people who do not want Turkey to move forward.</p>

<p class="contents">Last week, I took part in the Subcommittee on Human Rights’ visit to Turkey, and I have come back with a very different impression to the one I had hoped for. In particular, we found a tragic situation in Turkish Kurdistan, that is, it was a completely militarised zone. It is one thing for us all to condemn terrorism, but it is quite something else to regard an entire population as terrorists, to imprison minors merely for giving the V-sign, to persist with the logic of torture and to dismiss those judges who, for example, investigate police officers held responsible for an attack.</p>
<p class="contents">We, as Parliament, must support the DTP’s call for a ceasefire and we must call on the PKK to respond positively to that appeal. We must call on the Turkish Government to begin immediate talks with the DTP with the aim of reaching a political solution, as there is no other possible alternative.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the problems do not just concern the Kurdish issue: we were all delighted with the solution reached regarding Elif Shafak, just as we were previously with the one regarding Orhan Pamuk, but there is a danger that this is window dressing just for the West: there are at least another 80 writers and journalists who are standing trial under Article 301.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Turkish Parliament has approved the anti-terrorism law in its original wording, despite opposition not only from Europe, but also from the United Nations. Furthermore, we have been able to ascertain that, in Hakkari Province, which is also in the Kurdish area, 7 000 out of the 250 000 people living there are village guardians, and so we have a situation where a police force – the disbandment of which the European Union has been requesting for some time – is directly answerable to the government.</p>
<p class="contents">The commitment that we are asking Parliament, the Commission and the Council to make is to continue down the road of holding talks with Turkey, but with a focus on human rights and not just on ideological debates or economic interests. We believe that the future can bring a Europe that is multi-ethnic and multi-faith, but there must always be respect for everyone’s human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For over 40 years, this country, which is applying for European Union membership, has had an antagonistic attitude towards its neighbours, which include European Union Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also our right and obligation not only to demand explanations for past injustices, but also to demand that Turkey address the deteriorating situation involving infringements of the human rights of the Christian minority in Turkey. This minority can only depend on us to take up its cause. In this context, one cannot fail to mention the scandalous statements made by representatives of the Turkish Government in relation to the lecture given by Pope Benedict XVI in Regensburg. By pandering to the extreme sections of Muslim public opinion, this government has taken two steps backwards. In spite of this, we should not turn our backs on Turkey. However, I am sure that forms of cooperation other than membership can bear economic and political fruit.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be stressed that significant imbalances remain in our attitude towards future enlargements. Significant progress has been made in the political process towards Turkey’s membership of the European Union, whereas the process towards Ukraine’s membership has been put on hold, although it is not Ukraine that loses 250 cases at the Court of Human Rights each year. It is not Ukrainians who apply to us for asylum in their droves. It is not Ukraine that perpetuates tensions with its neighbours as a result of current and past conflicts. As long as this imbalance in political relations remains, Ukraine will remain confined to the straitjacket thrust upon it 60 years ago as a result of the decrees passed by Stalin's Communist Russia.</p>

Anti-European forces in Turkey are teaming up in intransparent state structures, nationalistic circles in the army, police, gendarmerie and security services. To what extent do those forces, summed up under the heading of ‘deep state’, hamper the present accession negotiations?</p>
<p class="contents">There are persistent speculations to the effect that this self-same ominous ‘deep state’ is linked to the killing of the Italian priest Andrea Santoro in Trabzon in February of this year, and that brings me to the altogether humiliating position of the Christian Church in Turkey, the clergy and lay members of which are considered to be foreigners. In fact, contact between churches and government is made via the Foreign Affairs Ministry. I should like the Council and Commission to take action on this score. Or does the fear of Islamic mobilisation in Turkey make you reluctant to insist on full freedom of religion in the land of Atatürk? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Turkey’s reforms need only exist on paper for us to celebrate supposed progress. For example, the implementation of an obligation to adopt international human rights conventions that has been incumbent on Turkey for more than 50 years by virtue of its membership of the Council of Europe was celebrated as a great success in 2004. In 1999, the European Council decided that the Copenhagen criteria had to be met before the start of negotiations. In addition, further political conditions have been laid down in connection with the Greece/Cyprus conflict. As if it were not enough that the Commission has been very generous in its interpretation with regard to Turkey thus far, now the deadline for the recognition of Cyprus is to be extended once again, in the vague hope that Turkey may yet meet it.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey is dismissing the demand that has now been made for it to actually meet the criteria as politically motivated and unrealistic, and seems to regard Parliament’s decision as non-binding. As is typical of Turkey, it is even asking MEPs to kindly show political sense and thus to continue to paper over the cracks. Reality looks rather different, however, namely that Turkey is simply still not ready to join Europe. There is no real recognition of Cyprus, no real sense of any wrongdoing with regard to the Armenian genocide and no real willingness to treat the Kurdish people properly. There can be only one answer to this – which, incidentally, citizens across Europe have been giving for a long time – we should give every possible support to the forces for reform in Turkey, but say a clear ‘no’ to the accession of Turkey to the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a subject currently under the spotlight throughout the world on account of recent events, the polemics that have arisen, the attention given to Pope Benedict XVI’s words in Germany and the reactions in the Islamic world.</p>
<p class="contents">A very important meeting took place yesterday, which demonstrated how important a constructive and positive dialogue between representatives of different religions – between Christians and Muslims – is for all of us. The meeting was based on the principle of reciprocity, according to which both sides have the right to uphold their own ideas, to defend their own values and to be able to manifest their own faith; this applies to Muslims in areas where Christians are in the majority, and to Christians where Muslims are in the majority.</p>
<p class="contents">The Turkish ambassador was also present yesterday at Castel Gandolfo for a meeting with the Pope. They spoke at length about these issues, and therefore I believe that Benedict XVI's forthcoming visit to Turkey will be fundamentally important. It will be an important trip because, in my view, it will encourage dialogue between Christians and Muslims, between the Muslim majority and the Christian – Catholic, Protestant or Orthodox – minority living in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, with Mr Eurlings and Mr Tannock, we have tabled an amendment and are putting it before the whole Chamber, including the other political groups. Its aim is to encourage dialogue between Christians and Muslims, between Christianity and Islam, <span class="italic">inter alia</span> through a strong message from this Parliament. Let us exclude extremism, let us isolate fundamentalists, and let us hold a dialogue with those who truly want to build peace in the Middle East and Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, helping the reforms and encouraging dialogue between Christians and Muslims are in Turkey’s own interests. The progress that that country is making on its journey towards the European Union can be measured principally by the results achieved in the dialogue between religions, in respect for minority rights, and in respect for the civil rights of everyone living in Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We certainly agree with him on the great importance of interreligious dialogue, especially between Christian religions and Islam. It was for this very reason that we objected to the Pope’s statements. Nevertheless, I appreciate both his apology for the statement in question and the initiative agreed yesterday with the ambassadors of Islamic countries to revive this dialogue. It is for this reason, in particular, that it is so important to us that Turkey have the prospect of membership – have a path towards EU membership – as this is a means of lending support to this dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey is also important to us as a strategic partner in the Middle East peace process, which can undoubtedly be promoted appropriately by means of Turkey’s path towards EU membership. Nevertheless – and on this point I agree wholeheartedly with the rapporteur, Mr Eurlings, to whom I am obliged for his efforts – we must give criticism where criticism is due. Years ago, I myself was a Parliament rapporteur. I am delighted that the process has been continued, that we are negotiating with Turkey, that some changes have indeed been made in that country. On the other hand, however, I am disappointed that Turkey has made insufficient progress on a good few issues. One example is freedom of expression: although many authors are acquitted, the scandal is that they are prosecuted for their opinions in the first place. That is unacceptable and must be prevented.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the Kurdish question, as has already been said, no one in this House has any sympathy for terrorism, and the PKK should declare its lasting support for the peace process once and for all. The Government must do its part to promote peace, however – economically, socially and politically. It must detach itself from those forces – the military and the security apparatus – that do not want peaceful dialogue – particularly with regard to the Kurdish question.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect – even though there are a few more things we should like to change – the rapporteur has certainly been at pains to make it clear that we do want Turkey to take the path towards EU membership, but that is why we shall not dispense with our legitimate demands – including in Turkey’s interests – as the greatest beneficiary of the process of reform is not the EU, but Turkey itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But it is not the one people say. It is not the harshness or hardening of the report. In fact, when you read this report you find that it repeats what we have, quite rightly, always said. It says that human rights and freedom of expression are not adequately respected in Turkey. It says that religious minorities do not have the right to own property, to publish and to teach that they have everywhere in the European Union. It says that when you join a club the least you can do is to shake hands with all the members and not to behave in a warlike manner towards any of them. Finally, it says that there has been an Armenian genocide and that nothing will be built without acknowledging that genocide, and there is nothing new in that. We said it in 2004, we asked for acknowledgement of the genocide in 2004 and in 2005 we said it had to be a precondition. Failure to adopt paragraph 49 would be a climb-down on Parliament’s part.</p>
<p class="contents">The real mystery, however, the real mystery of the Eurlings report is its consistency. Here is an institution that continues, several years later, to say what it said before. In the climate of general degeneration of which Daniel Cohn-Bendit spoke so critically a few moments ago, that is a strange thing. It is strange that here and now we should be saying that what we said yesterday must remain at the centre of our concerns. The mystery of the Eurlings report is that we find, for the first time in the history of negotiations, that we have a State that regresses before accession and not afterwards and that tells us accession must be on its terms and not ours. The mystery of the Eurlings report is that, unlike the Commission in its report on Bulgaria and Romania, this institution has decided to tell the truth, to tell it as it is, to speak the facts, and while I know - Guy Béart said it some time ago – that the first person to tell the truth must be executed, I hope that will not be the case with Mr Eurlings and his report, which I wholeheartedly support.</p>

Nevertheless, I believe that the decision by the Committee on Foreign Affairs tends to be the enemy of the good.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to demonstrate this using two examples. The first is the point that my fellow Member has just raised towards the end of his speech: the Armenian question. I attended and spoke at the conference on the Armenian question in Istanbul that many are now describing as ‘historic’. It was the first conference of its kind, discussing all questions on this subject – including ones by the harshest critics – in Istanbul. The participants in this conference, from Taner Akçam to Halil Berktay to Hrant Dink – who is currently fighting a running battle with Article 301 – all asked me to tell this House explicitly that anyone wishing to assist the debate in Turkey should not make recognition of the genocide a precondition for membership of the EU. For this reason, I should like to make the following appeal to my fellow Members: anyone wishing to help the debate continue, anyone wishing to make a contribution to change in Turkey, should listen to the voices of the opposition in the country. I want to see the border between Turkey and Armenia resemble the border between Germany and France one day, but this will require our help.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that, on the Cyprus issue, too, we all agree that Turkey must keep its side of the bargain and implement the Ankara Protocol. There is also a political aspect to the obligations, however, and this concerns the fact that the people in the north of the island of Cyprus, the Turkish Cypriots, are waiting for us to keep our side of the bargain and put an end to the economic and educational isolation of the people living in the north of the island. Turkey must implement the Ankara Protocol, but we must also help put an end to the isolation of the people of Turkish origin in the north of Cyprus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Its continuing refusal to do all this constitutes clear infringement of the association agreement, of customs union and of the additional protocol, which are its contractual obligations towards the European Union. As such, Turkey is wrong to link them with the Cyprus problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the proposal by the Cypriot government for common use of the port of Famagusta under the aegis of the United Nations, with simultaneous monitoring by the European Commission, combined with the return of the fenced off area of Famagusta to its legitimate residents, may help to overcome the present impasse.</p>
<p class="contents">We, the Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus, are working for the resolution of the Cyprus problem and for respect for the human rights of all Cypriots, both Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots. We are not seeking to put obstacles along Turkey's path towards accession.

Camre (UEN). – </span></span>  <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Thank you, Mr President, the name is the European Union. Mr Erdogan, do you perhaps have a map? That is how easy it is to answer the question of whether Turkey should be accepted into the EU. Turkey is not a European country, and as such Turkey cannot be a member of the European Union. The Heads of State or Government of the EU have promised Turkey that it can, on certain conditions, become an EU member, but those Heads of State or Government do not have the backing of their peoples in so doing. Two thirds of European citizens do not want Turkey to become a member, and the Heads of State or Government will ultimately be compelled to defer to their wishes if they wish to maintain the trust of their electorates.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Eurling’s report is an excellent illustration of how the citizens of the EU base their opinions on facts and not feelings. I would like to recommend voting in favour of the report, regardless of the fact that some of the wordings in it can be construed as meaning that we regard Turkey’s accession as an objective, albeit one still far from being realised. The government of Turkey has demonstrated again and again that it does not recognise European values, whilst at the same time demanding that we should respect unacceptable Turkish and Islamic values. We saw this in the case of the famous Danish cartoons of Mohammed in the <span class="italic">Jyllands-Posten</span> newspaper and also in the Turkish outcry against Pope Benedict’s speech in Regensburg. Turkey illegally occupies Northern Cyprus and believes that it can force the EU to accept this situation. Turkey wishes to stifle Europe’s freedom, our freedom of speech, and membership would mean the formation of a parallel society opposed to European culture. It is time to speak the truth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, this history consists almost entirely of painful events and acts of injustice. It is a history of constant invasions, wars, massacres and the occupation of central and southern Europe. These were the events experienced by Europeans for centuries.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, little has changed and Turkey continues to threaten its neighbours. Turkey is still enforcing an illegal embargo on Armenia and threatening Greece, questioning Greece's right to define the limits of its own territorial waters. It is still discriminating against the Kurds and refuses to acknowledge the full independence of Cyprus, which is a Member State of the European Union. This situation is preposterous. Turkey poses a threat to stability in this region and we, seemingly blind to this fact, are engaged in negotiations with that country with a view to it achieving membership of the European Union. Turkey also fails to respect values that we view as inalienable. It violates and infringes human rights and freedoms and restricts access to them. It persecutes political opposition groups, including the family of Leyla Zana, who was awarded the Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament. Turkey also restricts religious freedom, and this led to the killing of an Italian missionary.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the whole truth about Turkey. I do not agree that Turkey can play the role of a bridge between Europe and the Muslim world. On the contrary, I think that Turkey could become a gateway for terrorism. Turkey is part of a world that is alien to us in terms of its culture and traditions. We have to acknowledge this fact and ask ourselves: <span class="italic">quo vadis</span>, Europe? Should the Union be European or Eurasian?</p>
<p class="contents">Accepting Turkey into the European Union will set a dangerous precedent that will spell the end of Europe as we know it today. Accession negotiations with Turkey should cease as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall, of course, take this opportunity to repeat that we are in favour of Turkey's European prospects.</p>
<p class="contents">In essence, the Eurlings report is not only a warning, a message to Turkey about the steps it must take and the obligations it must honour in order to continue on its path towards Europe. It is also, at the same time, confirmation of the principles upon which the European Union was built, principles from which we have an obligation not to deviate because, when Mr Eurlings speaks of respect for human rights and for minority rights, he is reiterating a European principle. The same applies when he speaks of institutional reforms, the same applies when he speaks of a peaceful resolution to differences and the same applies when he calls for the signature of the Ankara protocol to be honoured and for this protocol to be applied immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, every country, every nation that forgets or does not come to terms with its history, will at some point have problems. Thus, paragraph 50 referring to the tragic history of the Armenians, the Greeks of Pontos and the Assyrians, does precisely that. It calls on Turkey to do so. This paragraph is the outcome of broad agreement and must remain as it stands. Consequently, it must not be changed in one direction or another with amendments that have been tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to remind all those who consider the report to be excessively strict, that there are in Turkey democratic citizens who want a modern Turkey, a developed and progressive Turkey which looks towards Europe and who are fighting for that against the well-known establishment. They need a message which we shall give them by voting for the Eurlings report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I shall avoid introducing distractions – new criteria that do not help a process that is already in itself difficult and requires us to be transparent, consistent and objective. In that respect, I agree with paragraph 50, as proposed by the rapporteur, on the Armenian genocide issue.</p>
<p class="contents">This country plays a crucial role in a geopolitical area that runs from the Mashreq to South-East Asia and the Caucasus. That leads us to support the efforts of all those who are working for a democratic, peaceful Turkey. Having said that, we must be strict in our judgments and demand that the Turkish Government, together with all its state machinery and institutions and Turkish society, make a serious commitment to those areas in which progress has to be more significant and constant. Those areas include civil, political and social rights, freedom of expression and, particularly, the rights of minorities, primarily those of the Kurdish minority and of women, who are in fact in the majority.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope for a firm condemnation of terrorism and the implementation of the Ankara protocol by the agreed deadlines.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, let us try to keep to the point and to be credible and effective in continuing to positively influence internal developments in this country and its external role in establishing peace and stability in an explosive region where the most serious threats to peace are concentrated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In that region we met parents, desperate parents powerless to stop their young sons leaving for the mountains. We were told that more than 200 young men have joined the armed bands of the PKK in the last few weeks. We also met young girls fighting against family feudalism, fighting against economic and social isolation and everyday violence. Many spoke of young girls committing suicide.</p>
<p class="contents">It was not hope, let alone enthusiasm for the future, that we found in Akari and elsewhere. There are many extremely precise facts bearing witness to the violence of the security forces, including against farmers, but also to extra-judicial arrests and the torture of young people as in Diyarbakir this year. The forced resignation of the public prosecutor of Van for demonstrating the responsibility of army members for the Semdinli bombing was also very traumatic. Quite apart from the dirty war exploits it reveals, the frustration of the independence of the judiciary is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone says, everyone knows, there is no military answer to the Kurdish question, and yet, with its checkpoints, tanks, soldiers and armed assaults it is the only one that seems effective. The PKK must call a unilateral ceasefire. If that call is heeded and kept, as we hope, it will have to be followed by a wide-ranging political proposal. The attention and support of the European Union will be crucial. The deteriorating situation in the south-east is affecting the human rights situation in the country as a whole. The anti-terrorist legislation was unanimously criticised by the non-government people we spoke to. It does not comply with international law. It may even cancel out some of the progress made in the latest legislative reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in the south-east is also rekindling a nationalism that is clearly and sometimes violently opposed to democratic aspirations. The writer Magden Perihan talks about a forest fire. She speaks of hooligan lawyers. Immediate action is required, in particular the abolition of Article 301 of the penal code, bringing anti-terrorist legislation into line with international law, the fight against impunity – in 2005 only 2 out of 305 accused policemen were sentenced – the compensation law must be put into effect – 2 000 cases out of 3 000 have been processed in Akari province – and, lastly, the 10% national voting threshold must be abolished, since it prevents popular democratic expression. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The best thing for the EU to do is to demonstrate who is the boss in the negotiation process, but the fact is that, for the moment, the opposite appears to be the case. Turkey refuses to observe its obligations in respect of Cyprus and even dares demand that Europe should break through the so-called isolation of the occupied part of Cyprus.

We endorse it, because it marks a turning point in terms of Parliament’s becoming aware of the reality of the relations between Turkey and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is the most critical of all those that have been produced in this House over the last few decades. In particular, it includes three points that are of decisive importance to us: the reference to the European Union’s absorption capacity as a criterion; the crucial need for Turkey to treat Cyprus, a full member of the European Union, normally; and the recognition of the Armenian genocide as a prerequisite for accession. I must point out to my fellow French Members from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament that that was part of their programme for the 2004 European elections.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of this report – and we do want to see it adopted – must have political consequences. I would begin by asking the Commission to stop playing hide-and-seek and to produce, on 8 November, an authentic report and not a children’s story, as it is wont to do in this area. I would ask the Council of Ministers to take a clear-sighted and courageous approach to the situation and to think about breaking off negotiations, as they make no sense these days to the average person.</p>
<p class="contents">Aside from the case of Turkey, it is the entire enlargement process that is at stake. From now on, no further enlargement should be embarked on until we have provided the European Union with effective decision-making mechanisms and with a sufficient budget. Pressing on in a state of illusion and hypocrisy would compromise the European project, that is to say the construction of a political union, and would further widen the gap between the common sense of the people and the blindness of the leaders.</p>

Let me remind you of our position, which has been clear since the start. Our long-term aim is to have Turkey join because we believe – and this is a genuine political project – in a Europe that is multicultural, secular but multi-faith, peaceful and open to the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">While we, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, have sent out clear signals to Turkey regarding, in particular, human rights, women’s rights, minority rights and the recognition of Cyprus, we have done so in the same constructive spirit. We have done so in order to give concrete expression to a fledgling Europe that will not be the Europe that Mr Sarkozy, Mrs Merkel or probably the Pope want. The challenge is immense and it has already come up against a problem in the shape of the Eurlings report, the new draft of which is unbalanced.</p>
<p class="contents">This report rightly stresses that the democratic process currently under way in Turkey is not progressing as quickly as we had hoped, but it overlooks some crucial progress made by Turkey, particularly in the area of foreign affairs. I am thinking of its role in UNIFIL and also of the fact that it stayed out of the war in Iraq. The aim of the amendments tabled by the PSE Group was thus to make some adjustments or, in other words, to soften the tone.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of Armenia now, Mr Eurlings heckled me just now, and I should like to make myself very clear. Parliament has recognised the Armenian genocide, and there will never be any revisionism in this Chamber. We have a duty to remember the one and a half million Armenians who were massacred in 1915, that is to say before the Turkish Republic under Atatürk was born. We have a duty to remember not only in Europe, but also worldwide, and that is why we have asked for the UN not to delay in sending a committee of international experts on this matter to Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, to use this tragedy, as some people are doing, in order to thwart Turkey’s candidature, or to half-open the door to a vulgar form of Islamophobia, is a trap that we do not wish to fall into. That is why, after some very difficult debates, after – I can assure you – some highly sensitive negotiations within my group, we have taken the line that you have heard on various occasions and that I will make my own. I can assure you that it is a difficult line: we will not demand the recognition of the Armenian genocide as a prerequisite, but, ladies and gentlemen, it is nonetheless quite clear that, when the time comes to review the situation prior to accession, this sensitive point will weigh very heavily in the balance, and Turkey knows it. For the time being, we expect Turkey to fulfil this duty to remember, to consolidate its stabilising role in the Middle East and to make progress in relation to …</p>

Our ‘no’ vote was motivated neither by a belief that Turkey is located outside Europe nor by the fact that it is a Muslim country. We pointed out that Turkey still has a long way to go before it meets the requirements we set for membership of the EU. We also expressed our fears that commencing negotiations would reduce the pressure on Turkey to establish a democratic state under the rule of law with full human rights for women, Kurds, Christians, trade unions and writers. This has proven to be the case. Earlier promising developments have come to a halt and, in some areas, have been replaced by retrograde steps. We now find ourselves in a shameful situation in which the EU is beginning to set requirements for the design of the electoral system and a new constitution in the sovereign state of Turkey. That is not the EU’s job. It is up to Turkey to choose how to meet the EU’s requirements. It is up to Turkey to choose its own solutions. The accession negotiations should be put on hold while we await adequate reforms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its accession would overstretch, overstrain, weaken, perhaps even endanger the EU. Anyone who says so exposes himself to the accusation of refusing to support the process of reform and push the criteria through. Yet even a privileged partnership requires that the Copenhagen criteria be met and the reforms be driven forward, particularly in the interests of the Turkish population itself.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ask ourselves critical questions. Those who want Turkey to have full membership are perhaps looking for a different Turkey, but will find only a different EU – a free-trade area garnished with political elements. As far as Turkey itself is concerned, we must ask ourselves the following questions. Is secularism really compatible with democracy if it is just a minority, an elite project? Is freedom of religion really compatible with state-controlled Islam in the guise of secularism? Are minority rights really compatible with Kemalism, which is a kind of Turkish Jacobinism? These are all serious, well-founded questions that we need to ask ourselves. We must stop running down a blind alley at whose end may lie a rejection of Turkey’s accession by the Member States and peoples of the EU, with dire consequences for Turkey’s inner stability.</p>
<p class="contents">We owe it to Turkey – particularly because it is an important partner – to be honest and to draw up decent criteria for a sound, tailor-made partnership that accords with the interests of both Turkey and the EU, instead of constantly painting our own picture of Turkey, which bears not the slightest resemblance to reality. For this reason, we must take care not to fall below the line taken in the Eurlings report, which I rejected in committee as I did not believe it went far enough. This line should represent our consensus, however, otherwise the signal sent to Turkey would be disastrous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This sent out a clear signal. Today we are debating the report on Turkey’s progress towards accession, a report whose intention should actually be constructive monitoring of negotiations with Turkey and of its accession process. It strikes me, however, that this Eurlings report tends to lose sight of our objective – Turkey’s membership of the EU. I ask myself what we want, therefore. Is it for Turkey to continue on its reform path – in which case we should treat it fairly – or are we saying that whatever it does it will never become a member of the EU? Our Turkish partners are confronted with an assortment of bad examples. The progress achieved and good examples are almost completely ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not fair treatment. It is true that Turkey needs to do further work on its process of reform. It is also true that it needs to comply with its obligations under the Ankara Protocol: human rights, democracy and protection of minorities are preconditions for EU accession.</p>
<p class="contents">If Turkey meets the criteria already laid down and continues to drive forward its process of reform, we, too, must hold to the goal of EU membership. That should be upheld in our report. I would consider this a very clear signal. If the rapporteur or Parliament disagrees, that must be stated in a report on Turkey, otherwise half-truths such as these will diminish Parliament’s credibility. We took a decision in Strasbourg in October 2005 to open accession negotiations with Turkey, and we must hold to it today.</p>
<p class="contents">I have always said that Turkey was not yet ready for accession, but was ready to start negotiations. Europe should show understanding and solidarity in acknowledging and supporting this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Anyone would think that there had been only a very narrow majority in favour of the Eurlings report in committee. The Socialist Group in the European Parliament endorsed the report, however. It was adopted in committee with 54 votes in favour. The same Socialist Group – Mrs De Keyser, Mr Wiersma, both highly respected Members – is now completely opposing what it supported recently in committee. That surprises me greatly. I should like to say to Mrs De Keyser that this is not what I understand by ‘clarity’.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ask ourselves some critical questions, the most important of which is whether we have taken the people with us on this enlargement tour, this negotiating tour of Turkey. The answer is a clear ‘no’. The people are very critical of it. I am addressing this explicitly to the Commission and the Council, too. Where do we think this discussion on the EU’s capacity to cope with enlargement has come from? Where do we think this change of attitude in Parliament has come from? All of us here discuss this issue with citizens fairly frequently, and we sense the scepticism, reticence, and in some cases even large-scale rejection of Turkey’s accession. This is also the reason for my warning to the Council and Commission that no new commitments should be made, no new prospects extended, until the EU has been reformed. We all agree on one thing: we need institutional progress. I should like to add that I believe we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Glossing over the issue never does any good. Mr Eurlings describes very precisely the aspects connected with Turkey that run contrary to the spirit of Europe. I should like to thank him for his report. In fact, virtually no progress has been made there in almost all the politically relevant fields – and in some cases the situation has even deteriorated. Not a single one of the political Copenhagen criteria has been met to date. Nevertheless, against all the rules, negotiations were opened. What we feared last year has come true. By opening accession negotiations, we have let go of one of the last means of exerting pressure to force reform. The process of reform has petered out. Either governmental bodies have failed to implement at all or failed to implement properly reforms that had already been decided on, or – as happened recently – such reforms have been withdrawn by parliamentary decisions. For example, the Turkish Parliament adopted the new Anti-Terror Law despite vehement protests from the Commission, resulting in a further curtailment of the already limited freedom of expression and of the press.</p>
<p class="contents">The Prime Minister of Turkey is using the EU process for his own ends and attempting to Islamise the country by stealth. By doing so, he is playing into the hands of the nationalists, who vehemently oppose Europeanisation. Does Prime Minister Erdoğan even want the country to join the EU? At all events, his refusal to recognise Cyprus underlines the fact that he does not accept the EU. Is this kind of candidate acceptable? Cyprus is a litmus test. If Turkish politicians do not give way on this, the negotiations must be discontinued. Turkey is now under obligation – without any ifs and buts and without imposing any new conditions or demands. The Commission must make this a mission, and the Council of Ministers, too, must demand the fulfilment of and enforce Turkey’s obligation at long last. Anything else would be unfair to the Turkish people, who are pinning their hopes on us. It is only our pressure that will effect change. If we Europeans fall down again, we shall be forever a laughing stock that no one can take seriously. Then nothing will change in that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are forces in Europe following one opinion or the other for reasons of their own. However, with post-enlargement fatigue and the institutional crisis in the European Union, we do not need to add contradictory messages to Turkey. It is time for our message to be clear and in keeping with the decisions adopted. We need to welcome the ninth reform package adopted by the Turkish Government as a positive element. However, if we look at it in essence, it does not meet European specifications. In fact, the statement by the deputy prime minister of the Turkish government, Mr Mehmet Ali Sahin, in the Turkish Daily News, that his government does not intend to allow the Halki Seminary to reopen is a cause of anxiety and concern. The demands of the Ecumenical Patriarch in Istanbul and the demands of the Greek minority in Imbros and Tenedos remain unresolved, I fear.</p>
<p class="contents">As Commissioner Rehn said earlier, the <span class="italic">pacta sunt servanda</span> principle of international law must be respected. This of course applies to Turkey, but it also applies to the European Union. We need to remain constant in our support for Turkey's strategic objective of accession to the European Union. At the same time, however, Turkey should immediately ratify and apply the Additional Protocol by the deadline in question.</p>
<p class="contents">The road to Europe may guarantee the stability and development of Turkey. However, Turkey will need to overcome past phobias and syndromes. The syndrome of the Treaty of Sèvres. That is why I believe that reconciling with history must not be a source of insecurity and risk. It is an indicator of the democratic maturity and self-confidence of a country. The call for the traumatic history of clashes with the Armenians and the Greeks of Pontos to be acknowledged should not have a destabilising effect for the national stereotypes of Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Our specific amendment does not impose new preconditions on Turkey. We are against the acknowledgement of the genocide of the Armenians and the Greeks of Pontos as a political prerequisite. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some Members are at least brave enough to say it more openly: they regard Europe as a religious entity and area, which means that political Europe is dead.</p>
<p class="contents">I thought, instead, that the dream – the inspiration, the creation and the dream of a federalist Europe – was precisely to expand the area subject to the rule of law and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the great offer that we should be making to Turkey and, just at a time when Islamic fundamentalism is rising throughout the world, we should insist on it and put it in practice in a report to speed up the accession process. In that case the criticisms, including the severest ones, might make sense.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, different solutions are obviously presenting themselves here: not Turkey’s full, political accession, but rather enhanced cooperation agreements, all things that in themselves do not have the strength of the political message or of full accession.</p>
<p class="contents">If we follow that path – which, unfortunately, was also suggested by President Barroso in his statement yesterday – we shall bear the responsibility not only for pushing Turkey away, but also for pushing away political Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But nevertheless, no one can under-estimate the challenges it poses in terms of Turkey’s absorption into the EU, with its very large population and hence the political influence it will gain by joining the EU, its relative poverty and therefore demands on the structural funds, as well as its distinct and separate cultural and religious identity.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the current discussion on large-scale immigration, and in particular the challenges faced by integrating the existing Muslim minorities in our countries, a major concern inevitably will be unrestricted freedom of movement of Turkish workers. Turkey’s membership of the Organization of the Islamic Conference countries will certainly complicate the CFSP. Recent Marshall Fund of Germany polls in Turkey have shown it to be the most anti-American and anti-Israeli country amongst EU and candidate countries; but more worrying in my view is large Turkish support for theocratic Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey will of course have to abide by all the economic, political and human rights clauses of the Copenhagen criteria before joining, and there are clear examples of continuing discrimination against Christian minority rights, including the Greek Orthodox and Syriacs, and ongoing impediments to free speech, such as Article 301 of the Penal Code prohibiting insulting Turkishness.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, failure by Turkey to come to terms with its past, including the 1915 Armenian genocide and the blockade of the Republic of Armenia, is deeply regrettable. But non-recognition of the Republic of Cyprus, where Turkey continues to station troops since the 1974 invasion, and the failure to implement the Ankara Agreement on the enlarged customs union to allow Cypriot ships to dock at Turkish ports, is currently a critical issue before the European Union. Neither is it true that torture has completely stopped, in spite of it being banned by the State; it is still allegedly being used against Kurdish insurgents, and we have heard about that from Mrs Flautre. We can therefore be sure that EU accession negotiations will be very lengthy, and I for one fully support the Eurlings report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We in the Swedish Social Democratic group are in favour of Turkish membership once the criteria we have had for everyone else have been met. We should not set higher requirements for Turkey or subject it to special treatment, as has been suggested in this debate today. Right now, it is the EU that is the guarantor of progress in Turkey, not only through the encouragement we provide, but also through our demands in relation to issues such as human rights. A former MEP, now a Social Democrat member of the Swedish Parliament, has written to the Turkish ambassador in connection with the fact that 1 200 children’s books by Swedish children’s authors, used by Swedish schools and funded by the Swedish International Development Agency, Sida, and the Olof Palme Center, were stopped by Turkish customs. I find this unfathomable and I have therefore put a question to the Council in this regard. I support democratisation in Turkey and problems such as this one need to be solved. I share the critical views on the report expressed by the other speakers from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament. Let us encourage progress and solve the problems but stand firm on the fact that we in the EU wish to see Turkey as a member when the time is right and the democratic deficit has been rectified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Can you imagine what would happen if Turkey voluntarily withdrew some troops from Cyprus and how much it would be in Turkey’s favour? Or what would happen if we were to delete the paragraph asking Turkey not to veto the participation of Cyprus in international organisations and so forth? Furthermore, we are restricting the two leaders in Cyprus, who have already agreed on working methods in the search of a solution, by indicating to them the basis of talks which neither of them has raised as a precondition.

We were there to evaluate progress on human rights issues and the effects of reforms on the ground. On balance, Mr Eurlings has done an exceptional job in producing a tough but fair report on the story of Turkish accession so far.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Armenian issue, I believe that it should be mentioned in the report, but it should not be introduced as a new precondition for membership, as we should remain committed to the original criteria if we are to stay credible.</p>
<p class="contents">I am supportive of the principle of Turkish accession, but recognise that it will be a long, hard road. We need to send a clear message with this report that, while EU membership is achievable, it will require significant and sustained commitment to reform.</p>
<p class="contents">The two human rights concerns on which I wish to focus briefly are freedom of expression and the ongoing Kurdish issue, which needs a new approach. On freedom of expression, despite reform packages – and we are now on the ninth – journalists and writers are not free to comment openly and critically on Turkey or its government members. Article 301 of the penal code remains in place to punish those responsible for ‘a public denigration of Turkishness or State authorities’. Prison terms of up to three years can be imposed. Up to 60 such cases are currently being brought against writers by the State Prosecutor. Despite the high profile case of novelist Elif Shafak, which was thrown out of court last week, self-censorship will continue to be forced upon the press until Article 301 is done away with entirely.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Kurdish issue, a guerrilla war using terrorism continues in the south-east – a Kurdish area of Turkey – and must be condemned. PKK terrorism and the massive military response in the south-east are inflicting real hardship on the region and its population. A new approach is required that uses diplomacy and politics instead of force. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has done some excellent work and has drafted what is actually quite a bold report, which in its own way suggests that enlargement is taking place much too quickly. There is still so much to be done with regard to Turkey that we cannot even contemplate the idea of its membership in 10 years’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">I was delighted to read in this morning’s newspaper that European Commission President Barroso has stated that it was unwise to continue enlargement before we had dealt with the matter of the Constitution. I totally agree with him. We cannot push for enlargement on such a large scale as would be the case with Turkey and at the same time see through the question of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. We should be listening a lot more carefully to public opinion and to the ideas of the people. When we recall what happened in the French and Dutch referendums, it would be better to take account of what the people think about this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also think about how far and how fast the EU can expand. If our citizens do not receive a reply to the question of how quickly enlargement is to take place, they will not be able to put their trust in the current EU. It is a pity that Commissioner Rehn has left. I would have asked him what Plan B is if rapid progress is made and Turkey is about to join the Union in some 10 years’ time and they have a referendum in France, for example. If the people say no, we will not be able to endorse Turkish membership. What is the plan, and how should we then proceed so as not to disappoint the Turks and stop the entire project collapsing because again there could unexpectedly be a NO vote in a referendum? Perhaps, however, we will have the answer to this later on.</p>

Turkey should be treated in the same way as any country we have negotiated with in the past. The process of harmonising Turkish and European law will help Turkey to modernise and liberalise its economy and to move closer to the fundamental values on which the European Union is based.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey is a country that has taken on the incredibly difficult task of separating Islam from the structures of government. This Muslim country’s secular nature is worth fostering and is something that we should offer particular support to in a world where the extreme and fanatical face of Islam is manifesting itself with increasing frequency. Nevertheless, Turkey needs to know that it cannot count on receiving special treatment. Ankara cannot expect the Union to lower its standards or water down its laws and requirements based on the European treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly like to draw your attention to the issue of civil rights and liberties. It is not enough simply to change laws and legal provisions. The civil service and the judiciary need to pay constant attention to civil liberties, freedom of speech and religious freedom. Progress in this field will be judged on the basis of hard facts. Ankara must understand this and must not be offended by the fact that we will be asking questions, assessing the situation and checking that the rights of the Kurdish minority are respected, and that they enjoy the same rights as all other ethnic minorities in the European Union. These rights include being able to have their own Kurdish language schools at every stage of the education system, starting with nursery education. New anti-terrorist legislation must not be used to restrict civil liberties and discriminate against minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will also examine the freedoms enjoyed by Christians, who are still unable to reopen a seminary shut down years ago. If Christian schools are not allowed to operate freely, it will be impossible for Turkey to become a member of the European Union. Finally, although we may be discussing Turkey, let us not forget that it is equally important for Europe to open association negotiations with Ukraine in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The fact that the outcome of negotiations is open and that they could – and should, in my opinion – result in alternatives to full membership is nothing new, but rather the subject of discussion in the Council and Parliament. I would contradict expressly Commissioner Rehn’s statement here in his opening speech that he expects the conclusion of negotiations, and accession, by the end of the decade. That leaves less than four years.</p>
<p class="contents">No one who wants to see Turkey become a full member is saying that it can join in its present condition – it has to make fundamental changes. Turkey must recognise and respect human rights, freedom of religion and minority rights. It must resolve the Armenian issue and actively recognise Cyprus. Does anyone in Turkey really believe that Turkey could join the EU whilst failing to recognise another full member? An insider said recently that Cyprus would be recognised only when Turkey became a full member or voluntarily broke off the negotiations. If the EU, including the Commission, tolerates that, it will mean letting go of all our chances of holding Europe together.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of freedom of religion, it is remarkable that the Turkish authorities – the deputy party leader, the highest representative of the religious authority, a State official – judged the Pope’s speech before even reading it. Pope Benedict XVI was compared with Hitler and Mussolini – an outrageous episode that shows and documents the intolerance and Islamism in the minds of the people with whom we are negotiating. In view of the burgeoning nationalism and the uncompromising attitude of the Erdoğan Government, I have considerable doubts as to the political will to actually cede sovereignty to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Eurlings report is right and necessary. Turkey should see the advice and requirements as an opportunity rather than a threat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are many challenges facing Turkey, but obviously the talks on membership support the continuation of Turkey’s reform process, and that is in the interests of everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the key issues is that Turkey should ratify and implement the Additional Protocol to the Ankara Agreement. At present we are working hard to find a solution which on the one hand would allow direct trade between the European Union and North Cyprus, and on the other would ensure that Turkey also opened its ports to Cypriot vessels.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time as the accession negotiations are taking place, it is also important to find a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus question within the framework of the United Nations.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Louis Michel, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the work he has done. It is obviously an important contribution. It is an extremely interesting assessment that will undoubtedly help to sustain the Commission report of 8 November. Even though we do not necessarily agree on everything contained in the report, I believe that it is important for Parliament to take up this issue and to clarify our own point of view by means of its contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate that has just taken place has, I believe, well and truly brought to light the issues involved in Turkey’s accession process, which began almost one year ago. The Commission will, of course, take account of this debate when it presents its own report on 8 November. That report will, as always, be rigorous, objective and uncompromising. It will be based on a wide range of information sources, including both official government data and the analyses of Turkish and other non-governmental organisations, or even of large international institutions. It will also take into account the reports drafted by the committees of your Parliament, as well as the Bozkurt report.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, Mr Toubon, with all of the respect that I owe you and that I have for you, to reassure you. This will not be a children’s story. The Commission is not wont, moreover, to do what you are suddenly accusing it of. Nor indeed is its aim, even if it were to please you, to produce a report that is unilateral and unsubtle or incomplete.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore important to always bear in mind the issues involved in this project. The decision taken on 3 October 2005 certainly reflects the desire to fulfil our commitments, but it also conveys a powerful mutual interest. I heard someone say in this Chamber just now that Turkey had more to gain in this instance than Europe. I am not at all convinced about that. I believe that Turkey obviously needs Europe in order to continue becoming modern and democratic and supporting the development of its economy, but I believe that Europe also needs Turkey at its side, as a focal point for peace, stability, democracy and prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">Current events, as someone also said, are enough to demonstrate each day the strategic value of this exercise. Whether we are talking about Iran, Iraq, the Middle East in general, the dialogue between civilisations or the energy crisis, Turkey always seems to be a key country, a vital asset to Europe. That does not, of course, in any way exempt Turkey from the obligations that any accession candidate must fulfil, and the European Union will make sure of that. In doing so, it will not set itself up, either, as a teacher who tyrannically delivers his lessons.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us remember that it was Turkey that presented itself as a candidate. It took that step. It therefore agreed to face up to the difficulties of European integration, because it saw in that the key to its own future and to that of its people. It is on this account that Turkey must now stay strong in pursuing and strengthening the reform process that it has itself courageously begun. We, for our part, are obviously going to continue encouraging it along these lines, and we shall not stop doing so. Turkey aspires to join Europe. I believe that we should give it its chance; one that must be fair, that stems from clear and transparent rules that are established at the outset and that will not change, either, according to the mood of the day.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to add something. I often have the feeling, and not only in this Chamber, that, when we debate this matter, it is as though we were evaluating Turkey for accession today, when that will actually take place tomorrow. It goes without saying that Turkey will not join tomorrow and that the process is likely to last for some time yet. This is therefore only an interim evaluation. Judgments are made in relation to progress and to advances - which sometimes take too long - and even to setbacks. It is quite clear that this is an evolutionary process. It is therefore very unfair to take a snapshot in time and just focus on that. That is not what accession is about. That does not correspond, I might add, to any enlargement process that we have known in the past. Why, then, should Turkey be treated any differently?</p>
<p class="contents">Now I come, before concluding in 20 seconds, to the Armenian issue. I should like all the same to point out – and I am very mindful of this point, as is Europe, because it comes under the duty to remember that is part of our legacy of values – that this issue is not, nor has ever been, a condition laid down by the European Council for the opening of negotiations or for accession itself, whether in the case of Turkey or of any other candidate country. Imposing this condition today would amount to moving the goalposts and would be very strongly felt in Turkey to be a ploy by the European Union to lay down new conditions with the aim of preventing Turkey’s accession at all costs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, on the other hand, vital to ensure that freedom of expression, including on sensitive issues that are linked to Turkey’s past, is fully respected in that country. The experience of our own countries demonstrates that the debate on the past, however distressing it may be, always comes about as a result of an act of awareness within our societies and rarely, if ever, as a result of an order, of a diktat from outside. This entire debate is linked to the principle of reconciliation, which is one of the main driving forces of the European project.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has always been clear on this issue. Turkey’s relations with Armenia must improve, starting with the establishment of diplomatic relations and the opening up of the land border, which is currently closed. The prospect of Turkey’s joining the EU must lead to an improvement in bilateral relations and to reconciliation, including in relation to the past. We obviously expect Turkey to treat this issue as an integral part of a free and open public debate in which it must be possible to exchange all points of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there you have the response from the Commission and my impressions after having followed this extremely interesting debate. I am, of course, going to feed matters back to Mr Rehn, who is more familiar with these issues than I. Be in no doubt whatsoever that your contribution to the report of 8 November will be welcomed.</p>
