<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kauppi (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FI)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, VAT fraud is a widespread problem in the European Union, which is unfortunately becoming more common all the time. According to reliable estimates, during the first half of 1998, for example, Member States detected 250 cases of so-called Carousel fraud, worth more than 500 million euros in all. To this must of course be added other types of fraud, and all the fraudulent transactions that remained undetected. We can therefore estimate that VAT fraud costs the EU and its Member States hundreds of millions of euros every year.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally it is a matter of Carousel Fraud. Carousel Fraud means the acquisition of goods without paying the VAT as required under the rules of the internal market. It is characterised by a chain of invoices, with or without goods, extending across one or more borders. The essential feature of this type of fraud is that one or more links in the chain do not pay invoiced VAT to the tax authority, while other parties in the chain receive VAT refunds based on these very invoices. Carousel Fraud generally concerns small items of value, such as computers and mobile phones.</p>
<p class="contents">The most effective way of preventing this type of fraud is through close, administrative cooperation between the Member States. It is generally known, however, that the current legal framework is not up to the task. In order to streamline the current legislative framework, the Commission has now put forward a proposal for a regulation that would considerably enhance and improve current forms of administrative cooperation in the field of VAT. I also support the Commission’s proposal for a directive, in addition to which I propose measures in my report to make direct cooperation between the authorities still more effective and practical.</p>
<p class="contents">The main point of the proposal is to allow for direct contact between local and regional authorities responsible for the fight against fraud. At present, all communication must go through central liaison offices, meaning that all requests pass through one country’s administrative machinery from a local office to a national liaison office and down the same path in the other country. This means that requests for assistance often arrive too late at their proper destination. The tax evaders may well have disappeared by the time the local officials in the country that received the request for help look into the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the Commission that cooperation at local level would improve mutual understanding regarding requests for information, would increase the motivation of tax inspectors, and would avoid wasting the few resources that exist. I therefore wholeheartedly support the Commission proposal, which should be seen as a major step forward in the fight against fraud. All too often, criminals can take immediate advantage of the most up-to-date and advanced means of communication, while the authorities are weighed down by bureaucratic, cumbersome rules, which slows down the work involved in tracking down the criminals and uses up far too many of the administration’s resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, however, could have gone still further to speed up cooperation and increase flexibility. I support the Commission’s proposal for sending communications in electronic form wherever possible. I would also propose that, to speed up the flow of information, electronic communication should be made the rule, and traditional correspondence on paper the exception. For the same reason, to speed up the exchange of information, that is, more room for manoeuvre should be given to the local authorities with regard to language policy. The obligation to translate requests for assistance between authorities must be made more flexible. Why should it be a requirement to translate a request for assistance into the official language of the second country if, for example, a Finn and a Greek come to an understanding that they will deal with one another in French?</p>
<p class="contents">There is one point, however, where the Commission proposal goes too far. The Commission is proposing that the Member States would be under an obligation to restrict many of the rights contained in the Data Protection directive if they thought this necessary in order to safeguard important economic or financial interests. It should be noted that there is no such obligation contained in the said directive but that it is simply a possibility that Member States can resort to. This aspect of the matter would therefore be better addressed by an amendment to the Data Protection directive and at this stage it should be left to the Member States to consider whether or not to pursue this line of action.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, something should be said about the legal basis. The Commission bases its proposal on Article 95 of the Treaty, which means the co-decision procedure for Parliament. I agree with the Commission’s view that this proposal should concern administrative cooperation only and must be dealt with according to the procedure laid down in Article 95. The Council has always rejected this view, formerly, and changed the legal basis to Article 93 or 94, which only require Parliament to be consulted. Now, however, the Commission has decided to take the Council to the European Court of Justice over another proposal for a directive concerning the recovery of claims. The legal situation will thus be cleared up soon. I would also like to hear comments from the Commissioner in connection with this choice of legal basis and any new information he might have for Parliament regarding how the case regarding the legal basis for the proposal for a directive on the recovery of claims is proceeding in the Court of Justice of the European Communities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That means that there was excellent communication between all the parties involved. The report constitutes yet further evidence of the competence for which our young colleague has, in a short time, acquired a reputation in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, as also for the industriousness shown by the quality of her work. Many thanks for that.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is, secondly, evidence of our need, in many instances, for ‘more of Europe’. It is only together that we can combat fraud more efficiently and thus more successfully. In this connection, we need, on the one hand, better coordination in order to move towards cooperation and exchange of information, and, on the other hand, an improved and more professional legal framework to facilitate this process of information and coordination more readily.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats says ‘yes’ to improved cooperation by the authorities against VAT fraud, although we of course emphasise that we are not only opposed to VAT fraud but also every form of fraud. In any case, 250 instances of it were uncovered in the first half of 1998, with losses amounting to over EUR 500 million.</p>
<p class="contents">I can do no other than associate myself with the rapporteur in saying that we do not need obligatory translations in cross-border requests for information, but rather more flexibility as regards the data protection directive, deregulation to make things simpler, rationalisation and flexibility to get the work processed more quickly, so that we can get on the fraudsters' trails and so create greater security in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We Socialists also wholeheartedly support this Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal deals with two very important matters. The first is the issue of tax fraud in a specific area, that of VAT in intra Community and triangular operations. The second issue, which is related to the first, as an instrument in combating fraud – is that of cooperation between public authorities to find a solution to, or at least, to reduce, the level of fraud previously mentioned. Mrs Kauppi gave a perfect explanation of the proposals in her speech and I fully share her sentiments.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I would like to make two additional comments with regard to the content of this report. The first refers to the validity, today, of the ‘provisional VAT system’, a system which was implemented in 1993 on the completion of the single market, of a strictly provisional nature, even with an expiry date, that has been spun out and which has not been respected, as you are all well aware.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw your attention to this because the reason we are having to discuss this report and the fraud it deals with today is that, to a large extent, we continue to maintain this provisional VAT system – set up by intra Community operations – which places a burden on a series of operations in the country of destination without having those border controls that were maintained by the system in place before the entry into force of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, in a definitive VAT system, which is appropriate to the single market, with taxation at source, we would probably not be discussing this issue, because much of this fraud would be prevented at source. This is the first observation that I would like to make with regard to this report.</p>
<p class="contents">My second observation concerns a very important point, which Mrs Kauppi referred to: the legal base chosen by the Commission to present this proposal for a directive. In my opinion, the Commission’s interpretation of the Treaty has to be applauded, for considering that the base applicable in this case was Article 95, that is to say, for deciding that tax matters can be reduced to matters of substantial, substantive tax law, but not to those of adjective law, to those matters – such as those we are dealing with at the moment – that deal with the management of taxes and the exchange of information between public institutions in the management of taxes. In these cases, it is not really a matter of fiscal law or tax law itself, in the strict sense of the word, reserved for national parliaments and, as a consequence, for unanimity, but of an issue that can be dealt with, as is happening now, by the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude, Madam President, with a piece of advice that stems from my last comment; it would be a good idea if, in the next Convention and reform of the Treaty, the field of tax matters could be defined once and for all and that a precise framework for harmonisation can be established. Naturally, not all tax matters can be harmonised; there are certain areas, such as income tax, that will never be completely harmonised, but there are others – and here I am essentially thinking about the basis for calculating tax on company profits – which should be set up as something that can be harmonised and exempted from the unanimity rule, which would give Parliament the leading role in areas as important as those we are dealing with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is through our tax regulations, which are in part difficult to understand, that we are laying ourselves open to fraudsters and indirectly promoting tax fraud. What we need in order to raise the level of taxpayer honesty and increase tax revenue is not only efficient monitoring and effective cooperation by the tax authorities, but also comprehensible and simpler legal texts as a fundamental precondition for this. The taxpayer very often refuses to pay taxes he regards as unfair. Incomprehensible tax laws and the tax burdens arising from them are, though, always or automatically seen by the taxpayer as unfair.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore in urgent need of a reform of the VAT system, which is far too expensive and complex to the point of being incomprehensible even by experts. It is not acceptable for transactions to be tax-exempt within the business chain between the Member States but taxable at national level. It is advance deduction of tax within the business chain that facilitates this evasion of tax in the first place and that should therefore be abolished.</p>
<p class="contents">By taking this step, we would be cutting the ground from under the fraudsters' feet, simplifying the system and avoiding needless controls, with all their vexations, which are a further burden on our small and medium-sized enterprises. We should, therefore, be thinking, first of all, not only in terms of how we get the different authorities to work together better, but also about how we can simplify the system that makes fraud possible in the first place. That would be a step in the right direction, but we will, nonetheless, support Mrs Kauppi's report, as we share her view that it is self-evident that cooperation should be improved and that the effort must be made to make Europe less bureaucratic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

VAT fraud costs the EU and its Member States several hundred million euro each year. Although measures have been taken over the last few years to come to terms with it, VAT fraud is still a considerable problem today.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that the best way to tackle this ever-increasing fraud is to have close administrative cooperation between Member States. By allowing direct contacts between local offices, the fight against fraud will become less bureaucratic and more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">However, let me sound a note of caution in relation to the efforts inherent in this Commission proposal to base this measure on Article 95 of the Treaty. Article 95 specifically states that it may not be used for fiscal provisions. The Commission's view is that this proposal is merely about administrative cooperation and that it does not relate to actual tax collection or tax measures.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect, I do not agree – my country does not agree – that by stealth the present position should be eroded. I do not think that SCAC – the existing administrative committee in the tax area – should have more of these functions assigned to it. It is the thin end of the wedge. This proposal relates to fiscal instruments which Member States use and it should certainly be adopted, but it should be adopted with the correct legal basis, which is Article 93, providing for unanimity of voting at Council level. The regulation that this proposal aims to replace is based upon Article 93, and quite simply this proposal should be also.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Kauppi has referred to the concerns regarding the legal basis in her attached explanatory memorandum. In the past where conflicts have arisen in relation to the legal basis, the Council has always rejected the Commission's view and has changed the legal basis to Article 93 or 94. As pointed out by my colleague, it did this most recently on the proposal for a directive on the mutual assistance for the recovery of claims. The Commission has decided to take the Council to the Court of Justice in this matter and Ireland will be joining the action on the side of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">While I welcome the substance of what this proposal aims to do, for the reasons I have outlined in relation to the legal basis, I and my Irish colleagues will be voting against the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate Mrs Kauppi on her report, which has managed, as has already been said, to achieve the support of most of the political groups in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make just a few specific observations. In a recent appearance to prepare for the monetary dialogue with Wim Duisenberg, the President of the European Central Bank, we were given a report which demonstrated that the introduction of the euro will make price differences between the various countries in Europe more evident, as a result, amongst other things, of differences in taxation. This leads us to call for the harmonisation of VAT and for it to be applied at source, as Mr Pérez Royo suggested, but, until this happens, it is clear that these price differences will encourage fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, ‘more Europe’, or more decentralised cooperation within the European Union, is always welcome. I was a tax inspector and I know how the obligation to refer to higher public authorities can paralyse an idea. We need to eliminate formal requirements. I see no need for a translation: nobody would ask for a translation of information that would permit the arrest of Jack the Ripper and I do not see why things should be different in the field of taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the legal base, I disagree with the last speaker but I agree with Mr Pérez Royo, given that the difference between substantive law, which characterises the essential elements of the tax system, and formal law, which was set up in order to guarantee that these obligations are met, is well known. Whereas the rules of substantive law have their base in Article 93 and, therefore, unanimity, those concerning formal law, administrative law and application law have their base in Article 95 because, amongst other things, this allows us to avoid unanimity and also paves the way, as we saw this morning in the field of financial services, for what the Spanish Presidency calls ‘more Europe’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I thank Mrs Kauppi very much for her report. It is extremely constructive. I can only echo what was said by Mr Karas who referred to Mrs Kauppi as his "young and effective colleague". She is not my colleague but I should like to echo the appreciative words of Mr Karas.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Kauppi, along with other Members of Parliament, spoke about the legal basis of this proposal. It is about administrative cooperation. It is not about changing the VAT regime. I wish the Commission could do that. We have wanted to do so for many years but we are not able to do so. But no, it is about administrative cooperation. It is not designed to change in any way the obligations of taxpayers or the rules governing the application of that legislation, but rather to gear administrative cooperation to the challenges of the internal market. That is why the Commission is submitting this proposal under Article 95 of the Treaty. In taking that article as the legal basis the Commission is consistent with its proposal for Regulation No 218/92 as well as with its proposal to modify the recovery directive. The Commission is correct in choosing Article 95 as the basis of this proposal. As Mr García-Margallo y Marfil said quite clearly, it gives Parliament codecision and that is what many Members of this Parliament want. I take this opportunity to thank Mr García-Margallo y Marfil for the kind words he uttered in my direction. I add to that that the Commission is extremely pleased that we have settled the matter of the so-called Lamfalussy proposal and that we can now continue with the work ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">More to the point, the Commission is of the opinion that this proposal is an important element of the new VAT strategy to improve the operation of the VAT system within the context of the internal market. It also constitutes a response to the Council calling on the Commission to present proposals for fighting VAT fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">The intra-Community market is today seriously affected by organised VAT fraud, where professional fraudsters abuse the exemption mechanism of the VAT system. Tackling that kind of fraud requires rapid and efficient cooperation between the tax administrations of the different Member States. But at present the legal framework is too weak to support really effective cooperation, essentially because it is vague, over-centralised and the exchange of information is not sufficiently intensive. In addition, cooperation is complicated owing to the existence of two legal instruments in this area with different scopes and different rules.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal sets up one single legal framework merging, for VAT purposes, the regulation and the directive, and modifies the current arrangements in three ways: firstly, the proposal lays down clear and binding rules governing administrative cooperation between Member States, for example, for the presence of foreign officials during controls, or for organising multilateral controls; secondly, the proposal devolves cooperation and provides for more direct contacts between tax inspectors of different Member States. This is also a point which Mrs Kauppi drew to our attention. She said that when French and Spanish controllers – for example – in a border area want to communicate, at the moment this communication has to pass via Madrid and Paris. It is obvious that direct communication between inspection staff will make cooperation faster and more effective. Thirdly, the proposal aims to intensify the exchange of information between tax administrations in order to combat fraud more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that this proposal gets the support of all speakers this evening, except for Mrs Doyle, whom I can no longer convince, since she is no longer here. The Commission is extremely pleased with this support. I would therefore like to particularly welcome the positive contribution of the rapporteur, Mrs. Kauppi.</p>
<p class="contents">But given the fact that examination of this proposal is ongoing in the Council, and given the Commission’s strong desire to address this issue in a timely manner, I believe that the most appropriate course of action at this time is for the Commission not to formally accept the amendments put forward by Parliament, but to endeavour to take them on board, as much as possible, during the negotiations in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">However I fear it will not be possible to take some of these amendments fully into account.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, as regards the issue of electronic communication, I would like to stress that much of the information covered by this regulation is not available in electronic format, and therefore, in practice, cannot be exchanged by electronic means.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the translations, I share the argument according to which Member States should strive as far as possible to waive a translation. But the Commission takes the view that the arrangements under which Member States should waive translations should be determined in an implementing regulation, binding for all Member States, and not individually by each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as concerns data protection, the Commission takes the view that if Directive 95/46/EC is fully applied, fraudsters would be informed that they are under suspicion, and consequently it is to be expected that they would transfer their fraudulent activity and would dispose of the evidence of fraud. That would seriously hamper the fight against VAT fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">I am personally confident that an agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission will be achieved on these issues. The Council has already started to discuss the proposal in detail. It will do its best to achieve an agreement as soon as possible, and we are making good headway. But your support of the proposal is important to achieve that much desired result. I would therefore recommend this proposal most warmly for Parliament's approval. I thank Parliament for its most constructive intervention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
