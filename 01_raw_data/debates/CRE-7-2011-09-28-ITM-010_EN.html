<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cecilia Malmström, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">−</span> Madam President, the situation of the refugees stranded in North Africa is of course an issue of major concern. When the crisis began, the Commission immediately called for a meeting between Member States, the Commission, the IOM and the UNHCR to discuss the situation of the refugees stranded in Libya and to get an assessment of the resettlement needs.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the European Union tried to evacuate – and succeeded in evacuating – thousands of people from third countries and bring them back to their countries of origin. We also called for the Member States to pledge resettlement places for refugees coming from the region. Several Member States announced their readiness to consider resettlement or to rearrange their annual quotas in order to be able to resettle urgent cases. In parallel, the Commission financed humanitarian assistance to be provided to all refugees leaving the country. That also included an evacuation process from places such as Misratah, the establishment of refugee camps and assistance with registration and reports.</p>
<p class="contents">In May this year I organised a meeting with the Ministers, a pledging conference on resettlement of the stranded refugees. Further pledges were made. In total, EU Member States pledged 408 places for refugees from North Africa. In addition, Norway pledged 300. This is good but is clearly not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is, as you know, not directly involved in the process of resettlement itself. That is jointly run by the UNHCR, the Member States and the IOM. The information I have on the statistics there is based on the figures I got from the UNHCR. So far, eight EU Member States have agreed to consider 374 cases submitted by the UNHCR. Of this number so far, seven Member States have accepted 303 refugees for resettlement; 155 have already departed: 25 to Belgium, 130 to Sweden.</p>
<p class="contents">We are very aware that the need for a settlement is much greater. However, that decision rests with the Member States. What the Commission can do is quite limited. We can encourage Member States through financial support from the European Refugee Fund, particularly for the regions where there is a regional protection programme in place. As an incentive, Member States can receive EUR 4 000 from the Refugee Fund per resettled refugee coming from any of these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Regional Protection Programme in North Africa includes Egypt, Libya and Tunisia and is run jointly with the UNHCR. At the Commission’s request, the programme has an important resettlement component financed from its EUR 3.6 million budget. This is intended to speed up the sometimes very slow process.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not yet possible to assess how many of the 3 083 of the settlement places pledged by the Member States formally within their quotas for REF funding for next year will be allocated from this region, but I hope that the urgent need in North Africa will be considered and that the Member States will use large parts of their quotas to resettle refugees from Egypt, Libya and Tunisia.</p>
<p class="contents">The regional protection programmes in North Africa were created to increase the protection space in the region. It is our long-term goal to build up an asylum capacity together with these new governments so that the improved international standards can be in place. This is also part of the mobility partnership that we are seeking with these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the joint EU resettlement programme, there is disagreement over the procedure. I very much regret that the compromise proposals so far have not been able to gain support. The European Refugee Fund is, as you know, quite a large and complex mechanism and is run according to well-defined rules. The pledging of resettlement places must take place by June each year, and that means that any amendment to the Refugee Fund decision must be finalised very soon to ensure a smooth operation.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that the Commission is working hard to develop better and more flexible ways to fund EU resettlement, and that will be part of the post-2013 financial instrument. We hope that increased funding, combined with new flexible rules, will result in more resettlement from EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this year we are celebrating the 60th anniversary of the Geneva Convention. During the commemoration in Geneva in December this year, state commitments will, hopefully, be made. The UNHCR has expressed hope that the EU Member States will come forward with new resettlement pledges, and we will continue to call on the Commission to resettle the most vulnerable refugees from North Africa and the Horn of Africa. Today, before this Parliament, I would like to ask you to join us in urging the Member States to do more and to show solidarity with those countries where there are people in extreme need of help and resettlement. Together maybe we can achieve something so that new commitments could be made. This would be a true commitment for solidarity and responsibility, sharing and also showing European Union values at their best. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are 4 500 people from Darfur, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia, Côte d’Ivoire, Palestine and Iraq living in inhumane conditions and suffering an extreme temperature of 50 degrees centigrade.</p>
<p class="contents">There is sickness and violence; the camp has burned down three times; and there is a lack of hygiene and drinking water. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, <span class="italic">Médecins Sans Frontières</span> and other organisations are doing a tremendous job.</p>
<p class="contents">Tunisia has shown solidarity with displaced persons and refugees from Libya. Tunisians have welcomed 90 000 Libyans into their own homes. However, beyond this emergency nobody is taking care of those in Sousse.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a major difference between the Europe that donates and the Europe that does not receive. Our solidarity extends to other countries, but we do not show solidarity within our borders.</p>
<p class="contents">We now need to make an impassioned plea for resettlement, so that the 4 000 refugees can be received on European soil. This is neither complicated nor expensive. There has been a show of commitment, as the Commissioner said, but there needs to be something more than good will and statements of intent.</p>
<p class="contents">We urgently need to resettle those groups who are suffering so much hardship in Sousse and who, in Europe, could find hope for their shattered lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Many times and in desperate voices they asked Europe not to abandon them. Others told us their child had lost 10 kilos and was malnourished and in need of medical attention, but they had nowhere to go.</p>
<p class="contents">Resettlement offers have so far totalled – or would total, if they were carried out – 718, but that still leaves 3 707 people. Madam President, I strongly call on the Council and the Commission to show commitment in order to end this serious humanitarian crisis as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course this is the story of all refugee camps in extreme areas, but I think all of our colleagues would agree that what we also saw was extreme generosity by the Tunisian people, by the army. These are people of whom many are living on the poverty line, yet they took refugees into their own homes and we witnessed this story.</p>
<p class="contents">What it means for us is a contrast between that and a more urgent situation today. I spoke to the UNHCR last week and it has identified 5 291 persons in extreme positions who could be resettled. They have been checked. They can be resettled. We are in a situation where we know the figures, we have done the organisation and of course the Tunisian border will now be closed because of the sheer number of sub-Saharan African refugees, people who have been rejected by the rebel forces in Libya, who are now coming since our visit to the area. So there is a more urgent situation today than ever before and, with the elections also coming, the political pressures on Tunisia are extreme.</p>
<p class="contents">Since that delegation visit we ask you to redouble your efforts. We will join you in doing it. It is crucial also that the joint EU resettlement programme is established before the new multiannual financial framework. The deadlock is unblocked in Council. It would allow Member States to pledge resettlement places in May 2012, to be offered in 2013, already a long time to wait for those who are in urgent need.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has also proposed supplementary funding for any new resettlement countries and this could give the incentive that is needed to involve more Member States in resettlement. In the shorter term unblocking the resettlement programme will also allow the European Asylum Support Office to take up its role of coordinating cooperation between EU Member States and in supporting those that are new to resettlement, but the political message is very clear: resettlement does not involve huge numbers; they are very modest numbers but they are highly symbolic. I know colleagues who visited the camps will agree with me that there was one country on their lips, and that was Norway. Norway had resettled refugees, the United States had resettled refugees, Canada had resettled, and of course we in the European Union had lagged behind. We must put that right. We must get the political message right, and the humanitarian message correct. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This year, Europe’s financial commitment was doubled, and obviously I welcome this, because Tunisia, with which we have a privileged partnership, has also agreed to accept sub-Saharan refugees fleeing from the war in Libya. The European Union, which has often reaffirmed its commitment to the refugees, must without fail support and aid Tunisia to manage these migration flows while fully respecting human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Norway, although not part of the European Union, has agreed to accommodate more than 300 refugees, while EU Member States have agreed to accommodate fewer than 400 refugees in total. I consider this to be a deplorable and shameful attitude, a real insult to the principle of solidarity that should underpin the European Union’s Mediterranean policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should remind you, what is more, that these refugees are currently confined in camps in intolerable conditions. This morning in this very Chamber the European Parliament approved by a large majority an allocation of EUR 43.9 million for managing the migrant and refugee flows arising from repression by authoritarian regimes and movements linked to the Arab Spring. These additional funds will be used to assist the Member States most affected by these flows and to reinforce marine patrols by Frontex.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us reaffirm our assent to a Europe committed as much to the promotion of human rights as to the management of migration flows, and let us reject the idea of a fortress Europe that is xenophobic and closed. Today, the European Union is paying the price of its previous support for the dictatorial regimes of North Africa. Our former friends Gaddafi and Ben Ali have fallen or are falling and their people are fleeing repression.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to know what stage the joint EU resettlement programme, currently blocked in the Council, has reached. I am asking you, Commissioner, whom I know to be extremely sensitive and pro-active, how, in the current situation, can the European Union make a concrete commitment with regard to this humanitarian emergency?</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I am taking the opportunity of asking the Commission whether it is aware of what is happening in Palermo, where the Italian authorities are forcing 250 migrants to remain aboard a ship, without any provision authorising their detention, and denying them their right to freedom and to communicate with the outside world. Thanks to numerous reports presented to the Public Prosecutor’s Office at Palermo by many organisations in Palermo and Sicily fighting for human rights, the Palermo Public Prosecutor has just opened an investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">This event follows some extremely serious facts that took place at Lampedusa last week, where the situation is out of control and where the safety of both the local population and that of the migrants themselves is at risk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For the first time in generations, Tunisians have the right democratically to determine their own destiny. Under the new democratic leadership, stability has been restored in Tunis and the country is once more on the road to prosperity. Tourists have returned and international businesses are now making new investments. Therefore a clear distinction must be drawn between genuine asylum seekers and economic migrants leaving Tunisia and other North African countries, coming from further afield, who are arriving on the EU shores in very large numbers; indeed more than 40 000 since January this year.</p>
<p class="contents">It is deplorable that in Lampedusa, a refugee reception centre has been razed to the ground by Tunisian refugees protesting at their imminent repatriation. The EU must have a fair but robust approach in dealing with this large influx of asylum seekers and, in my view, return – or help Tunisia return, if they are still on North African soil – individuals to their country of origin in the large majority of cases.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also redouble our efforts to apprehend those thuggish members of the Ben Ali, Gaddafi and Mubarak regimes, some of whom – bizarrely – may now be attempting to become bogus asylum seekers in the European Union. They should face the criminal justice system if they have blood on their hands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I was amazed to see the whole of Europe get into a panic when 25 000 Tunisians arrived in Lampedusa, so much so that France even slammed the border shut in their face – surely, 25 000 cannot be so many people – but now we are talking about 5 000 people. This therefore concerns even fewer people. Contrary to what Mr Tannock just said, these are people who cannot return home, Somalis, Eritreans, Sudanese and some from a few other difficult countries in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">There was a young man and a girl I met there, in that camp in Shousha. He was 19, she 18, and they had come from Somalia. He had worked in Libya for some time and she was pregnant. It was July. It could be that she has given birth in the meantime. It was July, though, and she was pregnant, in that tent, in that sand. He was 19 and had already made a career for himself as a worker in Libya. These sorts of people, these sorts of families deserve a second chance.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this, it is shameful to see that the Member States of the EU are looking away and doing nothing, and yet we had all the ambassadors at the table in the Tunisian capital at the time.

Yes, Mr Tannock, they are Erythreans, Ethiopians, Somalis, Sudanese, and you know only too well that they cannot return to their countries. They are living in appalling conditions in the middle of the desert. I have seen it with my own eyes.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has examined 2 500 applications on the basis of promises of resettlement. The United States has pledged 1 500 places and Norway has pledged approximately 400 places, which is more than the entire effort of the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, only seven have accepted refugees, including your country, Commissioner, Sweden, which has accepted almost 200. The rest, France and Great Britain, although parties to the Libyan conflict, have categorically rejected all applications from refugees. I find this debate unacceptable. As far as I am concerned, we could make a minimum effort to show generosity and I am prepared to join my fellow Members in appealing to those countries that refuse to lend a helping hand.</p>

The vast majority of all those people from North Africa who want to come to Europe are, in fact, not refugees but economic fortune seekers, who usually pay very large sums of money to traffickers to bring them into Europe. Let us not be naïve, then, because many of these people are anything but poor souls and anything but refugees. On the contrary, they are the very people who are most needed for the reconstruction of their own countries.</p>
<p class="contents">There appears to be something seriously wrong with this whole so-called Arab Spring. Because many North Africans seem to have less confidence in their new leaders than we in the European Union do. How else can you explain the persistent flow of immigrants towards Lampedusa and Europe, Ms Malmström? We must, therefore, make it clear that Europe will only be able to support the new regimes in North Africa, including Tunisia, if that immigration flow finally comes to an end.</p>

Firstly, we have to keep in mind that of the roughly three quarters of a million people who fled Libya towards the Tunisian border, all that remains is around 60-70,000 Libyans who are being hosted by Tunisian families, and some 4-5,000 refugees – and I repeat, <span class="italic">refugees</span> as opposed to economic migrants – who are still staying at Shousha Camp.</p>
<p class="contents">We spent a day at Shousha Camp. We could see for ourselves the difficult conditions in which these refugees live: desert conditions – we were walking in the sand – in a temperature that hovers around the 50° mark, sandstorms which prevent you from leaving the camp or even opening your eyes. Our consolation was that we were there for just one day. But those 4,000 refugees were stuck there, and have been stuck there since June. Therefore we must try and come up with a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to acknowledge the work being done by the UNHCR and other international organisations working there. I would also like to acknowledge the huge financial help being given by the European Union. However, I must say, Commissioner, that although the EU is doing a lot, financially, the aid is not at all visible. The only flags you see are UNHCR ones. You do not see any symbols or logos belonging to the European Union, even though we are contributing millions.</p>
<p class="contents">Now: where shall the refugees go? We cannot send them back to their country. We cannot leave them at Shousha Camp. They could go back to Libya. My hope is that the situation in Libya has changed. Perhaps it will become attractive to immigrants. Perhaps it will not start turning people away, and perhaps people will not start fleeing Libya. But the situation is still in a state of flux and until this changes, it is up to us to intervene. Yes, Europe and other developed nations must take on this task. Other countries which are lending a hand – like the United States – should make us feel ashamed of ourselves because compared to them we are not doing enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Solidarity towards Tunisia and the refugees is important. It is important because even if we do not help them, they will still come to Europe. They will get on a boat and risk their lives. But there are more dignified alternatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would add that it is very important for our Parliament to celebrate the tremendous change that has taken place in Tunisia more visibly. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to say how much I hope that next month’s elections are a huge democratic and popular success.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to come back to the question of the refugees currently in Tunisian territory. My fellow Members in other groups and I went there in July, as you know. We went to the Shousha camp, on the border with Libya. It is a place where almost 20 000 people a day found refuge at the height of the crisis. Their living conditions were extremely difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the evacuations you mentioned, Commissioner, in the countries of origin more than 5 000 people, who have indisputably been given the status of ‘refugee’ by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), are still blocked in camps like the Shousha camp. They have no prospects of returning to their homes in countries ravaged by persecution, war, famine and violence, if their country still exists that is. However, they cannot find solutions in other countries either, because the majority of Member States of the European Union turn a blind eye and a deaf ear when it comes to strengthening resettlement schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">We all have roughly the same figures and the same sources: for 2 400 people, whose resettlement was validated in mid-September, only 650 places were pledged, fewer than half in the Member States. Ultimately, slightly fewer than 200 refugees were resettled elsewhere. We must, of course, congratulate the Member States that made pledges, and Norway too. Many Member States, however – and not insignificant ones in terms of size and power – did not make a single pledge to resettle these refugees from Libya. Not a single one. They argue that they are already very active in the current resettlement process. They say they are taking action as and when the need arises. If only that were true, which it is not. There is therefore every reason to be extremely angry at such cynicism.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the lack of response and of any prospects for resettlement has direct and dramatic consequence. With no hope of returning to their homes, these refugees are driven into the arms of smugglers to take to the seas and to go for broke, at risk of their lives. Therefore, the question that needs to be asked is very simple: how many lives must be lost at sea before the Member States finally react?</p>
<p class="contents">As we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Geneva Convention, which you alluded to earlier, Commissioner, many of us believe that the Member States of the European Union have a special responsibility towards these refugees. They must pledge places for resettlement and they must pledge them quickly. You can be sure of our support to exert the necessary pressure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank the Commissioner for having presented data here on the aid which it has been possible to provide, but please allow me, as a rapporteur to Parliament for refugees, to express my indignation – and I know that the Commissioner will take the same view – at learning that not even people dying at the gates of Europe has compelled the Council to conclude the codecision that we adopted two years ago in Parliament. Not even people dying at the gates of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point I would also like to address the Council, but I cannot, because the Council did not even come to this debate. It is remarkable that among the promises of the Member States on the resettlement of refugees, Europe will allow the resettlement of perhaps 600 refugees, while the US will resettle more than double that, and Canada and Australia will resettle almost as many. Yet Canada and Australia do not share, as we do, the same region, neighbourhood and future as these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I will finish merely by saying this: I realise that the Commissioner wants to be diplomatic by saying that the codecision procedure is blocked. However, the blame for the codecision procedure being blocked is not equally shared. When there was the problem of delegated acts, the Commission and the Council did not want them and submitted a proposal to us: within a fortnight – two weeks – we in Parliament had a counter-proposal without delegated acts.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been waiting for a response from the Council and the Commission for four months. Parliament has been doing its job and it is down to them to resolve this problem, but the fact is that the problem lies in the Council’s failure to attend, and I would prefer it if the Commissioner tried to be fairer in her assessment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Rather than talking about this in particular, I would like to touch on another situation which often goes unmentioned, namely that of the people who have been received into the homes of families in Tunisia. This is a situation which should make us feel even more ashamed, as we see that in a situation of crisis Tunisia has been able to show solidarity, while Europe has not, even though it is not in the process of making the transition to democracy. It has not been able to show solidarity, and it has been unable to take in refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is indeed shameful that we can count the refugees that have been received into Europe in the mere hundreds. Many of these people, contrary to what has been said, cannot return to their homes. There are also children who have been enrolled in state schools, a situation that has implications for infrastructure and for their being hosted in these countries. This is why, Commissioner, I am very touched by the appeal that you have made, and I do not mean that in an ironic way. I am serious, but please tell me: is the Commission serious? Is Europe serious? What can it do? How can Europe sleep easily when it has this double standard? We are all too quick to repatriate and too slow to help, Commissioner.

Every time we have discussed such issues under similar circumstances, I think that Parliament has always been clearly and robustly supportive of you, of the Commission and of the initiatives being taken.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would remind you, as my colleagues mentioned, that a short while ago – three or four plenaries ago, if I remember correctly – we debated the question of the resettlement of refugees and pointed out that, even though we did not have the emergency situation in ‘our neighbourhood’ when we considered this issue and negotiated it the first time, we felt that this mechanism was now necessary. Today, several months after that debate, here we are again, and you personally are telling us – and we all agree – that the refugee resettlement programme has not been completed and its application has not yet started and that we are confined to efforts being made by individual Member States. Therefore, apart from the fact that we all agree that we support your efforts, I think that we also agree that Europe today is being called upon to manage caravans of refugees at what is obviously a bad time, a bad ‘<span class="italic">momentum’ </span>for it, because we do not have all the tools at our disposal that are needed in order to manage this crisis adequately.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleagues referred to Shousha and I too am in receipt of the information from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, according to which approximately four thousand people are crowded there, with about another 1 600 in host countries. At the same time, the numbers for resettlement – as you too have said – are very low in comparison with current needs and, according to the High Commissioner, only 14% of cases have progressed in terms of resettlement needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, without doubt, the communications and press releases from the Commission on economic aid to Tunisia are necessary and important. However, at this critical time, Europe must take proactive decisions, with equal burden-sharing and solidarity, if we want, above all, to be at one with our conscience and to be proud of the Europe of values that we all espouse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is clear that the major effort Tunisia has made to receive all those refugees from the Libyan war could destabilise – and is already destabilising – an entire region, considering the remaining 5 000 people who have come from war-torn Libya.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a disgrace to us all that this is still happening. It is not as if Europe has done nothing. It is true that, at the most critical point, the refugees numbered up to 700 000, and that Europe has helped to mobilise its Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it cannot be denied that something has gone wrong. If we are proposing to establish a mobility partnership with these Southern Mediterranean countries while, at the same time, amending the Schengen Agreement, what is the real message we are sending out? Indeed, what message are we sending out to Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, please do what we asked of Mr Barroso this morning: take action. I urge you to get properly involved in this issue, because at the end of the day, 5 000 people who need to improve their quality of life and resolve their living situation is not such a high number for the EU. Therefore, try to establish a more EU-centred policy; give more power to the European Asylum Support Office in Malta, and resolve all those disputes that are still outstanding and which the Polish Presidency wants to pursue.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, however, we must help Tunisia on this issue, which is not such a difficult task. Try to create a truly European policy. Stop hiding behind the Member States, because there must be some reason why we are incapable of solving a problem such as this. There is more to this than meets the eye.

We must reconsider the issue of the refugees and migration on the basis of a human rights approach taking into account the new political situations. The security approach and the ‘dusting’ carried out by the Frontex Agency are no match for our high standards and values. In the short, medium and long term, the financial assistance given by the European Union must be directed at strengthening the capacities of civil society in Tunisia, in particular, and in the countries of the south more generally.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by stressing that the immigrants of today are resources and not a burden. Am I not an example? Yesterday an immigrant, today a Member of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The wind of freedom of the Arab Spring is still blowing. More than 20 years after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the two Germanies were reconciled and reunited, now the Mediterranean is also no longer a frontier with respect to what unites the people of North Africa, in particular, with the people of South Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">We need these readmission agreements and, Commissioner, above all conclusion of the bilateral agreements with Tunisia, with Libya and with Egypt which we have discussed and on which you have worked so many times with great commitment, although once or twice we were probably unlucky. The free elections that will take place in October are a strong sign of this energetic movement towards the achievement of fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">A serious, concrete and credible measure in the context of good neighbourly relations with Tunisia needs to be put in place. At the same time, and I am referring to what the Commissioner said, on the subject of solidarity, only eight states have signalled their willingness to accept resettlement. This is too few, just as the willingness of the same states to help with the serious problems that Lampedusa and Pantelleria continue to suffer is also inadequate in my opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been to Pantelleria and Lampedusa. The migrants who were not refugees were migrants who destroyed the two buildings in which they were housed because they were supposed to be being repatriated. So, we must distinguish economic migrants from refugees and safeguard fundamental rights, bearing in mind that in the Mediterranean the European Union must take on a leading role and that this has not hitherto been the case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Originally from Eritrea, they suffered harsh treatment before reaching a camp in Tunisia.

Unfortunately, Italy has failed to find a solution to the crisis caused by almost 50 000 illegal immigrants who arrived there at the start of the year, in spite of the promises made by Prime Minister Berlusconi during the visit in March. In fact, the European Union has failed to find a way to tackle the exodus triggered by the instability in Tunisia and the war in Libya. The repatriation agreement is not a viable solution, especially given the tragedy involving thousands of refugees at the border between Tunisia and Libya.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has failed to keep its commitment to assist refugees on Tunisian territory and is unable to manage the crisis on its own territory either.

Resettlement is of course an extremely important life-saving measure for the most vulnerable people, but it is also a way to show solidarity. We have all rejoiced at events as the people of Tunisia, Libya and Egypt have risen to throw out their dictators and call for freedom and democracy. In the war in Libya, trying to throw out Gaddafi and his regime, we have all supported it and do support it. It has led to a lot of refugees. Many of these people have gone to Libya. Many of these people have been able to return to their home, their country of origin, with help from the European Union, we must remember that. The Tunisian authorities have also done formidable work to ease the situation. Some people might still be able to go home and some, as was said, could maybe go back to Libya when the situation becomes a bit more stable, but there are people who cannot return.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also been to the camp you referred to in Tunisia and I saw people from Eritrea, from Somalia, looking at their fellow refugees in the neighbouring tents, disappearing one after another, being sent home or somewhere else, asking, ‘Why? What will happen to me?’ They cannot go home, they have no state to go to because that state is a failed state, or they are persecuted. We must help these people.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States have done a lot. Some have offered resettlement. Some have offered more, and that is still to be processed, and I want to thank these Member States. I think we should also thank the US, Australia and Canada, because they have taken a lot but, dear friends, it is our neighbourhood. We are the European neighbours of these countries. We could do much more and I hope that we can after this come together even more, ask Member States to do more, to take responsibility. We are certainly willing on the Commission side to do our part. We have called for pledging meetings. We have asked the Member States, we have put resources at our disposal, we are even offering transport support for these people to come to the European Union, but Member States must also now live up to their promises and their nice words about solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
