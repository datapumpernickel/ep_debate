For whatever reason the Council is not going to reply to this question.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased, however, that this debate is taking place today instead of being, as is usually the case, one of the last items on the agenda of the last day of one of our Strasbourg part-sessions. I hope that these debates can take place during the sittings on the “important days” in Strasbourg, because fishing deserves it, and an agreement of the importance of the one we will discuss today, even more so.</p>
<p class="contents">I would especially like to thank Mr Fischler for his punctual presence, and to thank him also for honouring the promise that he made to the Committee on Fisheries, in the hearing of 30 August, when he told us that he would give priority to the fisheries agreement with Morocco, which can be seen from the promptness with which he has drawn up a proposed mandate for negotiation. I wish therefore for this expression of thanks to be noted.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also congratulate ourselves on the fact that the Council has approved, despite the storm clouds which had gathered, this proposed mandate. Therefore, we now have a mandate for negotiation of the fisheries agreement with Morocco. If we add to this the fact that the two budgetary authorities – that is, the Council and Parliament – have declared themselves in favour of the political priority of funding this fisheries agreement, we will conclude, Mr Fischler, that “all” that is left is to negotiate and sign it. That is your challenge now, with no doubt whatsoever, but in this task you can count on the support of this Parliament and of course the help of the Committee on Fisheries which I preside over.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to inform you that on the 29th in our committee we will have a wide-ranging audience with the sector affected by this fisheries agreement with Morocco and the participation of the European Commission would also be desirable.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure it is not necessary, Mr Fischler, to emphasise once again the importance of this agreement with Morocco to certain Member States, such as Spain and Portugal, and to certain autonomous communities such as Galicia, Andalusia and the Canary Islands, all of which, as is well known, come within Objective 1, are very dependent on fishing and at the moment have no other fishing grounds for their fleets and have a business structure which does not allow certain types of cooperation. Commissioner, you will have the opportunity to observe what we are talking about on your next visit to Galicia, which we await with open arms.</p>
<p class="contents">A significant amount of the supply of fish to the European market depends on this agreement, as do many direct jobs, as well as many more involved in the industry and services. The proposed resolutions presented speak for themselves and I need no more evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent seminar between Europe and Morocco which took place in our own Parliament highlighted the great interest, at the highest level, which Morocco has in Europe. “Cooperation” has been the mostly commonly used word. Well, the cooperation which the European Union is asking of Morocco at the moment is in the specific field of fishing. In relation to fishing we have no choice but to understand each other and cooperate. It is not a matter of exchanging one thing for another: fruit for fish. It is a matter of cooperating in the area of fishing. It is a matter of reaching the best possible agreement in terms of fishing cooperation. When? How? Fortunately the European Union is an economic, financial and commercial power. Fortunately we have structural mechanisms which provide for the negotiation contingencies. And, at the moment, I call on the Finnish Presidency to go ahead in the next Council with the FIFG Regulations and on the Commission, Mr Fischler, to be flexible in this text so that it may come closer to the position of the European Parliament. It is urgent that we foresee these contingencies in our structural aid and also, in exceptional cases, both for shipowners and for fishermen.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, we should not be excessively hasty: our legislative and budgetary forecasts allow us to deal with a protracted negotiation. It is better to have a prolonged negotiation, resulting in a good agreement, than a bad one achieved quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">What kind of agreement, Commissioner? One which continues to allow the fishing activities of the different fleets which today fish in those waters. What kind of cooperation? The widest possible, which must also include extractive cooperation, since if Europe is the principal market for the export of Moroccan fish, to subscribe to cooperation in terms of marketing and processing is not what is necessary, given that the market is controlled from the centres of consumption rather than from the centres of production. In any event, Mr Fischler, a genuine association policy should involve the opening up of that country to European investments, including in the field of extractive fishing. This will allow us to compete under equal conditions, putting Europeans and Moroccans on the same footing.</p>
<p class="contents">Equality has to be both real and effective and therefore non-discriminatory with regard to measures for the conservation of resources. Let us make sure, Commissioner, that what happened with the agreement with Argentina never happens again. Effective measures concerning the monitoring and control of the issues agreed, equally applicable to both parties, will be necessary. Nobody has a greater interest than the European Union in protecting resources and fishing responsibly. Let us ensure that the other party guarantees that it will apply these measures in the reproduction areas of the various species, where European fleets do not fish, and in those areas where both parties fish, and that closed seasons and temporary fishing bans are also applied, without discrimination and with a mutual system of control.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the European Parliament will support you politically and financially. That is why we have asked to be associated with this negotiation, which I hope will be approved in the coming tripartite meetings. Therefore, Mr Fischler, now – as we say in my country, on which you will no doubt become a great expert – good luck and <span class="italic">al toro</span> [take the bull by the horns]. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For our part, all the arrangements to be able to start these negotiations had been made a long time ago. Thank you, Mr Varela, for the good luck you wished me in this matter. Since it is more to do with ships, perhaps it would be more appropriate, rather than wishing for me to take the bull by the horns, to take the helm, using the more nautical expression. </p>
<p class="contents">The objective of these negotiations is to seek new forms of cooperation in the fisheries sector together, which are in harmony with the development of the Moroccan fisheries sector and with maintaining the catch capacity of the European fleet. As you also know, in spite of all the efforts undertaken on the part of the Commission, and in part by my predecessor, Morocco has still not wished to hold any exploratory meetings. Consequently, on the occasion of the meeting which you already mentioned, Mr Varela, on 21 October with Prime Minister Youssoufi, I offered to take up the negotiations in Morocco personally. In the meantime, the Moroccan authorities have approached us with regard to setting a definitive deadline. Since it has been mentioned, I would also like to point out that I have been invited to participate at the meeting of the Committee on Fisheries on 29 November. That is the date that was set. To be perfectly frank I envisage some problems there, as at that time I am also required to be in Seattle for the opening of the WTO Millennium Round. I would therefore ask you to understand that we shall either have to postpone this meeting or you will have to hold your Committee meeting without me.</p>
<p class="contents">I absolutely agree with you that we must spare no effort in order to successfully sign this agreement. But we all know, too, that it is going to be tremendously difficult, and you mentioned the discussions on this matter with the Moroccans last week. I attended some of these talks myself, and I had to observe that up to now the Moroccans’ attitude towards us has been anything but positive. I would also like to go into one other matter, and this concerns what should happen after November, after the agreement has expired, if the discontinuation of fishing activity is enforced. The Commission intends accordingly to apply the possible terms of Community law in favour of the crews and fishery firms affected. But the legal basis for applying these, especially after December, will be the new structural measures. It will therefore be important for an appropriate decision to be taken in Council in good time so that we have a legal basis for having available, at least, an instrument to be able to guarantee financial support to the fishing firms and fishermen affected in that event. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cunha (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, since 1992 the European Union has had fisheries agreements with Morocco, and the one which is currently in force expires at the end of November as we all know. By means of this agreement, around 500 boats from the European Union, of which 50 are Portuguese, have access to Moroccan waters in return for an annual payment of around EUR 125 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Given what happened in 1994, I have no doubt that we are faced with huge problems. Morocco feels that its fisheries resources are extremely valuable and also that they are permanently under siege by the large international fishing powers such as Japan, South Korea or Russia, who want to fish even more intensively than they currently do in their waters. </p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to remember here that this fisheries agreement with Morocco is part of a larger framework of cooperation and partnership by means of which the European Union also grants Morocco major commercial concessions and considerable support for its development. From the European Union’s point of view, it is important to point out that there are some Member States that feel that the cost to the budget of the European Union’s fisheries agreements with third countries is excessive. </p>
<p class="contents">This is why I would like to use my speech to highlight four points. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it is important to highlight the fact that the fisheries agreement with Morocco is by far the most important one the European Union has, representing more than 30% of all catches by the Community fleet in third country waters. The 30,000 jobs which are directly or indirectly dependent on this Agreement may seem few on a European Union-wide scale, but the fact that they are concentrated in small fishing communities, mainly on the Portuguese and Spanish coasts, which have no tradition of economic compensation and no likelihood of receiving any could make the elimination of these jobs an extremely serious matter.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is important to remind those Member States of the Union that are less enthusiastic about these fisheries agreements that a study made recently by independent experts shows that in return for the EUR 485 million spent by the Union in payment for access to third country waters, we gain a volume of business of around EUR 1500 million, which means that the benefits gained from the international fisheries agreements are three times greater than the costs they incur. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would also like to highlight the fact that these agreements create an added value of EUR 107 million for these third countries, generating around 18,000 jobs, which means that as well as respecting the biological balance of species, the European Union’s fisheries agreements with these countries have contributed to their long-term development. </p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, I would like to emphasise the importance of the sustainability of this agreement, because only a time-scale of at least five or six years would be able to provide a degree of stability for those working in the industry, and a certain medium-term vision in order to implement structural action on controls, assessment and supervision. </p>
<p class="contents">And finally, it is important therefore, that the Council and the Commission perform their work and inform Parliament about it. It is long overdue and I think that the Commission, the Council and the Member States can be blamed for this delay especially by those governments that were most involved in this matter. As the saying goes, “better late than never”. The speed at which we negotiate is becoming a prime factor given the uncertainty and anguish that the lack of a decision is causing fishermen and their families even now. Socio-economic measures must therefore be provided for compensation both for fishermen and for the processing industry if there is a halt in activity as a result of a possible delay in the negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is to say, Mr Fischler, that on 1 December 7,000 European fishermen will lose their jobs, 477 Community ships will remain moored in our ports, 10,000 jobs in the preserving and processing industries will be under threat, as well as many thousands more, relating to marketing and dockyard activities, will also be at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">And these are jobs, Commissioner – and I want to warn you of this – in coastal areas which are highly dependent on fishing, Objective 1 regions, where fishing is the principal activity.</p>
<p class="contents">In Galicia, which is my region, extractive fishing plays a part in 45 of the 56 Galician economic activities. The Community fleet which fishes in this fishing ground, Commissioner, has been decreasing agreement after agreement in terms of the number of ships and fishermen. This does not surprise me, but we cannot imagine that the ships and men who have fished there for decades, and of course long before the Jamaica Convention, will disappear overnight.</p>
<p class="contents">The aid to shipowners and fishermen which is going to result from the FIFG has already been mentioned. I would like to tell you, Commissioner, that, firstly, neither the fishermen nor the shipowners wish to be subsidised. They are hard-working sea-faring people, who just want to work in the job that they know and for which they take such risks.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, these subsidies are never going to make it to a certain proportion of the population affected by this stoppage: to Mrs Manuela, who owns a fishmongers, to Mr Antonio, who sells electrical goods, or to the traditional boat-builders who are carrying out their work in the Galician training workshop in Rianxo because there will be no boats to repair.</p>
<p class="contents">And, furthermore, Commissioner, if these subsidies are paid with FIFG resources, which are scarce and which are aimed at the adaptation and renovation of fleets, there will be fewer resources for the objectives of this fishing fund. Four years ago this Parliament declared itself in favour of creating a line specifically to deal with halts of fleets, unforeseen crises and circumstances such as a delay in the renewal of agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">After the expiry of the previous agreement, Commissioner, there was a halt which lasted seven months, to which we have to add the natural biological stoppages and other bans which were not so much biological as arbitrary, imposed by the Moroccan Administration on a European Commission which was not able to defend the interests of its people, which was illustrated by the numerous unjustified seizures including some which were outside the Moroccan exclusive economic zone.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask the Commissioner what he plans to do with regard to preventing the re-occurrence of this situation because, until now, I have no idea what he intends. Neither do I know – since the Commissioner mentions it – what the Commissioner’s position is and how fishing will be defended at the Seattle Summit. I have seen how active you have been in the newspapers, Commissioner, in defence of agriculture, but I have heard nothing about fishing. I believe it would be useful if you were to establish a line of defence for European fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">But the Council is also doing a dreadful job, especially in view of its incomprehensible inactivity with regard to providing the Commission with a mandate for negotiations with the Moroccan Government.</p>
<p class="contents">And I believe that the Council’s delay can only be explained by the lack of pressure from the Government of the Member State which should be most interested in this Agreement. And further proof of this disinterest on the part of the Council is its absence today in this debate: disinterest in the fisheries agreement with Morocco and a lack of respect for this Parliament which represents all the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament, which will have to express its opinion on the future agreement by means of the assent procedure, must – I believe – be involved with the other institutions during the negotiations with the Moroccan government. There is no place here for a late and bad consultation, as is normally the case.</p>
<p class="contents">And I would like to say to you, Commissioner, that I believe that the current agreement already has the characteristics of a second generation agreement and that, therefore, you must not insist on that position, which you have indicated, of saying that the negotiation is going to be very difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement is not limited to mere financial compensation. There are already joint Euro-Moroccan enterprises and these will continue to exist, but this cannot be an exclusive model. Because we must not demand that shipowners get rid of their fishermen, with all their <span class="italic">savoir faire</span>, and we Socialists will not allow the continuation of certain companies to take place at the expense of their fishermen.</p>
<p class="contents">The existing agreement and the one to come are a sign of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation and benefit both parties. Within the future agreement the Community must offer its technical services so that Morocco may also put its fishing fleet in order.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Fischler, with regard to fishing, you have not yet begun your work, or at least, you have scarcely started and started badly. You are still an unknown Commissioner, and I say “started badly” because of your unfortunate début of announcing the probable disbanding of the Directorate-General for Fisheries which, as you well know, caused a real storm in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">But I would like to tell you, Commissioner, that we are not going to take that into account. You were an acting Commissioner and I would like to borrow the metaphor of Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna and tell you that you have a good bull, a <span class="italic">miura</span>,<span class="italic"> </span>to fight; carry out good negotiations, bring them to a satisfactory conclusion, defend the interests of the European fishermen as the Moroccan Government will defend the interests of theirs.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McKenna (Greens/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, first of all our group did not sign this resolution for a number of very important reasons. We find it very one-sided and a blatant demand for Morocco to give in to European demands regardless of what it wants. We Greens believe it is up to Morocco to decide how best to benefit from its resources in its own waters.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most deplorable aspects of this resolution is the failure to address the issue of the Western Sahara. Last night a representative of the Saharoui people spoke to the Greens. He told us of EU-flag vessels fishing off the coast of Western Sahara. The border of the Western Sahara is established at 27° 4’. North of that is Morocco and south of that is the Western Sahara. We all know that the Saharoui people are supposed to vote in a referendum very soon on self-determination but of course many serious problems have been posed by the Moroccans.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no EU country that has recognised Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara, but according to the Saharoui people, at the same time the EU pays EUR 500 million to Morocco. EU vessels fish hake and other species in waters off Morocco, and Morocco has no legal jurisdiction in these waters. Many people believe this constitutes illegal fishing. Some might even go as far as to call it piracy. These are very serious allegations and I should also point out that similar allegations have been made as regards Somalia.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commission what assurances it can give that this is not happening. Current agreements with Morocco have provisions for an experimental satellite system. Can the Commission reassure us, through the results, that EU vessels are not engaging in illegal fishing. I should add that the representative stressed that they had no problem whatsoever with EU/Morocco agreements. Their concern was that it be “legal”, that is, restricted to Moroccan waters only.</p>
<p class="contents">Our problems with the resolution are not just on this point – although it is a very serious issue. The Greens would like to stress first of all that we are not, as many people would have it, against fisheries agreements with third countries but we have very important conditions that we want attached to those agreements. We want them to be more equitable, less environmentally and socially damaging and consistent with other Community policies.</p>
<p class="contents">There are specific criteria that we would like to follow. First of all with regard to all EU fisheries agreements, not just Moroccan agreements: they should follow the precautionary approach. Most people subscribe to this in theory but not in practice. Simply put, in the case of agreements there must be clear scientific proof that added fishing pressure from proposed EU activities will not compromise sustainability of fish stocks. If we cannot be sure that fish are available these particular species should not be put in the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The second criteria is that the regional approach should be followed. All countries involved in fishing the relevant stocks, be they coastal states or distant water states, should be involved in assessments of stocks and negotiations over how much fishing is done and who has the right to do it. This approach is followed very successfully in the South Pacific on tuna and there is no reason whatsoever that it should not apply here.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a consistent EU approach of negotiating with one state at a time. This is not acceptable. Control is also a very big problem in most of these agreements. The third countries simply do not have the resources to ensure that the vessels from the EU and other distant water fleets respect the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">We know the problems that the Member States have in their own waters, so it must be very difficult indeed for these other countries to be able to tackle these problems. Satellite systems are a very small but positive step, but a lot more needs to be done. In 1997 the Council requested an in-depth analysis of the EU third country agreements. The summary report is now available. It was discussed on Tuesday at the Council meeting. We welcome this study very much and hope that the Council will now conduct a wide-ranging debate, both within the Council itself and with other sectors of society, about these EU fisheries agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the conclusions of the report are questionable but at least it provides some hard information and figures on the agreements. This is something that was sorely needed and has been called for for a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point I want to make, as previous speakers have and, I suspect, most of the following speakers will, concerns the importance of this and other fisheries agreements to certain regions of the Community which are heavily dependent upon fishing. The Greens sympathise with their plight and trust that appropriate compensation will be made available for those fishery workers who are put out of work in the eventuality of a halt in fishing activities. But the current EU policy is doing them a disservice by continually holding out hopes that there are fish available for them somewhere. It is fanning false hopes. It is clear that there are limits to how much fish is available. For many years the FAO has been warning of the problems, yet we keep looking for fish somewhere else until there is nowhere else. If one looks at Community statistics on employment in the sector, it is clear that this is on the decline. Much of this is due to the continued industrialisation of the sector, developing even larger vessels which require fewer people. While this serves to make fishermen’s lives easier and safer, it does come with certain social costs in terms of employment. The aspect of employment in all sectors of the fishing industry needs to be reviewed. It is affected by many factors including structural policy which does not take employment into account in issues of vessel size.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to come back again to the point of Morocco’s right to make its own decisions. On behalf of the Green Group, I went with the Committee on Fisheries last year to Morocco and the Moroccans were very clear: they did not want to sign the last agreement. They did so only under extreme pressure from the European Union including a letter from Jacques Santer pleading and begging with the Moroccans to agree this last time; this would be the last agreement; the EU needed time to find another solution. But nothing has been done to find other solutions and this has to be done. We cannot force our wishes on other countries. We must respect their rights. We must have equitable agreements with other countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And also in terms of the unpleasant incidents that would ensue from a possible stoppage of the fleets working in Moroccan waters, with all the inherent tension and social costs.</p>
<p class="contents">And as far as this is concerned, I cannot fail to highlight the mistake made four or five years ago by establishing a fisheries agreement outside the broader framework of the cooperation agreement established between the European Union and Morocco. At the time we drew attention to the dangers that would ensue, and now we have new and inevitable consequences, specifically the demands for more Moroccan fishermen on Community vessels, fishing licences restricted to new, joint ventures, the obligation to unload fish in Moroccan ports, more concessions in the agricultural area etc. </p>
<p class="contents">Of course we are in favour of and want to reach a rapid and efficient negotiation with the Kingdom of Morocco, which will be to our mutual advantage. But we think that it is vital that the negotiations about to start, which may prove to be difficult and slow, are directed towards certain key areas at Community level. Firstly, the fisheries agreement will definitely have to be incorporated into our overall cooperation agreement with that country. Next, we cannot make more concessions or give more compensation in the area of agriculture, and the current jobs in the fisheries industry must be guaranteed. And finally, but no less importantly, we must take every precaution and provide for appropriate compensation in case of a possible and undesirable stoppage of the Community fleet’s fishing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Souchet (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, the fisheries agreement with the Kingdom of Morocco is by far the most important ever signed by the European Union by virtue of the number of Community vessels which it affects, the fishing opportunities which it opens up and the jobs which depend directly on it, more than 8,000 fishermen and 20, 000 workers.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of regions within several European Union Member States are closely, if not totally, dependent on this fisheries agreement. Everyone here knows that if this agreement were not renewed, then the whole European Union fishing sector would suffer indirectly from the consequences. Effectively, the fishing vessels that could no longer fish in Moroccan waters would inevitably transfer their activities to other areas, thus risking causing dangerous chain reactions and imbalances harmful to everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">It should have come as no surprise to the Commission to find that the Moroccans are tough negotiators. It should have come to this conclusion before. We already experienced considerable difficulties when negotiating the agreement currently in force. It is, furthermore, perfectly legitimate for Morocco to seek to manage its fishing resources to the best advantage of its long-term interests. It would be remiss of us to reproach them for this. But it must be possible to integrate this requirement properly, and respect it fully, within the framework of a new agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, has the Commission made our Moroccan friends sufficiently aware of the formidable consequences that Member States of the Union would have to deal with as a result of the non-renewal of this fisheries agreement with them? We have the impression that the Commission has not shown the necessary zeal in this matter. The fisheries agreement expires on 30 November. The Commission was very tardy in requesting its negotiating mandate. New negotiations have not been initiated, even though the deadline is only one month away.</p>
<p class="contents">What mechanism is envisaged, Commissioner, if the situation becomes deadlocked, to prevent the vessels directly concerned, the fishing sector participants affected, the regions concerned and, most especially, Objective 1 and 2 areas which are dependent on fishing, as our joint resolutions specifies, bearing the brunt of the disastrous consequences in the event of non-renewal of the agreement? Just now, Commissioner, you were rather vague on this essential point. There is no question that the Commission has demonstrated passivity, incompetence and laxity, even though this is an essential task entrusted to it under the terms of the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission does not now devote all the energy needed to preserve this fundamental pillar of the common fisheries policy which the fisheries agreements represent, then there will be great and justified pressure from those working in the fishing sector to demand that the common fisheries policy is challenged and a bilateral framework reintroduced enabling fisheries agreements to be signed directly between Member States and third countries, agreements which would better respect and defend the vital interests of our nations.</p>
<p class="contents">This is to say, Commissioner, that the issues involved in the negotiations with Morocco are particularly important to the very future of the common fisheries policy. We therefore hope that in Brussels, Strasbourg or Seattle, you will give it all the priority attention which it demands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martinez (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, the matter of renegotiating the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement which is due to expire on 30 November has been referred to us. This is one of the 29 fisheries agreements signed by the European Union with around fifteen countries of Africa and countries bordering the Indian Ocean. These negotiations are going to take place in a specific context, characterised by two new elements, firstly, the death of His Majesty Hassan II, the last giant figure in the history of the twentieth century, and, secondly, the principle of Turkey’s candidacy for accession, accepted a few days ago. When proposing to integrate a country which has nothing in common with Europe, it is hard to voice significant reservations with regard to Morocco which at least shares with Spain or France its language, history and economic relationships.</p>
<p class="contents">Technically, Morocco wants comprehensive negotiations on fishing, the preservations of fish stocks, on local industry and even, more generally, on our agricultural dealings with Morocco. The position of our countries is essentially a budgetary position, with a cost of EUR 125 million per year. The main beneficiary is Spain which carries out 20% of its fishing production within the framework of the agreement with Morocco, Mauritania and Senegal. As for Portugal and France, they benefit to a lesser extent, and Italy too would like to derive advantage from it. Furthermore, Morocco wishes to preserve fishing resources within its economic area, and other countries, such as Great Britain, are announcing their concerns about the budget. It is true that the Community budget allocated to fisheries agreements is not inconsiderable: EUR 300 million, or 5% of the budget for European external policies. It is a not inconsiderable sum then, even if we lose nothing in the deal. If IFREMER is to be believed, then, for every euro invested, the turnover generated for Europe would be around three euros, and the added value would be 900 million. The Spanish are the main beneficiaries, with the Canaries where 91% of the fleet is dependent on this agreement, and with Andalusia where 75% of the fleet is involved, and there would be a cost to pay if there were to be no agreement. And indeed Morocco does not lose out either since almost a thousand jobs are affected by this agreement, for an annual added value of 36 million. But the Moroccans bring up, quite rightly, the risk of over-exploitation of fishing resources. Forty years ago, fishing catches worldwide were less than 20 million tonnes, today they are around 100 million tonnes, even if Europe is not responsible, as we are fishing less and less in the Mediterranean, where our share is no more than 40% of the catch. It is important, then, to monitor these fishing resources, which I know well, from the small ports of Oualidia or Media down to Mauritania by way of the Western Sahara, which I must remind Mrs McKenna is not independent, but has belonged to Morocco for centuries.</p>
<p class="contents">How are we to find a compromise with the Moroccan Minister, El Khyari? On the European side, we could make concessions on the development of the local Moroccan processing industry, on aid for scientific research and on landings in Moroccan ports. There are still two stumbling blocks: firstly, the matter of abandoning community preference in the field of agriculture, and we already know the problems affecting the sectors of tomatoes, early fruit and vegetables or horticulture, and secondly, another point, on which we cannot yield involves trading the Spanish fleet’s fishing rights for an increase in immigration in a Europe which already has 18 million unemployed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Fischler, you reminded us that you will be in Seattle. The problem must therefore be considered at a much higher level. These are not negotiations regarding just fishing, but are far wider-ranging negotiations, Euro-Mediterranean talks, or even WTO talks. If, in Seattle, we are going to give in to the United States on the subject of compensation funding in agriculture, then it will be difficult to refuse Morocco similar concessions in the agricultural sector. Clearly, too, Morocco-Europe relations must be evaluated at the summit. We must take advantage of His Majesty Mohamed VI’s forthcoming visit to Parliament to undertake comprehensive renegotiations, and we must ensure that Morocco is not destabilised by the sort of foolish remarks made just now by Mrs McKenna regarding some putative Saharan sovereignty. We know full well what the consequences would be if Algeria had access to the Atlantic coastline.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs Morocco and vice-versa. The agreement must therefore be sought with respect for our shared identities, for sovereignty and also for our separate identities, while acknowledging that history has made Morocco, if not a cultural exception, then at least a Mediterranean exception, for Europe in general and for France in particular. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is never late if the outcome is good. And at least we have a good mandate, above all in view of its ability to seek different forms of possible cooperation and even new legal formulas which may allow us to maintain satisfactory fishing relations for both parties.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should regret the delay, which has created public alarm and a nervous state within the fleet which could have been avoided, and the speculation and declarations which may do more harm than good to negotiations which, given the importance of the agreement, should be held in a discreet, calm and cordial environment. But also because, at this stage, a halt in fishing activities seems inevitable, which will necessitate, as happened at the time of the expiry of the previous agreement, a search for extraordinary Community funds to finance time when the fleet is forced to remain in port. </p>
<p class="contents">I am not going to repeat the arguments which other Members have given and which illustrate the enormous importance of this agreement and its socio-economic repercussions. But I do want to insist that, for all these well-known reasons, the fleet is in suspense, and since it also has to pay for an ever increasing proportion of the fisheries agreements, it has stated that it is not prepared to not receive information regarding the progress of the negotiations. Natural discretion and reserve is one thing but secretiveness towards those who have everything to lose is another thing altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries knows very well what it feels like to beg for information from here and there amongst the negotiators, even in these times of transparency and cooperation which we have just inaugurated.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, like the industry itself, I believe that this time – and in this case I am particularly sorry that the Council is not here, because it is to them that I mainly address my comments – we must stand firm and show that, even though we have spent years asking and begging to be able to take part, as simple observers, in the negotiations of the fisheries agreements, this participation can no longer be postponed, Mr President. It is the case that, within the meagre budget which fishing represents in Community funding, the agreement with Morocco implies a relatively significant amount, so much so, Mr President, that it is the only agreement for which we are asked for our assent. We are therefore legally bound to the result of the negotiations and we have, therefore, the full right to first-hand information, without having to wait for the charity of representatives of the Council or the Commission who may come to inform us third-hand whenever they can or whenever it suits them.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens also demand information and we are the representatives of those citizens, elected by them and, for this simple reason, we have acquired the responsibility, in this case, to at least be informed of what is happening.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, I hope that the question of observers, which appears in at least one of the motions for resolution also signed by my group, is taken seriously for once. And to this end I ask, as other Members have done as well as the motion for a resolution, that this be, once and for all, a priority issue in the next tripartite meeting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is not only an economic problem. And if it were, that alone would have required the Commission to act more rapidly and to take the initiative in this matter. It is also the problem of the relationship between two countries in a part of the world that needs peace and tranquillity. And this is why this Agreement is of strategic importance, not only in relation to these fishing communities, but also in relation to the balance, to the peace that can only be achieved by means of various types of cooperation, this being a case in point. </p>
<p class="contents">But now that we have reached this situation, we should work out why it is that we have done so. And the Commissioner is not new to the Commission; he is a Commissioner who has joined us from the previous Commission. He has joined us with exactly the same portfolio and the same dossier, and therefore, he has a very specific and genuine political responsibility which is his alone, not only to resolve this problem, but also to resolve all the problems that will remain until the agreement is renegotiated. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to tell you sincerely, Commissioner, that I was not very convinced by your speech a while ago. I sensed little enthusiasm, and it seemed to me that you have come here to give an administrative response to what is a worrying situation. This is a cause for concern not only to me, but certainly to my fellow Members in Parliament too. What fishermen need to know on this specific point is not that the Commission will be implementing initiatives and not that the Commission is prepared to help them. What the fisherman need to know, Commissioner, is what kind of initiatives are going to be implemented, and above all, what amount of Community subsidy is going to be provided to help these fishermen, and for how long the Commission is prepared to maintain it. Because, as Mr Miguélez said, what the fishermen need is not to be financed to remain inactive, but to be supported by the European Union so that they can carry out their professional duty, which means being able to work and thus contribute to the wealth of their country and to the wealth of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Commissioner, I am asking you for concrete responses. You know that you are already not very popular in Portugal because of the meat issue. We hope that your popularity does not continue to decline because of fish! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I refer to a Community region, European politically speaking but African geographically speaking, which is called the Canary Islands and is situated on the Atlantic flank opposite Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years, including Spain’s time as a democracy, we have experienced various situations where fishing has always been an unresolved issue between the parties because of the contentious issue of defining our territorial waters in relation to the neighbouring continent of Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we have recently managed to take cooperative positions, by means of the Morocco-European Union agreements, despite having other unresolved matters, such as agriculture (tomatoes), the environment (nuclear energy policy) and the Saharan referendum, which affects us significantly from a global point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the Committee on Agriculture and Fisheries of the Spanish Senate has begun a visit to the Canary Islands in order to directly familiarise themselves with the problems facing the primary sector: agriculture and fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the Government of the Canary Islands has also expressed his desire to visit Morocco in order to hold a dialogue and often a direct channel of communication with the Moroccan Government, along the lines of the good neighbourliness which should characterise the relations between two neighbouring and civilised peoples, since frequently the viscosity of reality – as Mr Obiols said so well the other day during the debate in Brussels in relation to the common destiny of Europe and Morocco – does not always permit the most appropriate type of action.</p>
<p class="contents">We trust that peace and stability will reign in our Atlantic area and we have a good opportunity to use the fisheries agreement or other European instruments for transnational cooperation to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Morocco will fulfil its international obligations, as indicated in the talks held last week in Brussels by the Moroccan authorities. In any event, I hope that the diplomacy of the European Commission will adequately defend the general interests of the Community fishermen who are affected by this future fisheries agreement between the European Union and Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to remind you of a Spanish saying – which I believe is relevant today – which says: “he who wants to eat fish, Commissioner, must get his breeches wet”. For this reason there are many of us here, Mr Fischler, who want to convince you of the social and economic importance of renewing the European Union-Morocco fisheries agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To this end, I support the resolution tabled by the European Popular Party, the European Socialist Party and the UEN Group, and I belong to the group of ten MEPs from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance who have expressly supported it. Logically, our position is a consequence of our conception of the relationships of the European Union and also the specific interests of the countries which we represent.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to express our support for the signing of the agreement for two fundamental reasons. Firstly, because we consider that the policy of reaching agreements with non-EU countries is a correct policy on the part of the European Union. In this case it is a policy which affects an essential industry, which affects a significant section of our society as well as employment in certain countries. It affects the way of life of our coastal populations, in the same way that agriculture affects the populations of our inland regions and – why not say it – it affects a fundamental part of the food requirements of the entire European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We clearly want these agreements to respect the conservation of resources. We clearly want them to defend and respect the interests of non-EU countries. But I would like to say that the agreements should not only refer to poor non-EU countries, that is, Morocco, Angola and other countries, but that they should also refer, and this is also a European Union Policy, to agreements with Canada, the United States, Australia and Argentina, countries with which my country – specifically Galicia – has a direct relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that at last, agreeing with these arguments, the Spanish Economic and Social Council has said that European Union agreements with non-EU countries lead to seven times the benefit than the cost of producing them.</p>
<p class="contents">I said that this particularly affects the territories of the Spanish and Portuguese States: the Canary Islands, Andalusia and Galicia, in Spain. In Galicia, specifically, you know that 120,000 jobs rely directly or indirectly on fishing and that the agreement with Morocco especially affects three very significant areas: Ribeira, O Morrazo and A Guarda, where there are approximately 150 ships and 1,500 sailors who depend on the signing of the agreement with Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you here that on 15 November 1995 the economic and social cooperation agreement with Morocco was only signed after Morocco had agreed that a fisheries agreement had to be signed. I say this because these two agreements, which were considered essential if the Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Barcelona was to take place, shows that in our fisheries agreement, as we and Morocco want, all relations, political, economic and social, with the neighbouring Mediterranean kingdom should be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to say that no agreement will be valid unless it conforms to the fishing industry as it actually exists. The fishing industry in the Kingdom of Morocco is made up of small businesses owned by shipowners for whom it is absolutely impossible to create joint enterprises which are largely Moroccan. Therefore, the new agreement must be an agreement which extends, while amending the necessary clauses, the current agreement, bearing in mind, of course, that we respect the fact that this agreement must benefit the economic and social development of Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we want a quick negotiation and in any event we want significant and sufficient economic support for the sector affected – shipowners and workers – to cover any transitional period during which there is no right to fish in those waters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jové Peres (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, my political group has tabled its own resolution and amendments to the resolution of the other political groups. I am not going to insist on the different aspects of the resolution, which you already know, I am simply going to refer to certain specific points which – I am afraid – may be important in our future debates.</p>
<p class="contents">First point: joint enterprises. It appears that Morocco would be prepared to sign an agreement in which joint enterprises were the principal element. What does this mean? Simply that it would be an agreement which would only benefit certain shipowners. The small-scale and inshore fleet would be of no interest to Morocco in terms of establishing joint enterprises; this would mean, in areas such as ours where employment problems are very serious, the scrapping of small vessels and a reduction in employment. On the other hand, joint enterprises would mean fewer Community crews and the demand by Morocco for more landings in Moroccan ports. This would mean cutting jobs. If this were the principal element of the agreement, it would benefit the type of fleet which is multi-purpose and larger-sized which, in any event, is already looking for other fishing grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">Second point: on the 26th, Commissioner Fischler – according to items in various parts of the media in my country – appears to have expressed his approval of considering additional concessions in the importation of fruit and vegetables originating from Morocco in the negotiation of the fisheries agreement. In this regard, we should take into account three factors: firstly, fruit and vegetable are grown in the European Union in areas where there is also an urgent need for employment; secondly, fruit and vegetable are frequently used as an exchange currency in commercial agreements with non-EU countries and thirdly, in the last reform of this sector, important public instruments for market management were dismantled. Therefore, it is not admissible for fruit and vegetables to pay the price for a large part of the European Union’s external policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that, during the negotiation of the fisheries agreement which is about to expire, the Group of the European United Left opposed the signing of a fisheries agreement through the concession of additional quotas for the importation of fruit and vegetables within the framework of the parallel negotiation of the Association Agreement. Initially it was a question of balance: while the fisheries agreement was in force temporarily, the conditions for fruit and vegetables were of a permanent nature.</p>
<p class="contents">Frequently, these concessions are granted as a contribution to the development of non-EU countries. Nevertheless, the reality is much more complex. And in the case of Morocco, 85% of tomato production and exportation is carried out by five companies; the largest of them is <span class="italic">Domain Royal</span>, which belongs to the royal family, and the other four belong to the Moroccan aristocracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The cuts to the fisheries agreement to favour the Moroccan fishing industry only benefited the main owner of the cephalopod-fishing fleet, a family relation of the former Minister for External Affairs. This does not exactly favour a just and egalitarian development, but rather benefits certain interests.</p>
<p class="contents">And lastly, I would like to refer to the way that negotiations are carried out. Traditionally, Morocco does not negotiate until the previous agreement has run out and the fleet is halted, with the social tension which that causes. This time the same thing will happen. This attitude cannot be permitted from a supposed partner. My group wishes for a just and balanced agreement with the Kingdom of Morocco on the part of the European Union, but we also think that, in order to prevent this periodic bartering which causes our fishermen enormous anguish and places them in a difficult situation, the future agreement should be established within the framework of the Association Agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Portas (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, firstly let us address the situation in hand. On 30 November, Portuguese boats that currently fish in Morocco will stop doing so. As a result, many boat owners will obviously ask for vessels to be decommissioned, thereby adding even further to the graveyard for boats that the common fisheries policy has become. And many fishermen will fall straight into unemployment, thereby adding even further to the poverty trap that the common fisheries policy has become. Another two Portuguese ports will be badly affected if this agreement is not renewed: we cannot fish nor can we work, which is a denial of basic human rights and of citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us now address the situation from the political angle. This situation reflects the incompetence of the Commission and of the Council. The agreement expires on 30 November and the mandate for negotiation does not extend beyond October this year. I have never seen such negligence, such delays, such inertia and such total lack of consideration for fishing countries and for the fishermen of Southern countries. Do not deny it, Commissioner, because it is true. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this is a case of negligence on the part of the European Union. We have known of Morocco’s intention not to renew the agreement since the day the last agreement was signed. Years have passed and neither Commissioner Bonino, nor Commissioner Fischler, nor the respective ministers have had the necessary diligence or agility to avoid the need to debate now, a month before a very damaging event takes place, what we can do about it.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the situation shows the foolishness of a certain vision of the European Union’s Economic Policy. We gave Morocco a trade agreement with no time limit. We obtained a fisheries agreement with a time limit. This means that Morocco can place its products in European Union territory at will, but we can only fish in Moroccan water until 30 November 1999. We are conceding much more than we are getting in return, and this is what you get for choosing an unchecked and unfettered globalisation in which you systematically prefer uncontrolled liberalism on a global scale, to the defence of national interests. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this case shows how mistaken it is to allow federalism into common policies. Morocco’s problem is essentially with Spain. As everyone knows, the Spanish fleet is much bigger, the Spanish fish in competition with the Moroccans; the Portuguese fleet is smaller which means that our fishing does not compete with that of the Moroccans. What is Portugal's situation at the moment? Europe is not able to negotiate with Morocco because Morocco does not want to, and Portugal cannot negotiate with Morocco because Europe will not allow it to! We cannot even guarantee our right to fish, we, who are a maritime nation, nor can we guarantee our right to handle our own affairs, we who are a neighbouring country of Morocco. We entered Europe in order to be part of a solution. In terms of fishing as well as agriculture, this Europe is isolating us as if we were part of the problem!</p>
<p class="contents">The only solution is to allow, within the framework of the common fisheries policy, each country to reach bilateral agreements with third countries which do not have agreements with the European Union. And this is what I am asking for in the name of the principle of subsidiarity, with a view to a revision of the common fisheries policy: a member country of the common fisheries policy must be able to make bilateral agreements with third countries as long as an agreement is not already in place between the European Union and those third countries. </p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Fischler, I have been here for three months and I have already seen you harm Portugal’s interests three times: over mad cows where your decision defies belief, over pig-breeding, where your desire to persecute us is unacceptable, and now over fishing where your Commission’s inaction is also unforgivable. I would just like to say one thing to you: I am beginning to be convinced that you think that Portugal is just a beach. If you have the misfortune to go to that beach one day, you will see that the Portuguese fishermen will tell you politely that you are a <span class="italic">persona non grata</span> in my country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will not have much to add.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I would like to congratulate Mr Fischler on his taking up of this fishing portfolio at a very bad time. We have worked with him for the last five years, and I have confidence that he will move these issues forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not in favour of nationalist speeches. We should not use this debate to look after our own national political interests. It is a Community debate. Fishing policy is a Community policy. The Commission, the Council and the different institutions are obliged to defend this common fishing policy, which of course includes agreements with non-EU countries. I come from one of the three Spanish regions which are most directly affected by the fisheries agreement. I am referring to the Canary Islands. And I can tell you that we have always fished in these waters– my great-grandfathers fished in these waters – and it seems incredible to the population of these regions that this agreement could disappear.</p>
<p class="contents">But I believe that it would be a mistake at the moment for us to tell the Commission what the conditions for the negotiations should be. Parliament, this very morning, fulfilled its obligation to include in the 2000 budget an item of EUR 125 million, which had not been envisaged in the Financial Perspective negotiated in Berlin, in accordance with the interinstitutional agreement between the Council and Parliament, but which is fundamental to the starting of the negotiations. I believe that Parliament has fulfilled its duty and has offered the Commission the means to carry out the negotiations, and we hope that the Commission will carry this task forward.</p>
<p class="contents">But I also believe it would be a mistake, as some have done here, to impose any kind of conditions on the negotiations. I do not believe that we should tell the Commission what it should or should not do. I believe that, finally, this agreement is important and that must be concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another important dimension: Morocco is a nearby country. This European Community was not built to attack anybody nor to threaten anybody. This European Community has to be concerned not only for its own future but also for the future of the neighbouring countries. At the moment, we are dealing with the future of the neighbouring countries of Central and Eastern Europe by means of incorporating them into the European Union, but we also have to concern ourselves with the future of the neighbouring countries on the southern side of the Mediterranean. It is not a matter of trading one thing for another. I do not believe that the solution to the Moroccan problem consists of admitting Moroccan immigrants, but the reality is that every week twenty or thirty Moroccans arrive on my island in small boats – the so-called <span class="italic">pateras</span> – at great risk, and many of them drown. We have a critical situation within a few minutes of our own shores, within an extremely short distance. I believe that in the negotiation, the Commission, on behalf of the European Union, which is rich, is probably able to offer sufficient compensation to Morocco so that the fisheries agreement may become a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be tragic if there was a re-occurrence of what happened last time, when there was a delay of seven months. I hope that as a result of the ability of the Commissioner and the attitudes of the Commission, the Council and our Governments, a favourable agreement can be reached which will allow us to continue fishing, on the one hand, and, on the other, allow Morocco and the Moroccan people to profit from the privilege of administering waters which contain such an abundance of fish. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fisheries agreement with Morocco has also been on the agenda this morning in this context, when we talked about external action expenditure. The majority of this Parliament was then of the opinion that this agreement would feature as one of its new priorities and that it belonged on the list comprising the reconstruction of Kosovo, East Timor and Turkey. </p>
<p class="contents">Whatever the opinion may be concerning the fisheries agreement with regard to the impact on the local population or the European fishing fleet, there will be very few people who will be prepared to put the humanitarian disasters of Kosovo, East Timor and the earthquake in Turkey on a par with this fishing deal. </p>
<p class="contents">Also, from a budgetary point of view, I find it completely irresponsible to agree on an amount whilst negotiations have not even reached the halfway stage. In fact, we do not know if an agreement will be reached. We do not know what the situation will be like then and we cannot gauge the financial implications. But the funds are already available. I would have thought it was acceptable to place an amount in reserve. Then, at least Parliament would be able to vote again on the allocation of these funds after having read the content of this agreement more carefully. </p>
<p class="contents">Because how will this pan out? Is the integrity of Parliament’s decision not seriously prejudiced if we have the funds available at this stage? What happens now if you do not like the agreement? Or would any agreement be acceptable a priori? You will get another chance during the second reading of the budget in December. It is therefore important that you grant more importance to the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries and not to consider it as a little added extra to a fait accompli. </p>
<p class="contents">What input will Parliament have? There is no guarantee whatsoever that the agreement will be submitted to the European Parliament for approval. The agreement with Mauritius was subject to a simple, consultative procedure. Parliament objected to this and took the matter to the Court. The Court ruled that it was unnecessary for Parliament to approve agreements. As a result, we now have a situation where it is completely unclear what agreements have to be submitted to Parliament for approval and what agreements only require comments. In this light, the agreement with Morocco might well bypass the European Parliament in terms of content on account of the consultative procedure and in financial terms on account of the blank cheque we provided this morning. Parliament’s power should not only be fought for by government leaders at intergovernmental conferences but must also be asserted by ourselves in our daily work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are opposed to the reduction of appropriations for aid to developing countries. Europe is directly affected by the desperate situation in Africa. Firstly, as a former colonial power, but also for having continued to plunder the wealth of these countries even after they became independent. The very nature of this aid must be completely reviewed since, until now, it has served only to maintain neo-colonial relationships favourable to the establishment and the multinationals. Elf provides a particularly striking example of one of these. As for the population, they remain entrenched in endless poverty. Instead of setting the interests of workers in the fishing industry, the interests of European countries and those of African countries against each other, a way must be found to unite their demands and their campaign against powerful capitalist interests.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Morocco and this particular fisheries agreement, it is no longer possible to once again ignore the rights of the Western Saharan people, starting with their right to self-determination, their right to establish an independent state, if they so wish, and to protect the natural wealth of their territory, whether it be phosphate deposits or the specific resources of its shoreline which are threatened by this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, finally, like to draw your attention to the particularly tense social situation in the Moroccan fisheries sector. A strike movement has been affecting most of the ports in the country for several weeks and is being violently repressed by the forces of law and order. Once again, as in September 1998, it is a campaign to gain the freedom to exercise elementary social rights, paid leave, social security, retirement at 55 and a guaranteed minimum income. But the fishermen of Morocco are also demanding justice following the murder of the founder of their union, Mr Mounacir, by the henchmen of Basri, and I would like to express our solidarity with them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first is that thousands of Andalusian and Spanish families are looking to us. They hope to see evidence that, for the European Commission and especially the Council, the priority and the most urgent matter at the moment is to come to a sound agreement with Morocco. It is difficult, Commissioner, as you have just said, but it is not impossible. Employment is a priority objective of the European Union and it is not enough just to create it. We also have to prevent its destruction. Andalusia, my region, has the highest rate of unemployment in the Union and almost 50% of the boats which fish in Moroccan waters are Andalusian.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is that Morocco is a priority country within the framework of Euro-Mediterranean relations. Morocco and the European Union have a mutual interest and need, and intransigent positions and insults are the enemies of cooperation and understanding. Parliament can and must help with this understanding insofar as we are the legitimate representatives of the citizens of Europe, who at the moment are naturally expectant and concerned with regard to the results of the future negotiations. Neither is it good for the negotiation climate that, through an absurd desire for the limelight, spectacles should be made such as the one this morning with the resolution which various political groups have presented. It does no favours for the workers in the fishing industry and their families if certain politicians are after a photo and a headline in a newspaper or, as they say in my region, want to confuse wheat with chaff. I believe that there is no place in this debate for the Sahara question.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, the Council and Parliament must act together, in a coordinated and transparent fashion. Nothing would offer as much advantage to the other side as a lack of unity amongst ourselves and contradictory debates on a matter which is so vital to our interests and also for Morocco itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is why we are somewhat perplexed that the Commission has still not explained its plan to us for dealing with this situation. By making the substantive part of the FIFG regulation an implementing regulation, the Commission will cause fisheries to be the only area in the agricultural and structural domain not to be decided on in the first six months of this year. It is also worth pointing out that even if the Commission’s proposal for an implementing regulation had been adopted, it would not have helped us in the slightest. In article 17(3), concerning financial compensation in case of a temporary stoppage in activity, it excludes fishermen from any compensation and imposes ridiculous limits on boat-owners. </p>
<p class="contents">I do not know if you have noticed, Commissioner, that one of the annual financial ceilings that you are proposing in order to deal with situations of this kind in Member States is lower than your own salary as a European Commissioner. We know that when you assumed your new responsibilities for fisheries, you made a show of highlighting your distance from the sea. Nevertheless, you should not forget that you are a Commissioner for Europe and that here, both on the coast of continental Europe and on archipelagos such as the Azores and Madeira, there are many people who make their living from the sea, and as a matter of fact, these people tend to be some of the most deprived and the least supported. </p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to say that I agree wholeheartedly with two things said here by my friend and colleague Manuel Medina Ortega. We, the Portuguese Socialists, are radically opposed to any kind of nationalistic rhetoric or rhetoric about re-nationalisation. More than this, we are also extremely concerned, as my friend António José Seguro has also said here, about the support to Morocco, and not merely in terms of its commercial aspects, as has been suggested by certain speakers. But for this, Commissioner, you will need a radically different attitude to the one you have had in the past, particularly towards my country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Bavaria lies in the neighbourhood of Bohemia, so perhaps Bavaria has a coastline too, and I may say that this has become true in the present-day EU, since today in the EU Morocco is in the neighbourhood of Bavaria and Spain shares a border with Poland. All European problems are the problems of all EU states, and I therefore wish to say that this fisheries agreement is a problem for Europe as a whole. It concerns the European Union as a whole. It is not a local phenomenon. Of course we must safeguard the interests of the fishermen concerned, but we must recognise that there are general ecological problems in connection with this fisheries agreement and general problems relating to both foreign and security policy, affecting the whole of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our task to support stability in Morocco, and I am therefore dismayed at the notes which Mr Jové Peres has introduced into this debate, in both his proposed amendments and his contribution today. We must be glad that the remarks appropriate to the class struggle which he has expressed today have not previously led to the establishment of a socialist system in Morocco, like the ones in Libya and Algeria, with whose consequences we are having to fight a running battle today. Instead, democracy is slowly maturing there under the new King, and we must try to support this tender shoot of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Spain has just achieved something exemplary for Europe, thanks to its intelligent policy of compensation for Morocco, in which Mr Medina Ortega, for example, also had a part. I found his speech to be a very fine one and very important, and I would like to say quite clearly that it must be in our interests to safeguard the fishing interests of the Spanish and the other European fishermen affected, but to ensure that a sensible agreement is obtained in the near future, which includes the interests of ecological, foreign and security policies and which does not make the mistake of working with a demagogy which destabilises our neighbourhood, so that we do not wake up until it is too late, as in the Balkans or in the Caucasus today.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Langenhagen (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, thank you for your various efforts to track me down, and for the opportunity to be able to speak now! Commissioner, because of the development of international maritime law in the 1970s, traditional fishing grounds were lost to European fleets. Approximately 35% of world seas and 90% of fishing stocks are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of coastal states. The European Community was therefore forced to conclude international agreements in order to retain access to fishing grounds and thus ensure the livelihood of the Community’s fishermen. More than two dozen fisheries agreements with third countries are currently in force, ranging from a straight exchange of fishing rights to agreements for access to stocks in return for financial compensation payments.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like at this point to stress the vital significance of the fisheries agreements for the EU. They finally constitute and facilitate a guarantee of job security in the EU. Approximately 40,000 workers are employed in this sector, and thus the existence of an international agreement, such as the agreement with Morocco, also plays an essential role with regard to the supplying of consumers and the fish processing industries, and thus to sustainable prices. We can see what a fundamental matter of concern the fisheries agreements represent for the EU. The negotiations must therefore be driven forward until further agreements or renewed agreements are signed.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are discussing the renewal of the agreement with Morocco. This agreement – I still clearly remember the long drawn-out negotiations four years ago, which were the subject of many parliamentary resolutions – has exceptionally important social and economic consequences, especially, of course, as we have just heard, for the less favoured regions of Spain and Portugal. Around 8,000 fishermen and 20,000 jobs in the processing industry are directly affected by this agreement. The previously applicable compensation payments of over EUR 400 million to Morocco over the course of four years make the agreement the most significant fisheries agreement in the Community Budget. Due to these considerable financial repercussions on the EU-budget, as we have just heard, the assent procedure comes into play. This is a challenge to Parliament. The effects of non-renewal would be catastrophic. There would then be the threat that thousands of jobs would be lost, with widespread effects not only on the entire Iberian Peninsula but also on the status of Europe in this important sector of industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately matters are not so simple. Morocco is reluctant to start negotiations or to come to terms too quickly. It is playing for time. Nonetheless, the Community should not have the objective of striving to come to an agreement on any terms due to pressure of time. On several occasions in the past, Morocco has unilaterally presented obstacles which were not covered by the agreement. The situation where the costs of the agreement are continually increased while the fishing areas and seasons are continually reduced is unacceptable. The European Parliament, and the Committee on Fisheries in particular, are generally very concerned about the renewal of this particular agreement. Why did the Council take so long to give the Commission its mandate for negotiation? Where, Mr Fischler, are the Commission’s long-announced cost-benefit analyses?</p>
<p class="contents">The economic and social consequences in the event of expiry of the agreement for Community fishermen are sufficiently known. Why then this hesitation, which in the end is playing into Morocco’s hands, cutting the ground out from under the feet of EU fishermen? Clarification is essential here, and in short order. In the interests of EU fishermen, Parliament must make a clear statement (and that is what it is indeed doing, as we are just learning now) to put an end to this intolerable situation as quickly as possible. If not, I fear a negative effect on international agreements per se. This means, as Mr Posselt said, ultimately a negative effect on Europe’s foreign policy too. I therefore consider it necessary as a matter of urgency, today and tomorrow, to give a signal and invite the Commission to actually initiate measures up now for the financial aid of those affected. Moreover, I expressly ask that Parliament, represented by us, the Members of this House, should now actually participate directly in the negotiations on the agreement. There can be no further doubt about our involvement.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, many thanks for your contributions. I believe this really is the way to make constructive progress in this certainly very difficult situation we find ourselves in with reference to the future agreement with Morocco. Unfortunately Mr Portas is no longer here, as he expressed a rather different opinion. Apparently there are always people who think that discussion and debate involve insulting the Commissioner and then disappearing!</p>
<p class="contents">You can be certain of one thing: even though I did not in opening mention all the elements relating to the significance of this agreement, particularly for the Spanish and also the Portuguese fisheries industry, I am nonetheless perfectly aware of its significance. But I think we all know how important this matter is, and you can also be sure that I shall be lending my wholehearted support towards arriving at a solution to this matter. I am even willing, Mr Nogueira, to wade in myself, if necessary. This is not the essence of the problem. I would like to stress, in particular, that it is essential to look upon 15 October and the formulation of the mandate for negotiation in the right light. This is undoubtedly not a case of delay. We started to approach the Moroccan authorities as early as February with direct contacts, a great number of letters, and a great many visits. As early as February, we initiated preparatory talks in order to ascertain what exactly Moroccan future interests would entail. For this would have considerably facilitated the task of drawing up a customised mandate in order to be able to have very precisely orientated negotiations. You all know that these efforts were to no avail because, quite simply, our Moroccan counterparts were not yet ready to exchange even a word with us or even meet us to discuss the matter. Our prime concern at the moment, therefore, is how to manage to start meaningful negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Our positions in the debate have become very clear. When I am told that we must make no concessions, then you have to consider what our respective starting positions are. As far as our starting points are concerned, ours is, as virtually everyone here emphasised, that this agreement is of exceptional importance. Morocco’s current starting position is that they do not want this type of agreement any more! At any rate, emphasising that we will not tolerate any concessions in the negotiations will not, I believe, succeed in making the Moroccan side more open towards us, as it were, and more prepared to come to an agreement with us.</p>
<p class="contents">So now, as has been said, it is really important to get things underway. There is another thing you can be quite sure of. It is also very important to me that these negotiations are handled in the most transparent way possible, and, obviously, I am willing to report back to Parliament at every stage on the further progress of negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been stressed how dangerous it would be if this agreement which is, incidentally, not part of the Association Agreement, as many people thought, were to be extended to include associations relating to agricultural goods.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be very, very cautious here, and we should try as far as possible to reach an agreement purely concerned with fisheries. When, at some stage in the future, we know precisely what the Moroccan demands are, we can certainly come back again to a further debate on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also been asked whether there is any guarantee that the use of this agreement will guarantee sustainability for the future, and to what extent the satellite monitoring system actually serves to monitor fishing activities. Well, again, to be frank, all the prerequisites have been met on our side. All European vessels operating in this area can be monitored by satellite. There is though still a problem on the Moroccan side. We have proposed to the Moroccans that we are willing, within the framework of the MEDA Programme, to contribute towards resolving these problems on the Moroccan side, but, as has been said, definitive implementation on the Moroccan side is still outstanding.</p>
<p class="contents">On the matter of aid following 30 November: I have already pointed out, too, that we wish to proceed on the basis of potential support in principle, as we already did last time. Therefore, fishermen can count on our providing aid. But we must also obtain the necessary administrative prerequisites in good time. Here too, no time is to be lost. Here too, there is some urgency, I believe, and I would like to ask for the support of Parliament in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The last question, why at this stage have we applied for EUR 125 million in the Budget? I am very grateful to see that this was accepted this morning. It is a matter which I think can be seen from two points of view. I do not think that anyone could realistically expect any future agreement to be obtained substantially more cheaply, or at a substantially lower price, than the previous agreement. Therefore if we envisage an amount in the budget which is exactly equal to the previous annual amount we were prepared to allocate, then that is a clear sign that we are not going to let ourselves be persuaded to part with increasingly high amounts, but that we are setting a limit at this point for the amount of money we are prepared to assign to this agreement. I believe this is a good sign to send to Morocco, one which will certainly be of support to us in negotiating.</p>
<p class="contents">A final point, something which certainly does not help us progress in this difficult matter is our tendency to continually pass the buck to one another, from Parliament to the Council, or Council to the Commission, or vice versa. We can only be successful in this matter if all three institutions work together. This is what I would request, and I find it a pity that the Council is not represented here today to be able to give this guarantee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a source of pride for all of us and we Portuguese Christian Democrats are extremely happy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to remind Members of this House that what has happened in East Timor after the referendum is something we should look at. We have just discussed Morocco, and the Western Sahara was mentioned. A referendum will be taking place there. The European Union needs to be extremely diligent to ensure the same fate does not befall the people who go out and vote. We need to see that a fair and democratic procedure takes place in Western Sahara, that people have the right to vote freely. We hope that what happened in East Timor, after the UN persuaded the people to go out and exercise their right to vote and they were subsequently persecuted and murdered by the Indonesians, will not happen when the people in Western Sahara vote. The European Union needs to address this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We are delighted that Mr Gusmão has received this award. He deserves it and the people of East Timor deserve it. They deserve their independence, their freedom and the right to live in peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
