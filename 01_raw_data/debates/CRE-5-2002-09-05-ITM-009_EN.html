The foundation of the African Union as an off-shoot of the OAU and as a role model to the European Union is a promise of the future for this continent and a homage to the institutions that make up our own. As well as providing a model of political structure and a single project for the continent, the European Union must also protect the rights recognised by the international conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">The tragedy of another age, however, currently being suffered by Amina Lawal, is threatening all these promises and signatures ratified by her country, Nigeria. The extreme distress experienced by Mrs Lawal and Mrs Husseini before her and so many other ignored voices, is evidence of the ludicrous gap between commitments and political and legal practices in certain countries of Africa. It is difficult to understand that, in this day and age, a sentence of death by stoning could be passed down. It is difficult to accept such a barbaric act could be carried out for the mere fact of having had a baby after a divorce. Above all, it is difficult to accept regional laws, in a federal state which denies and flouts a national constitution. Admittedly, it is the primary responsibility of the federal authorities of Nigeria to establish conformity and respect of its national laws and international commitments throughout its territory and the jurisdiction of its state. However, it is also the moral and political duty of the Union, many of whose Member States share a common history with the African continent, to oppose criminal abuses, such as certain interpretations of the Sharia law and to support, using every effort and every means at our disposal, those who are fighting for the rule of law, for rights and for real justice for all. If we are satisfied with a token statement each time a Kafkaesque crime befalls a citizen of the ACP countries, we are essentially becoming accomplices and are upholding, due to our diplomatic inertia, the return to obscurantist ways.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why my group and I are calling for a working group to be set up on the question of Sharia law and women’s rights as part of our forthcoming ACP-EU delegation. The stability of Nigeria is under threat and the stability of the whole country could be affected by what is happening in Nigeria, the most densely populated country in Africa. The shockwaves created by Amina Lawal’s case have just reached Europe; let us take action to prevent further shockwaves in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wonder, how can women – not men of course – be condemned to death by stoning for adultery in a country which has ratified the UN treaty on eliminating all forms of discrimination against women, in a country which has ratified the treaty against torture and the international covenant on civil and political rights, in a country with which the European Union has close ties under the Cotonou agreement?</p>
<p class="contents">How come the federal government of Nigeria is unable to make the Islamic fundamentalists respect the very constitution of the country? What is the point of having a president if he is unable to guarantee the fundamental freedoms and human rights of his citizens? I find it impossible to believe, Commissioner Patten, that intolerance, obscurantism and misogyny can triumph over reason and human values. I cannot accept that the Union does not have ways and means of preventing these criminal practices against women and that, in this specific case, we are unable to force the federal government of Nigeria to apply the law throughout its territory.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to send out a very strong message from this House today both to Nigeria and to any other country in which crimes are being committed against women because, as we know from the press, sentences of death by stoning are also passed in Iran. We need to tell fundamentalists the world over that no tradition or culture can sanction the violation of the rights of half of mankind, which is why we are calling here and now for Amina Lawal to be released. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I looked into these facts and the first thing that strikes us about this case is the cruel and unusual punishment that is involved. Above all, we have to look at the unfairness of the decision that was taken in imposing a punishment on the female partner in the name of some kind of religious belief. This is not religious justice; this is a purely political policy by which men in many parts of the world, in the past and still today, maintain their control and domination over the weaker sex.</p>
<p class="contents">The second hurtful aspect of this case is the absolute and wanton cruelty involved. It violates every instinct in mankind that prompts us to work for a world that can be shared in peace and enjoyment by us all.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, this case reminds us of the barbarous days when witches were burned, as somebody pointed out earlier, and when human beings were sacrificed to satisfy an unseen, unknown and uncaring deity. There are many people in this world who recognise many different visions and manifestations of their god or gods. There are many people who recognise no god whatsoever. This does not prevent us from sharing and enjoying the same world together. But if some people believe that on behalf of their god, they can take it upon themselves to punish and persecute their fellow men because they follow a different religion or do not have any religious beliefs, then mankind cannot co-exist in peace in this world.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we in this Parliament must make it clear that only democratic institutions have the right to make laws and impose humane punishment on other human beings and that the code of the United Nations will be upheld by the European Union at all costs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Her crime is to have given birth to a child after her divorce. Some months ago, Safiya Husseini, sentenced to the same fate, was spared following an international outcry. But how many people have been sentenced to the same barbaric fate before this victory and how many will be sentenced in the future?</p>
<p class="contents">It is high time that these highly antiquated legal decisions, which show complete contempt for human dignity, are prevented from being passed in Nigeria and elsewhere. This strict application of Sharia law, which has nothing to do with respect of the Muslim religion, was declared unconstitutional by the Nigerian Minister for Justice, including in the federal Muslim states of the north. In its constitution, the Federation of Nigeria describes itself as a secular State. Nigeria is also signatory to conventions which spell out its commitments at international level. Although the Katsina state is involved, there are other responsibilities: those of the federal Nigerian authorities which have a duty to ensure strict respect of the constitution and the protection of human rights for all Nigerian citizens, regardless of status, religion or sex.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community, and Europe in particular, must condemn this unacceptable breach of fundamental human rights. Europe is opposed to the death penalty. It has committed itself to protect women’s rights against sexual discrimination and against religious intolerance. Doing everything in our power to save Amina Lawal from death by stoning is also one of Europe’s duties. Human rights organisations are bravely fighting in Nigeria. These organisations are often under threat, but they are working together despite the lack of resources and the lack of support, other than support from European organisations. We must support their demands.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as part of the Cotonou partnership agreements, Europe can and must urge Nigeria to respect its international commitments and to promote democracy and women’s rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now we are faced with the drama of Mrs Lawal. More and more states within Nigeria are introducing Sharia law. The political climate is often so influenced by Islam that politicians only have a chance in elections if they support this legislation. Barbaric ancient desert practices such as stoning women or hacking off limbs are naturally at odds with the most fundamental human rights. The much-discussed clash of civilisations, cultures or faiths can only be prevented if the strict Sharia law is abolished everywhere. Nigeria is a very fragile and unstable democracy. The European Union supports the democratisation process there, and with good reason. However, it can only continue to do so if the federal government does everything in its constitutional power to stop barbaric punishments from being administered.

<p class="contents">It also leads us to remind not only the Federal State of Nigeria, but also Niger, Sudan and Somalia, that the current interpretation and application of the <span class="italic">sharia</span> is not only a clear violation of fundamental rights, but that it evidently contravenes the international commitments to human rights which they have signed up to, including the Cotonou agreements, article one of which clearly states that the rights of the individual will be respected and that the situation of women and issues of sex equality will systematically be taken into account in all areas, political, economic and social.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, as well as our absolute rejection of the death sentences which have been handed down, and as well as asking for mercy for Amina Lawal, Ahmadu Ibrahin and Fatima Usman, we must and want to demand that the governments of these countries bring their legislation into line with the international standards and commitments in the field of human rights, in order to prevent an application of the <span class="italic">sharia</span> which violates human rights. Furthermore, as the European Union we must be prepared to use the mechanisms available to us under the Cotonou agreements in the event of the violation of the principles they stand for. Only in this way, Mr President, will we contribute to progress on freedom and respect for human rights in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">'Why Amina and not me?', the whole world asks in the face of this Islamic hypocrisy.

The harm it would do to the life of Amina is irreversible.

<p class="contents">These are horrors which every civilised person, government and judicial system condemns. Some acts of savagery are doubly chilling because they are authorised by people supposedly appointed to administer justice. It is not just in Nigeria, but today we are focusing on Nigeria. The practices carried out there in the name of Sharia law are beyond the pale of any society that calls itself civilised and humane. Stoning for adultery is barbaric; flogging for sex before marriage or alcohol consumption and amputation for theft may be considered excessive. To give judicial approval to a stoning to death by a legal mob cannot be acceptable to the vast majority of Nigerians who are decent and responsible, including their president, and it certainly cannot be acceptable to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier this year, we saw international pressure helping to put a stop to plans to stone Safiya Husseini to death. Now Amina Lawal faces the same threat of death by torture. Safiya was married at 12 years old and Amina at 14 years old. They lost their childhood and Amina may now lose her life. The young couple Ahmadu Ibrahim and Fatima Usman face the same prospect, as does an older man accused of rape. This punishment is incompatible with the conventions and covenants signed by Nigeria.</p>
<p class="contents">Tens of thousands of people have written from 110 countries to appeal for clemency in the Amina case. I believe the federal government understands that and indeed the minister of justice has also condemned the verdict. The key is the governor of Katsina state and it is important that the presidency and the Commission and the President of our Parliament add their pleas to those many of us have already sent to Umaru Musa Yar'Adua. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Despite international pressure, the Nigerian Government is not willing to meet its obligations under international law and is allowing 10 Nigerian federal states to apply local and religiously motivated criminal law contrary to national constitutional law and international human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, we need to be aware that Nigeria is by no means a unique case. According to information from Amnesty International, in Iran, for example, in 2001 and 2002 at least six women were sentenced to death by stoning for crimes such as ‘adultery and earthly depravity’, in some cases after a long prison sentence, and these sentences were carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">In Iran alone a total of 35 people, both men and women, have already been executed this year in various ways. It is therefore high time that the European Union took a stand against this barbaric practice not just in individual cases, but as a matter of principle. It should also be possible to endeavour to impose sanctions on regimes where practices of this kind take place.</p>

I am not surprised that it has caused so much outrage, as well as shock, in Parliament. Throughout, the Commission has been deeply concerned by the possible application of harsh penalties in Nigeria.</p>
<p class="contents">This time we, like Members, are particularly concerned about the case of Amina Lawal, who has been condemned to death by stoning, which, as Mr Bowis said, is in effect a state-sanctioned and organised brutality, although she is at present awaiting appeal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is as strongly opposed as every Member who has spoken to the use of cruel and discriminatory punishments. We have consistently expressed concern over Sharia punishments in Nigeria and – I shall return to this point – we have expressed our concern about Sharia punishments elsewhere as well. This concern has been expressed, among other places, at the Commission on Human Rights. Quite simply, we expect all communities to accept international norms concerning human rights, gender equality and respect for human life.</p>
<p class="contents">We are resolutely opposed to the use of the death penalty and fully subscribe to the European Union guidelines against the death penalty adopted in 1998. We have had the opportunity on more than one occasion to discuss those guidelines in this Parliament. A Troika démarche was carried out to restate this position only last year in Nigeria.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to provide support for human rights and democracy initiatives, through its cooperation programme with Nigeria and through other instruments such as the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, which has so many eloquent champions in this Parliament. This initiative includes Nigeria as a focus country, and will support interventions in the field of good governance and legal reform with the aim of achieving a positive impact on the status of women and awareness of their legal rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union is, of course, in constant political dialogue with the Nigerian Government, as a number of Members have pointed out, for example, Mrs Karamanou. This could be intensified as foreseen under the Cotonou Agreement, depending on how the situation evolves.</p>
<p class="contents">I was interested by the proposal, which was also mentioned by one of the authors of this resolution, to establish a working group on Sharia and human rights and women's rights under the Cotonou Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">As Parliament may know, we financed a study – the Peters report – on the problems of applying the Sharia Law in Nigeria. I am sure Parliament will not be surprised at the main conclusions. The report believed that some legal texts were poorly drafted and contradictory, that application of the texts was inconsistent, that the judges concerned were incompetent and poorly trained and that there were contradictions not just with international laws but also federal laws.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure Parliament that we will continue to raise this deeply troubling issue. As I have had occasion to say to foreign ministers from a number of countries, it is very difficult for us in Europe to accept that female lapidation is consistent with internationally acceptable norms of behaviour and of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Izquierdo Rojo raised the question of female lapidation in Iran. I can assure her that I have raised that issue with Iranian ministers. I have raised it in Tehran, as well as at meetings outside Tehran. I very much hope that in the course of the next months we will be able to begin a comprehensive human rights dialogue with Iran, alongside the discussions we will be having with it on political issues and on trade and cooperation, so that we can continue to raise the issue with it, as we raise it with every other country where it is relevant. Parliament is concerned about this; we are concerned about it; European public opinion is deeply troubled by it.</p>
