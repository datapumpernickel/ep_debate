<p class="contents">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think this resolution is important because it refers to a positive decision by the Macedonian government, and unfortunately not by all the political forces of Macedonia, on the law on higher education which will at last allow young people from minorities, in particular the Albanian minority, to study in their mother tongue. I think we should congratulate Mr Georgievsky, the Prime Minister, and Mr Xhaferi, leader of the Albanian party in the government majority, who are behind this law on higher education. Unfortunately, it was not supported by the parliamentary opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable that, at the request of the Socialist Group in particular, the text of the resolution does not mention their names, and I would like to point out to our Socialist friends that their request, made in the name of a more general principle that political forces should not be cited, strikes me as rather unreliable given that, looking at the motion for a resolution on the Middle East we are going to vote on today, we are frankly dealing with very specific situations and very specific players. So, once again, we have double standards and I think that is deplorable.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Commission to monitor this issue very closely. It will take a great deal of money to establish the university. This is a practical way of supporting a project which could help overcome the problems of two large, differing populations living side by side, and this is an area where monitoring by the Commission is crucial. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pack (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, I would like to take up what Mr Dupuis had to say. I believe that when the audience in the stands sees ARYM up there, they will actually think this refers to a different country. ARYM means <span class="italic">Ancienne République Yougoslave de Macédoine, </span>i.e the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Quite simply, that means ‘Macedonia’. The dispute about the name is a dispute between Greece and the country of Macedonia. Of course we all hope – and that includes the Greek MEPs here – that this dispute will soon be settled.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen how the difficult situation in Macedonia has steadily worsened where the treatment of the Albanians is concerned. All of those who, for a long time now, have been going in and out of this country, have kept up the pressure for this problem to be resolved. However, I would also stress that this problem is nothing new: it is the legacy of the Yugoslav period, when the Albanians were always discriminated against, including those in Macedonia. Unfortunately, it was, of course, the case that the problem was not resolved under the last government, in the run-up to 1998. Therefore, we are all delighted that a genuinely sound solution is perhaps at last to be found to this problem of higher education.</p>
<p class="contents">The illegal foundation of Tetovo university many years ago produced great tension in Macedonia, which I am sorry to say, could not be defused over the past few years. We owe a duty of care to the students to ensure that this problem is resolved. After all, these students had, or have, diplomas that serve no purpose in the outside world. Therefore, I believe we owe it to the young people to find a solution to the problem, and have now paved the way to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">As a delegation, we have always insisted that a solution should be found to this problem. Now at last we have found it. Not us, but the government under Prime Minister Georgievski, and also the Albanian leader, Xhaferi, and above all, the representative of the Council of Europe, Max van der Stoel. This outstanding cooperation has led to a draft bill, which was adopted by the majority in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In common with Olivier Dupuis, I bitterly regret the fact that the opposition parties – which formed part of the government up until 1998 and could have resolved the problem – have closed their minds to this draft bill without offering a better solution themselves. I am particularly at a loss to understand the behaviour of the Albanian opposition party, which has deliberately closed its mind to the necessary solution to the Albanian problem in Macedonia. The fact that the Socialist opposition refused to support this must have been against their better judgement, but that sometimes happens with the opposition, and not just in Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now awaiting the necessary aid for the transformation of Tetovo university into a private university whose diplomas will then be recognised. All those who want to see an improvement in the inter-ethnic relations in Macedonia, in the interests of stabilisation, must now do their bit to help solve this problem and ensure that a private university actually becomes a reality. That is what this urgent procedure is all about today. People from different ethnic backgrounds must be able to live together in Macedonia. This could provide a good role model for the neighbouring countries and help to stabilise the entire region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is a breakthrough on an issue which has caused a great deal of problems for a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">At long last, the Albanians now have the opportunity to attend university courses in their own language and within the official education system of Macedonia. That is a real step forward for Macedonia. As far as I am concerned, it proves to all neighbouring countries that education does not only have to spread hatred, as is often the case these days, but that it can also serve as a cradle for a peaceful, multi-ethnic society. That is a development which, in my view, deserves unqualified support from the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to spend a moment on something which, normally speaking, I do not think belongs in a European Parliament, namely the role of a fellow countryman. I am proud of the fact, that this time round, the role of Mr Max van der Stoel, the High Representative for minorities of the OSCE, has proved crucial in this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe it is extremely important for the outside world to send positive vibes to Macedonia. That does not mean to say that the Macedonian people are not sufficiently alert themselves to be able to deliver something in this area. The former President, Mr Gligorov, was already a shining example of non-ethnic thinking, and the new President, too, has gained the trust of all groups of the population in Macedonia. In my view, it is an extraordinary achievement on the part of the Macedonians to be able to settle the issue within their own borders.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears to me that cooperation between Slavonic Macedonians and especially Albanian-speaking Macedonians is an extremely important topic which could manifest itself in the fight over the important initiative to establish a university in Tetovo. This initiative has been on the cards for years and still there is no talk of official recognition.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, this initiative is now being backed by a parliamentary majority, as a result of which a key problem in the inter-ethnic relations has been solved, not only because it is so important to teach in Albanian at the universities, but especially because it considerably enhances the social position of the Albanian-speaking Macedonians. It attracts a new class of students to higher education. It is also significant in terms of the presence of Albanian speakers in the official apparatus, a presence which is currently lagging far behind what should actually be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears to me that the recognition of degrees from Tetovo university is a major step forward. In time, the university should also be funded by taxpayers’ money only. After all, the Albanian speakers pay taxes and are just as entitled to a share when it comes to paying for education.</p>
<p class="contents">I, myself, was educated at a university which was a ‘Free University’, free from church and state influence, yet government-funded. I have to say that I still believe this to be a great bonus and it also proves that the state respects the country’s own particular educational sphere.</p>
<p class="contents">The outside world should do all it can to help the Albanian speakers integrate in their country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would have preferred it if we could have found a solution that all the parties in Parliament could have voted for. We would rather leave it to the Macedonians to discuss where the process broke down, Mrs Pack. I have it on good authority that they were only trivial issues, and that the government could have accommodated the opposition in this respect. I do not know. I do not think that is the be-all and end-all. What matters most is that a solution is found which we can all subscribe to.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though this notion is unpopular in this House – indeed the prevailing mood is the smaller the unit, the more divided the systems, and the more separatist the movements, the better – I would like to make the point here, which is one we have also discussed at some length in the delegation with our counterparts from Macedonia, that we must be clear about the fact that their own Albanian-language institutions should help to promote social cohesion in Macedonia and not create divisions. That is an important aspect we should not lose sight of. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is exactly what has happened in Macedonia. Therefore, I also believe that this reconciliation is sustainable, but that the government, which has very courageously found a solution to the university issue and to many other issues, needs visible signs of its success, and powerful support, else peace throughout the region will be under threat.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is so important, firstly, to find a solution to the name problem. When Greece, of all countries, again puts forward a proposal to call it Slavo-Macedonia, it really is asking for trouble, because that is precisely what the Albanians would regard as being another example of exclusion tactics. Secondly, I take the view that it is very important to quickly bring the stabilisation agreement to a successful conclusion, and thirdly, I believe that it is very important to support Macedonia as a role model in the region, so that it has a stabilising effect on its neighbouring countries. It is also imperative for free, country-wide elections to be held as soon as possible in Kosovo, in order to ensure that forces with unequivocal democratic legitimacy come to power there – and not just at local level – which will truly have the interests of the Kosovo Albanians at heart. I am sure this would defuse no small number of problems in Macedonia, too.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel Macedonia has every chance of becoming a type of Switzerland of the South-East, and we should give it massive support on this journey, and reject anything that could lead to a relapse into nationalism and chauvinism, which, I am sorry to say, certain forces in the country are currently trying to provoke for tactical reasons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Without doubt, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is helping enormously to promote peace and security in the region and we trust that the last problem in its relations with Greece will shortly be resolved in a way which respects the dignity of both countries.</p>

That is why the Commission has repeatedly urged the Macedonian Government to resolve the outstanding problem of higher education in the Albanian language.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the passing of the new law. The Commission is working with the OSCE High Commissioner for national minorities, Max van der Stoel, with a view to providing financial support for the implementation of this important law. Perhaps I could use this opportunity to say that the cooperation between the Commission and the High Commissioner, Mr van der Stoel, has already got off to a good start.</p>
<p class="contents">Our combined efforts have enabled us to solve a similar problem that existed in two other European countries, i.e. Estonia and Latvia, and I am grateful to be able to take this opportunity to say that our cooperation with the OSCE High Commissioner in this respect has been extremely constructive and valuable. I believe the same will apply to Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is intending to make EUR 1 million available for the current year, under the national programme for Macedonia, in order to support the implementation of this law. The funding allocation is provided for in the financing proposal which is to be put forward today – possibly this very hour – to the PHARE administration committee. If the Member States adopt this financing proposal, a financing agreement will be concluded with the government and a detailed project will be drawn up in close cooperation with Mr van der Stoel in the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">The PHARE funding made available for the year 2000 under the national programme could also be used to support the university in the coming academic year, i.e. in 2001 and 2002. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
