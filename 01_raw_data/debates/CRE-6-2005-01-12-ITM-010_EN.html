<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schmit,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Security Strategy confirms that our transatlantic relationship is unique and irreplaceable. By taking common action, the European Union and the United States can constitute a considerable force in the service of our shared values in the world. The conclusions of the November European Council refer to the responsibility shared by the European Union and the United States in the face of the major challenges such as terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the peace process in the Middle East, and the eradication of poverty from the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The Luxembourg Presidency is firmly committed to implementing these conclusions. I am sure that today’s debate in this House will help us to accomplish this task. Relations between Europe and America are founded on shared interests and on the promotion of such shared values as freedom, democracy and human rights. They also benefit from the interdependence of their economies, something that is unique in the world. These factors, taken as a whole, explain why, even when the recent Iraq crisis was at its worst pitch, there was continuing trans-Atlantic cooperation on most of the major issues, whether the Balkans, the Middle East peace process, the fight against terrorism, or non-proliferation.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite certain isolated differences, the economic relationship has continued to develop. The United States and the European Union share great responsibility for international economic and monetary stability. It is worth adding that the latest agreement on aircraft construction demonstrates our ability to resolve our differences in a spirit of cooperation and partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">If the state of the relationship has been, and remains extremely positive, it is nonetheless true that it must adapt to change on three fronts. This morning, the President of the European Council stressed the fact that the status quo is not a credible option. For a start, the end of the Cold War has made for fundamental changes in the international order. Faced with the Soviet menace, trans-Atlantic unity was a necessity in terms of mere survival. Today, the more important element of choice and political will has been added. The tragedy of 11 September changed the way in which America perceives the world; it obliges us, too, to revise our definition of collective security. This obviously affects relations between the United States and the rest of the world, including the European Union. The internal transformation of the European Union into a more political union endowed with a common foreign and security policy, with a single currency and with an area of justice and freedom will inevitably be reflected in its relations with America, changing their quality and intensity. All these factors together means that, of the three major components of the relationship with the United States – NATO, bilateral relations and EU-US relations – it is the third that is growing in importance.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, President Bush’s visit to the European Union on 22 February acquires exceptional significance. The Presidency intends to take this opportunity to give the relationship fresh momentum. The President’s visit is a powerful political and symbolic act. We see it as communicating Washington’s acknowledgement of the shared interests and values that link America and the EU. This visit must be well prepared, and I will give close attention to honourable Members’ suggestions on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, to be sure, advocating a pragmatic and constructive approach to the future, but it will also be an ambitious one. European unity is one of the conditions on which the establishment of a strong and balanced trans-Atlantic relationship depends. We have to work on it. It is also important that the EU should put forward its own initiatives in clear terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, as stated in the European security strategy, Europe must continue to develop its own capacities. There are few areas in which the EU and the United States do not cooperate. Time does not permit me today to look at all the policy areas concerned, but there are three that are particularly urgent.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the conflict in the Middle East, the resolution of which is a matter of vital importance not only to those involved in it, but also to Europe and the United States. We are working towards such a resolution within the framework of the Quartet, with the Americans, the United Nations and Russia. The latest developments in the region open a unique window of opportunity. Like the Americans, we Europeans must encourage the Israelis and Palestinians to seize this vital opportunity to relaunch the peace process and do everything possible to support the parties in their search for a just and lasting solution. I would add that Mr Poettering, speaking this morning, highlighted the political role that the European Union must play in the quest for the peace that is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue has to do with Iraq and, over and above that, with the destiny of the region. Although the present situation there is extremely problematic, it is in the interest of all, and particularly in Europe’s interest, that Iraq should emerge from the present crisis. The elections at the end of this month will take place under difficult conditions, but we must hope that they will create the conditions needed for a democratic and sovereign Iraq to make a new start.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Iran, the European Union and the United States, different though their methods and approaches may be, share the same objective, which is to prevent the country developing nuclear weapons. The European Union has embarked on more wide-ranging negotiations with Iran; we have high hopes of them, and that not only in the nuclear sphere. The outcomes that are emerging will be, or could be, a great success for the European foreign policy and for Europe’s approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is the disaster in Asia, which we have just been discussing, and which is a clear illustration of the need for good cooperation between the European Union and the United States when such calamities strike. The acknowledgement of the central role of the United Nations in coordinating aid, something to which many of you referred and which the European Union advocated from the outset, has been an encouraging sign in that the Americans very quickly came to accept it. There are very many areas in which Washington’s and Brussels’ views largely coincide, including the long-term stabilisation of the Balkans, Afghanistan, the main aspects of the fight against terrorism, which must reconcile the demands of freedom and security, and the relaunch of the Doha round, among others. In other fields, we have to accept that, although we have shared goals, we have different approaches, and Iran, as I have already stressed, is one of them.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, there are areas on which we really do differ, including climate change, the International Criminal Court and capital punishment. Although we must try, by means of some sort of dialogue, to resolve our differences in so far as we are able to, we must also be realistic enough to admit that it will not always be possible. When that happens, let us, as friends and partners, be honest enough to acknowledge our differences, but also make sure that they do not affect our relationship as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to make one final comment. The best proof of the trans-Atlantic relationship’s maturity would be for us to talk less about this relationship in general than about the tasks we set ourselves towards the end of making the world a safer place and giving its economic, social and ecological development greater balance. It is true that this year’s second anniversary of the launch of the ‘New Transatlantic Agenda’ encourages us to reflect on the state of this relationship and of its institutional process. The Presidency is willing to listen to any suggestion towards improving it in a pragmatic way. It is by action and by the development of good policies through dialogue and cooperation that we will best be able to move the trans-Atlantic partnership forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Potočnik,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. Mr President, first of all I would like to convey Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner's apologies. She very much regrets being unable to attend this debate. However, the reason she is not here is pertinent to this debate. She was due to participate in your debate as originally scheduled, but is now on her way to Washington for meetings with the present and future American Administration, including Secretary of State Colin Powell, future Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the future National Security Adviser, Stephen Hadley. Mrs Ferrero-Waldner will brief the Committee on Foreign Affairs on this visit on 25 January 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the opportunity to discuss transatlantic relations with you early on in this parliamentary term. Reviewing the state of our relations with the United States will be high on our political agenda over the next few months, and for good reason, since the outcome will have a major influence on developments in the transatlantic relationship over the coming years. This debate today is both timely and welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to start by stating two simple and irrefutable facts. First, EU-US relations are truly unique and irreplaceable. Second, the balance sheet of the transatlantic relationship is fundamentally positive.</p>
<p class="contents">On the economic front, we have the largest trade and investment relationship in the world, with figures like EUR 600 billion worth of trade in 2003, and an investment stock measured at EUR 1 500 billion in 2002. These investments have created, directly or indirectly, some 12 million jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. But our relations extend well beyond the domain of economics, even if some media reports continue to focus solely on past divisions over Iraq. We are working together with remarkable success in places such as the Balkans, Afghanistan and Ukraine. That being said, it is clear that the EU-US relationship must adapt to the changing security environment and to changing global priorities. It must also adapt to changes within the European Union. We are convinced that as the enlarged EU's foreign policy strengthens, so too will the scope and intensity of our relations with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">In essence, the European Union and the United States are both founded on the same principles and values: respect for the rule of law, democracy, human rights and of course free market economies. We also share many common interests, such as the fight against terrorism, promoting solutions to regional conflicts, dealing with third countries, improving transatlantic economic relations, concluding the WTO Doha round, and creating global prosperity. In many cases, we share the same strategy for implementing those goals. In others, although we share the same goals, we have different approaches to implementation. There are also issues on which our views fundamentally differ, such as how to tackle climate change, and on some aspects of human rights and international law.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at the key EU-US issues today, it is natural to begin with our multilateral efforts in the Indian Ocean. The recent human tragedy clearly demonstrated that in times of crisis, only effective international cooperation can prevail. EU and United States assistance has been vital, and together we have set a good example of effective multilateralism. We want to continue this preference for effective multilateralism by working closely with the United States on issues such as United Nations reform and climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to one of the most significant areas of dispute between the European Union and the United States, my colleague Mr Mandelson announced yesterday that the EU and the United States have agreed terms for launching negotiations on subsidies affecting the civil aircraft sector. The objective of these negotiations, which will last three months, is to eliminate subsidies and to establish fair, market-based competition between Boeing and Airbus. With this agreement, the EU and US have confirmed their willingness to resolve the dispute that has arisen between them over trade in large civil aircraft, and to devote time and resources to doing so by negotiation, rather than pursuing the dispute through WTO channels. This is a significant move. However, it is the beginning of a process and not a conclusion. Much work remains to be done. The Commission intends to work closely with Member States and Airbus, as well as with the US trade representative, to achieve a final result that maintains Europe's competitiveness in this important sector.</p>
<p class="contents">On regional issues I would like to highlight three areas of common priority. First, we should redouble our efforts to bring peace to the Middle East now that a new Palestinian leadership has been elected. It is crucial that we, through the Quartet, use the positive momentum among the parties to ensure full implementation of the roadmap without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, we must continue working together to help put Iraq on the road to democracy, peace, prosperity and stability. Third, we share the objective of preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons capability and we should both do our best to ensure that Iran fully implements the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Doubtless many of you have the feeling that we could do more and work better together. The Commission shares that feeling. In order for our cooperation with the US to continue developing successfully we must be united, consistent, effective and pragmatic. Important work is already being done to reinvigorate our ties. The Commission is assessing the contributions made to the discussion by the stakeholders on how to enhance the EU-US economic partnership and we will propose a strategy, with concrete steps, by the time of the next EU-US summit later this year.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also reviewing the institutional framework of our relations. The Commission will submit a communication on both the framework for relations and economic partnership to Parliament and the Council in the spring, prior to the EU-US summit.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has an important role to play in furthering EU-US ties. We have been listening carefully to your views within frameworks such as the transatlantic policy network, and we look forward to a general constructive dialogue with you on the future of the transatlantic partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">You are an important ally for us in ensuring that this partnership flourishes and grows stronger in the coming years. We are convinced that further dialogue between you and the US Congress will be essential to cement a good basis for our bilateral relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me underline that the Commission attaches great importance to the visit of President Bush to Brussels on 22 February. We see this as a major opportunity to revitalise our partnership and define common priorities and missions. We will do everything in our power to ensure that the visit is a success and that it confirms what we already see as auspicious signs of an improving relationship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union and the United States have a shared history, common values and the same passion for freedom, and this is because the transatlantic link is written into the genetic code of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear – as both the Commission and the Council have pointed out – that we have differences separating us, such as the International Criminal Court, the Kyoto Protocol, extraterritorial laws and trade policy, which the Commissioner referred to a moment ago. But I believe that we must place much more emphasis on what unites us rather than what separates us.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the objectives we as the European Union pursue – as the President-in-Office of the Council said – with regard to peace, stability, the fight against terrorism, weapons of mass destruction etc. can be achieved much better in cooperation with the United States rather than by speaking out against them – as Commissioner Patten said in one of his recent speeches – just as the United States will be better able to achieve their objectives in cooperation with the European Union rather than in opposition to it.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States are an admirable people; they represent 3% of the world’s population and are able to produce 30% of its goods and services, and they have been able to create a political, economic and military superpower that is unprecedented since the Roman Empire.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the forthcoming visit by President Bush offers a wonderful opportunity to restore that strategic alliance, that harmonious partnership between the European Union and the United States, and to ensure that the values we both advocate – including human rights and fundamental freedoms – can be taken on in all regions of the world, be consolidated and be truly effective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Paradoxically enough, it is the re-election of George W. Bush that offers the opportunity of making a new start in transatlantic relations. After all, President Bush, as he has already indicated himself, needs European involvement in order to be successful in the core task of his foreign policy during his second term in office: the fight against terrorism and, particularly, addressing the problems in the Middle East. In that respect, the interests of the United States and Europe still run parallel to a large extent, even if the gulf between us sometimes seems wider than ever. We have a few difficult years behind us, particularly where Iraq is concerned. President Bush has announced his wish to strengthen relations with his European partners, and in this light, we warmly welcome his visit to Europe next month.</p>
<p class="contents">Both sides have to make an effort if there is to be a significant improvement in relations. The Americans will need to take greater account of their European partners’ views than they have done before, but Europe, in turn, will need to be prepared to let its own former differences of opinion become a thing of the past. We are therefore hopeful that the Americans will reassess their relationship with their European partners. We are also cautious and even somewhat sceptical, because for the time being, there are no concrete signs of real changes of direction on the part of the Americans. I am therefore convinced that in the near future, we will, in this House too, have even more extensive debates on transatlantic relations when the time comes to discuss an own-initiative report on the subject. We believe Europe must adopt a clear common position, on which basis it can conduct dialogue with the United States on how to tackle world problems together. The debate on transatlantic relations is therefore closely linked to the European debate about our own effective common foreign policy. In that respect, it is impossible to ignore the, at times, fundamental differences of opinion on how to tackle global problems. The fact that a number of issues, including Kyoto, the International Court of Justice, the disarmament issue and non-proliferation, will also be mentioned in the next few years is, to us, an important point in the discussion. These are all areas in which the differences are often still gigantic.</p>
<p class="contents">Legitimacy of international action is one of those points we would actually like to mention, where the difference of opinion in the debate of the past few years has been crucial. The guiding principle of European external policy is multilateralism. We remain of the opinion that a decision to intervene should lie with the UN and cannot be taken by individual countries or coalitions of countries. Europe should defend that position, and we must make it an absolute priority to reform the United Nations and make it a truly effective and representative platform. It is preferable that this be done in tandem with the Americans, but we should not shy away from tabling our own proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have a lot of historic links, and there is considerable gratitude towards the United States, which has helped us on many occasions. Together, we have a great responsibility to work for peace, democracy and human rights throughout the world and have a common interest in close and unreserved cooperation in the fight against terrorism and in the interests of global security, disarmament and effective international institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no secret that we have big differences when it comes to views of the International Criminal Court, Kyoto, multinational agreements, the treatment of the Guantánamo Bay prisoners, the death penalty and a number of trade issues. These are important issues for the EU and our citizens, and they are always on the agenda in discussions with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Relations have also become extremely strained in connection with Iraq, and we can spend forever – as we have in fact done in this House – debating the whys and wherefores of what went wrong. We must put that behind us and together accept responsibility for the Iraqi people’s being able to enjoy peace, security and democracy. The opportunities for a fresh start in the Middle East peace process have also increased following the Palestinian election. This is a sphere in which the EU and the United States can together play an important role.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a very important six months ahead of us. The two summits between the EU and the United States must lead to a new lease of life in our relations. Together, we can achieve a lot. It was good to hear of Luxembourg’s ambitions, even if the Presidency does not have its earphones on at the present moment. We hope that the Bush administration Mark Two will realise that there is much to gain from cooperation with Europe that is characterised by trust.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must also make great efforts, and I am therefore pleased about the constructive tone that exists in this House. We must formulate clear short- and long-term strategies for what we wish to accomplish, and how. A number of factual matters have been mentioned, as well as the matters of how we are to set up a free trade area and a Transatlantic Parliamentary Assembly. The EU has partnerships with most countries in the world. It is odd that we have such an insubstantial agreement with, in particular, the United States – our closest neighbour of all and our most important partner. That is why I look forward to what the Presidency and the Commission are shortly to present to Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The disaster has also shown, though, an urgent need for closer cooperation between us. A friendship must be able to cope with criticism and plain speaking. I am sure I will not be saying anything new if I list the critical issues that need to be put on the agenda again and again. From Kyoto to Guantanamo Bay by way of the International Criminal Court, there are problems that we must – and will – raise with our American friends, but we want to be fair too; we want to give President Bush a chance to mend the relationship in his second term of office. We very much welcome his statement that he attaches particular importance to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor do we want to overlook the fact that, despite all the difficulties we have had and still have, cooperation is proving successful in many areas; whether between federal states, between think tanks or citizens’ initiatives, cooperation is working with extraordinary success in many areas, as well as in business and the economy. As for the future, many tasks await us; there is the conflict between Israel and Palestine, there is the mullahs’ regime in Iran to be brought to heel, but there is also hunger and disease to be combated.

The fact that transatlantic relations are now so good surprises some people, but this is merely down to the fact that the EU’s policies do not differ in any fundamental way from the line followed by the US Government. The debate on the EU Constitutional Treaty made it apparent that EU Heads of State or Government want the EU, too, to become a global and even military player. Two examples of this are the militarisation of the EU, with the inclusion of an express commitment to rearmament in the new EU Treaty, and the fact that economic and monetary policy is based on neoliberal principles. As I see it, a form of transatlantic relations whereby the EU becomes a world power, mostly working together with the USA, but sometimes competing with it, is the stuff of nightmares. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, it is the United States alone that can guarantee some sense of order in our complex and unpredictable world; the United Nations certainly cannot do it. Simply think of the recent mass killings in Darfur, Sudan. It is also Washington which guarantees NATO’s continued existence, thanks to which Europe need not fear conventional military threats today. Moreover, in terms of combating terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction, the European Union is really no match for the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, a sense of realism and enlightened self-interest on this side of the Atlantic Ocean require solid, open-handed, transatlantic relations. I truly hope that the need for this will come to be generally accepted throughout all the European institutions, including this House.

From listening to this debate, one would not think so. However, as Chairman of the European Parliament Delegation to Canada, I fully recognise the importance that the Canadian Government attaches to its relationship with the 25 Member States of the European Union. It is important that we continue to maintain a high level of dialogue at summit and ministerial level to address critical issues facing the European Community.</p>
<p class="contents">The new EU-Canada Partnership Agenda was launched under the Irish presidency in Ottawa on 18 March 2004. It has established a coordination group to ensure the prompt and effective implementation at political level of decisions concerning all elements of the relationship between Canada and the European Union. This intensified dialogue will allow for a more strategic, sustained and coherent approach to all issues affecting Canada and the European Union in an increasingly wide range of sectors. These include: environmental issues, justice and security matters, migration and integration affairs, fisheries, education, culture, youth exchanges and transport security.</p>
<p class="contents">We will work together to enhance the frequency and level of contact between the Canadian International Development Agency and EU agencies responsible for development assistance in order to bring forward common approaches.</p>
<p class="contents">Global issues of maintaining peace and security are best addressed in an effective multilateral system within a European Union working together with the US Government, the Canadian Government and our partners at the United Nations to combat international terrorism, tackle global poverty and promote democratic values.

Rivalry between Europe and America is a dream come true for the enemies of Europe and the United States, and this is perhaps something that should be borne in mind by the participants in the demonstration in Mainz, referred to by Mr Pflüger. I say this as a representative of a country in which the overwhelming majority of citizens were opposed to the Iraq war, but are simultaneously in favour of close ties between Europe and the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation has now changed, as the outgoing/incoming President Bush is no longer vying for another term. He no longer needs to convince Americans and Europeans that he was right about Iraq, and will therefore be open to arguments put forward by the Old Continent, or in other words, by the EU. Furthermore, eight of the countries that recently joined the EU have traditionally had better and deeper relations with America than parts of the ‘old’ Europe. This means there is a new and improved outlook for the marriage of convenience between Europe and America, and indeed we know from experience that such marriages last a good deal longer than marriages for love. Europe is not Juliet Capulet, a compatriot of the President, and the USA is not Romeo. Cooperation and a strategic partnership between the USA and Europe are what is needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Competition must be organised sensibly, and economic competition is of primary importance. Our common interests are based on a desire to maximise security; this includes security in foreign policy, the fight against terrorism and other aspects, such as the major environmental issues, which need to be resolved. Moving on to competition, however, this also means that the major industrial nations of Europe and North America must unite, not at the expense of the poor, but by laying down a joint and fair framework, which is a key prerequisite for a peaceful world. In spite of the disputes which sometimes arise in connection with practical policies, our core values are the same.</p>
<p class="contents">We have fared extremely well in Europe with a combination of these three factors, and it is because these relations were in place that this Europe of ours is, by and large, free today. We should make it quite plain that we are not building the European Union in opposition to the United States, but to make it strong and enable it to become a partner of the United States once again, as only those who are strong can become partners.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, another aspect to which thought must be given. The EU has treaties, association agreements and suchlike with nearly every country in the world, and the Americans have NAFTA, APEC, and others, but apart from NATO no contractual agreements exist between the EU and America. For this reason, we should ensure the eventual creation of a transatlantic marketplace, which would help us in many ways; for example, in organising competition sensibly and in a way which does not violate multilateral frameworks, in jointly protecting our interests and in standing up for our core values. I believe this to be one of the main challenges facing us.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we adopted the Constitution. Victor Hugo once said that he dreamed of a Common Assembly which would unite Europe in peace and maintain relations with the other great democracy on the far side of the Atlantic. I believe that this must be our goal, particularly on a day like today, when we have just voted in favour of the Constitution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The resolution includes a paragraph on the idea of a transatlantic marketplace, a proposal which has already been put forward in several of Parliament’s resolutions. It is an extremely simple idea, based on the premise that our economic integration is much deeper than we are aware and than we perceive it to be, as well as on the premise that this economic integration facilitates healthy growth and secures jobs on both sides of the Atlantic, and hence enables us to help the whole world participate in this prosperity. This applies to both the multilateral and bilateral agendas.</p>
<p class="contents">What we lack, though, is a rational view of this economic and social reality in the political sphere. This means that we cannot continue with the existing New Transatlantic Agenda on its own, and especially not with the Positive Economic Agenda, which is far too technical and apolitical, as well as being impossible to explain to the public. Changes must therefore be made to these agendas, and we must develop some kind of plan, idea or strategy to form the basis of this transatlantic marketplace.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed is therefore not a free-trade zone, but a genuine harmonisation of the two economies, which in fact already exists in reality. The idea of the internal market must be adopted, realities acknowledged, geopolitical and geostrategic changes which have taken place in the world recognised and a model applied that already exists in the sectors of competition and trade, where experts work together across the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="contents">One need only look at the current figures and the relevant Commission documents – for example the Quinlan and Hamilton report – to see that economic relations are currently very close. To give but one example; US investment in the Netherlands in 2003 was at approximately the same level as total investment by US companies in the whole of Asia. I hope that this example will stir the Members of this House into action, and I hope that we can build on it and start to cooperate properly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a fragile hope, and the window of opportunity of which you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, spoke is a narrow one.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see our trans-Atlantic relations strengthened by the resolute commitment that the European Union and the United States must make, that this opportunity be not lost. The new Palestinian president must indeed be strongly encouraged in his self-confessed willingness to renounce violence and thereby relaunch dialogue. This courageous stance will, however, become untenable unless he soon – that is to say, between now and the summer – gets distinct indications that this attitude is in no sense a sort of capitulation. We have always known that this conflict, so long and painful, would, at its end, have neither victor nor vanquished.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether rightly or wrongly, the Arab world regards the Americans as having taken Israel’s side. That is why there are such expectations, and not only in Palestine, that the European Union will balance perspectives and give its own guarantee. Here more than elsewhere, and now more than ever, our expectation of you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is that this necessary complementarity of influences be reinforced and put to work for the sake of peace and in order to strengthen trans-Atlantic relations, which is indispensable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The decisions by the summit in Dublin set in motion the replacement of the NATO army in Bosnia by the euro-army, approved the aggressive plan for the Middle East, ratified and legalised the occupation of Iraq, promoted terrorist policy against the peoples and applied new anti-democratic measures, such as biometric data, global personal files and much more. A joint attack on pension systems and labour relations was likewise decided, together with the creation of better conditions for action by big business.</p>

Such statements and opinions should be regarded as highly irresponsible, because transatlantic cooperation provides us with an opportunity to find common answers to the global threats facing humanity, such as poverty, natural disasters and environmental degradation. It also enables us to work together to combat AIDS and terrorist attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately neither the European Union in its present guise nor the super-state outlined in the draft Constitution, with all its bureaucratic red tape, wastefulness and sluggishness, are capable of reacting in an appropriate manner to global challenges of a political or economic nature.

The past few years have done nothing to improve our relationship with the United States. This is undoubtedly largely attributable to the US intervention in Iraq, but there are also other problems, and one that springs to mind is the unacceptable pressure brought to bear by the US administration, and the American President himself, in favour of Turkey being allowed to join the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think it does transatlantic dialogue any good if one party interferes in the other’s internal policy matters. Having said that, we should also admit that there is in this Parliament a certain kind of primary anti-Americanism, which certainly does not make things any easier. Europe and the United States share the same values, democracy, human rights, and the free market economy being among them. These are often referred to as universal values, but they are, in fact, Western, or rather European.</p>
<p class="contents">We also share a number of common enemies. In the first place, there is the threat of Islamic terrorism, even though opinions differ as to how to address this problem. In this respect, we should not remain fixated too much on multilateralism versus unilateralism. In practice, multilateralism often means that we hide behind bodies such as the United Nations, so that, in practice, little or nothing ends up being done.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not blame the Americans for our weaknesses in the military field and in the field of external policy; we have only ourselves to blame. We could take a leaf out of their book. Just think of the tsunami in South-East Asia. American military were very quickly on the ground to provide practical aid. The European Union was present in the form of Commissioner Michel who came to take stock of the damage and to share out a few bags of rice in front of the television cameras. The contrast was harrowing and spoke volumes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a time not to look back in anger but to look forward with hope.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, with the arrival of the President of the United States next month, is it not possible for the Commission, the Council and Parliament to think of three major areas where we could cooperate in the terms we have used in our joint resolution on a Community of action? A Community of action that will seek to develop a peace initiative in the Middle East; a Community of action that will search for global security in the fight against international terrorism, cooperation in development assistance and in facing the new global challenges of the disasters in the Middle East which the President-in-Office of the Council mentioned. Last but not least, a Community of action that will pick up the ideas which, I hope, the Commission will come forward with on strengthening the economic partnership. That is the idea, which Parliament has endorsed on several occasions, of completing the transatlantic market and fixing a date of 2015, so that we can really mobilise the communities on both sides of the Atlantic to complete a barrier-free transatlantic market.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, the Commission will be coming forward with its review of the New Transatlantic Agenda, and we in this House have insisted on many occasions – and once again in the joint resolution – that we should take the opportunity to upgrade this relationship; show that it is visible to the peoples on both sides of the Atlantic, and not exclude, as the new transatlantic agenda does today, the political communities. We need to find a way to bring all the actors together in what we have called a partnership agreement, because I am certain that if, with the arrival of the US President, the opportunity is taken by the incoming administrations on both sides to shape a new strengthened transatlantic partnership, we all will be beneficiaries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The way the South-East Asian post-tsunami crisis has been handled would tend to lead one to answer in the negative. The Bush administration’s initial response was to propose the setting up of a coalition of donor countries around the United States, rather, of course, than place its intervention under the authority of the United Nations. The European view of this initiative is that it is a sign of ‘no change’ from the previous term.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must say to America, as one does to a dear friend, ‘you are cutting yourself off; your policies are isolating you.’ Not all the coalitions in the world will be able to do anything about it; they will not be able to paper over public opinion’s profound crisis of confidence in the United States. One French essayist summed up this widespread sentiment in these words: ‘The United States is in the process of becoming a problem for the world. We were more used to seeing them as a solution.’</p>
<p class="contents">Let the Americans defend their interests, let them resolutely defend their security; nobody will hold that against them. What causes doubts to arise, though, is the Messianic and ideological motivation that the US administration attaches to its intervention in Iraq. These doubts take root when human rights violations involve all the belligerent parties in Iraq, and doubts become grave concern when whole populations are infected with hatred of the West, as a reaction to an ill-thought-out military intervention which obviously underestimated how resistant the people of Iraq would be to the transition to democracy thought up by the Pentagon.</p>
<p class="contents">The Americans did not always espouse this doctrine, though; in the past, they chose to focus their foreign policy on the search for consensus and a sort of general interest. They preferred agreement to coercion and acted within a multilateral framework. In so doing, the USA performed its duties as the world’s major power and strengthened its authority.</p>
<p class="contents">The American intervention in Iraq put an end to that, but it is not too late to change, provided that the Americans themselves take the initiative in so doing. What must come first is the normalisation of their relationship with the United Nations. The UN is the sole authority competent to decide in favour of international military intervention, and we must invite the United States to join Europe in committing itself, on the one hand, to multilateralism and respect for international law and, on the other, to reform of the United Nations, particularly as regards the Security Council and the way it is made up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is likely to be less unilateral, more political, involve less use of force and be more open to dialogue with international organisations. This means that his visit to Brussels in February will be all the more important, and, as Mr Schmit has said, it ought to act as a major impetus towards more open transatlantic relations. It should also be an opportunity to familiarise ourselves with US plans for the next four years, and to set out our European expectations. In this respect, it would be useful if President Bush were to speak before this House. After all, he is a representative of Europe’s closest ally, so why should he not be invited to speak here?</p>
<p class="contents">At noon we voted on the resolution on the Constitutional Treaty. The Constitution is intended to help create a European identity, but there are those in Europe who would like to create this common European identity in opposition to America, by means of cheap anti-Americanism. This is not the right approach to take. Europe and America are linked by common values, as well as by their history, their Christian heritage and their common strategic interests. This is something that should not be forgotten when differences of opinion arise. It should not be forgotten either when we face new challenges, as our security also depends on coming up with a wise response to these challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe there are three key areas in which the United States and Europe should stand shoulder to shoulder in 2005. Reference has already been made to the Middle East and to the need for peaceful solutions, as well as to common security. I should like to note that attention must also be paid to Eastern Europe, or in other words Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, and to our common concerns regarding anti-democratic tendencies in the Russian Federation. The European Union and the United States should cooperate in order to set the process of democracy in motion in countries where this has not yet happened, such as Belarus, and to support pro-democratic trends in countries where the transition to democracy has already begun, such as Ukraine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No global problem can be addressed without cooperation between the European Union and the United States. We therefore think it is right to take the opportunity offered by the new signals coming from the US administration to rebuild cooperation between the European Union and the United States and, in this context, President Bush’s visit will certainly be an important occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">American decisions have certainly played a major part in the problems that have arisen in recent years, but the splits within Europe and our inability to put across our point of view have also been a factor. I therefore want to underline the fact that Mr Bush must find a Europe that is more united, true to its principles and proud of its identity. We must highlight what we have in common with the United States – freedom, freedom of the economy, democracy – but also what sets us apart, at least in relation to the current prevailing trends there – multilateralism, the primacy of law over force, and therefore the primacy of international institutions, which need to be reformed, the rejection of the death penalty and protection of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has to be able to influence the United States’ decisions, and it will be able to do so if it is united, if it is not split between a traditional, sterile anti-Americanism and the choice of those who rush to side with the coalition of the winners. Or the coalition of the willing, rather, because they are not winners, as the disaster in Iraq shows. Europe should therefore be itself, united and true to its principles.

Since the collapse of communism the main focus of attention for the United States and NATO has moved to Central Asia, and the EU is developing its own defence cooperation strategy. There are many issues that the United States and the EU disagree about: they must face up to the fact and discuss them. It is important that transatlantic relations in the future are built on dialogue, not confrontation.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst terrorist attacks might increase the feeling of solidarity between Europeans and Americans, they have also highlighted the difference between their ways of thinking and acting. The relationship is nevertheless unique and based not only on common interests and values, but also on competition. Regarding global issues, the EU and the United States need to act in a context of broader cooperation. Cooperation must be increased on environmental issues, natural disasters and humanitarian catastrophes. The EU and the United States should be involved together in the financing and building of effective early-warning systems in areas prone to risk.</p>

Poland has good reasons for attaching particular value to both the United States’ presence on the European continent and to cooperation between the EU and the USA. This is because of our geopolitical situation and historical experiences. Yet at the same time, Poland wishes to be a committed and entirely credible member of the European Community. We feel European, and we see our future as intimately bound up with that of the European Union. This places a clear duty on us to undertake efforts aimed at achieving the best possible relations between the EU and the USA, as we are aware of their particular value. The aim of such relations is security and stability, both inside and outside the Euro-Atlantic area. Another way to ensure this security and stability, and perhaps even the most important way, is through support for democracy wherever a chance presents itself of achieving such democracy. This results from a faith in our values and from the conviction that putting power in the hands of citizens is the best guarantee of stability and security.</p>
<p class="contents">What requirements must be met to achieve democracy? Firstly, societies must consent to the assistance they are offered. Secondly, the root causes of threats to stability, whether economic or social, must be eliminated. Finally, and this is an important point; extensive cooperation must take place within the Euro-Atlantic structure. Many examples can be found to demonstrate the importance of these three requirements for the attainment of our goals. The latter have not been attained in Iraq or in the Middle East, where it is difficult to talk of success, although the situation in Afghanistan has already improved somewhat. We can, however, celebrate a genuine triumph in Ukraine. We acted in line with the wishes of the people of Ukraine and eliminated the root causes of threats. In addition, extensive cooperation took place within the Euro-Atlantic structure.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet we should not forget that long-term support and long-term cooperation, in particular between the European Union and the USA, are needed to ensure long-term success in Ukraine. The proposed common foreign policy, provided for in the Constitutional Treaty, may prove to be an important instrument, allowing Europeans to act appropriately. This policy leads us to hope that our support for a free and democratic Ukraine will have the desired effect. I thank you.</p>

There can be no doubt that these relations are no longer exceptional, as they were during the last century. They are, however, a reliable and stable point of reference for both the USA and the European Union in a new international context. Despite all the differences between American and European policies – differences which became even more pronounced during President Bush’s first term – the European Union and the USA are still each other’s closest partners with regard to both political and military matters and economic and cultural issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union cannot tolerate unilateral measures by the United States that take no account of the architecture of international relations. America should not exploit its military superiority to impose its political will on the rest of the world and to place itself above international law. It should not exploit such superiority to dominate the political situation throughout the world. The modern world does not need US domination. Instead, it needs intelligent cooperation between the European Union and the USA on the fight against terrorism and against the causes of terrorism, and on measures to extend democracy and ensure respect for human rights, respect for international law and the development of a global civil society. It also needs joint initiatives to promote economic growth in developing countries, sustainable development, the elimination of hunger and the reduction of poverty on Earth.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already said, at the beginning of the twenty-first century the world does not need US domination, but cooperation between the European Union and the USA. At the same time, we must also subject anti-American sentiments in the European Union today to a critical analysis, as we cannot allow a pan-European nationalism opposed to America to emerge in Europe. Europe does not need to create an enemy overseas in order to construct its own political identity. In other words, Europe does not need the new kind of ideology Hanna Arendt warned against in the 1950s. Quite the reverse is the case. The European Union needs to take measures to familiarise modern America and its citizens with the achievements of European integration in recent years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That need has been recognised by almost all sides across the House. Certainly it is reflected within our Parliament's delegation for US relations. This is not only because we enjoy the most important global trading relationship, a trading volume of more than EUR 1 billion per day, but also because we share a common interest in finding solutions to major issues such as climate change, terrorism, security and peace in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the re-election of President Bush, we have noted the many positive comments from the US Administration in support of better relations. Europe has seen visits last month from Secretary of State Colin Powell, today from Head of Homeland Security Tom Ridge and will see a visit tomorrow from Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist. I understand that President Chirac will visit Washington in the next few weeks. All this is welcome but these visits have almost all taken place within the context of bilateral relations rather than through visits to EU institutions. On the day when this Parliament has strongly supported the new EU Constitution, it is worth noting that the US still largely sees its European relations in these bilateral terms.</p>
<p class="contents">I have high expectations that our new ambassador, Mr Bruton, will be able to raise the profile of the EU. I suggest that he be invited in future to attend debates of this nature.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome President Bush's intention to visit the EU institutions next month, but I await further details of how widespread the US authorities consider EU institutions to be. For instance, I am not aware that he has any intention to address this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that our Parliament also bears some responsibility here. In 1999 we gave our full support to the creation of a transatlantic legislative dialogue, major parts of which we and the US have never implemented. As Mrs Mann said previously, we gave our support to the creation of a single transatlantic market by 2015, but we have not seen many steps towards taking that forward. I believe we need a renewed sense of purpose to reforge the transatlantic relationship. I trust that we will take the very many positive ideas and words of this debate forward into practical and effective steps, which will be to the mutual advantage of both sides. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The idea of setting out a sort of programme, a list of economic and political priorities, strikes me as a useful one, and one on which work needs to be done, particularly in view of President Bush’s visit to Brussels. The idea of creating a transatlantic market place is not an entirely new one, but it must be gone into more deeply and thought through in a mature way. It is important in its own way, provided, of course, that it fits in with our concept of multilateralism.</p>
<p class="contents">Transatlantic dialogue therefore needs to be stepped up at every level, and the reason why I include your House in this is that, although power in America is in the hands of the administration, that is to say, the President, there is also an important centre of power within the Congress. I therefore think that it is very important to build up inter-parliamentary relations within the context of a renewed dialogue across the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="contents">Someone pointed out that we had had nothing to say about Canada. I would remind you that the Prime Minister and President of the Council made reference to Canada during his speech this morning. It cannot be denied that our relations with Canada are of crucial importance in the context of this trans-Atlantic dialogue, and so we treat them with the importance that they deserve, but the fact is that, today, we have focussed primarily on trans-Atlantic relations in respect of the United States, in view of what has happened, and in view, not least, of President Bush’s visit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is true that we have been through a turbulent period, but it is also true that we have now emerged from that period, showing that the transatlantic relationship is still strong and durable. The EU-US summit of June 2004 clearly demonstrated how much we have in common and the readiness of both sides to focus efforts on the key challenges ahead. It could be described as cooperation between partners with common interests and common values who are competing with one other in a fair way.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to touch on matters that have already been raised concerning the question of the transatlantic agenda. As you know, the relationship today is based on the Transatlantic declaration of 1990 and the new Transatlantic agenda declaration and action plan of 1995. Those are the instruments which guide the new relationship with the United States. However, following calls from the European Parliament, and most recently from the Foreign Affairs Committee Resolution of April 2004, we are reassessing the framework for our relations. We are launching an independent study, to be completed early this year, assessing the current cooperation framework. It will include an analysis of alternative preferences for cooperation. The contractor will also look into the advantages and disadvantages of the framework agreement. However, what we have always held to be important is the substance of the relationship. We believe that it is the substance that matters and try to focus on that.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning economic issues and economic cooperation, I would underline that the Commission strongly supports the aim of closer economic cooperation between the European Union and the United States. The last EU-US summit called for a forward-looking strategy to promote integration, drawing on ideas from both sides of the Atlantic. The consultation of stakeholders ended in December 2004, and we have recently been assessing the results.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim is to identify and overcome the real obstacles facing economic cooperators, with the new strategy to be presented to the next EU-US summit in 2005. It is too early to commit to any option at this stage, but we should certainly continue to reinforce cooperation in the areas highlighted, especially in the European Parliament's recent resolutions on the transatlantic partnership. The European Parliament's input will be welcomed as we review our economic relations with our US partners.</p>
<p class="contents">We are facing many common threats: international terrorism, Aids, poverty and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We need to be constructive in engaging on issues where we have differences, such as climate change, the International Criminal Court and trade disputes. It is clear that EU-US agreement is a necessary condition for progress on global issues. The recent catastrophe which we all faced is a clear lesson to us all that we cannot do things in any other way. We need to lay the groundwork for an effective multilateral system, based on a revitalised United Nations in which the United States fully participates.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should also underline that relations with Canada – which have been mentioned – are truly flourishing. That may be why more has not been said about them. The transatlantic partnership with Canada has always been an extremely important relationship for us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Chairman of the Delegation to the EU-Mexico Joint Parliamentary Committee, this is a matter of some importance to me. If we are going to discuss NAFTA, then we should discuss NAFTA as a whole.
