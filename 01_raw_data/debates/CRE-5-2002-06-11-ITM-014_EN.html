<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">van Velzen (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to express my thanks to the Commissioner and his cabinet, to the representatives of the European Commission, the Spanish Presidency, the secretariat of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the consultants, the shadow rapporteurs and all those who have been involved in the preparations for this report. In the final analysis, this is about the specific programmes for research, technological development and integration and reinforcement of the European Research Area. Mr President, I think we can only say that thanks to fruitful cooperation in this House – this is also true of the Caudron report – the European Parliament can be satisfied with the results which will be voted on tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said before, we are building on the successful work of Mr Caudron. Accordingly, we have adopted the structure and the appropriations of the Sixth Framework Programme as they are in the specific programmes, without making any changes. In that way, we are actually making history. For the first time, as far as I know, we are therefore voting twice in plenary about more or less the same amendments. Tomorrow, we will be voting again on the amendments which we had discussed before and adopted in the framework of the Caudron report and which we, in informal trilogue with the Council and Commission, have decided to transfer to the specific programmes. This seems to me to be an historic event.</p>
<p class="contents">What are, in fact, the items of the specific programme that have been added since Mr Caudron’s Sixth Framework Programme? Needless to say, I will not enter into each and every detail, but simply allow me to mention a few points that are very close to my heart.</p>
<p class="contents">I will naturally begin with bio-science. We were right, in my view, to focus mainly on cancer research, among other things. We want European support for fundamental and experimental cancer research that is centred on issues related to a much more effective diagnosis at an earlier stage, for this is ultimately the basis for patient survival. We naturally also want more support for preventive measures. Last week, we held a discussion with a number of very prominent cancer specialists, and the word ‘prevention’ was very much on everyone’s lips. I believe that we can make an important contribution to this by means of the Sixth Framework Programme. Furthermore, we also naturally want a much faster transfer of the results between experimental work and what ultimately benefits the patient, and we refer to this with an unusual word, namely ‘translational research’. This is what it is all about.</p>
<p class="contents">We also support new approaches in the case of cardio-vascular diseases and diabetes, however, with the specific aim to try to establish a link between research in the field of the human genome and the application of new technologies and new research methods. In my view, we can make a lot of headway with this new approach of genetic engineering etc.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, however, also looking into other developments. We are, for example, looking into how nanotechnology can be used in order to treat heart attacks more effectively and faster, and how we can use advanced innovative technologies in surgery relating to cardio-vascular diseases. If we close our eyes and consider what we can offer our citizens in the next ten years in the form of new technologies, better research methods, etc, then you will appreciate the huge importance of this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of food safety, we also rightly focus in this programme on the fundamental role of food, diet and life style in people’s health.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, it is of enormous importance in Europe’s information society to establish the link between mobile communication on the one hand and new technologies in the field of digital television, and the potential in the field of broad-band communication on the other. In this total package, we, as European industry, can play a much better role in employment too. In the final analysis, this is what matters.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to draw your attention to the INTAS project. We are always talking about a much stronger partnership between Europe and Russia. Thanks to the INTAS project, we can considerably strengthen cooperation with Russia, and that is of great importance, partly to combat the brain drain in Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to note that our Commissioner Busquin displayed a great deal of forward thinking when he established the Sixth Framework Programme in this manner and guided it in the direction of a European Research Area. He particularly played a pioneering role in Barcelona when he persuaded the Member States to make joint efforts in order to get industry, the national governments and the European Union ultimately to commit to 3% of GNP for research. This is when actual jobs are created in Europe, this is when dedication for a competitive Europe is evident, and I would thank the Commissioner for this forward thinking. You should see this programme in that light too. It is essential that all groups give their full support to this programme tomorrow so that it can be implemented at the earliest opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Zorba (PSE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, a basic political problem has overshadowed all our debates over recent months: how to resolve the structural weaknesses in all areas of research in Europe. I think that, together, we can find suitable solutions which will ensure that the European Union can safeguard the future and respond to its citizens' expectations, given that today's European economies and societies are going for knowledge-based development.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the specific programme for structuring the European Research Area is concerned, the Commission proposal did in fact contain all the ingredients we needed to identify sensitive points and I am grateful for the cooperation we enjoyed in committee and, vitally, from the Committee on Industry. As luck would have it, the Barcelona Council approved the Commission proposal on increasing overall expenditure on research during the course of our work. This was encouraging and came just at the right time.</p>
<p class="contents">These are a few of the basic points I should like to comment on: inter- and multidisciplinarity, which is, I think, crucial if we are to break traditional moulds and move on to more daring, innovative plans, to move into new research areas, rather than mere collaboration between various research areas. I think that, if we move in this direction, we shall release creative powers which will allow us Europeans to beat other forces in this field in the forthcoming race for international competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is collaboration between and the mobility of researchers. Attracting new researchers and overcoming obstacles is something which concerns not just the countries of Europe but candidate and third countries as well. I think that the Marie Curie fellowships will help here, which is why we are calling for the Commission to monitor mobility, so that the European Parliament has reliable statistics over coming years. Europe has much to gain from researchers from third countries. Not only must we avoid underestimating the importance of fellowships to them; I think we must also make some kind of commitment. And if I reiterate this issue, Commissioner, it is because I think that you agree on its importance.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is the European Higher Education Area. Research and higher education have mutual benefits and are interconnected vessels. There is, of course, a degree of competition, the question of teaching rights. But I think that the Bologna procedure and the common initiative we are waiting for from Commissioners Busquin, Liikanen and Reding will be of immense interest here.</p>
<p class="contents">Society and science: the fears and expectations of European citizens from research and science are greater now than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only do we need more systematic public dialogue, but this public dialogue needs to be structured so that it has a real impact on our society, provides food for thought and educates. Dialogue implies a two-way relationship and should allow European research to understand the needs of our citizens and to respond to social demands, which is why we insisted that social sciences and human sciences take priority. However, I believe that a great deal of work still needs to be done in the society and science area, mainly strategic, structural planning.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to believe that, politically, we have done what we could, cautiously and by common assent, and have resolved some of the problems before us. From now on, as far as implementation is concerned, the Commission now has the baton, although the research community will play the leading role in applying the programme and we trust that it will not gainsay our political choices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Alyssandrakis (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, the specific programme for research and training on nuclear energy provides EUR 940 million for activities in three priority areas – controlled thermonuclear fusion, management of radioactive waste and radiation protection – as well as other activities in the field of nuclear technology and safety. The bulk of the funds – EUR 750 million – is proposed to be used for nuclear fusion research, with a maximum of EUR 200 million provided for ITER, the Next Step tokamak device. Subject to a positive outcome of the international negotiations, a specific decision is expected in the period 2003-2004, so that construction of ITER could effectively start during the period 2005-2006. This will be a major step towards sustained production of energy from nuclear fusion, which is expected to become an efficient source of energy within a few decades. In view of the limited deposits of fossil fuel, the importance of this development cannot be underestimated. Consequently, the associated research fully deserves the proposed funding. Given the fact that the final decision on ITER has not been taken yet, the flexibility in partitioning funds between ITER and other fusion activities is an important element of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Other activities within the field of controlled nuclear fusion include the Associations' programme in physics and technology and the exploitation of JET facilities. The Associations' programme includes, among others, studies of magnetic confinement schemes other than the tokamak, in particular the continuation of the construction of the Wendelstein 7-X "stellarator", research on fusion materials and keeping in touch with civil research activities on inertial confinement and possible alternative concepts.</p>
<p class="contents">The Joint European Taurus (JET) in Culham, England, has been a highly successful machine and its facilities will continue to be exploited, but will have to be phased out at an appropriate time to enable the corresponding resources to be redirected to ITER.</p>
<p class="contents">Regardless of the future of nuclear fusion reactors, the problem of radioactive waste – in particular long-lived waste – will be with us for several thousands of years. Consequently, it is only by an increase of the research efforts that we may hope to decrease the dangers emanating from them. The specific programme provides for EUR 90 million to be used for research on geological disposal and the development of concepts to produce less waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Radiation protection takes up to EUR 50 million. Finally, the chapter of "other activities" covers the evaluation of innovative concepts and the development of improved and safer nuclear energy processes, education and training in radiation protection, improvement of the safety of existing installations, for a total of EUR 50 million.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy welcomes the Commission's proposal and expresses its support for fusion research in general and ITER in particular. A European site for ITER will confirm the worldwide leadership of the European Union in fusion technology, acquired through, among other things, the JET facilities, which should not be abandoned before exhausting its capabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of amendments proposed by our committee refer to nuclear waste and nuclear safety. Ways of dealing with waste should be not only acceptable to society, but also intrinsically safe.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, I should like to point out that there is a mistake in the French translation of Amendment No 4, where the original English text "both safe and acceptable" has been transmuted into "both healthy and acceptable". Could the President ensure that this is corrected?</p>
<p class="contents">The research on interim disposal, waste characterisation and waste packaging, should be funded, together with research on geological disposal. Research on innovative concepts and techniques that produce less waste should include the high-temperature reactor, light-water reactors, gas-cooled reactors, fast reactor technologies and co-generation.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, the adoption of the report by the Committee on Industry will mark an important step towards more efficient and safer nuclear energy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schwaiger (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner Busquin, ladies and gentlemen, my report deals with the direct actions for the European Atomic Energy Community that are implemented and realised in the Joint Research Centre and in its installations at Ispra, Petten, Geel, Mol and Karlsruhe. This specific programme has several focal points, the policy objectives of which I would like to discuss in detail now.</p>
<p class="contents">I will start, though, by saying a bit about education and training. Both advocates of atomic energy and its critics will surely agree that it is very important that an adequate number of young and superbly-qualified workers in the field of nuclear research in Europe should make an active contribution, by their research over the coming decades, to ensuring nuclear safety in the operational nuclear power stations and also, if need be, controlling the fuel cycle where this is a source of risk. The same applies to the safe storage of nuclear waste over the next few decades, and to its being able to be decontaminated as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is important to maintain the Joint Research Centre's high standards and build on its research capacity by training young scientists on courses and scientific practical placements which can, inter alia, be carried on in networks of international, national and regional facilities at the various levels.</p>
<p class="contents">More needs to be said about the general principles, but I do not want to go over the details again, as we had an in-depth discussion of them in the Sixth Framework Programme. However, there are two principles to which I want to give particular attention. The first principle is adherence to general ethical guidelines, which are also binding on EU researchers, and especially Euratom's. The public acceptability of research in the Member States plays an important part in this. You will be aware, Commissioner, of the misgivings that remain as regards some areas of scientific research, biotechnology for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, adherence to the principle that women researchers should have equal opportunities. This relates both to their training and also to the award of important research contracts, whether these are to be carried out by researchers acting on their own or in a team.</p>
<p class="contents">Now for the Joint Research Centre's specific objectives. I see research's principal contribution as being to the safety of the atomic power stations and of their fuel cycle. Europe's citizens can demand that the safety of atomic power stations meets the highest standards even in an enlarged European Union. The stringent western European rules, which the Member States have framed in exacting terms, but which have not to date been harmonised, must be recapitulated as part of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> and must also apply to the atomic power stations in the central and eastern European candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Joint Research Centre's expertise and the results of its research and that of the national authorities in the European Union should be drawn on in establishing a European code of nuclear safety, which should be ratified before enlargement takes place, enabling it to be put before the candidate countries as being valid in law. The candidate countries would have to accept this code as part of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> before their accession and would then have to put it into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, especially Vice-President De Palacio, gave these ideas from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy a favourable reception and supported them. I also assume that you yourself will welcome these suggestions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, then, our desire that a Commission proposal on this topic be submitted as early as this summer. To take an example, the continued operation of the as yet unmodified atomic power station at Ignalina in Lithuania is not acceptable. Another possibility would of course be for it to be decommissioned before Lithuania joins the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Taken as a whole, the European Union and the Joint Research Centre have a great deal of research capacity to hand in the field of nuclear safety. Maintaining that capacity for decades is a safety requirement for the public, who have to be able to live in safety, protected from the radioactivity from nuclear waste.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and, of course, of fissile materials. The safeguards in the Euratom Treaty do indeed provide for this control, but it must also be extended, by means of the whole range of expertise within the Joint Research Centre, to the non-proliferation of fissile materials, which can of course also be used in terrorist attacks. Thefts like those which have recently occurred in Germany are a warning signal in this respect. This of course applies equally to the tracking down of stolen nuclear material and its safe storage.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by highlighting the cooperation between the Joint Research Centre and the medical sector's national and regional research centres, for example the cancer research carried on by the Institute for Transuranium Elements jointly with the German Cancer Research Centre. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Piétrasanta (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I am going to be presenting the non-nuclear section of the report on the Joint Research Centre (JRC), which represents two thirds of its budget. In the Sixth Framework Programme, the Joint Research Centre will be refocusing its activities so as to strengthen its organisational role and participate usefully in the European Research Area.</p>
<p class="contents">Its work programme has three distinguishing characteristics: concentration, openness and networking, and consumer-orientation. To this end, the Joint Research Centre has restructured its non-nuclear activities around two main areas, supported by specialist skills: food, chemical products and health, and sustainable environment and development. These areas will be supplemented by horizontal activities: technology foresight, reference materials and measurements, and public security and anti-fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">The total budget allocated to the JRC’s activities stands at EUR 760 million. Its decision to adopt this new strategy and restructure its services was inspired by a report published last year by a high-level working party chaired by Étienne Davignon. These changes are intended to make the Joint Research Centre better adapted to the needs of political decision-makers and privileged users: the Council, Commission Directorates-General and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The JRC will also be active in giving impetus to the European Research Area and the Sixth Framework Programme. It will work on setting up a Community system to harmonise measurements and will participate in European and global networks. The JRC will be a high-profile player throughout the implementation of the Sixth Framework Programme, in terms of participating in both networks of excellence and integrated projects. It will be able to make an active contribution to developing the new European citizenship by providing a common knowledge base of scientific and technological references and by facilitating dialogue between scientists and decision-makers. It will also be expected to help with the ‘operational’ implementation of the new tools, including the stairways of excellence – as far as it is competent to do so, of course – and with integrating research into local development.</p>
<p class="contents">In certain thematic areas, proposals from the Joint Research Centre would appear to be essential for specifying the public contracts that may be awarded, for example in the sustainable development sector. This sector encompasses all of the issues relating to ecosystems. For example, the JRC has spent more than a year and a half working on establishing the criteria for ecosites and will help to set up a European network. This also applies to food safety, where the JRC will help to establish a reference and standardisation system, and to the protection of individual privacy in information and communication technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Joint Research Centre’s role as an advisor on European policy needs to be enhanced. It is improving networking and cooperation with public and private institutions in the Member States. It is also finalising a human resources and mobility plan, which involves in particular training young scientists and arranging exchanges with national research institutions. The point is not that it should become a research centre competing with other centres to research the scientific questions at issue in several Member States, but that it should ensure linkage between these centres when it comes to implementing the results and achieving the objectives of European directives. In the same way, the Commission must be able to turn to it for the most rapid response possible. It therefore needs to have teams that are capable of adjusting readily to requests made and reacting immediately. To do so, they must have knowledge of their fields permanently at their fingertips, keep up to date with upstream research, and even carry out additional research in areas that have not been covered by the national institutes. The JRC has an important part to play in the process of opening the programme up to the accession countries, to the countries of the Mediterranean region and to those involved in international cooperation under the MEDA and TACIS programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget either the role of mediator that the Joint Research Centre has been called to play in the risk-management sector, on issues such as risk exposure, impact assessment, damages, and nuclear safety and waste problems, creating synergy in particular with the initiatives launched under the EUR-OPA Major Risks programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Centre should further develop its work on implementing practical projects on saving energy, in particular in the construction sector, and on renewable energies. It must not confine itself to research on photovoltaic energy, but must also promote demonstration projects in other areas, such as wind energy. It might also monitor the assessment of the introduction of fuel cells.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the growing popularity of organic food products and traditional, locally-grown produce, the JRC will develop methods to ensure their authenticity and quality. It will also study ways of optimising their impact on the environment and local development.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to make it possible for us to provide better guidance and if necessary to refocus particular studies in accordance with political developments on science, I think that it would be desirable for a monitoring committee to be set up that is in contact with Parliament, so that we would be kept abreast of its activities on a more regular basis, which would allow us to build on the fruitful exchanges we have had so far.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Joint Research Centre’s main objectives will therefore be to remain close to its users – the European Parliament and the Commission – to develop its role as a recognised centre of excellence on issues of safety, health and the environment, and to develop its activities as a promoter of research networks.</p>
<p class="contents">The Joint Research Centre can therefore be expected to make a success of its commitment to reform and to justify its unique position within the European Commission. I should like to thank Commissioner Busquin and his services for having done all they could to help us to prepare this report and its conclusions which we are presenting to you today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Graefe zu Baringdorf (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I shall refer to five reports – and two minutes times five makes ten! I readily concede, though, that atomic power and nuclear energy do not affect agriculture to that great a degree if we disregard the wind, which has just been mentioned. I will therefore try to keep my comments brief.</p>
<p class="contents">It is on the basis of principle that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development regrets that there is no specifically agricultural core area in the Sixth Framework Programme, but that projects are divided up between the chapters on food safety, protection of the environment and development. What makes that all the more regrettable is that we claim to have a multifunctional approach to agricultural policy, with a concern to highlight the interaction between the technical, economic, environmental, social and cultural dimensions. It would be appropriate for it to have a research package to itself as, in terms of extent and practical implementation, agriculture is, along with atomic energy and pharmaceuticals, one of the major areas in which the results of research are put to use.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, research in the area of agriculture and new technologies always essentially has to do with issues of genetic engineering, biotechnology being a much broader area in that it includes the production of both butter and beer. Let it not be thought that research is only just beginning – it was indispensable to past generations' means to live and enjoy life, and indeed to those of our own generation, and that far more so than new technology would have us believe. If we are to talk about food safety in connection with new technologies, then it certainly offers an opportunity to explore the possibilities of the secure supply of safe food and to make a contribution to this. It must be clear to us as well, though, that new technologies can endanger food safety. When there are problems in the food sector, we often find that they have to do with these new technologies. for example, research into the use of seeds is not, or at least not primarily, concerned with the development of resistance; rather, attempts are made to use gene manipulation to bring about the creation of resistance, mainly even to build up resistance to plant protection in the synthetic sector.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, though, not only the chemical sector, but also the organic sector. If only this were about getting research to investigate natural substances with a view to finding potential ways of protecting plants. If only this were about improving resistance in seed by means of research into the natural process of seed development, and not so much about mapping out core areas in the new field of genetic engineering. On the other hand, we have the problem that the use of the new genetic engineering leads to contamination, which researchers for the firms that operate in this area had initially ruled out. The crossover of genetically modified rape onto a related weed was formerly considered impossible, yet now it has happened. Now, we also find transference from applications in conventional sectors into the organic sector, where it is banned and ruled out by current European Union legislation, and contamination of the latter by the former. Organic businesses are not allowed to work with genetically modified organisms, so more research seems to be needed into how research into genetic engineering can be prevented from contaminating other areas. Little has been done other than to put forward theories.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, agriculture generates a whole lot of issues. Speaking as I do on the committee's behalf, I make it clear that we are very definitely not opposed to new technological developments. We are only against the risks inherent in the application of something that research has produced. I have listed a number of points. What matters is that the risk in the application is not passed on to the farmers and, in the course of food production, on to the consumers. As we have prescribed in the atomic energy sector, there must, rather, also be damage limitation and assessment of the damage and risks involved in practical applications and of what harm biotransfer can do to other sectors, so that we are not always only learning from our own mistakes but benefiting from research that can give us advance warning of potential risks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These add to the Commission's impressive project of developing a valid European research area. The only amendments we will oppose are No 6, – which excludes European funding for research aimed at military purposes. We do not look for research specifically aimed at military ends, but research might have military as well as civilian applications, for example research into new materials. By including this prohibition clause, there could be unnecessary impediments to genuinely beneficial research projects.</p>
<p class="contents">We also prefer the committee's Amendment No 24, regarding the budget, to Mrs Zorba's Amendment No 26, which specifies an amount for the Marie Curie International Fellowships. It is surely better to leave the EUR 1.630 billion for human resources unspecified, so that there is more flexibility. We certainly have nothing against the Marie Curie fellowships.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group has tabled a clarifying Amendment No 25 which specifies that participation will be permitted by those who hold doctoral degrees where those degrees were obtained in three, rather than four, years. I trust that Mrs Zorba will accept that this is a sensible clarification.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to concentrate on the specific programme for science and society, which is essential for re-establishing the necessary level of trust and mutual understanding between the scientific community and civil society at large. This is vital if Europe's research effort is to be supported widely and with continuity and thereby realise its full potential. We have seen a lamentable breakdown in this relationship, perhaps as a result of faulty assertions by scientists and politicians in previous crises. Perhaps it is even more attributable to a lack of willingness by science and industry to communicate clearly and systematically. Our hope is that this programme will promote much improved communication and that the public will be much better informed about the objectives, the results, the applications, the achievements, the recognition of the ethical and environmental constraints and the practical usefulness of scientific endeavour.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope, above all, that more young people will be attracted to science as a career. We badly need them for all our futures. We wish Mr Busquin, his team and this programme well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will speak briefly about each of the reports.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I welcome Mr van Velzen's emphasis on life sciences other than genomics and his advocacy of translational research, which means rapid transposition into clinical applications. This is something which will appeal to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome our amendment, which adds nanosciences to nanotechnology. The recent excellent STOA report on nanotechnologies makes it clear that we are still at the stage of nanoscience. That must be emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as aeronautics is concerned, I am glad that there will be some attention to the health of passengers. I support our amendment on space science. Indeed I would like more attention to the big science projects in the European research area outside the framework programme. Of course I support Parliament's new emphasis on health and safety at work.</p>
<p class="contents">I support Mrs Zorba's conclusions. Like her, I was delighted with the increase in funding for science and society. However, I agree with her that some funding should come from the priority thematic areas for the science and society implications. Multidisciplinary research, yes; a European higher education area, with the synergies that implies for the European research area. We should be training people in research management and ethics.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Piétrasanta has made an excellent analysis of the new tasks of the JRC as a technical reference body and a support mechanism for decision-making. I greatly welcome his emphasis on the need for monitoring and the need for the European Parliament to be involved in such monitoring – not just in the JRC.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Mr Alyssandrakis' report is concerned, I would welcome a breakthrough in fusion research, not least because it is far less dangerous than nuclear fission and we need to have an alternative to that form of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am fairly sceptical about whether or not ITER will proceed within this framework programme, but we will see. Every citizen wants action on radioactive waste. The Royal Society in the UK emphasised that recently. It has not been solved yet. I am a great advocate of transmutation and partitioning and welcome any support that can be given to those technologies. I am not, however, a supporter of spending EU money on research into new reactors. This is something that should be funded by the nuclear industry itself. We are not in the business of giving industrial aid to that particular sector. That is not what the public is calling for.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Mr Schwaiger is concerned, he is absolutely right to say that we must have, before long, some sort of <span class="italic">aquis communautaire</span> in the sector of nuclear safety. So congratulations to everyone for their good work and cooperation and good luck to all our scientists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will receive the unqualified support of the Liberal Group.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must become more innovative. Research results must be translated into new products. The Sixth Framework Programme offers the opportunities to do this, especially by deploying new instruments so that, for example, multi-disciplinary teams within integrated projects can work together. Innovations mainly take place on the cutting edge of disciplines, and it is important in this respect to clarify how the integrated projects will be implemented and how the loose ends will be tied up from an administrative point of view. For clarity is still completely lacking in this field. The Commission therefore has an important task to fulfil. An area of attention in this respect is the late payments by the Commission, which can thus cause huge problems for projects and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted with the budget for information and communication technology of EUR 3 600. After all, ICT, being a horizontal technology, makes a huge contribution to innovation within all other disciplines. My proposal to increase the budget for the participation of small and medium-size companies to 15% has been adopted by the Commission and the Council, and this underlines the importance of small companies in terms of dynamism in our economy and employment. This participation, however, should, according to the Liberal Group, feature within thematic programmes. This would guarantee cooperation between large and small companies, for small companies lack the know-how and the manpower to go it alone. It is not acceptable for the best part of the limited research budget that is available to be used for flanking policy by the Commission, since that is not a European task.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Joint Research Centre, I should like to comment on its tasks in relation to nuclear safety, currently a very controversial topic in the Union. For what transpires? The acceding Member States boast a large number of nuclear power plants which do not meet our safety standards. Eight nuclear power plants have now been closed. It is, in fact, very odd that we in Europe have high safety standards for our water intended for swimming in, as Mrs De Palacio pointed out recently, but that there is still no joint approach in the field of nuclear safety. Binding rules across the EU are essential. As we cannot distinguish between the current and acceding Member States, it is necessary to amend the Euratom Treaty so that the JRC can complete the tasks imposed on it via this specific programme in a clear, transparent and effective manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will confine myself to the nuclear question.</p>
<p class="contents">The Euratom Atomic Energy Community was founded in 1957 and is now well past its sell-by date. It is a closed institution and is regulated solely by the Council. Codecision with Parliament is excluded. We really need to change this.</p>
<p class="contents">Its separation from other EU norms is also highlighted by Euratom having its own framework for its research programme. This nuclear technology is the only area to have its own ringfenced budget. Moreover safety requirements, as Mr Schwaiger has pointed out, are not at all coordinated. This is more than regrettable.</p>
<p class="contents">The nuclear fusion budget remains the largest single area – EUR 750 million – of energy research and proposes funds allocated to the development of the next generation of fusion research. Most experts anticipate that if fusion is ever to achieve commercialisation it will not be for at least another 50 years. Therefore the fusion budget is a financial black hole in pursuit of an ever-receding holy grail of fusion energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite around half a century of commercial operation of nuclear reactors, the solution to the long-term management of nuclear waste remains unsolved. The framework programme for additional funds to research geological disposal of radioactive waste means that EU-funded research for what is effectively a commercial waste problem represents yet another subsidy to the nuclear industry. This is unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As far as the short term is concerned, the budget should be increased, but the research topics selected are, in any case, relevant. In fact they are by their very nature essential. They consist, firstly, of managing ultimate residues and spent fuels: advanced reprocessing and transmutation into products that are less and less radioactive and have shorter and shorter lives. This is the top priority and it is absolutely essential that we provide the resources necessary to ensure that we deactivate this final waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, they concern the safety of nuclear installations and radiation protection. Even though European nuclear installations have already demonstrated their high safety standards and are the subject of very rigorous control and environmental protection measures, work on this must continue.</p>
<p class="contents">In the long term, by which I mean after 2050, when any oilfields that are easily accessible will be exhausted, it is nuclear fusion that will take over and it is important that Europe is not left behind by its American and Japanese partners in perfecting this technology.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the medium-term proposals, the central link between the two, are, paradoxically, completely inadequate, in terms of the funds devoted to research into the new generation of fission reactors that will have to replace those currently in service.</p>
<p class="contents">In ten years’ time, on average, the reactors that now provide us with heat and light will have reached the end of their lives. They will therefore have to be replaced by reactors incorporating new designs: high-temperature reactors, new pressurised water reactors and new fast neutron reactors. The latter – I would stress this point – are currently the focus of publicly funded research in the United States, while the previous French Government recklessly abandoned the technology.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a field in which Europe is recognised as having genuine expertise – it is a world leader – and our objective has to be to maintain our technological advantage. We therefore need to invest the necessary research effort. Our American and Japanese partners have embarked on independent policies and the Union and its Member States, Mr President, must not be left behind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that the JRC focuses its efforts on nutrition, chemical products and health, as well as, in particular, the environment and sustainable development, technology foresight, reference materials and measurements, but also public safety and the combating of fraud. I would particularly like to thank Mr Schwaiger for pushing so hard for a code of safety standards for atomic power stations, because it is the prevention and containment of accidents that has recently become especially important, and Parliament is agreed that atomic power stations and atomic materials need a specialised approach in order to guarantee their safety in future.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be said that, of the EUR 11 billion allocated to specific priorities, at least 15% must of course be used for research projects for small and medium-sized enterprises, with a special allocation of EUR 430 million for horizontal research projects. Then there is the ‘stairway to excellence’, where particular account has to be taken of SMEs, just as European SMEs and European industry will in future work more closely with universities and colleges, institutes of higher education and research organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is a need for small and medium-sized enterprises also to be allowed to cooperate with small research groups, newly established and distant research sites and with organisations in the candidate countries. I believe that it is of vital importance to involve small and medium-sized enterprises, especially in the networks of excellence and in the integrated projects. We must surely be aware that the 18 million small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe account for two-thirds of the workforce and, in the final analysis, for 80% of tax revenue, a fact which, I believe, entitles them to work closely with others in research and thus help to shape Europe's future. For us, at the end of the day, good research policy, skilfully applied, makes for the best social policy, for it is always the case that first you have to create the necessary economic conditions, and then you can be generous when distributing the gains. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will allow the broad guidelines on European research, which we adopted in last May’s part-session, to be implemented in the best possible conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Admittedly, the adoption of the rules for participation has been postponed to July. The tight deadlines – so we have been told – left no alternative. In any case, the RDFP package – the specific programmes and the rules for participation – will be adopted before the summer recess, which will allow them to be implemented properly on 1 January 2003. We will therefore be respecting the undertaking that I gave to you back in February 2001, and I am particularly pleased about this.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the specific programmes, which are the subject of tonight's debate, I should also like warmly to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr van Velzen, Mrs Zorba, Mr Alyssandrakis, Mr Piétrasanta and Mr Schwaiger. Personally, at this stage in the work, I followed progress more particularly on Mr van Velzen’s report on the specific programme on the first and third aspects of the RDFP. Once again, I can testify to the quality of Mr van Velzen’s work, all the more so when he had to rework his report several times: he firstly had to take into account the outcome of the votes at the second reading of the RDFP and then had to transfer several of the amendments adopted en bloc at the same vote into the specific programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The end result is a report which is absolutely consistent with the results of the votes on the sixth RDFP, and this in three respects, the first being the seven priorities. There is no point my reminding you of the list, but I will mention in particular the first of these priorities to say that in the specific programme we have better clarified the status of health and the fight against major diseases, separate from research on the genome.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the report is consistent in terms of budget. Parliament very much welcomes the increase in certain budget lines and the inclusion of footnotes giving guidance on allocation within some budget lines, as we requested. Thirdly, and finally, it is consistent in terms of the transition between the new and old instruments, which had been a source of concern to Parliament and several Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the report specifies the research areas adopted at an appropriate level of detail. For example, mine clearance, research into the solar system, doping practices, safety in the workplace and biological agents used by terrorists. We managed to steer clear of a further debate on the ethical issue. Some were nevertheless tempted, but common sense won through and the interests of the majority prevailed: I should like to thank all colleagues for this.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by praising the excellent spirit of cooperation between the various political groups, the Commission representatives and Commissioner Busquin, the Council and the Spanish Presidency. Thanks to this we will have adopted, by the appointed time, an excellent work programme that the European scientific community will now be able to implement from 1 January 2003. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For the first time the preparatory work is on schedule – even ahead of schedule – and agreement has already been reached in the first round. Thanks go to everyone who has been involved.</p>
<p class="contents">This time I am particularly interested in Mr Alyssandrakis’s report as I myself was the rapporteur of a similar report in the fifth framework programme. Fusion is the energy solution of the future, and when it becomes established we can forget discussions about the energy deficit, the overly large share of imported energy in Europe, and greenhouse emissions. The enormous potential associated with fusion means we must make it possible: the more resources we invest, the faster we shall achieve results. For this reason, the ceiling of EUR 200 million the Commission has set for the ITER programme is misguided. Hopefully more of us next time will look further into the future and have the courage to set aside more resources for fusion research. It is in Europe’s interests to hold onto ITER. ITER, if a Member State is to be chosen as its location, will bring a massive increase in know-how to Europe, as well as hardcore technical skills and new technology.</p>
<p class="contents">There already exist workable methods for the temporary storage of high-active fuels so there is no need to use the framework programme to finance this sort of research. For this reason Amendment Nos 7 and 8 should be deleted. There is a ready-made model for bedrock disposal already in Finland, although new alternatives can always be examined. Nuclear power research and the issue of safety associated with its proper use are largely one and the same thing.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has recently indicated a desire to create common, pan-European minimum safety standards. This carries with it its own risks. Whenever there is harmonisation there is a danger that we will go with the weakest link. On the other hand we have very good experience of cooperation between authorities. This way the bad learn from the better, and there is no need for compromises, which the weakest cannot achieve, and which at the same time would lower standards of safety in the most advanced Member States. Regulators already practise excellent, impartial cooperation. For this reason I support Amendment No 17.</p>
<p class="contents">Any development of harmonised regulatory approaches falls outside the scope of the framework programme. The responsibility for following western safety regulations rests with the Member States, and responsibility for monitoring rests with that most viable of organisations, the Western European Nuclear Regulatory Association. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A dream that I simply want to tack on to this specific programme? Perhaps. But above and beyond the dream, in a tangible and precise way, we Members of the European Parliament are thus affirming the existence of Europe with all the strength of the creative intelligence that it holds in reserve, whether in its industry, in its universities or in its researchers, and thanks in particular to their mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be inconceivable for us to maintain the obstacle course that researchers have to negotiate on a day-to-day basis so as to gain the space to be able to devote themselves to their actual work, faced with rules and regulations, the minefield that is social security and the administrative mazes for obtaining visas and resolving career problems. That is why we have a very clear affirmation in these programmes that a vital prerequisite for their successful implementation is mobility: mobility that crosses natural, cultural and economic boundaries, that champions gender equality and that will enable the exchange of research practices. Perhaps the DG responsible will have to launch a mobility support service very soon: today it is just a freephone number, tomorrow it will be a crossroads towards a Europe on the move.</p>
<p class="contents">We should add that upstream it is necessary to develop interdisciplinary doctoral courses that will open up a new concept of the mental, technical and scientific plain on which research is conducted, a concept which meets the expectations and needs of the public. For the universities it is a strategic challenge to encourage both teaching and research staff to open their minds to this possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Promoting new skills and new attitudes that we need to adopt to place ourselves in the vanguard of research while taking into account the European dimension; taking stock of this potential, of these reservoirs of grey matter, networking them, creating the prolific alchemy of the European Research Area; is this a dream? No. Because, building the European Research Area is to rely on the strength and potential of our researchers, on the reservoirs of talent in our universities and schools, on mobility, which opens the way for the exchange of knowledge and expertise, and thus create a powerful catalyst that will make it possible for Europe to exist, to embody the very substance of the European Research Area of this millennium, with the people of Europe, for the people of the world. Thank you to those who gave us this vision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I give particularly strong support to the reports by Mr van Velzen and Mrs Zorba, which I believe improve on the Commission proposal and take us in the right direction. I attach great importance to what Mr van Velzen had to say about cancer research, on which European assistance for research must continue to focus. We fought hard for that when the Framework Programme was going through Parliament, and so we need to underline it again today. As regards sustainable development, research needs to be used to deal with environmental problems. I have tabled a number of amendments on this, which have met with the committee's support, for example one on research into sustainable biofuels. I disagree with what Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf said, and believe that biotechnology can play a thoroughly positive role, in which it would also benefit the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to say, with reference to the ethical aspect of research, that I urge the Commission to support Amendments Nos 17 to 20. These were part of the package in the Caudron report, and could give a positive indication that we support those technical solutions that offer alternatives to what has very frequently been a matter of dispute here in Parliament. So this would be a positive and constructive approach.</p>
<p class="contents">We have refrained from resubmitting the celebrated Nisticò amendment on cloning and stem cell research, about which we have argued so much. The main reason for this is that serious problems with specific parts of this amendment arose in Council. I still do not understand why the Council was not able to come closer to this amendment. Parliament wanted to go further than the Common Position had done. I now hear, though, that a statement by five Member States has moved the Council to start discussing ethics, which cannot but be satisfactory from our point of view, and I call on the Commission to take a constructive approach and smooth the path to an agreement in Council. Parliament will certainly not raise any objections if something is introduced in the ethics field approximating more closely to our amendment than the Commission's declaration and the Common Position did. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They will make substantial changes contributing to the success of the whole programme in that they are based on the focusing of financial aid on a restricted, specific number of priority themes throughout Europe. This will give researchers a closer system of cooperation and will increase their mobility, for the aim is to create an attractive working environment for them in Europe too.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the employment rules, the Sixth Framework Programme, on which work began over a year ago and to which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has contributed, has preserved the very themes highlighted by our committee as well among the priorities, particularly employment, health and safety at the work place and the integration of the socially excluded and disadvantaged such as people with disabilities. Indeed, we must not forget that the whole point of research is to serve the people: it is not an end in itself.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, particular stress has been placed on support and research for small and medium-sized businesses, precisely because of their function of an economic catalyst in Europe. Moreover, the restructuring of the Common Research Centre has made it more efficient and the confirmation of the budget is an important step towards the creation of a European Research Area.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I am pleased to welcome the inclusion of an amendment tabled last June on employment in Europe. Our request that research should be extended to the development of operating systems and hardware in Europe has been included in the specific programme aimed at integrating and strengthening the European Research Area. That will certainly help to boost employment and put the brakes on our current growing dependence on the United States and Japan in what is considered to be a crucial sector for the new economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The sum of EUR 17.5 billion approved by the Council was, in any case, up for debate, which means that it was available for distribution. However, I had to resign from the position of spokeswoman for the Committee on Budgets which had been<span class="italic"> </span>entrusted to me; this was not out of any refusal to do the job, but rather because the committee had resolved not to take up a position this evening, as we are dealing here with new methods of integration and coordination, which are not to be assessed <span class="italic">ex ante.</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would nonetheless like to make use of this time, as practical experience has brought to my attention something I regard as crucial. I refer, Mr Busquin, to the Commission's negotiation of contracts with small and medium-sized enterprises with regard to proposals eligible for support under the Framework Programme. How is it that projects with what I regard as excellent content are doomed to failure because the applicants cannot stand up to the Commission's assessment procedure? An assessment procedure, which, in my view short-sightedly, insists on profit margins and liquidity, utterly disregarding the firms' capacity for innovation and willingness to make investments. An assessment procedure that faces SMEs in particular with safeguards that constitute high obstacles, and, in the final analysis, an assessment procedure that is humiliating and has a demotivating effect on firms working in an essentially innovative way and with less emphasis on profit, which should therefore actually be favoured partners in the Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Cofinancing requires that we ensure that private traders do not misuse Community funds or misdirect investment of them. That much is clear, but such an audit needs decision-making parameters that are more accurate and more responsive to individual cases, or else innovation and initiative will be systematically ruled out rather than supported, and we will end up, as we did with the European Structural Fund, with an accumulation of funds and wasted resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Busquin,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I turn first to you, Mr President, to express my regret that you have not been able to take the floor, because in your capacity as Vice-President, you have always strongly supported the idea of the European Research Area, but I imagine that you will continue to do so. I should firstly like to thank Mr Caudron once again for having ensured that the Sixth Framework Programme was put to the vote during the May part-session, which has made it possible – as you rightly said – to keep to a timetable that is in the interests of the entire scientific community, as well as European industry, and to adopt this framework programme, the specific programmes and the rules for participation within the allotted time. Once again I should like – on behalf of the scientific community, essentially – to thank Parliament and all those who have made it possible for us to achieve something that you have rightly described as very positive, that is to adopt these rules in due time, so that we can prepare for 1 January 2003 in the best possible conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, however, it is the specific programmes that are at issue, and thus another important stage in the process, and here I should like to thank very warmly the rapporteurs for the five specific programmes, Mr van Velzen, Mrs Zorba, Mr Alyssandrakis, Mr Piétrasanta and Mr Schwaiger, for the quality of their work.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to thank the other members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, who may not have been rapporteurs but have taken part in this work and made useful contributions. I should also, for the benefit of Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, who issued an opinion on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture but who has now left the Chamber, like to make it clear that there was never any question of defining research on a sector-by-sector basis. We did not champion a particular sector – we focused on research – but we are not by any means indifferent to agriculture and it is evident in many areas. Very special attention is paid to it in an area that he did not mention, in the context of support to Community policies, where agriculture will play a very important role. Moreover, the multifunctionality of agriculture is included in its own right, as are aspects of sustainable rural development and support for biodiversity, which shows clearly that we are not concerned about genomics alone, but also about biodiversity, as a natural process, which may be of interest in many respects.</p>
<p class="contents">One very positive point is that the specific programmes have turned out to be absolutely consistent with the framework programme, which, as you know, has been finally approved by the Council and has now been officially in force since 3 June. In any case, the framework programme is only a basis. I note that the rapporteurs have done some very high-quality work and that even now the Commission can definitely accept a very large proportion of the amendments in their present form, in terms of both their principle and content.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, furthermore, to echo Mr van Velzen’s praise of the initiative that has been taken – which qualifies as historic – to table en bloc the amendments adopted en bloc at the May part-session, which, if adopted, will be incorporated into the text as described in the statements issued by the Commission and the Council when the framework programme was adopted. We have therefore complied fully with the agreement that we concluded and I think that this is an interesting and new element from an institutional and methodological point of view. As Mr Caudron rightly stressed, clearly when we work in a spirit of mutual trust in this field we are able to make progress more rapidly, and I too wished to underline this myself once more.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the amendments are useful clarifications and provide more detailed descriptions of the scientific content of the framework programme; of course, they must be taken into consideration. Sometimes, however, I have to say that the proposals go into too much detail and, although we can accept them in principle, in some cases it would be more appropriate to include these suggestions in the work programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the individual reports. Mr van Velzen’s report, which is very wide-ranging and covers the first and third aspects of the European Research Area, that is integrating and strengthening the European Research Area, is clearly very comprehensive and we can confirm even now that all of his amendments are to a very large extent acceptable. We can accept all of the amendments concerning the process of implementing the framework programme, as Mr Caudron also stressed: the transition from the fifth to the Sixth Framework Programme, the budgetary proposals, of course, which have been included, and the need for a flexible transition, where we have accepted your proposed form of wording. I believe that here Parliament is making an important contribution to a Commission position which – we have to admit – was rather too isolationist; Parliament has shown wisdom and understanding on this issue of the transition from one framework programme to another.</p>
<p class="contents">We will of course also have to ensure that the programme is implemented in an integrated way, and we will be sending Parliament some information in this regard, in particular on drawing up the work programmes. I hope that we will be able to continue to work together in the implementation phase, that we will be able to keep you informed on a regular basis about the various aspects and that you will obviously let us have your views and thoughts on any problems that may arise. We all agree that it will be necessary to evaluate the contribution made by the framework programme to establishing the European Research Area, and I would remind you that there will be an evaluation of the new instruments after two years. All of this is work that we can do together.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the priority of genomics and biotechnology for health is concerned, the Commission will of course take on board all of the amendments relating to research into cancer, of whatever form: genetic, clinical and others. In particular, as you also mentioned, translational research is a very important aspect, as are, of course, strategies for prevention. In the same way, we will not forget diabetes and the new opportunities opening up here, as Mr van Velzen has just stressed.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to Mr Liese, who tabled an amendment in plenary, that in my view, where palliative care is concerned, it is quite clear that this point can be taken into account in what we call the coordination of European policies, and in the support for research into diseases, which must in any case be approached holistically. There will not therefore be any problem with incorporating this idea that you expounded in plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I can assure you that the Commission will not be able to accept any of the amendments on life sciences that have just been tabled in plenary if they compromise the balance that we all worked together to achieve between genomics and non-genomics research in the Sixth Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the other thematic priorities are concerned, overall the Commission can accept all of the amendments, apart, however, from those which go into too much detail on the specific programmes, such as on food safety and quality. These are details and issues that do not fall within the scope of the specific programmes as described in the Sixth Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to an amendment that has just been tabled in the plenary, by Mr van Velzen I think, on space and satellites, we need to engage in a process of reflection and carry out research, but this must also be done in collaboration with the European Space Agency, which is moreover responsible for implementing space policy. Although I have sympathy for the substance of your proposal, we will have to adjust the wording to find a way to make collaboration possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally speaking, I can safely say that the entire contents of Mr van Velzen’s report are an accurate reflection of the wishes that we have all expressed, even though some points are obviously too detailed for us to take on board as they stand, but we are certainly on the same wavelength, a fact that I can only welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The same obviously goes for Mrs Zorba’s amendments. They are all acceptable and have even introduced an extra dimension into the reflection process by establishing a link with the notion of multidisciplinarity and by putting greater emphasis on researcher mobility. I also agree, Mrs Zorba, with the comments just made by your neighbour, Mrs Zrihen, on the notion of Europe, because Europe’s wealth lies mainly in its human resources – in its researchers – and we must capitalise on them by strengthening the link between the research process and the so-called Bologna process, so that we can establish a Europe of knowledge. This was, moreover, stated at the Barcelona Summit. Europe’s greatest challenge will be to maintain high-quality human resources, and I will be coming back to this when I address science and society and attracting young people into careers in research.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also, as you said, support for the creation of the European Higher Education Area. I think that this idea of science and education has a bearing on our debate on the rules for participation, which is obviously important, but we also think that we need to ensure complementarity with contrasting and similar actions within the thematic priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to Mr Purvis, who addressed a drafting problem in the text of an amendment tabled in plenary, which seeks to clarify the eligibility criteria for experienced researchers, I should like to say that we intended our text to mean four years of experience or a doctorate. The original wording is therefore unsatisfactory. We are now proposing a much simpler text, which reads, four years of experience or a doctorate, and is therefore along the same lines as the amendment that you are tabling in plenary. This is the crucial point, and I think that you were right to stress the fact that where we wrote ‘including’, this was not perhaps sufficiently clear and that it was therefore better to replace ‘including’ with ‘or’, which is much simpler. There you have a very precise answer to an amendment that is going to be put to the vote in plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, Mrs Zorba, we find it difficult to accept the amendment setting a fixed budget for international fellowships, because I think that fixing amounts in advance introduces a degree of inflexibility that is not entirely appropriate. We can assure you, however, that we will monitor the individual fellowships in the spirit of your amendment, because obviously they are one of the entry points into the framework programme. But we do not agree that we should start classifying all mobility actions in an excessively rigid way, because this would end up being damaging.</p>
<p class="contents">However, where your amendments on science and society are concerned, we fully agree with those which call for greater involvement of the general public and the stakeholders – such as patients’ organisations and environmental associations – in the science and society debate, and those which underline the important role played by teachers and the media in developing a better understanding of science. Nevertheless, we do not think that it would be appropriate to mention issues relating to science and society explicitly in the thematic priorities, because this is an area that cuts across the thematic priorities and covers science and society as a whole. We would therefore be downgrading it if we were to include it solely in the thematic priorities. Having said that, these are details compared with the general thinking behind your proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, and this is an important point, I note that Parliament has ensured that greater priority is given to ‘science and society’. We have to recognise that this is actually the first time that this subject has been addressed explicitly in a framework programme, and you have increased its budget, which is a good decision in my view.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to Mr Alyssandrakis's report and the additional comments made by Mrs Matikainen, I believe, Mr Alyssandrakis, that all of your amendments serve to clarify the Commission proposal. The Commission is willing to accept all of them, subject to some minor drafting changes, although this will not affect the general thinking behind them. This applies, for example, to all of the amendments concerning radiation protection, which is of course a major issue.</p>
<p class="contents">On nuclear fusion, we can take on board the majority of the amendments that advocate funding for the activities concerned, but we have to make it very clear that the ITER project is a new initiative. I believe that you and Mrs Matikainen are saying more or less the same thing, but the ITER project really does have to be seen as a next step and it is therefore essential that it also be included in the specific programme because it is one of the projects on which the future of nuclear fusion depends. This does not mean that basic research and research in general should not be pursued in areas other than implementing ITER, as you rightly stressed, for example on JET and other types of tokamak, such as the stellarator. But our objective has to be to make ITER our next step. Moreover, substantial progress has been made in international negotiations on ITER in recent weeks: today we have a proposal for at least three sites, two, maybe three, in Europe – Mr Vidal-Quadras will understand what I am getting at because Spain is doing marvellous work in this field – and one site in Japan. Negotiations are progressing well here and that is significant.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission fully recognises the importance of the management of radioactive waste. However, the amendments tabled tend to introduce deadlines that are too restrictive for the purposes of research. They cannot therefore be accepted in full, because we have to keep research into the management of radioactive waste fairly open-ended: there may not be just one solution, but several.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to Mr Piétrasanta’s report. We should like to thank you, Mr Piétrasanta, and through you the entire Parliament. We wish to thank you, as Mrs McNally mentioned, for taking such a keen interest in the Joint Research Centre and for ensuring that it is supported in the framework programme. It is very important for Parliament to realise that in the Joint Research Centre the European Union has an instrument at its disposal that can help to make certain political objectives a reality. It will be useful in helping us to establish the European Research Area by creating common bases of knowledge and measurements and also, as you stressed Mr Piétrasanta, by fostering links with national centres. This is an interesting point and you did well to highlight it.</p>
<p class="contents">While we are on the subject, I should like to inform you that the Commission intends to make a statement for the Council Minutes indicating that it welcomes Parliament’s intention to set up an ad-hoc group of Members, a kind of monitoring committee, to act as an interface with the Joint Research Centre. I think this idea was already in the Avignon report, but you were right to take it up again. From an institutional point of view, we will see that we make a statement to the Council and have it noted in the Minutes. This is a good idea and it enjoys parliamentary support.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider the amendments to be acceptable, including those that emphasise the priority that must be given to environmental issues, in particular the protection of ecosystems and food safety. You will be aware that the Joint Research Centre is considered to have some of the best expertise in Europe on traceability, for example of GMOs. It will therefore be an important tool in the run-up, in particular, to enlargement, when the Centre is opened up to new members: I will return to this point when I address Mr Schwaiger’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schwaiger, I should like to say how timely your amendments are; this comes as no surprise given that you are very familiar with the issues and that you insisted on visiting the JRC. We do not have any problems with them; quite the opposite. We think that your report puts forward additional arguments in favour of integrating the Joint Research Centre into European networks, and in particular networks of excellence, and we agree with the principles that you mentioned, both on ethics and openness.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make it clear, however, that the same goes for research into both efforts to harmonise nuclear safety criteria and the nuclear fuel cycle, which is vital. Here, recent events show that the nuclear fuel cycle needs to be subjected to ever more stringent controls, and the agreement on disarmament that has just been concluded by Russia and the United States assumes that Europe will also play a part in this discussion. I met officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna who asked us to pool some of our expertise with theirs, precisely so as to gain a better understanding of these dissemination issues. Your comment, Mr Schwaiger, could not therefore have been more pertinent and is highly topical. This therefore needs to be taken into account when considering the general issue of dispersion and non-dissemination, and Europe needs to make its contribution to the joint effort. Mrs De Palacio and I also support the technical aspects of your proposal. As you emphasised, the safety of some nuclear power stations, including those in Lithuania, gives huge cause for concern and the JRC has a degree of expertise and a training capability here that could be exploited.</p>
<p class="contents">There you have it: I think that I have now dealt with all of the reports and I should like, by way of a conclusion, to respond to some of the interventions made in the debate. I have already said to Mr Purvis that on the issue of the Marie Curie fellowships we will correct the text along the lines that you suggested. I would stress that you were right to say how important ‘science and society’ is for young people. How can we encourage young people to study science, a point also made by Mrs McNally? This is where we need the actions to converge. As you know, we have drafted a ‘science and society’ action plan. We will have to consider how to implement it and we can do so together.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Liese mentioned biofuels: his proposal is highly relevant and we can support his amendment. Besides, it is along the same lines as Mrs De Palacio's directive on the same issue. As I have already said, we can support the ideas on palliative care that you mentioned in the debate. Mr Souchet has left I think, but his question on nuclear energy is clearly a general one.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to address some more general issues related to the economy. Today, in adopting the framework programme and the specific programmes, I think that we have shown how essential research and innovation are to achieving the Lisbon objective of becoming the most dynamic economy in the world. With this in mind, I think that the July part-session, as Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy proposed yesterday, will obviously be very significant, because it is then that we will be in a position to make the Sixth Framework Programme a reality as part of the European Research Area.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I can tell you that the response to the calls for expressions of interest – a new initiative that we have just launched for the first time and that we issued to the scientific community and industry – has been startlingly successful, and has even been rather difficult to manage because we have received more than 15 000 expressions of interest. This shows that the European research community and the European Research Area are gathering momentum. The problem is that we risk being the victim of our own success and running into management difficulties. But 15 000 expressions of interest is quite something!</p>
<p class="contents">Success on this scale reflects the efforts we have all made – that you have made – to provide information and raise awareness. I think that this work has been very worthwhile because it points to the emergence of an awareness of and willingness to foster research and innovation in Europe. You are right about this and I should like to respond to a number of the points made about research and innovation, by Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, who stressed the issue of the link between research and innovation, and by Mr Rübig, who mentioned the problem of small and medium-sized enterprises. It is clear that we need to move into the implementation phase, and that we have to achieve our target of 15%, which is not always easy because doing so relies on providing information and raising awareness. In the implementation phase we will have to pay particular attention to the practical measures we can take to reach this objective. For an SME the difficulty lies in the costs and in saying this I am responding to Mrs Langenhagen's comment: I think that you are right to highlight this issue of guarantees for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to implementation, we are trying to ensure that the guarantees no longer constitute an additional source of fear or present additional difficulties for small and medium-sized enterprises. So much then for the issue of implementation, based on the rules for participation, of what we will call the admissible costs. This is what we have in mind at the moment, but the debate is ongoing because, as you know better than anybody, we are talking about public money and we cannot commit it any old how. The debate is underway though, and I hope to have the opportunity to discuss it with the Committee on Budgets and, of course, the Court of Auditors. In this way our proposal will be able to cater for this difficulty, while ensuring that we do not run any unacceptable risks.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mantovani, you also mentioned SMEs. This is an objective that we all share and I think it is important for us to launch an information campaign and reflect on the modalities. If you wish, I would be quite happy to have a meeting with you about this issue, to listen to your proposals and consider how we might best implement the SME strand; in any case they will benefit from over EUR 2 billion under the next framework programme, which is a very significant sum. We must also ensure, as you said, Mr Rübig, that our work complements that of the European Investment Bank, which is prepared to deploy additional resources in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we are going to try to create some momentum, given that in Barcelona we agreed on the objective of 3% of GDP. I should like to thank Mr van Velzen for having underlined once more that the future of Europe is at stake here, that we need to boost research and innovation in Europe, and that we need to do this together; this is what Parliament wanted. I remember that when the idea of the European Research Area was first floated, you insisted on the objective of 3% of GDP. We are going to achieve this, thanks to you, thanks to the scientific community, and thanks to the desire to make research and innovation a priority at European level. I should like to thank you in any case for your work and I hope that we will all have played our part in moving things forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
