<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hughes (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – Mr President, our ongoing work on working time goes back to the 1993 Directive, which excluded approximately six million workers in total, some 5 million of whom were working in the various transport sectors. Last year's overhaul of the directive brought all rail workers, non-mobile workers in the other transport sectors, offshore workers and doctors in training under the directive's scope. Furthermore, separate agreements have been reached in the maritime and aviation sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal on road transport thus seeks to close one of the last remaining gaps, but even so it will not cover all drivers. As it stands, it will only apply to workers covered by Regulation No 3820/85 and will therefore leave out a number of categories of workers, including workers driving vehicles of less than 3.5 tonnes, regular urban transport drivers, taxi drivers and drivers of vehicles carrying no more than nine passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 5, from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, seeks an early revision of the regulation in order to include these workers. Even more serious, however, is the possibility left open in the common position, namely that the self-employed might be permanently excluded from this directive. The original 1993 directive applies to employees, but this proposal has two legal bases: Article 137 covers occupational health and safety, while Article 71 covers operational safety. It therefore applies to the self-employed, and rightly so. We cannot exclude the self-employed. If it is dangerous to a driver's health and safety, and to road safety more generally, for an employed driver to work long hours, is it not just as dangerous for a self-employed worker? The answer to that, of course, is that it must be.</p>
<p class="contents">When a lorry fills your rear-view mirror, are you going to wonder whether that driver is employed and rested, or self-employed and potentially tired and dangerous? So inclusion of all drivers is important, both on occupational health and safety grounds and on operational safety grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is also a third important element: that of ensuring fair competition between the various modes of transport. The rail sector is currently covered by the 1993 directive, but road is not covered by anything approaching a similar regime. If we are serious about promoting a transfer of freight traffic from road to rail, with all of the environmental benefits that this can bring, then this too is a very important consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">My proposed compromise on this point is the same as the Commission's revised opinion following our first reading. In Amendment No 4, I propose an extra three-year transition for the self-employed, and then their automatic inclusion. However, even this poses difficulties. Even a temporary exclusion might open up the possibility of imaginative new forms of false self-employment and of collective arrangements being dismantled by unscrupulous employers. That is why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has also proposed a tighter definition of what a self-employed driver actually is in Amendment No 10. Those not meeting the criteria listed therein would be subject to the same rights and obligations under the directive as employees.</p>
<p class="contents">These are some of the important points in the proposal, but others include the definitions of working time and stand-by duty. The common position is so vague on these issues that there is little point in trying to limit working time on that basis. We have, therefore, proposed a return to the definition in the Commission's revised opinion in Amendment No 6. In Amendment No 15 we propose that the reference period for calculating the average 48-hour week be limited to arrangements set in place as a result of collective agreements. I proposed to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that a driver should receive prior notice of commencement of a period of availability 24 hours in advance. That did not get the support I would have liked in committee, and I would therefore recommend to the House that the compromise proposed by Mrs Lynne in Amendment No 24 of 12 hours' prior notice should be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">In Amendment No 14 I propose that night work be limited to 8 hours with a possible temporary extension to 10 hours, so long as the 8-hour average is achieved over a reference period to be agreed after consultation with the social partners. The human being is not a nocturnal animal and research demonstrates that the risks of accidents to health and safety are highest as a result of night work. Therefore, that is also an important point.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the key element is that of the inclusion of the self-employed. I hope transport ministers will be persuaded to agree to it, otherwise this whole package might be rejected. They would be to blame if that were to occur, and I hope we can work together to make sure that we put this piece of the jigsaw puzzle in place as soon as possible.</p>

I will not deny that there was a lengthy debate about specific points. The most important bone of contention in our group was the inclusion of the self-employed. The majority of the group supported that view, but even so, unlike the discussions at first reading, where the Commission and Parliament agreed that the self-employed should be included, the debate was much more difficult this time. However, the majority of the group was, as I said, in favour of including the self-employed. Why? Firstly because the self-employed, like any other workers, are obviously entitled to health and safety at work. Secondly, competition. It is not right for businesses, whether independent or working with employees, to compete with each other on working hours, as is the case with the Common Position of the Council and the Commission. A third reason – probably the matter on which the public is rightly most sensitive – is that many regrettable accidents occur, very often due to the fact that people have to work far too many hours and there is too little control. What is more, the control is made even more difficult by tachographs being tampered with. This has a human cost, whether to tourists travelling south or motorists forced off the road by a lorry driver who has fallen asleep at the wheel. I believe it is our duty to adopt a regulation on this at European level. That does not mean it is not still open to discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">The PPE-DE Group will not be supporting two of the points. Firstly, according to the text discussed in the Commission, employees are to be informed twelve hours or a specified number of hours beforehand and before the end of the previous shift of the start and length of their period of availability. We shall not be supporting that because we believe that the unpredictability of traffic flows makes it really too difficult to organise.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that according to Amendment No 8, employers should count the time a non-driving worker spends sitting next to the driver whilst the vehicle is in motion as working hours. We agree with the Commission that that should continue to be counted as a period of availability and not as working hours. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am going to take this opportunity to highlight the problem of independent workers, because I believe that the good intentions on the health and safety of mobile workers, which the Commission and the Council are boasting of, may have horrendous effects if obstacles continue to be placed in the way of including independent workers in the Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fact, ladies and gentlemen, and not an opinion, that the three basic principles put forward to justify the need for the Directive – the health and safety of workers, road safety and fair competition – are mere words if we exclude independent workers. It could even be said that the health and safety of the majority of workers in countries such as mine, who are self-employed, are not of the least concern to us if we exclude them from this Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has the opportunity to avoid responsibility for situations such as those which arise in my country, where more than 400 drivers lose their lives every year, without distinguishing between self-employed and salaried workers. This figure is increasing by 20% per year. Why are we only going to take account of the risk facing a minority of these drivers? ‘Are the self-employed not people?’, as Mrs Smet asked. Of course they are. Why forget about the majority? Do those drivers and citizens who use the roads not face identical risks?</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be serious. If we really want road safety and the health and safety of workers, it makes little difference whether they are self-employed or salaried. Independent workers are not another race. In fact, they have more work to do than the salaried workers. They have to look after their lorries, their businesses, they have to load and unload, adding these tasks to their maximum hours, while salaried workers deduct all of this from their maximum hours.</p>
<p class="contents">As if this argument were not enough, ladies and gentlemen, and if we want to consider the question of free competition, of fair competition, please bear in mind that salaried drivers are going to spend fewer hours driving, the lorries they drive are going to make shorter daily trips and they will arrive later at their destinations. How competitive are those companies going to be in comparison with those companies whose conditions are much tougher and much less economically burdensome? So our conclusion is that excluding self-employed workers is going to have horrendous effects for these workers and also for the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these reasons, we urge the Council to add to the effort that it has already made and include independent workers, if it truly – and this is not pure rhetoric – wishes to protect the health and safety of all drivers, increase road safety, promote fair competition at Community level and not destroy the sector. It should do so if it wants to protect jobs and companies and, if it wants, in summary, the directive that we deserve in the 21st Century. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, because they contain legislation which is not workable in practice and harms the competitiveness of self-employed drivers. Secondly, because compliance with the rules cannot be monitored or enforced. They are therefore unnecessary, and the liberal group is always opposed to such legislation. Thirdly, there is sufficient national legislation. Even the Common Position is giving this due consideration. And if there is any legislation required at all, then the majority of my group are satisfied with the common position. The transport sector consists of a few major businesses, and their employees must be given sound working conditions. It is in the interest of the internal market that a European framework be created for that purpose. But the transport sector also consists of many small, self-employed drivers. They are independent businesses with one or two lorries which service a vital segment of the market. They must be able to do their work, their businesses must be profitable and their services competitive, and they must not be bogged down by unnecessary red-tape and legislation. One of our major objections is therefore to the proposal that self-employed drivers will need to comply with this legislation in three years’ time. It would be preferable to see what the proposals bring and only then to consider whether self-employed drivers should adopt this framework or whether separate regulation is required.</p>
<p class="contents">As for night work, we agree on the times as described in national legislation, for they offer plenty of flexibility. However, the period of availability is creating problems for us. Here too, we would like to take a pragmatic approach. Drivers often face unforeseen hold-ups, as a result of which they need to have more frequent breaks to eat, for example. There are other reasons for long delays. If all that were to be included in working time, the driver would very soon reach the maximum limit, as a result of which productivity would decline unnecessarily. That has little to do with health and safety.</p>

Many overlook the fact that we are dealing with a road-transport sector which is highly fragmented and under pressure from shippers: there are many small businesses and a few large ones. Those large ones employ staff and the small ones do not.</p>
<p class="contents">Against the background of liberalisation and cabotage, we are dealing with an international issue which requires international solutions. The price competition is cut-throat, not only in the road-transport sector but also between the different modalities. That was mentioned a moment ago. This results in<span class="italic">, inter alia</span>, the subcontracting of both wheels (lorries) and drivers on a large scale.</p>
<p class="contents">This also leads to cowboy pricing, if I can refer to it that way. One might say – and this is not the first time I am saying this – that the sector is diseased up to a certain point. This also leads to a social rat race and to the evasion of social duties. It affects working times and working conditions and puts pressure on wages. The sector is repeatedly up to new tricks. That would not be the first one. We have already closed the Willy Betz loophole. We now have to face the fact that more drivers are becoming self-employed, and the pseudo self-employed in particular have a role to play.</p>
<p class="contents">This whole development is detrimental to the sector, the environment (for cheap transport generates more transport), safety and society. For that reason, we believe that this gap must be closed. We have already closed the Willy Betz loophole for Eastern European drivers by means of licensing. In this case, we will close the loopholes not only by involving the pseudo self-employed, but also the self-employed as far as driving times are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, we very much applaud the fact that everyone, both the employed and self-employed, must remain within those 48 hours. In addition, I believe the entire definition of pseudo self-employed to be of major strategic importance, and I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on this very sound approach. The codecision procedure requires our Parliament to form a united front during the negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has been a relatively long time coming.</p>
<p class="contents">Last time we discussed additional groups – at that time it was a question of doctors and a number of other groups – there was a similar discussion, but drivers were not included. It is very good that this category is now being covered. Our group also believes that it is obviously necessary to put employees and drivers on an equal footing. We are fairly sure that if this is not done, less scrupulous haulage companies will organise themselves in such a way as to be able to exploit technically self-employed drivers who are in fact a kind of employee. We do not want this sort of cheating in the industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group has tabled two amendments. We will support all of Mr Hughes’ proposals, but on one point we would like to proceed a little faster. We believe that the transposition period of three years is unnecessary. Firstly, the industry has known for a long time that changes would be introduced, so they have had time to adapt. Secondly, there is a point of view which has been under-emphasised, namely regard for other road-users. It can be said that the requirement for a transposition period is one way of taking the industry into account, but it certainly gives no regard to other road-users. Mr Hughes also admitted that the new regulations might lead to considerable problems, even with a transposition period. We therefore believe that it is as well to bite the bullet and implement the provisions without a transposition period. This is particularly important with regard to regulations on working time concerning night work and other activities which may represent a danger to road safety.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the proposal as it stands, with Amendments 25 and 26 at the end, requiring the transposition period to be removed from the proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we would like to comment on the proposal regarding the definite inclusion of the self-employed.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that it would be appropriate to include the self-employed in the new directive from the start. The Council's caution on the matter is quite understandable, but we nevertheless feel that instructing the Commission to assess, subsequently and with no time restriction, the consequences of excluding the self-employed today, would serve merely to postpone the realisation that it is necessary to include them.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, it is not just the issue of second drivers which needs to be addressed more exhaustively – it is, moreover, dealt with in Member States' national contract legislation – but above all that of self-employed drivers, including those who have only one vehicle or, in any case, consistently drive one of the vehicles they possess.</p>
<p class="contents">There are various different causes which have a bearing on the matter. Often, when a self-employed driver purchases a vehicle, he is bound to pay for it in somewhat burdensome instalments. In order to meet the payments, he is forced to increase his workload. Another contributing cause is the just-in-time method which companies, having usually reduced their storage capacities, adopt in order to maintain continuous production, a method, that is, which requires them to produce a continual, regular supply of materials to be worked upon. Often, the combination of these two causes leads self-employed workers to neglect their health, not to take sufficient rest periods for their safety and, consequently, to create the conditions for potential harm to their or others' safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from anything else, definitively regulating the working hours of self-employed drivers as well is certainly a way of consolidating conditions of fair competition over the entire sector on Community territory and, at the same time, increasing the necessary safety measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sure that is true. But I am sure she would also agree that there is a significant minority who take a completely opposite view. This morning I chaired a press conference here on the subject of burdens on business. I was joined on the platform by colleagues from Austria, Finland and Sweden – Members from other countries would have come if they could have – who much shared the views which I will now share with the House.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the publication of the Hughes report, I have been personally bombarded with complaints from the UK Removers' Association, the Confederation of Passenger Transport, the Road Haulage Association, the Freight Transport Association and the International Road Transport Union, as well as small local haulage companies and self-employed lorry drivers. They are united in their horror at amendments that would put UK operators out of business, and in their amazement that these proposals are coming from a UK MEP.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no evidence that self-employed lorry drivers, who rely on their own health and, on the safety of their vehicles for their day-to-day business existence, are in need of more EU legislation to make them more safe. There is no evidence that Member States, when they agreed the common position, were unmindful of their health and safety responsibilities. There is no requirement on Parliament to tighten up this legislation now.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur's amendments would lead to lower earnings for professional drivers, increase road congestion and pollution and raise transport costs. Given that UK hauliers are already paying the highest fuel taxes in the world, these proposals would be the last straw for many in the UK road haulage industry. They also show no understanding of the needs of the industry, or its employees. These last three sentences are not my words. They are the words of the UK Road Haulage Association. UK Conservative MEPs will be rejecting all the Hughes amendments. We shall not be alone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is hardly a sector in which this is more pertinent than the transport sector. I should like to reiterate the objective of this directive. Article 1 states that the purpose of the directive is to provide better protection for the safety and health of drivers, improve road safety and bring about more harmonised conditions of competition. I think that the common position does not do this justice; in fact, it even contains a number of inherent contradictions. Our rapporteur has made proposals which make a sensible contribution to transport policy and environmental policy over and above this.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to raise three points on which we disagree with the Council. The most important point – as already mentioned – is to include self-employed drivers. You are wrong, Mr Bushill-Matthews, to say that self-employed drivers and haulage companies are all opposed to Stephen Hughes’ proposal. A whole series of companies has readily recognised that the competition will be ruinous if self-employed drivers are not included. Allow me to reiterate the consequences: if the one-third of the 3.5 million truck drivers who are self-employed are excluded, we shall see thousands of drivers turned into unwilling, bogus self-employed drivers overnight. I cannot believe that they will agree to this.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point on which we disagree is night work: we should remember that most serious accidents on European roads are caused not by technical faults but by overtired drivers, which is why we think that eight hours is long enough at the wheel.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns standby duty, i.e. the time during which drivers must be ready to take up work. We think that flexible working times should be in the interest of both sides, i.e. the employer or haulier and the employee, which is why we feel that a day's notice is a sensible solution. However, Mrs Smet, this calls for intelligent logistics. We cannot simply allow the current method, the current practice of shifting stock on to the road at the expense of the truck drivers' standby duty, to continue. We need a reasonable, new, practical solution and I think that is precisely what Stephen Hughes gives us in his report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that we have to have a level playing field for hauliers across the EU, because they travel across borders all the time. We are very concerned that some hauliers will be able to undercut their counterparts from other Member States if we do not pass this directive. Consequently, it is also important that we include self-employed workers. I know that my colleague said that the ELDR Group was against including self-employed workers, but in actual fact we were rather split on this and a sizeable minority of us actually believe that self-employed workers should be included. I believe that they should be included for several reasons, but the main one is again that they can undercut the other hauliers, and this will have tremendous health and safety implications. I am also afraid that some of the more unscrupulous employers will make those hauliers self-employed just to get round this legislation. That will lead to not only more deaths on the road, but to health problems for the hauliers themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to also draw attention to the need that Stephen Hughes talked about of giving drivers an appropriate length of time before they take out a load. I know that Mr Hughes was talking about a 24 hour period. I put forward the compromise amendment of 12 hours' notice before the load was taken out and am very pleased that he has agreed to that amendment. It is only right that hauliers should be allowed some time to sleep, particularly before going on long journeys.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely hope we are going to vote for this directive and include self-employed workers. It is a step in the right direction towards providing health and safety not only for the hauliers, but for other road users as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have received many letters expressing a degree of alarm about the possible consequences of this proposal. For example, a haulage company in Arran, not the most remote of Scotland's islands, pointed out that many hours are spent on ferries to and from the mainland. This is an issue which may adversely affect tourist travel to, as well as from, areas like Scotland. A coach operator in Glasgow is of the view that if the Hughes proposals are fully implemented, mainland European coach operators may regard Scotland as a destination too far. In the case of Scotland's Western and Northern Isles, two or three ferry crossings may be required before reaching Scotland's mainland, often landing in areas very remote from the ultimate destination.</p>
<p class="contents">The report's conclusion also refers to achieving a level playing field with other transport sectors already covered. The reality, though, in much of rural and island Scotland is that no alternative to road transport exists. Indeed, a former Shetland Islands MEP was fond of pointing out that the nearest mainline railway station to Shetland is in fact Bergen.</p>
<p class="contents">Scotland's road transport sector is already being penalised financially by the UK government through punitive taxation on fuel. Some aspects of this working time proposal potentially threaten the already fragile viability of road transport. Therefore I cannot fully support the more restrictive proposals in this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been a very difficult task and, excuse the pun, a difficult road for him to travel down. The overall aim of the report is to raise awareness with regard to health and safety and to prevent unfair competition.</p>
<p class="contents">In his report, Stephen has mentioned his concerns with regard to the common position; I share some of those concerns. There are areas that are open to improvement. However, I also expressed concerns with regard to some of the amendments adopted by the committee and to some of the stances taken within the committee. As already mentioned by some of my colleagues and, in particular, my Scottish colleague, peripheral areas of Europe would be more adversely affected than others by these restrictions. For instance, in Ireland 98% of what is manufactured is transported by road. We have a fast growing economy. It depends on a flexible and innovative transport industry. The principle was clearly established in 1993 that directives are to avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal restrictions which would affect these kind of undertakings. We must try to reduce the number of vehicles on our roads, but there is no guarantee that this directive would do that. In fact, according to information available from studies carried out by the Irish road hauliers' association it would increase the number of vehicles on the road and would neither reduce congestion nor lessen environmental damage.</p>
<p class="contents">The working time directive as proposed by the Council could result in higher costs for companies. Some of the amendments put forward by the rapporteur, such as Amendment No 6, are too prescriptive, while others such as Amendment No 14, are too restrictive. Amendment No 17 would impose additional obligations on Member States and would be difficult to implement. In Amendment No 19 there is a call for harmonisation of penalties. This is not something we should agree with. This matter should be left to the Member States because otherwise, as has already been seen, there would be differences in implementation of the penalties.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, under Recital 14 certain conditions with regard to the average working week are not being implemented. What we are seeking is decreased administrative burdens, a more balanced proposal and fairness for all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Neither is it easy to achieve the general objective of organising working time for people who carry out professional mobile road transport activities, because it is necessary to take account of the health and safety of drivers, as well as road safety and, therefore, collective safety. And because another objective must be to prevent unfair competition. I believe that the Directive must include self-employed workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 31 of the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights says, ‘Every worker has the right to working conditions which respect his or her health, safety and dignity’. And self-employed are workers in every sense of the definition. And the second paragraph of this Article says, ‘Every worker has the right to limitation of maximum working hours, to daily and weekly rest periods and to an annual period of paid leave’.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the text, in the terms in which it provides for inclusion, is intended to achieve both the elimination of unfair competition and the granting of a prudent time limit for the self-employed to adapt to the new situation and to ensure their protection. At the same time, the prudence of the time limit is not going to encourage companies to dismantle themselves and resort to pseudo self-employment.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, I believe that the recommendation must guide us and contribute to creating a more just and transparent society, where it is difficult for unfair competition to take place, and where due attention is paid to the health, safety and dignity of workers whether they be self-employed or salaried. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a tribute to his political skill. Apart from alcohol, I think fatigue is probably the biggest killer on our roads and it is also true to say that if I were employed as a truck driver, I would not want my job undermined by a self-employed driver who would be willing to work 18 hours a day. Nor, if I was a self-employed driver and wanted to strike a fair balance between my working life and my family life, would I want someone undermining my position by being able to work 18 hours a day.</p>
<p class="contents">It is pointless to argue that a self-employed driver might be less fatigued than an employed driver. From my own personal experience, the reverse is in fact true. A self-employed driver has many more tasks to carry out and is more likely to be fatigued when first taking the wheel, never mind having worked 10 or 12 hours in the day, so I would strongly support this report and welcome the compromises that Stephen Hughes has reached. It is also important to tighten up the definition of "self-employed". We have seen too much abuse of this loose definition of "self-employed" in other areas of work.</p>
<p class="contents">Our responsibility is to find a balance between the needs of employed and self-employed drivers and the community at large, so as to ensure that the latter can go about its business safely. They look to us to provide and guarantee safety and to ensure that employed and self-employed drivers are protected by the law from being driven into bad health and, perhaps, an early death from overwork. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The area of application of the directive is the most essential question in this whole matter. The compromise achieved in the Council leaves self-employed hauliers outside the scope of the directive. In my opinion Parliament should also approve this compromise. Self-employed hauliers must not be subjected to artificial regulations limiting their total working hours. This would lead to an increase in bureaucracy and make it more difficult for small businesses to operate. It would also interfere with self-employed people’s use of their free time in a way which would be impossible to monitor. The issue has no bearing on road safety because the driving time of independent self-employed hauliers is already regulated under other rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to mention the further limitation of working hours in terms of night work. This would increase traffic jams, weaken road safety and increase costs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur proposes a transitional period of three years for the automatic inclusion of self-employed workers in the scope of this directive, which is a sensible and balanced approach and which warrants our support. The common position adopted by the Council, which excludes self-employed drivers and does not even guarantee that they will be covered by the organisation of working time that it is claiming to be instituting, would have the following consequences: it would put the objectives of the common transport policy at risk, it would not promote road safety and greater equality in conditions of competition and would deny adequate protection for the health and safety of persons whose occupation is the performance of mobile road-transport activities.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal therefore represents an acceptable balance between the economic aspects, road safety and workers’ health. The truth is that, if adopted, it will contribute not only to reducing the level of road accidents associated with excessive working hours, but also to establishing more healthy competition between self-employed drivers and employed drivers, which will enable us to combat the phenomenon of the pseudo self-employed, which discredits the rules of fair competition in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the maximum working time at night, especially bearing in mind the situation of peripheral Member States such as Portugal, the solution adopted by the Council is more appropriate, which stipulates ten hours in every twenty-four hours. Drivers in these Member States are forced to make longer journeys to reach the major centres of production and consumption. The only way in which we can reduce driving time is by making use of the night, when the traffic is less intense. Reducing the driving time to eight hours would, therefore, unjustifiably increase the competitive disadvantage that drivers from these countries face in relation to hauliers from the more centrally located Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that his amendments are largely based on, and are in line with, the Commission proposals, except for the two which Mrs Smet mentioned a moment ago. But I should also like to thank the Commissioner in particular for the courage she has shown in bringing this common position about, for that was a very complicated task. Many governments were opposed to it, and the fact that we are here at all is thanks to her tenacity. In that respect, she has achieved more than her predecessor. I hope we will bear this in mind when we deal with other matters too.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to thank Mrs Sanders-ten Holte. She has given a truly brilliant, nineteenth-century, liberal account, which would not look out of place as an annexe to Dickens’ Christmas Carol. I believe that his novel was also about whether one should work on Christmas Day. This is now given fresh relevance.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is important that a common position has been reached. It is also vital for us to negotiate on a few points in the common position which are inadequate, particularly the issue of the self-employed. In my view, we have not found the ultimate solution, but we are at least opening up the path for negotiations. Those who claim that we should adopt the common position without question are disempowering this Parliament. Surely they can understand that. Those who claim that current legislation is good enough, should read up on the accidents, especially accidents involving buses. Anyone opposed to those amendments should, next time there is a major accident involving a bus, be very aware of the damage they cause with such opinions to the effect that absolutely nothing should be done on this score. It is not acceptable that this rather dangerous sector should be the only sector to be excluded from the Working Times Directive. That is the reason for my group to at least support sound amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As perhaps the first visionary of our present concept of a liberal and peaceful Europe, he coined the following expression about 200 years ago in his widely acclaimed treatise "Christendom or Europe": "Everything is good, but not necessarily all the time, not necessarily everywhere and not necessarily for all of the people." He was quite right. This insight is something we come up against almost every day in the European decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">Extended to self-employed drivers, the directive regulating the working time of persons occupied in mobile road-transport activities under discussion today is a perfectly typical example. From the point of view of small and medium-sized enterprises, and especially self-employed drivers, this directive, with its limit values on average, accurately-defined maximum working times, minimum breaks and rest periods and its provisions on night work, is an example of politics exerting an inadmissible and unnecessary influence on working times for which these drivers alone are responsible. From their point of view, it is even a compelling, authoritarian obstacle which stands in contradiction to the principles of a market economy and should therefore be rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">However, social and competition policy and road safety experts take a different view. When it comes to more and more frequent shock headlines such as: "Tired truck driver ploughs into carefully parked broken down car" and the need to avoid bogus self-employment and the unfair competition which it engenders, this directive is long overdue.</p>
<p class="contents">Improved health protection and safety in the workplace for employees in the road haulage industry also deserves a mention. For me, as an ardent supporter of a social market economy, my motto is: people first, the economy second. So I would recommend that we tighten up the common position in the interests of everyone, including those of us who use the roads as pedestrians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As you know, this directive has a special significance for me. In fact, at the end of 1998 the Commission presented its first proposal aimed at introducing common rules applicable to all professional drivers and, since then, this Directive has followed a complicated and tortuous path and has been in deadlock within the Council throughout that time.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2000, a modification of the general directive on the organisation of certain aspects of working time was adopted, Directive 93/104/EC, in order to incorporate mobile and non-mobile workers in the transport sector. However, it should be pointed out that despite this modification mobile workers are only covered in a series of areas, in particular the average weekly 48 working hours, annual holidays, health controls of nocturnal workers and the guarantee of sufficient rest time. For this reason, to maintain and defend the proposed directive under discussion still makes total sense.</p>
<p class="contents">Having realised how difficult it was for work to progress in the Council and out of concern to take a step forward, although it was not the ideal step, at the end of 2000 I presented an amended proposal for a directive which, as you know, provided for the automatic inclusion in the long term, specifically after 3 years, of self-employed drivers.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with what has been said here, since the Directorate-General for Energy and Transport is concerned with regulating the activity time of drivers outside driving time, for safety reasons. A driver’s degree of tiredness does not depend on whether he is self-employed or on a salary. Please have no doubt that that is my position. Therefore, knowing the difficulties, I proposed a text to the Council and Parliament in which that aspect was modified, with a three-year transition period for the incorporation of self-employed drivers, but with that incorporation taking place automatically.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no need to remind you of the long discussions in Council, which ended with a common position on a compromise accepted by all the States, all the delegations present, and which, of course, I myself accept on behalf of the Commission. In this respect, I would like to say that I believe that, while not perfect, it is a step forward. It should be pointed out that, in the arguments of the delegation of the different countries of the European Union, of the ministers, there is one factor which is true and that it is the considerable difficulty of genuinely controlling self-employed drivers. And, although self-employed drivers are excluded, it is a step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a compromise which I have accepted, although I do not like it, and I would like to make this very clear. Ladies and gentlemen, you must understand that I am always faithful to my commitments and I will therefore honour this one. I will not be able to support a series of amendments that you are proposing, although I would like to because I fully agree with them, but I have a commitment to the Council. This does not mean that, when the conciliation takes place, as I believe it will<span class="bold"> </span>– because I doubt that the Council will reach a compromise leading to the automatic inclusion of self-employed workers, as I think it should – I will not use all my resources to try to find a solution to unblock the situation which is no doubt going to come about now.</p>
<p class="contents">I will refer to a series of amendments, which will be listed specifically tomorrow, which I cannot accept at the moment, although I agree with their content. I can accept Amendments Nos 7, 11, 14 and 16, which include ideas which appeared in the modified proposed Directive and do not exactly form part of the compromise agreed in the Council and which I believe improve the overall content of the Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we have been able to see that Amendments Nos 9 and 12 provide the texts with greater clarity and that Nos 18 and 22 offer, in principle, better protection, although we will perhaps have to consider modifying the specific wording, but in terms of their content, we will not be able to accept them.</p>
<p class="contents">I will say the same for Amendments Nos 3, 5, 8, 12, 15, 17 and 19, which cannot be accepted because they either risk coming into conflict with the existing rules in Regulations No 3820/85 or No 3821/85, or Directive 88/599, or there may be a risk of encountering difficulties in their implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that the concepts of working time and driving time are two different notions, regulated by two different legal instruments. In this respect, there is one amendment in particular, Amendment No 23, which involves a disproportionate administrative burden and which I cannot accept. As Mr Hughes said at the beginning of his speech, as well as various other speakers, the essential thing is the inclusion of self-employed workers, which, according to the proposal I produced at the time, would take place automatically. I believe that, from the point of view of the internal logic of the Regulation, it is based on the fact that tiredness is a safety risk, and therefore, as the person in charge of the Directorate-General for Energy and Transport I presented a proposal of this nature, because otherwise it would be simply an issue for the Commissioner responsible for Social Affairs and not for me. I am doing so for safety reasons; although I fully share this concern, I have a commitment to the Council which I must respect, but you know that you can rely on me to try to seek solutions during the conciliation debates, the final result of which I hope will be as positive as we all wish. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
