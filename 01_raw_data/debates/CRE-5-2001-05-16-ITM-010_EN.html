<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Common organisation of the market in the sugar sector</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 30 June the current sugar scheme will either have to be extended or changed. Last year the cost of overproduction in the sugar sector amounted to EUR 800 million, almost as much as the sum made available for dealing with the BSE crisis. Despite strong criticism of the current scheme by the Court of Auditors and the negative effects on consumers and third-world producers, the Council appears very unwilling to make changes to the sugar scheme as proposed by the Commission. There is a threat that a number of EU Member States may give in to the short-sighted approach based on self­interest taken by the sugar industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council intend to back the Commission proposal, given the strong criticism of the current sugar scheme by the Court of Auditors and the negative effects on consumers and third-world producers? If not, why is the Council advocating maintaining a sugar scheme which has been strongly criticised by the Court of Auditors and which has negative effects on consumers and third-world producers? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As this House is aware, Parliament made its declaration on this matter on 13 March 2001. In looking at this declaration, I can say that it is generally <span class="italic">not</span> along the lines suggested by the honourable Member. I would also point out that the Commission has stated that it may approve an extension of the current organisation of the sugar markets beyond 1 July 2003 on condition that all the other parts of its reform proposal are approved by the Council.</p>

<p class="contents">The Council will continue addressing the issue at its meeting in May and will look at all contributions, including those presented in the question which has just been put to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Council adopted a regulation on 26 February 2001 on the “Everything but Arms” initiative to extend duty and quota free access to all products except arms and ammunition originating in a large number of least-developed countries.

In effect we are subsidising the sugar industry – last year to the tune of over EUR 800 million – as if there were not enough sugar in the world and as if we were eager for these subsidies to help our farmers survive. I really think that the policy we are pursuing with regard to the developing countries is and continues to be hypocritical. A splendid initiative like “Everything but Arms” is actually tainted by the fact that we maintain our hypocritical attitude and prefer to continue doing what suits us, by supporting the sugar producers, who traditionally belong to the castes of our nineteenth-century industrialists. I note that we have once again made an exception. I hope that the Council will continue to exert pressure for unanimity for reforms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Despite earlier Council decisions that the preparatory talks held prior to Ecofin meetings between ministers from the 12 euro countries would be completely informal and that only euro-related issues would be discussed, the signs are increasing that such talks are becoming formalised to resemble a 'euro Council' and, in practice, by taking preliminary decisions on a range of Ecofin issues, are taking over real power from ECOFIN. Belgium, in particular, has put forward proposals for 'developing' the informal euro Council. In view of this situation, what steps will the Council take to put an end to all attempts contrary to the Treaty to formalise a 'euro Council' and gradually transfer Ecofin's powers to such a Council? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In some ways it is positive if it is saying that the Eurogroup does not make any decisions at all.</p>
<p class="contents">My first supplementary question is this: is it really the case that no real decisions are made in the Eurogroup, or is it the case that decisions have already been taken by the time the matter reaches Ecofin, which simply goes along with whatever has actually been decided in the Eurogroup?</p>
<p class="contents">My second question concerns the future. The Presidency is aware that proposals have come from a number of sides, not least from Belgium, to develop the informal “Euro Council” and add more functions. Mr Danielsson confirmed that the Eurogroup has started to take on additional functions and address more issues.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question is therefore: can we be absolutely sure that the Eurogroup will not actually take over more and more real power in the future?</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital for the countries not in the euro to be able to remain outside the euro area without losing power over matters directly concerning the euro. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We were worried that we would end up with a situation in which – as Mr Gahrton was suggesting – decisions would be taken in a room to which we had no access. As such, we would receive a <span class="italic">‘fait accompli’</span> which we would just have to process in the Ecofin Council.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I can honestly say that things have not turned out that way. A great deal of respect has been shown for the principles set out in the decision I quoted from Luxembourg, i.e. the European Council Resolution of December 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there is need for discussion in the circle of ministers of finance who share the single currency, but no real decisions are taken in this circle. The position of the Ecofin Council has been respected, with great unity shown on the principles of this matter. Can we be absolutely sure about what will happen in the future? As someone once said, it is difficult to predict, particularly about the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I think there is every reason to believe that the members of the Council will continue to feel solidarity on the principles laid down in the European Council’s previous decisions, i.e. that the Ecofin Council’s position will be preserved.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that some representatives have expressed a personal opinion that the position of the European Council should be expanded is a matter for them. We are trying to assess how things have worked in practice, and we believe we can say without hesitation that the position of the Ecofin Council has been respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 3 by Yasmine Boudjenah (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0329_EN.html">H-0329/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Western Sahara</span></p>
<p class="contents">The UN has decided to extend the presence of MINURSO in Western Sahara by two months in spite of the fact that the settlement plan signed between Morocco and the Polisario Front is not yet fully applicable. On the contrary, the threat of renewed armed conflict between the two parties is now greater than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, several indicators point to the fact that Morocco is seeking to rearm, such as the announcement that it is purchasing American or French fighter planes by investing part of the money obtained under the recent agreement between Vivendi and Maroc Telecom (US $ 3.5 bn).</p>
<p class="contents">The British press has also recently revealed that Morocco benefited from trade agreements with the UK, thus enabling it to acquire more arms and renew its military capability: Mirage fighters, and spare parts which may already have permitted the manufacture of 56 field guns. These weapons are now deployed at the border, along the so-called ‘defence wall’. If confirmed, this transaction would be illegal since Community legislation – the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports – prohibits the sale of arms to countries or areas where there is a conflict situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Council confirm this information ? Does it propose to intervene with the Member State in question? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Contrary to what is suggested in the question, there is no Community legislation on arms export. Therefore, the question cannot arise of whether or not a particular transaction is legal in accordance with Community Law. The Code of Conduct to which the honourable Member refers was drawn up on 8 June 1998 and is based on common criteria for conventional weapons transfers. According to the operative provisions of the Code of Conduct, each EU Member State will assess export licence applications for military equipment made to it on a case-by-case basis against the provisions of the Code of Conduct.</p>
<p class="contents">As such, decisions on whether an export licence should be granted are made by each individual Member State, and it is not up to the Council to decide on such individual transactions. According to the Code, every year Member States must exchange information on their arms exports in the Council, allowing a joint review of how well the Code is operating. This annual review is presented in an annual report in accordance with Operative Provision No 8.</p>
<p class="contents">The general political stance of the Council with regard to the conflict in Western Sahara is to fully support the United Nations and the UN Secretary General’s personal envoy James Baker in their work on finding a solution to the conflict. The Council is convinced that the UN process constitutes the best framework for a rapid, lasting and mutually agreed solution which would also increase stability in the whole region.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that every solution must be acceptable to all parties and based on complete respect for fundamental democratic principles and human rights. In line with this political aim, the Council is willing to contribute to the process and help to create a climate of trust between the parties concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, at the end of last year the EU submitted a proposal to the parties concerned for a number of humanitarian and trust-building measures. The EU is maintaining close contact with James Baker and is looking into how best to support the UN’s initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasise that the EU is the largest provider of humanitarian aid to the Western Sahara refugees, giving aid of EUR 20 million over the next three years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Amongst these criteria I would highlight the idea of banning the sale of arms to countries or regions that are involved in conflict. This matter is so serious that now, in the United Kingdom, MPs have obtained the right to vet arms sales from their country to anywhere the world. This move has created quite a stir in that country, even though the decision is not retroactive and British MPs cannot take action on this matter of arms sales to the Western Sahara.</p>
<p class="contents">I would nevertheless put my question once again: do you not think that there may be ‘sanction’-type measures that the European Union could take when this code of conduct is breached? Furthermore, what concerns me the most is that this affair appears to demonstrate Morocco’s desire to rearm itself. Deplorably, it also demonstrates the support that the country is receiving within Europe. This can only heighten the already tense atmosphere in the region. Although the situation in this 25-year-old conflict is currently deadlocked, largely as a result of Morocco blocking the validation of the electoral lists established by MINURSO (United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara), there is a risk of armed hostilities flaring up overnight. Can I ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether the Swedish Presidency plans to issue a statement on the matter before the end of June? I am thinking back to the German Presidency, which made a specific statement on Western Sahara. Given this background, why does the European Union not officially recognise the Polisario Front as a negotiating partner in this conflict, something that the United Nations did 25 years ago? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Visa requirement for Colombian citizens entering the EU</span></p>
<p class="contents">A sizeable group of Colombian intellectuals, headed by the Nobel Prize wining novelist, Gabriel Garcá Márquez, have expressed their anger at the Council's decision to demand entrance visas for Colombian citizens entering the EU. They have gone so far as to state that until this decision is amended, they will not even travel to Spain, a country with which they have the closest of linguistic and cultural ties, but whose government did not oppose the Council's decision. 187 Spanish intellectuals have expressed their solidarity with the position of their Colombian colleagues. In view of the alarm and rejection provoked by the Council's decision, is the Council aware of the feelings of the group of intellectuals headed by García Márquez? Does it sincerely believe that the visa requirement is a useful way of tackling crimes perpetrated by Colombian nationals? Will it be contacting the Colombian Nobel Prize winner in order to acquaint itself with his arguments, and will it then be minded to correct its ill-advised decision, as many members of the public, including myself, are demanding it should? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Council would also like to point out that Parliament confirmed the Commission’s proposal on this issue on two separate occasions, in its declaration of 5 July 2000 and in its second declaration made as recently as 1 March this year. The Council adopted the ensuing regulation with a qualified majority on 15 March, and it entered into force on 10 April, i.e. just over a month ago. The Council cannot therefore understand Mr Carnero González’ view that the decision was wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">The system as it is set up was devised with full consideration for openness and transparency, as Member States should inform the other Member States and the Commission of what measures they are taking in accordance with this regulation.

I do not need to be reminded of European Union procedures for adopting decisions of this kind. I think we are all familiar with them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s decision to include Colombia in the list of countries whose citizens require visas to enter European Union countries is not simply useless in the fight against the organised crime some Colombian citizens might be involved in. It also forces ordinary citizens to bear the additional cost of obtaining a visa.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, this decision clouds relations between the European Union and Colombia unnecessarily. In addition to myself, many Colombian intellectuals, led by none other than Mr García Márquez, have stated how close Colombia is to us. It has come to my notice, for instance, that Mr García Márquez did not travel to Spain to take part in the recent celebrations marking the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the newspaper <span class="italic">El País</span>. This was to comply with the undertaking given by those intellectuals who stated that they would not travel to the Union, at least, not to Spain, until this rule is withdrawn.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Report by Christa Klaß, MEP, on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 24 October 2000, Parliament adopted by a large majority a report (<a href="/doceo/document/A-5-2000-0195_EN.html">A5-0195/2000</a>, C5-0090/2000) on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine.</p>
<p class="contents">What stage has been reached in the further consideration of this document in the Council? Why has the Council not yet completed its consideration of this directive? When will the directive be placed on the Council's agenda for final consideration and forwarded to the Member States for implementation?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposal and Parliament's report on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine create greater legal certainty for the economic partners concerned in these areas which are so important for wine-growing in the EU. Clear rules on cultivation, authorisation, registration and checks should simplify trade and establish a clear legal basis therefor. It is incomprehensible that, five months later, the Council has still not reached a decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The final decision has been delayed because some Member States have asked for more time to consider the provisions on genetically modified organisms, despite the fact that these provisions are no different from Community legislation in force and are equivalent to those recently adopted in accordance with the Community directives on the marketing of seed and forest reproductive material.</p>
<p class="contents">Adopting the directive was on the agenda at the Agriculture European Council in November of last year. It was postponed until December and then until January of this year, as no agreement had been reached on the provisions concerning genetically modified organisms.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Swedish Presidency aims to reach agreement on the Council supporting and adopting the new legislation before the end of the Swedish Presidency, i.e. by June of this year at the latest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This part is also very important to economic operators and economic partners in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, according to my information, the plan was to wait until the release directive, i.e. Directive 90/220, had been adopted. This directive has now been through conciliation, i.e. it has been adopted. I therefore see no reason to delay this any further. This directive says nothing about definitive licensing.

<p class="contents">I want to emphasise that the consultation procedure being introduced through Article 5 into the new Act is only advisory. If we talk about the situation in Sweden, the fact that, in order to be able to make a correct assessment of damage, Swedish authorities may need to consult the institutions when applying the rules concerning foreign secrecy is not in itself anything new.

It is perhaps even more relevant in a Swedish Parliament than in this illustrious European Parliament. I have a lot of confidence in the Swedish authorities’ ability to make independent assessments of such issues. I think the risk of self-censorship is very slight.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me just to emphasise that, in the Council’s view, the system we have had up until now regarding public access to documents is subordinate to the rules on which this Parliament has adopted a position and which it has actively helped to devise. We now have an Act covering all documents, and last year’s Solana decision, as it is known, is no longer valid. We have compulsory registers. We have a requirement for rapid assessments to be made of whether or not documents can be released. We have clearly defined provisions governing secrecy etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks in large part to this Parliament, the EU’s institutions will therefore acquire much better and clearer rules governing transparency and accessibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">During his recent visit to Skopje, capital of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), the High Representative for the CFSP, Mr Xavier Solana, stated that it would be a mistake for the government of FYROM to negotiate with the terrorists (of the KLA). He also added that the FYROM leadership had the support of the EU as there was no place in the Union for those who resort to violent means. In the light of this categorical statement, will the Council say why this position of principle does not also apply to Turkey, which used violent means in 1974, in breach of international law, to seize 40% of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus, which it has since held under occupation in defiance of UN resolutions? Is the Council unaware that the country in question, which has recently been declared a candidate for accession to the EU, uses violent means to prevent the Kurdish minority from exercising its personal and civil rights, uses excessive force against prisoners, imprisons journalists and, in general, exercises the power of the State by violent means, violating all human rights charters, a fact which has also been established on numerous occasions by the International Court of Human Rights? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is perhaps most clearly apparent from the Council’s decision, adopted on 8 March 2001, concerning partnership in connection with Turkey’s accession.</p>
<p class="contents">A considerable number of the priorities and objectives in the accession partnership have to do precisely with human rights. Regarding the issue of Cyprus, this Act repeated what was said at the European Council in Helsinki in December 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the accession partnership and of Turkey’s national programme for adopting the rules, the European Union will now concentrate on ensuring that Turkey really implements these priorities. An Association Council is planned for 26 June 2001, when the issue of implementation will be addressed. The Commission has given notice that another in the series of reports on Turkey and the other applicant States will be published in November of this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should also like the Council to tell me if it knows about the following new provocation on the part of this country, by which I mean Turkey. First, the allegedly pacifist, europhile foreign minister, Mr Cem, threatened that if Cyprus was accepted as a full member of the Union, his country's reaction would know no bounds. In other words, he threatens all and sundry. Secondly, the Turkish air force has repeatedly and frequently violated Greek air space, forcing the Greek air force into dangerous interceptions. Thirdly, the International Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg found last week that Turkey was blatantly violating the human rights of Greek Cypriots from the part of Cyprus occupied by the Turkish military.

<p class="contents">The Council noted the decisions on principle that have been taken to incorporate the appropriate tasks of the Western European Union into the Petersberg tasks. These included setting up a satellite centre and an institute for security studies in the form of bodies into which suitable parts of the current, parallel WEU structures would be incorporated.</p>
<p class="contents">The Swedish Presidency was called upon to join with the Secretary General of the Council in continuing the work on this issue in the Council (General Affairs).</p>
<p class="contents">A draft Community measure on the establishment of a satellite centre for the European Union is in the process of being discussed right now by the Council bodies. The Swedish Presidency aims to have it adopted by the Council before the end of June. A satellite centre is of the greatest importance for increasing early warning and crisis monitoring capability within the framework of the common foreign and security policy, especially the European security and defence policy. The centre must have a constitution and structure which will enable it to respond flexibly to the demands of the European Union and its Member States and to carry out its tasks in close cooperation with existing institutions within the Community at national and international levels. The staff and infrastructure of this centre should come, to begin with, from the WEU’s satellite centre. The precise arrangements for this have not yet been determined. The recently established satellite centre, which is to be located in Torrejón de Ardoz in Spain, will begin its activities on 1 January 2002. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council scarcely needs to remind you that the European Community and its Member States have played, and continue to play, a very active role in the international negotiations on climate change. In its conclusions, the Council has time after time confirmed it commitment to reaching an agreement at the next and Sixth Conference of the Parties to safeguarding the Kyoto Protocol’s environmental integrity and to creating conditions for its ratification and entry into force by 2002 at the latest. It certainly does not need to be repeated that the Council sticks by both its policy on climate change and these commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council in Stockholm in March 2001 again confirmed its strong commitment to the Kyoto Protocol as the basis for the international work on reducing emissions. The European Council called upon all the negotiating partners to contribute constructively to reaching an agreement on the more specific conditions for implementing the Kyoto Protocol and facilitating a successful result.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council still stands by its belief in the Kyoto Protocol and the Kyoto process.</p>
<p class="contents">Extensive consultation with other parties has been carried out by the troika, which has met the Canadians, the Iranians – who currently hold the Presidency of the Group of 77 – the Russians, the Chinese and the Japanese in order to garner support for the Kyoto process and for the efforts made by the President of the Conference of the Parties, the Dutch Minister for the Environment, Mr Pronk. Further bilateral negotiations on the same theme will, of course, take place before the second round of the Sixth Conference of the Parties in Bonn this summer. The European Union has also made known its commitment to proceeding further with the preparations for ratification by no later than 2002, even if the United States decides not to participate. The EU’s direct strategy, therefore, involves securing sufficient support for the continued success of the Kyoto process, in spite of the United States’s current position.</p>
<p class="contents">Through a number of high-level representatives, including the Swedish Minister for the Environment, Mr Larsson, and the Commissioner for the Environment, Mrs Wallström, the European Union has also lost no time in making its attitude clear to the new administration in Washington.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important objective right now is to get the United States involved in the Kyoto process again. The EU emphasises that the climate issue is an important part of the transatlantic relationship and calls upon the United States to make a constructive contribution to this process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Remembrance of the Holocaust</span></p>
<p class="contents">Following up the Swedish Prime Minister Göran Persson's initiative in arranging the well-received Stockholm International Forum on the Holocaust in January 2000, Parliament adopted a written declaration on 7 July 2000 on the remembrance of the Holocaust. In that declaration, Parliament calls on the Council and the Commission to strengthen their efforts to promote education, remembrance and research about the Holocaust, to encourage the study of the Holocaust in all its dimensions, to encourage appropriate forms of Holocaust remembrance, including an annual European Day of Holocaust Remembrance, and to take all the necessary steps to facilitate the opening of archives to ensure that all documents bearing on the Holocaust are available to researchers.</p>

On the issue of establishing an annual European Day of Holocaust Remembrance, the Council would simply point out that it has not received any practical proposals in this area. Those Member States which are involved in the international working party to promote remembrance, education and research in connection with the Holocaust have followed the recommendations of the committee of government representatives and representatives of voluntary organisations, to the effect that annual days of Holocaust remembrance should be established on a unilateral and national basis. This has happened in, for example, Germany, Sweden, Great Britain and Italy. As from next year, Finland too will have such a national day.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council would emphasise that what history, including the Holocaust, can teach us is that it is necessary here and now actively to combat racism and xenophobia in all its forms. In this context, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia in Vienna will have an important role to play, especially when it comes to cross-border efforts. It may also be noted that, on 28 May, the Council and representatives of Member State governments will adopt a declaration concerning the fight against racism and xenophobia on the Internet. It is, unfortunately, a sad fact that new technology is exploited by anti-democratic forces.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of the further efforts being made to disseminate knowledge concerning the Holocaust so that it will be possible, for example, to draw conclusions about the ways in which contemporary intolerance is to be combated, an international conference was held in January of this year in Stockholm on the very subject of the fight against intolerance. Representatives from all the EU’s Member States, the Commission and the OSCE, together with the Secretary-General of the UN, met to discuss strategies for combating racism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me also to conclude by saying that the Council really appreciates the European Parliament’s commitment in this area. I would say a special thank-you to Mr Sacrédeus himself for his work on the important position adopted by Parliament in July of last year on this subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Parliament’s decision following the written declaration in remembrance of the Holocaust – a direct follow-up to Prime Minister Persson’s initiative in arranging a conference in Stockholm on this subject in January 2000 – indicates that we should like to see the Member States establish national days of remembrance or, better still, a European Day of Remembrance.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out that – as current President of the EU and, at the same time, the person who took the initiative to arrange this conference – Prime Minister Persson has a unique opportunity and a special authority for getting even more countries than those which Mr Danielsson has just mentioned to establish annual days of remembrance and perhaps to agree upon a common day of remembrance.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the work that is being done on combating racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism. My practical follow-up question is this: is the Prime Minister prepared, during the time that remains of the Swedish Presidency, to bring to life – if only on an informal basis – the possibility of an annual day of remembrance of the Holocaust in different countries? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has also been discussed in detail in the Council. One conclusion drawn is that there are unfortunately many historical events of the 20th century in which atrocities have been carried out. That applies, unfortunately, not only to the Holocaust which we have just been talking about but also to other events which there will be a desire to remember and use as a point of departure in the fight against intolerance and xenophobia.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore arrived at the view that it is probably most appropriate to let the issue of a national day of remembrance be purely a <span class="italic">national</span> issue and to inspire national authorities to take decisions to establish such days. It might perhaps be better to refrain from recommending a specific day, for example 27 January, as a European day of remembrance. There are so many other dates. For example, there is Crystal Night, which is important to remember in many countries, and we have the days around the end of the war in 1945, which can also be important days to remember. We therefore believe that the best course is to inspire national decisions rather than try to put forward proposals to be decided upon at European level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In December 2000, the EU Council of Ministers for Fisheries set the TACs and quotas for Northern hake for 2001 providing for a greater reduction in the allowable catch (45%) in sub-area VIII (Bay of Biscay) than in the more northern sub-areas (58.9%) without any justification based on scientific management advice, given that for the purposes of monitoring and scientific assessment, this resource has since the late 70s been considered to form a single stock which is not divided into regional components. What criteria did the Council use to justify this distinction?</p>
<p class="contents">Given that there is no scientific evidence to show that the stock consists of different components rather than constituting a single fish population occupying a vast area of the sea, is the Council aware that the subjective political criteria used have resulted in significant discrimination against some fleets in the Community ?

<p class="contents">In the light of scientific opinions from the ICES, recommending that lowest possible catches be adhered to and that a recovery plan be implemented for the stock in question, the Council has laid down the Total Allowable Catch for hake at 22 623 tonnes, compared with 42 090 tonnes during 2000. The Commission had proposed a TAC of only 11 000 tonnes for 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">The Total Allowable Catch for hake is divided up into four administrative areas. According to the scientific information to which the Commission had access, the situation regarding hake in Divisions VII a, b, d and e was worse than in the three more northerly areas, which is why a proportionately greater reduction in the TAC was made there.</p>

The negotiators meet almost every month with a view to concluding the negotiations this year. Much has been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Algeria has already given its preliminary approval to the following human rights wording: ‘Respect for the democratic principles and fundamental human rights established by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights inspires the domestic and external policies of Algeria and constitutes an essential element of this Agreement.’ This broad reference covers human rights for all human beings, irrespective of gender, as well as all areas of civil and political, as well as social, economic and cultural rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Another provision in the draft gives each of the contracting parties the right to take suitable measures if it considers that the other party has omitted to fulfil an obligation under the Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">In the ongoing negotiations, agreement has also been reached concerning two important matters affecting the situation of women. Special emphasis is to be placed on giving the female section of the population access to education, including technical education, higher education and vocational education; and – within the framework of social cooperation – priority is to be given, through education and the media, to promoting women’s role in the process of economic and social development, concurrently with Algerian policy on the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Concluding an Association Agreement will facilitate and institutionalise the political dialogue with Algeria, including on issues affecting human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Andrews’s question, the Council shares his concern about the murders which have taken place in Algeria over the last ten years. Through the Swedish Foreign Minister, the Presidency addressed the issue at the meeting for political dialogue between the European Union and Algeria which took place in Algeria on 24 April. We expressed our concern about disappearances, arbitrary arrests and torture. Moreover, a list of such cases was passed to the Algerian authorities, and we requested information about these cases.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has also expressed its concern along the same lines at the annual meeting with the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of MEDA’s technical and financial aid to Algeria, the EU supports a project for modernising the police force. The programme includes training in respect for human rights in the course of police interventions. EUR 8.2 million have been set aside for this purpose. The European Union is also providing aid to selected institutions with a view to strengthening civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">Once the Association Agreement with Algeria that I have just mentioned has been concluded, the political dialogue with Algeria will be institutionalised. We shall then have a framework within which we can express our concern about, and criticisms of, Algeria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are many other groups which also need to be mentioned. As an example, I can assure you that, with this general wording as a basis, the Swedish Foreign Minister, who is a woman, made clear references to precisely this need to draw attention to the position of women in Algeria.</p>
<p class="contents">That is repeated the whole time in the dialogue with Algeria, and we shall be able to repeat it still more powerfully once we obtain an Association Agreement. The Agreement will give us a framework which will make it possible to address all the problems related to human rights. I believe we have precisely the same view of the necessity for improving the position of women in Algeria. I also believe that we have precisely the same view on the need to ensure that Algeria does not only respect women’s rights, but all human rights.

It is all very well to have human rights agreements signed, but the reality is that no matter what efforts have been made in Algeria over the years by the Council and by the European Union, the situation, like in Turkey, has got worse instead of better. I want to ask him: Is it the intention of the Council to agree to the final statement on the association agreement when it arises in October or November?

<p class="contents">An Association Agreement exists because the European Union desires a framework, a form within which, for example, a political dialogue can be conducted – also concerning matters about which there is no agreement. That is why we want Association Agreements. The Council believes that this is a more effective instrument than just letting things happen.</p>
<p class="contents">As the case of Turkey shows, the Association Agreement is an effective instrument enabling the European Union to highlight and criticise states of affairs it does not accept.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Danielsson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> This is an important issue that the honourable Member has addressed. I shall therefore give a relatively long answer, in spite of the lateness of the hour.</p>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Member is aware, what is known as the ‘Everything but arms’ Regulation was adopted by the Council on 26 February 2001, when freedom from duty, without any quantitative restrictions, was extended to include all products, except for weapons and ammunition, originating in the world’s 49 least developed countries. The Regulation came into force on 5 May 2001. We think that this measure forms a significant contribution to the economic development of the least developed countries and that it is also concrete proof of the European Union’s political goodwill towards the developing countries in connection with the preparations for the next round of the WTO negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Regulation was the result of intensive discussions in the Council, where full account was taken of the consequence analysis prepared by the Commission and of the Member States’ need for assurances concerning the more detailed provisions for implementing the proposed system. These assurances related not only to the Member States’ interests, but also to the consequences of the proposal for those ACP states that are <span class="italic">not</span> among the least developed countries, as well as to the desire to guarantee that the least developed countries themselves, rather than third parties, benefit from the new system.</p>
<p class="contents">The doubts related mainly to three particularly sensitive products: bananas, rice and sugar. The final text took account of these doubts, while the main principle, according to which the EU should adopt meaningful measures to improve the economic situation in the least developed countries, was maintained. When it came to bananas, rice and sugar, implementation was therefore deferred until such time as agreement had been reached on the principle of access without duties and quotas. Where bananas were concerned, complete liberalisation was postponed until 2006. In the meantime, annual 20 per cent reductions in duty would be introduced as from January 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the problems of infrastructure that would-be banana exporters in the least developed countries at present encounter, it is difficult at this stage to assess with certainty what direct effect the Regulation will have on the banana market. As has been mentioned previously, adjustments have been made to the Regulation so that account might be taken of the misgivings experienced in this regard in the European Union and the banana-producing ACP countries that do not belong to the group of least developed countries. Moreover, the Commission has undertaken to monitor the application of the Regulation in order to discover and deal with all the difficulties as soon as possible. The Commission will investigate to what extent the least developed countries are benefiting from the Regulation, whether the available tools are sufficient for tackling – where justified – more serious disturbances in Community markets and when it is a question of bringing the adjustment mechanisms into play, especially for rice, sugar and bananas. In the light of this investigation, the Commission will present a report in 2005 and table the necessary proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Member certainly knows, the Council is fully aware of its ACP partners’ problems when it comes to the operation of the banana market and is doing its utmost to take account of these misgivings in <span class="italic">all</span> relevant initiatives. In connection with the Cotonou Agreement, the EU acknowledged the overwhelming economic importance of exports to the EU for banana suppliers in the ACP countries and agreed, if need be, to take measures to guarantee the continued profitability of banana-exporting companies in the ACP countries and continued opportunities to sell their bananas in the EU market. When the Council acts in order to meet the need to alter the organisation of the banana market so that it complies fully with the WTO’s rules, the attempt will therefore also be made to introduce guarantees to prevent ACP bananas from being excluded from the market.</p>
<p class="contents">On this point, I also want to mention the agreement in principle reached immediately before Easter between the Commission and the United States regarding the protracted dispute between the EU and the United States concerning the trade discipline for bananas. In very general terms, those parts of the agreement concerning ACP suppliers are designed to protect the latter’s position by guaranteeing more reliable and more favourable conditions for the ACP states’ access to the EU market. Of special importance in this regard is the proposed introduction of a quota, exclusively reserved for ACP suppliers, and of an historic licence system which is seen to benefit the ACP suppliers more than the previous ‘first come, first served’ proposal. In this connection, I would also remind you that, when, in 2006, the EC’s organisation of the market in bananas becomes a duties-only system, a reduced duty will, in any case, give the ACP states a relative advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Commission’s proposal, the Council will have to submit formal points of view regarding certain details of the agreement in principle with the United States. Parliament’s views will, of course, be sought regarding each possible change to the Council Regulation on the common organisation of the market in bananas.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would remind you of the Council Regulation establishing, from 1 January 1999, a special aid scheme for ACP states that are traditional banana suppliers. This system offers technical and financial aid to help ACP suppliers adjust to new market conditions and increase their competitiveness, at the same time as encouraging environmentally more friendly production and marketing methods. The financial and technical aid supplied in accordance with this Regulation amounted to almost EUR 45 million in 2000. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to ask him whether as from 1 January 2006, pursuant to the new banana regime, the only protection offered to Community banana producers and ACP countries which are also included will be the tariff.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community has just given up the tariff. Consequently, no protection of this sort will be available after 1 January 2006. I anticipate that the beneficiaries of this measure will be the large multinationals. If I were in charge of a multinational company, I would relocate the plantations from Central America, Ecuador or any other country to one of those least developed countries. The reason would be that thanks to this agreement I would be assured that as from 1 January 2006 there would be no restriction on the import of bananas.</p>
<p class="contents">My question to the President-in-Office of the Council concerns whether consideration has been given to the implications of all this both for Community producers, some of whom live in very underdeveloped areas of the Community, and for producers in other ACP countries who do not enjoy a particularly high standard of living either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
