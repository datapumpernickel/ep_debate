<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, I am sorry that Mr Nicholson cannot be here himself today. Now that I have read out that text, I would like to move on to my own comments.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, we are today debating the report by the honourable Member Mr Nicholson, whom I would like to thank for his swift and accurate work. He was working under great time pressure. Nevertheless, we have not let ourselves be influenced by the urgency of the Council's timetable, and we are very pleased that we are able to give this subject rather more attention today.</p>
<p class="contents">Cod stocks and their condition have long since overtaken negotiations on the TAC and quotas and our hard work in that area, but unfortunately in a purely negative way. That should give us politicians, and indeed everyone involved, food for thought. Although the price of cod and other fish will rise, at the same time fishermen will have problems making a living and providing for their families in the long term. The future of an important and historical sector of the economy in our coastal regions is increasingly at risk. The fishing bans do not now only apply to the specific area covered by the report but have also been extended to large areas of the North Sea. Stocks have suffered a further drastic fall in all areas. On a positive note I would like to say that under your leadership, Commissioner, the Commission has reacted swiftly and consistently without waiting for regulations or proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now our job to oversee these measures and to jointly learn lessons from this for our future policy. The Member States are, of course, particularly prominent on the list of those responsible. But we keep coming back to the same question: why did things have to get to this stage? Must it always take such horrendous news to stir us into action? When will we finally incorporate sustainability into our fisheries policy?</p>
<p class="contents">The storm warnings for the Irish Sea were not just issued yesterday, nor did they apply to the Irish Sea alone. Our present predicament demands that we should work together in the interests of consumers, fishermen and fish stocks. Are we, despite all the Commission's efforts, giving the fishermen affected enough opportunities to put forward their own ideas about resource management and market stabilisation? Are we working together closely enough at all levels to ensure that the most recent economic developments are promptly reflected in our policy? If we do not at long last collaborate closely, the next crisis could be fatal for us. For example, the renewed debate on dioxins is deeply worrying. At the end of the day, we need to be proactive instead of reactive. When will we learn that lesson? How many sectors of the economy still have to give credence to this because of our catatonic state? I particularly have in mind the chaotic BSE situation. It is even more important than ever – and this applies across the board – for us to anticipate predictable developments and have the courage to take the wind out of our critics' sails. And that means using not just words, but also deeds.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal before us is a step in the right direction. In particular, I welcome the flexible approach towards establishing a closed area and the pragmatic use of derogations. This approach demonstrates that attention really is being paid to the interests of fishermen, by not actually imposing a total fishing ban but instead, where possible, by allowing other fishing to continue, with appropriate monitoring of course. But at the same time I wish to stress that this is only <span class="italic">one</span> step in the right direction. Similar problems await us in other waters, and even if they have not manifested themselves so clearly to date, the Irish Sea should be a warning for us all. There is still a great deal to do. I call on the Council and the Commission, as a matter of urgency, to develop further measures under the fisheries policy, not least so that our actions will really have an impact in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Langenhagen has painted a very bleak picture of the state of cod in the Irish Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish Sea, as Mrs Langenhagen has said, is an example to us all of how a stock, if not managed correctly, can be decimated. In just six years the amount of cod caught in the Irish Sea has halved. In 1993, 11 000 tonnes of cod was caught and in 1999, 5 500 tonnes were caught. This regulation for 2001 is necessary, however painful, if there is to be a cod fisheries at all in the Irish Sea. It is an example to other areas as well. A similar situation has arisen in the North Sea. The cod stocks have declined so much that there has been a reduction of half in the total allowable catch and a new cod recovery programme introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Vast stretches of the North Sea have been protected whilst the spawning season gets under way. However, another consequence of the ban in cod fisheries over the next few months has been that the other areas where there is no ban are beginning to worry. For example, in the Western Isles fishermen are concerned that because of the cod ban in the North Sea – and to some extent in the Irish Sea – cod stocks off the Butt of Lewis and south of Barra will be adversely effected. After years of sustainable fisheries in these waters people fear that the adverse effect of these protective measures will be a decimation of their own stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">These fears can only be compounded when just last week in Mallaig, with the opening of the scallop beds, a dramatic increase in boats could be witnessed, which would otherwise have been fishing for the banned species. We have to think about the adverse effects on other fisheries when protective measures are introduced. It is somewhat ironic that in protecting fish stocks in one area we are inadvertently destroying stocks in another area.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the reform of the common fisheries policy and the launch of the Green Paper in March are critical to stock preservation and to the fishing industry. We have to get the balance right between sustainability and a successful industry on the other hand. The reform of the common fisheries policy, I believe, is an opportunity. We must make sure that we get the reforms right.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hudghton (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, in his report on the Irish Sea fishery Mr Nicholson recognises that this area has the dubious honour of pioneering the use of emergency measures to arrest the decline in cod stocks. But in the North Sea, too, we are subject to emergency measures this year, necessary measures aimed at maximum protection of cod during the spawning period between now and the end of April.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is it then that, after so many years of a common fisheries policy whose principal intention is to conserve stocks, we have to resort to emergency measures in the Irish and North Sea cod areas? While accepting the need for these short-term measures, we must also learn from past mistakes and prepare sensible long-term management proposals to try to deal with these situations. The technical measures which have been pioneered in areas like Scotland must be built on and improved and extended to all areas of fishery. Appropriate action must be taken to prevent the displacement of effort leading to damage in other areas and to other stocks. The impact of industrial fishery must be properly assessed, in terms both of its allowable white fish by-catch, and of its effect on the whole marine food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly a significant downturn in fishing activity can be expected in the next few years, and clearly with that significant downturn in activity will come a significant downturn in the income of many families and many communities in our fishing areas, both in the catching sector and in processing. Just as the economic and social effects of the lack of a new agreement with Morocco have been felt in very particular areas, so the effects of these emergency measures in the long-term cod recovery plans will have an effect in very particular areas. There is a case for looking at similar financial compensation measures for these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The CFP review provides a challenge and an opportunity. I hope that the solution we come up with will be one that actually works. The best means of doing that is to make sure that the new fisheries policy includes significant and adequate involvement of stakeholders – of fishermen, processors, scientists and conservationists from particular areas such as the North Sea, so that we can work together to recommend proposals for management which are tailored to and targeted towards the needs of these particular areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People cannot live there but we make ever more intensive use of it. Not just to travel from one continent to another, but also to drill for oil, to extract other minerals, to dump waste and to generate electricity using tidal power stations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mercury, lead and radioactive waste are reducing sea-life and making fish ever less fit for human consumption. Shallow coastal regions, river mouths and other transitions between fresh and salt water, where fish used to have their spawning grounds, have been greatly altered as a result of human interference. The sea has long been regarded as the source of an inexhaustible food supply. It is being fished with ever larger vessels and with ever more refined technology to clear out the sea. This is being done in the seas bordering Europe, but to an increasing extent further away as well, by European ships along the African coast.</p>
<p class="contents">I have previously taken a stance by rejecting agreements which the European Union enters into with countries in the developing world in order to be able to go and fish the sea there until it, too, is exhausted. In the short term, it is true, this will provide a solution to the European food requirement and in exchange we will also pay something to poor countries for it. In the long term, however, it is definitely not a win-win situation from which we all stand to gain.</p>
<p class="contents">The demand for fish continues to grow while the supply continues to decline as a result of overfishing and pollution. There are still fishermen who believe that the sea remains inexhaustible. Last week I heard a fisherman who was being interviewed on Dutch television say, “The fish will always be there, that has always been the case and it says so in the Bible as well”.</p>
<p class="contents">These sorts of certainties, which appeared to be true for centuries, will increasingly vanish in the future. That is why it is good that times and areas are designated in which the fish stock has to reach a certain level and when and where fishing is prohibited as a result. For the same reason, the fishing quotas must be restricted.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur recognises that the supply of cod in the fishing ports on the east coast of the Irish and North Sea has declined dramatically in the last ten years. The quantity currently permitted is less than a fifth of that at the beginning of the nineties. The actual catches, which are smaller than those permitted, fell to a quarter. That is how exhausted the sea is.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of this, the rapporteur wants to extend the exclusion period in which the catch is less restricted, by six weeks between 22 February and 30 April and he criticises the large area of sea to be closed off to fishing during the spawning season. Groups of fishermen protest if they get the impression that governmental measures are unilaterally to the disadvantage of their country while their colleagues from other countries are allowed to carry on clearing out the sea. Then pressure arises to mitigate measures and to permit more exclusions. In this way, attention is at risk of being diverted from the necessity of fishing quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">Owing to the short-term disadvantages, everyone expresses outrage and opposition to fishing quotas. But we would be better advised to close more areas completely for a prolonged period than to let the fish die out completely as a result of inadequate measures. This is currently under discussion with regard to the North Sea as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Dam (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the survival of cod is seriously endangered in various European waters. The Commission is rightly introducing measures which should protect this species of fish from extinction. But like the emergency measure which the Commission has announced for the North Sea, its measure for the Irish Sea is also half-hearted. The Commission's measures are chiefly based on political feasibility and lack the necessary scientific basis.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the emergency measure for the North Sea, a measure which particularly affects the Dutch fishing fleet was opted for. Politically it is feasible, the fact is that things are going well for the Dutch fleet and other Member States and fleets appear to hate this. That is why the Dutch protest and the alternatives put forward do not win approval anywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Closure of an area does not have a sufficient effect on the recovery of the cod. Neither in the North Sea nor in the Irish Sea. The fact is that fishing will move to open areas where spawning may be taking place and young cod may be present. If fishing moves to areas where concentrations of young fish are present, then the measure itself will hamper the recovery of the cod. In addition, it is striking that the North Sea emergency measure does not prohibit targeted fishing of cod with stationary nets, in which precisely those fish ready for spawning are caught, within the twelve-mile zone and within the plaice box. As a result of greater fishing pressure in open areas, stocks of other species of fish and seabed ecosystems will also be damaged.</p>
<p class="contents">The alternative measure that has been put forward by the Dutch State Secretary for Fisheries, on the other hand, offers cod a much better chance of survival. This plan, a suspension of all cod-related fleets for a substantial number of weeks per year, can still save the cod. And at least as important, this plan is supported both by maritime biologists and the maritime sector. However, the Commission does not consider the policy to be feasible. Its emergency measure may result in our only finding cod in one kind of European water soon, that is to say in formalin.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, Mr Nicholson is adopting the half-hearted stance of the Commission in his report. Of course, the blow to the fishing industry is great, but the blow will be much greater if there are no more cod left soon. The Commission must examine how it can accommodate the fishermen financially, undoubtedly the fishermen will have to make sacrifices. In order to provide for the future, Dutch fishermen are willing to do so and I am convinced that the Northern Irish fishermen possess the same willingness. That just leaves the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My problems began this morning at a very early point when my flight from Belfast to London was cancelled. Thanks to British Midland International and the good work of their staff, I got here rather late, but still I am here. I apologise, as I did not intend to be discourteous to the House.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened with tremendous interest to Mr van Dam talking about half-baked approaches by the Commission and how well the Dutch fishermen were responding. Mr van Dam should go back and read my report because I neither criticised the Commission nor the fishermen. This is not an easy problem. It is a very serious problem. To some extent the fishermen in my region faced this problem last year. For them, this is the second year of closure.</p>
<p class="contents">I should tell Mr van Dam and the Scottish fishermen, who are now facing the first year of closure and are creating a lot of waves, that the fishermen from my region not only took this in their stride but actually responded in a very positive way. They cooperated with the Commission in the technical measures and were prepared to look very sincerely at them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not easy for fishermen to take on board a closure of their area for such an extensive period. It is even more difficult when there are no support mechanisms to help the industry find a way forward. This is what I want to concentrate on. When I raise the problem of the Commission coming forward with concrete proposals – be it set-aside or support mechanisms – the Commission says: " let the national authorities come forward with ideas and we will take them on board in a very positive way." But the problem is that the national authorities will not come forward with any sincere proposals to help the fishermen in the region. Certainly not the United Kingdom authorities – and it does not really matter whether it is a Conservative or Labour Government. Neither of them would ever come forward with any positive support to help the fishermen.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one amendment to my report and I ask the Commissioner to take it on board. It is to allow the fishermen, under the supervision already agreed at the early part of the closure, to continue right through that closure. If at any time the discards exceed part of that closure, then the fishermen will quite readily accept. At this moment, the Commission has set its face against accepting this amendment. This is unfortunate because the cooperation that is being given by the fishermen to the Commission is a shining example to other parts of the European Union. As Mr van Dam said, there is a tremendous problem, there is tremendous concern and we have to ensure the future of cod for the future of fishermen. I hope the Commission will be able to take on board the very positive aspect that I have put forward in my amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The very fact that the Commission has found it necessary to implement emergency measures in four separate areas to save exhausted fish stocks, serves to illustrate the total failure of the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As of today, 12 February 2001, more that 40 000 square miles of the North Sea will be closed for 12 weeks to all white fish trawling. In addition, there will be emergency closures covering the West of Scotland, the Irish Sea, as we have heard, and North Atlantic hake and all of this comes on top of the savage cuts in total allowable catches and quotas announced by the Council last December.</p>
<p class="contents">The common fisheries policy in its current form has been operating for 18 years. The system of tax and quotas has led to massive quantities of healthy fish being dumped dead back into the sea. Over two million tonnes of fish a year, 25% of the total fish catch in the EU, are discarded in this manner. The system of MAGPs has also been a disaster. Member States who attempt to observe these rules are punished while other Member States ignore the MAGPs entirely. So, the CFP has failed in its core objectives. It has failed to sustain fish stocks and it has failed to secure a future for our fishermen. This latest round of cuts and emergency measures will again drive hundreds more out of the industry. The cod recovery measures in the Irish Sea last year cost the Irish Sea fleet a devastating drop in income of 42% during the closed season.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this appalling crisis, despite the fact that there are too many fishermen chasing too few fish around the North Sea and the Irish Sea, this House voted overwhelmingly at its last part-session in January to do away with 6 and 12-mile limits around our shores, to open equal access to the North Sea and to break into the Shetland and Irish boxes.</p>
<p class="contents">These decisions will be regarded by many fishermen in the UK and Ireland as the last straw. Sixty-five per cent of the entire fishing resources of the EU are to be found in the waters surrounding the British Isles, that is the UK and Ireland. Why should we sit back and allow our fish to be plundered and allow our fishermen to be impoverished?</p>
<p class="contents">It was extremely foolish and short-sighted of this House to vote the way it did on the reports last month. It may well prove to be the last straw that breaks the camel's back and may drive the UK out of the common fisheries policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Socialist Group supports the conclusions of Mr Nicholson, in his report, in relation to the Commission proposal for the recovery of cod stocks in the Irish Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">We understand very well that the over-fishing of a species for one year is paid for over the following years and that the recovery of stocks is very costly and slow. However, we also understand that the inactivity of a section of a fleet over a long period means the loss of jobs and markets and many difficulties for the future of that fleet. I therefore agree with Mr Nicholson that this is an issue which requires a great deal of balance and consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">The sector often complains – with good reason – that it is ignored when proposals are adopted by the Commission, since these are almost exclusively based on scientific reports which do not take account of the experience and everyday lives of the fishermen.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commission to combine this everyday reality experienced by the fishermen with the work of the scientists and, when formulating proposals, to take greater account of the socio-economic situation of the regions which depend on fishing. All of this should be done with the greatest transparency, clearly explaining to the sector the reasons for which particular measures are adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that the common fisheries policy is a failure. In this respect I completely disagree with the Member who spoke before me. I believe that, in the same way that the reform of the common agricultural policy is only possible through a redefinition of the rural world, the reform of the CFP also has to be very ambitious and develop in parallel with the reform of the fishing world, of those regions which depend on fishing, which will surely have to face the future by bringing other approaches into play, which are different to those which they have been employing up till now and which depend exclusively on an extractive model. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I appreciate his very open and honest attitude to this. He has not gone back and told fishermen around the Irish Sea that the European Commission is trying to persecute them or to do them an injustice. He has put the problem to the public at home the way he has put it here. A problem exists.</p>
<p class="contents">Our colleague over in the far corner of the House spoke earlier and quoted the Bible. The Bible, someone said, tells us that there will always be fish in the sea. Well, I want to quote a more up-to-date document about the codfish. I am quoting the author Mark Kurlansky in his book 'Cod: A Biography of the Fish that changed the World'. According to Kurlansky, the Encyclopaedia of Commerce and Navigation printed in New York in 1858 said that the codfish was a species so well-known that there was no need to explain anything about it, that it was extraordinarily prolific and that someone had counted the eggs of a middling-sized codfish and found that there were 9 835 000 eggs. The encyclopaedia came to the conclusion that mankind could never exterminate this species. We have proven both the Bible and this nineteenth-century encyclopaedia wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Stevenson is too young to remember the cod wars which were fought around the coast of Iceland in my lifetime – in fact, at a time when I was already in politics. The British – with due respect to all States in the Union – sent warships to Icelandic waters to ensure that their fishermen were protected when going there to fish the stocks in Icelandic waters. It is good that opinion in Britain is changing in favour of the right of coastal fishermen, which I always accepted, to exploit their own resources.</p>
<p class="contents">With all due respect to Mr Stevenson, who is a good representative of his people and very enthusiastic, I do not accept that the common fisheries policy is a failure. I do not accept that British fishermen have been wronged, because if you look at the figures the British fishing industry is getting its natural share of European fish. The only country that has been 'wronged' are the Irish fishermen who have been denied their natural share and who were never allowed to exploit the seas. In the sixteenth century the British went to war with the Hanseatic League over Icelandic cod and they only withdrew from that war after some casualties because they discovered a new source of cod off the coast of America.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an old story. But do not go back and tell the fishermen of Europe that it is the European Commission which is to be blamed. It is trying to solve a difficult problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that reason, at this point I only wish to comment on the report actually before us now.</p>
<p class="contents">I think no one would deny that it is an incontrovertible fact that cod stocks are at an all-time low in the Irish Sea. Another incontrovertible fact is that if we wish to protect the stock of cod, there is only one thing to do: we must leave the stock alone during the spawning season. That is why it is very important to close the spawning grounds in good time before the start of the spawning season, even if that is very painful, and even if that inevitably creates problems for fishermen. And time is short, because the spawning season starts in the middle of this month.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that everyone involved up to now, and I would particularly like to thank the Committee on Fisheries and the rapporteur, has gone to great pains to ensure that we meet the deadline we have set ourselves. You will be voting on the report tomorrow, and that just leaves enough time for us to make a decision in Council so that the regulation can come into force on 15 February.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is totally in agreement with the report before us and I would like to thank you once again for your support.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now turn to the amendment that has been tabled. Unfortunately, I have to reject this amendment. Why? Last year we carried out a number of trial catches with semi-pelagic trawls, precisely during the second half of the closure period. These trials clearly showed that the risk to cod is very high during this period and that there is a significant by-catch of cod. However, the Commission is willing to allow semi-pelagic trawls to be used during the first half of the closure period, subject to the conditions mentioned by Mr Nicholson, namely that there should be a specific observation system in accordance with Article 3 and that these activities will cease if the by-catch of cod becomes excessive.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also aware that the second condition I mentioned involves a certain risk, but because of the observation system, if there should be a further closure next year we will be in a position to say whether or not this exception can also be made during the first part of next year's closure period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
