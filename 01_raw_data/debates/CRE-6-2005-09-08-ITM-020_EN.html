<p class="contents">Unfortunately, however, these improvements do not go far enough. The example of the continued imprisonment of two ill parliamentarians, Riad Seif and Mamoun al-Homsi, and the recent persecution of many civil activists, such as Hasan Zeino and Yassin al-Hamwi, are pertinent proof of that. As is, indeed, the Syrian authorities' continued tactic of imposing obstacles on the registration and free operation of non-governmental human rights organisations in the country. As well, of course, as the tactic of intimidating and harassing numerous Syrian human rights activists.</p>
<p class="contents">The Syrian Government must realise that this situation is unacceptable to the EU, and its continuation will no doubt hinder the accomplishment of a future EU-Syria Association Agreement. We call upon the Syrian authorities, and especially the current President, Mr Bashar al-Assad, who has given hopeful signs of wanting to open up the Syrian political system, dominated for many years by the Ba'ath party, to proceed in a speedy and determined fashion in the much needed process of democratisation and reform of his country.</p>
<p class="contents">Such changes will not only earn him and his Government much respect abroad but, more importantly, they will greatly benefit the Syrian people.</p>
<p class="contents">Colleagues, I urge you to support this joint motion for a resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem concerning Tunisia demonstrates in a general manner how seriously we treat human rights in our Association Agreements. That is the reason why we wanted this resolution on Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">We want Syria to open up and become democratic. For months now, we have been calling for cases involving political prisoners such as Riad Seif and Mamoun al-Homsi to be treated seriously. Mrs Patrie and I, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the President of Parliament, Mr Borrell, sent letters in August calling for the release of these two political prisoners who have already served two thirds of their prison sentences. They are former members of Parliament who are in a poor physical condition. These letters have remained unanswered.</p>
<p class="contents">We want the forthcoming Association Agreement with Syria to clearly indicate that human rights are a condition on which we will not compromise. We do not wish to isolate Syria. It is a country that we consider to be a friendly country, which must become democratic and which we can assist. However, for the time being, we are keen to address the following message to the Syrian Government: now that it is time to reach a decision on this Association Agreement, please take this message seriously; do not think that, in every instance, we will have to table resolutions in order to finally start a constructive dialogue with Syria on human rights, in particular with the subcommittee on human rights that we are calling on you to set up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We would therefore call upon the Commission, the Council and the Member States to make it clear to the Syrian authorities that the agreement we are currently negotiating must include clear clauses on human rights, as established by the Euro-Mediterranean Association.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, like Mrs De Keyser, we are calling for the establishment, within the context of the Association Agreement, of a sub-committee on human rights in relation to Syria, as has been done in the case of Jordan or Morocco, with a view to holding a structured dialogue on human rights and democracy. This sub-committee would become a key element of the action plan.</p>

<p class="contents">Syria blames France and Great Britain for needlessly splitting up these regions, which they had won from Turkey in the First World War and for hence making impossible their return to the greater Syria that existed before the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p class="contents">Over 40 years ago, the desire for greatness caused Syria to join with Egypt and Yemen in leading the attempt to create a United Arab Republic. It was when this project failed and Syria also lost the Golan area in 1967 to Israel that the seeds of an authoritarian and militaristic regime were sown. The regime is intolerant of ethnic minorities, of Christianity and of interpretations of Islam that deviate from the version propagated by the state. It is also intolerant towards domestic opposition, distrustful of neighbouring countries and even more distrustful of great powers further away.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the years, violent acts by exiles from other countries have been supported from Syrian territory and it is also suspected that recent political assassinations in Lebanon were organised from Syria. The European Union hopes to establish strong relations with all the states in its immediate surroundings, including all countries around the Mediterranean. Indeed, if Turkey ever joins the European Union, Syria will become our immediate neighbour, as will Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">My group thinks that it is not only economic or military considerations that should play a role as our relationship with Syria becomes even deeper. The European Union must place more emphasis on the release of political prisoners, the right to opposition and the government’s democratisation. How will the Commission do this? Whilst we should appreciate the circumstances as a result of which Syria has ended up in this bad situation at present, we should not resign ourselves to this. The democratisation of Syria now takes priority over closer trading relations. The al-Assad family’s criminal regime must not be rewarded for bad behaviour. By taking this line, we will contribute to making Syria democratic, and the recognition of a Palestinian state will also have a part to play in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since 1963, Syria has operated under a state of perpetual emergency, which is the legal basis for many of the repressive instruments imposed by the government and which it justifies on the grounds of the ongoing conflict with Israel following Syria's loss of the Golan Heights in 1967 and the struggle against Islamist terrorists who oppose the secular socialist state.</p>
<p class="contents">More recently, as Syria has pursued a more active engagement with the EU through participating in the Barcelona Process and signing a EuroMed association agreement, all areas of its domestic policy have been subject to intense international scrutiny, in particular its poor human rights track record and alleged holding of political prisoners, with deaths in custody and arbitrary arrests, the preventing of free assembly or of citizens from leaving the country, and, of course, the use of torture.</p>
<p class="contents">Matters have not been helped by Syria's lamentable behaviour in turning a blind eye to Islamist terrorists crossing into Iraq from its territory in spite of its own fight against Islamism, as well as its covert support to terrorist training for Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah, in spite of its continuing denials of such support. Syria's withdrawal from Lebanon under international pressure has been marred by the arrest of the pro-Syrian security chiefs in connection with the assassination of Rafik Hariri, a fierce critic of the Syrian regime. Syria remains a one-party state although there is talk of ending this state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution calls for clemency for a number of cases cited by Amnesty International and there can be no doubt that the plight of the stateless Kurds in Hassake and the discrimination against the still remaining small Jewish community are totally unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur on the European neighbourhood policy, I believe that it is nevertheless important to keep Syria engaged in dialogue with the EU and to encourage the process of democratisation and observation of fundamental human rights which Syria has signed up to in its international obligations - obligations which it must meet if it really wants to enjoy a beneficial EuroMed action plan in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When President Bashir Assad succeeded his father in office, he was the focus of a great deal of hope. Syrian Christians who know him well tell me that he, as a member of the Alawi minority himself, has a very tolerant attitude towards other faith communities, not least the Christians.</p>
<p class="contents">It is all the more disappointing that the Baath regime’s brutal machinery of oppression is still operational, with the secret services at work in Lebanon, and the police in Syria itself. I would like to emphasise that, as we have ties with Syria through the Mediterranean dialogue and the Mediterranean community, we have to apply particularly rigorous standards to it. While we ought to support it in its desire to draw closer to the European Union, we cannot do so unless it upholds fundamental human rights and moves towards pluralism and democracy. That such a thing can happen only step by step is obvious, but the process must be begun without delay, and we must send a clear message to that effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this respect, the opening of an electoral process in Egypt <span class="bold">–</span> which is, admittedly, imperfect <span class="bold">–</span> and the regained sovereignty of Lebanon are cases in point. Unfortunately, the recent events in Tunisia show us that it is difficult to progress along that road. That is why questions must clearly be asked about the conditional nature of our partnerships. If an Association Agreement concluded with a country is seriously breached, this should be able to bring about its suspension, even on a temporary basis. In Syria, the arrival in power of President Al-Assad has given rise to a great deal of hope. Conflicting political signs are, however, reaching us, allowing some confusions and uncertainties to remain as regards completing the ratification process for the Association Agreement. In my role as Chairman of the Delegation for relations with the Mashreq countries, I recently took a delegation from our Parliament to Syria. During this visit and particularly in the presence of President Al-Assad himself, we laid a great deal of emphasis on the need to respect fundamental freedoms and on the need to secure the release of the two former parliamentarians, Mr Seif and Mr al-Homsi. Their release is the subject of an item in the report on the visit, drafted by our Mashreq Delegation. The release – I quote – ‘of the two imprisoned Syrian parliamentarians is a preliminary condition for the signing of the Association Agreement.’ The vote on this urgent resolution will act as a powerful message from our Parliament: respect for human rights and respect for fundamental freedoms are non-negotiable factors in our partnerships. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I fully support the European Parliament’s motion for a resolution calling on the Syrian authorities to release political prisoners held in that country. Their number includes several Syrian parliamentarians we consider to be our colleagues. Syria must be persuaded to ratify the convention banning the torture of prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, however, difficult for me to support the proposal in the draft calling on Syria to guarantee that those arrested will be well treated. After all, we know that this refers to political prisoners, so we ought really to be insisting that no political prisoners are ever taken, and not condoning the fact and politely asking Syria not to be too cruel to them.</p>

The regime continues its anti-democratic methods and autocratic practices against any protestors. President Assad appears to be too weak to overturn the autocratic, nepotistic and back-scratching regime which permeates the political system.</p>
<p class="contents">The two former members of parliament in prison whose immediate release we are calling for – together with an immediate end to all political prosecutions – are also victims of the accusation of nepotistic behaviour on the part of the regime.</p>

On the basis of the principles outlined in the Barcelona Process Declaration, our goal is to establish a constructive human rights dialogue with the Syrian authorities. In this context, the European Union troika has, in the past, taken steps following the arrests of opposition figures, including Mr Al-Turk, and the judgment on two parliamentarians, Mr al-Homsi and Mr Riad Seif.</p>
<p class="contents">Very recently, the Commission conveyed to the Syrian Ambassador its grave concern regarding the detention of public figures and of members of Parliament and, more specifically, that of Mr al-Homsi and Mr Seif.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission’s Delegation in Damascus is very closely monitoring the detention of these two political prisoners. A short time ago, the Head of Delegation drew this situation to the attention of the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Moallem. The attempt to have Mr al-Homsi and Mr Seif released was a failure even though, under Syrian law, they could be granted early release after serving three quarters of their prison sentences.</p>
<p class="contents">The law, however, requires the two political prisoners to sign a declaration announcing that they will cease all future political activities detrimental to the Syrian State. They refused to sign it. From a Syrian point of view, therefore, nothing more can be done to release the prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">We can also observe conflicting, yet positive, signs, which are perhaps the outcome of international pressure: consider, for example, the acquittal in June of this year of Aktham Naisseh, a human rights activist.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the overall situation is, unfortunately, unsatisfactory, and the Commission will continue, in close cooperation with the Presidency and the Member States, to bring up other individual cases at every level of its contacts with the Syrian administration.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Association Agreement negotiations, the Commission remains convinced that a human rights dialogue will be more effective in the framework of the contractual relations provided for in the Agreement. This Agreement, including the provisions on free trade, cooperation and political dialogue, and with the clause on human rights and democracy as crucial components, will be an important instrument for opening up Syrian society and for making it more democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards enhancing the MEDA programmes with the aim of supporting the development of a democratic society, the Commission, under the current national indicative programme with Syria, continues to have support for civil society as one of its priorities in the area of cooperation, and it hopes to continue along these lines thanks to future programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Since it has been mentioned several times, I will say a word about the Association Agreement. The Commission remains aware of the current political difficulties regarding the signing of the Agreement with Syria. By arranging the military withdrawal from Lebanon, Syria has taken a first positive step towards implementing Resolution 1559 of the United Nations Security Council. It is clear, however, that, owing to the current situation, that is to say the continued and visible presence of the Syrian secret service in Lebanon, as well as the lack of cooperation in Iraq, Syria absolutely must take strong and positive action in order to restore confidence and must do this before it considers any possible signing of the Agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
