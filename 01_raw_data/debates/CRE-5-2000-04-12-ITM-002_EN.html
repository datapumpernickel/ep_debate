It is generally anti what Europe really represents and anti most of what Europe has achieved. Paragraph 15 of the motion for a resolution is a symptom of this aggressiveness towards Europe. We are all attached to fundamental rights and the rule of law, starting here in this House. So how can we agree when the fundamental right of recourse to the courts is being threatened? This is not a question of internal affairs, but external affairs of great importance. We are Members of this House and we represent our electors. Anything which discriminates in our legal and political conditions, between our political parties and groups in terms of freedom and equality affects our right of representation and ultimately the rights and very freedom of our electors. These are the elements particularly under threat in this report which wants to interfere with and discriminate between the statutes of the political parties. The very essence of Europe is under threat. The fundamental right of recourse to the courts cannot be altered by anyone and nor can the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 15 ruins the whole text by defiling a very serious issue. The temptation for those in power to act arbitrarily which this paragraph encourages is a clear illustration of the position taken in the rest of the report, and a terrible omen. We therefore move the inadmissibility of this report which, in addition to having a dubious legal basis, was not properly prepared and does not enjoy the broad consensus which Europe must have. This is evident in both the injudiciousness of this regrettable paragraph and the fact that 222, I repeat 222, amendments were tabled on this report. Is there any better proof that this report is totally inappropriate? We therefore propose, in order to defend Europe and the rule of law, the immediate rejection of this report.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, Mr Ribeiro e Castro is right to single out paragraph 15, which states that ‘no actions may be brought in connection with the <span class="italic">interna corporis</span> affairs of the European Parliament.’ That statement clearly infringes the fundamental right of every citizen, and thus also of Members, to bring an action. But more generally I believe this report infringes a whole range of different rights, beginning with the rights of the small and medium-sized states which have formed an integral part of our institutions and been highly respected by them since the early days of the Treaty of Rome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU countries have completely different cultures. In some countries Parliament can draw up its own rules of procedure and one does not have the option of going to the court of justice. Some countries have a different system. We have recital 15. Mr Dimitrakopoulos has already mentioned that there are amendments. The UEN Group are welcome to vote against them and then we will see if it is left in or taken out.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dimitrakopoulos (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Madam President, Minister, Deputy Minister, Commissioner, we are at a really very important juncture so far as the vocation of the European Union is concerned. Today, through the proceedings of the Intergovernmental Conference, the European Union is being called upon to address the great challenges involved in the transition from the 20th to the 21st century, challenges we all recognise, which are important, which influence the course of the European Union every day, and challenges which, above all, raise a fundamental issue: how ready are we, as an institution, as the European Union, to face them? The Intergovernmental Conference attempts to answer just that question. It is common ground that in the face of all those challenges, the way the European Union functions at present is certainly in need of some changes, changes whose important aim will be the future progress of the European Union on the basis of what we have all accepted until now.</p>
<p class="contents">The report you have before you today is significant in that it covers the following points. The first point is once again to consolidate the institutional nature of the European Union. We repeat and insist that the European Union is both a union of states and a union of peoples. It is precisely our acceptance of that principle which has guided the European Union towards the many successes we can mention, and which, of course, we all like to refer to from time to time.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is to reconfirm and consolidate another important principle, the principle of a balance of powers, a principle that relates precisely to the role and relationship of those who participate in the European Union, a principle expressed by the way all the Member States express themselves in all – I repeat, all – the European Union’s institutional bodies. And as you know, the European Union has got to where it is today, achieved what it has achieved, precisely because it has been and is functioning on the basis of a balance of powers as agreed and commonly accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">The third basic principle safeguarded in the report is the proposal for a general – and I stress the word general – review of all the institutional bodies that make up the European Union. For some, perhaps, that may be a risky proposal. However, I must stress that it is necessary and essential, particularly since we all agree that over and above all, the current reconsideration of how the European Union works is directly linked to the great challenge presented by the European Union’s enlargement. It is only natural, when already in a Europe with 15 Member States we find and all agree that some things do not work quite so well and must be put right, that this will be all the more necessary when we it concerns a European Union with 18, 20, 25 and 27 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth point concerns a number of new proposals, despite the fact that the issues to which they relate had always been debated. I refer very specifically to closer cooperation. Closer cooperation, at least as we view it, must comprise two main elements. Firstly, it must be an incentive and not an obstacle – I stress: not an obstacle – it must be an incentive for all the Member States to participate more and in greater depth in the European procedures. Secondly, it must contain a very highly developed element of democratic awareness, which means that if any country or countries for some reason do not wish to participate, at least during a first phase, this should not be regarded as an exclusion or as a factor that restricts the presence of those countries in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We have taken a great many steps and we certainly can point to two examples of closer cooperation. The Schengen Agreement, and Economic and Monetary Union itself. I would also like to see closer cooperation in foreign policy issues and others as well. To put it clearly, closer cooperation is a Community process and both foreign policy and common defence policy issues should be dealt with as a Community process, because it provides control mechanisms. I would like to close by expressing my thanks to the Portuguese Presidency and in particular to Mr da Costa for his cooperation, to Commissioner Barnier, to you and all our colleagues, and of course, to my co-rapporteur Mr Leinen, with whom we worked hard but very well. I would also like to thank the members of Parliament’s Secretariat who assisted us and the interpreters, who on very many occasions worked long hours to enable the difficult negotiations you all know about to take place.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Leinen (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>– <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, the national governments took the decision at the Helsinki Summit to almost double the number of Member States. I believe that is the background to the reform we are calling for now, so as to enable the European Union to handle the enlargement process. Doubling the number of Member States requires far-reaching reform of the working structures and the decision-making procedures in the Union, so that this whole undertaking does not become incapable of acting. The key issue is the transition from unanimity to qualified majority voting. That is the most crucial issue and it must be the yardstick for gauging the success or failure of this Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It is quite clear that when there are 27 Member States, it is no longer going to be possible to reach unanimous decisions. It will either take too long or we will only be able to reach solutions that have a minimal effect. This would not be in the interests of our citizens and our countries. We therefore call for qualified majority voting to become the rule and unanimity the exception. However, I am most disconcerted by the developments at the Intergovernmental Conference, because the message we are getting is that so far, the governments have been unable to reach agreement on a single issue regarding the transition to qualified majority voting. I believe this only goes to show once again, that the Intergovernmental Conference is not the best way to get results, because it is a long time before actual negotiations take place and there is too much waiting around on the starting line.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Dimitrakopoulos mentioned flexibility. I believe this is also an important principle where enlargement of the Union is concerned. Twenty-seven countries will not all be able to move at the same speed when it comes to integration. That is why it is so important for some countries to integrate more closely, as we put it, if we want European unification to take place within the confines of the European Union rather than outside them. Remember that the debate on the “hard core” or the federal core was revived again after Helsinki, because some people feared that it will not be possible for unification to proceed within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I ask myself what kind of message this Intergovernmental Conference sends out to our citizens. I feel it must be brought to their attention that the Union will become more democratic, more transparent and more accessible to them. In other words, we also need to offset the democratic deficit. Parliament must be granted codecision rights in all matters where the Council takes majority decisions. We also want to improve our opportunities for supervising the Commission. In fact we have submitted proposals to the effect that the President of the Commission should be able to ask Parliament for a vote of confidence, and that it should also be made a little easier for us to express our lack of confidence in the Commission when we see fit to do so.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">A Europe of the citizens – to pick up on a theme I touched on before – also goes hand in hand with the Charter of Citizen’s Rights in the Union. We demand that this Charter be incorporated into the Treaty at the end of this year. I would just like to mention that this would also enable the “Europeanisation” of the political debate to take an important step forwards. We want a statute for European parties. After all, politics must take place at European level and not at national level. Many of us believe that European lists may prove helpful at future European elections, so that the debates directly associated with the European elections are not purely concerned with domestic affairs, with the opposition pitted against the government, but are European debates, so that the issues we are most concerned about here on the continent are brought to the fore. </p>
<p class="contents">The reform of the European Treaties must deliver two things: more efficiency and more democracy. If the European Treaty of Nice succeeds in this, then the prospects are good for achieving stability and also acceptance amongst the citizens in an enlarged European Union.</p>

I would like to encourage the Portuguese Presidency – which so far has managed the negotiations for the Intergovernmental Conference very imaginatively and with a great deal of consideration towards the European Parliament – to give its backing to an extension of the mandate, for example, particularly in the sphere of foreign and security policy, and that of fundamental rights, and to take the decisions necessary to do this in Feira, once we know what is needed on the basis of the implementation of the Helsinki and Cologne Decisions pertaining to foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">This is where we must truly succeed in bringing about cooperation between the first and second pillars, and also in integrating the second pillar more effectively into the first. In other words, we must bring about closer cooperation between civil and military crisis management. The Treaty of Amsterdam made it possible for there to be far-reaching integration of the Western European Union into the Treaty; in particular, it transferred the Petersberg tasks. I believe there is a need for the European Parliament to be empowered to undertake the necessary parliamentary supervision, so as to create equilibrium between the institutions. I say supervision, not codecision – apart from where budgetary matters are concerned – because this is important if we are to make clear that foreign and security policy are, of course, primarily a task of the executive.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We should also reflect on what is to become of Article 5. In my view, and that of the Committee, it should be included in the Treaty as a protocol, so that any country which so desires can sign up to this protocol on the basis of a free and sovereign decision. I believe that in so doing, we would be able, in the long term, to create a European Union in which there would be no variation in security standards from country to country. This would not be tenable in the long term, in view of the various interests that are represented here.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is not a State. But it operates as a federal state where it has the authority to do so. That is why relations between the institutions must also be organised along federal lines, and there must be a balance between large and small States. This is certainly one of the difficult tasks facing this Intergovernmental Conference. I can well imagine – and this is also the opinion of my group – that we would be able to work effectively with a Commission containing representatives of all the countries, if the President of the Commission was afforded the opportunity to structure a Commission of this kind in an efficient manner, that is if we were to create such an opportunity by strengthening the position of the President of the Commission here.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">However, if we assume that due consideration is being shown towards the small countries, then we must also be in a position to create a stronger basis of legitimacy for the larger countries according to the “one man one vote” principle, and on this basis, adjust the proportional allocation system within the European Parliament, giving certain assurances as to minimum seat numbers, and also settle matters accordingly within the Council.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">However, the crucial test facing this Intergovernmental Conference is to foster the enlargement process by extending majority decisions. Therefore it must be clear that with the exception of constitutional issues, everything should be subject to majority decisions, although of course the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission would be well-advised to draw clear distinctions in their drafts, in areas such as social and taxation policy, between matters which, according to European rules, should be decided on by majority voting, because the internal market requires it, and matters which are to remain subject to unanimous decisions, being the preserve of the nation-state.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">This leads me directly on to the matter of the catalogue of competences. This is another task as I see it. We must make it clearer within this European Union who is responsible for what and when. If we were to clearly apportion responsibility in this way, then we would have more transparency and the people would be more willing to give the European Union their support. This is also something the Intergovernmental Conference should strive for, and the proposals to divide the Treaty, the requests to make these distinctions clear, appear to me to be important, also the way in which, for example, the Council is at last bringing transparency and openness to its role as legislator, and we are therefore managing to separate the executive and the legislative. It is all part of the same package.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">As to closer cooperation: there will certainly be a need for this in an enlarged Community, particularly where foreign and security policy is concerned. But I would like to make clear where the boundary lies. The boundary is the point at which the unity of the system of laws and the unity of the institution are compromised. That is why we must not push closer cooperation too far. We must not use it as a fallback option because we are unable to extend majority decisions to a sufficient number of areas. I feel that here too, there are certain rules that we need to stick to.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is a Community of values. Therefore it is to be hoped that the Convention, under the leadership of Roman Herzog, will put forward a catalogue of fundamental rights which we will be able to include in the Treaty in a legally binding manner, and that on this basis, we will then be able to define our values in such a way that many of the things we discussed in the past will no longer be possible, because we will have a clear legal provision in place. If we succeed in this then, all in all, we will have made considerable progress, and will thus have created the conditions necessary to the enlargement of the European Union.</p>

But firstly I would like to thank both rapporteurs for the enormous amount of work they have done. I would also like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his open-mindedness, and I would like to thank Mr Vitorino for making a particular point that I would now like to address myself. </p>
<p class="contents">My first point concerns the discharge, which is very topical at the moment. The EU Treaty states quite clearly that the European Parliament grants the Commission discharge to implement the budget. In practice, however, this act on our part is twofold, the first stage being to undertake a political assessment under the discharge procedure, and the second being to close the budgetary accounts. Now the first stage, that of the political evaluation, can have mixed results. There is assent, there is refusal, and matters are sometimes deferred. This does not necessarily affect the budgetary accounts, the second stage that is, for they can be closed even if the first stage met with refusal. This has the advantage that a balance from the budgetary accounts can then be carried forward to the following year. This should be enshrined in the Treaty, for it is already included in our Rules of Procedure and is, as I said, established practice. In addition, we would like to receive information directly from the Member States, so as to improve the way in which we conduct our assessment of budgetary management.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">My second point relates to the creation of a European Public Prosecutor’s Office. For years we have endeavoured to protect the financial interests of the Community more effectively. This now also needs to be done under criminal law, at European level, in very open and clear cooperation with the Member States. In other words, there is not enough police and judicial cooperation between the Member States in the face of increasing cross-border crime that is harmful to the EU budget. That is why we need coordination at European level, without prejudicing the right of national courts to administer justice. I am most grateful that some Member States, but particularly the Commission, have been so willing to take up this theme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the view of this Committee that the construction of this area of justice is important and, to this end, a reform of the Court of Justice is necessary. In order to reform the Court it will be necessary to amend the Treaty, so that the Statute and the Regulations of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance become operative. None of them is currently operative. Our first demand is therefore that qualified majority be established with the assent of the European Parliament. With regard to the Court, Parliament also asks to be able to participate in the process of selecting judges as already happens with the posts in the constitutional courts in our states.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, with regard to freedoms and rights, we want citizens to be provided with full rights to appeal so that they can be assured that Community legislation will be enforced in the event of violations of fundamental rights. This is not currently the case. We want to see a reform of Articles 230 and 300 of the Treaty so that Parliament is on an equal footing with the Commission and the Council as far as appeals are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Madam President, we want to see a reform of the Treaty so that Parliament, in relation to the third pillar, also has full access to justice by means of repeal in the event of regulations and acts which do not conform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are now approaching the time when we will have a Community with a single currency and a common currency policy that is largely dictated by the European Central Bank. But we still have 15 different economic policies in the Member States of the European Union, and we will only succeed in the long-term if this economic policy is framed according to common principles. Hence our first demand is that we should firmly establish the social market economy, which adds a human dimension to the functioning of the market, in the European Treaty, as a model for our economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Our second demand is for Parliament’s participation in the drafting of the economic policy guidelines, which we have already discussed here today, to be placed on a more formal footing, i.e. the Commission should present us not with a recommendation but a formal proposal, on which we can then be consulted in the true sense of the word.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Our third demand relates to competition policy. On the one hand, competition policy is the key to the social market economy, on the other hand, however, it is also the most robust instrument of economic policy that the European Community has at its disposal. Numerous decisions on individual cases are taken in matters of competition policy and that is quite clearly the task of the Commission. But in future, whenever general rules are drawn up, or the Commission drafts guidelines in conjunction with the Council of Ministers, then the European Parliament must also be involved in the codecision procedure, for only then will Parliament be able to realise its goal of becoming a fully-fledged member of the European forum, where European economic policy is not just discussed publicly, but is also framed with the participation of Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Court must be able to focus on the real legal issues and legal protection of EU subjects. The Court of First Instance must be better accommodated in this framework, and both jurisdictions must be able to take more autonomous decisions regarding their own structures and procedures. Sound and timely administration of justice is a vital component of the constitutional state. In the light of this, the role of the European Parliament should be upgraded to that of a fully-fledged legislative body and that of a fully-fledged European institution.</p>
<p class="contents">These are, in a nutshell, the motives underlying the opinion issued by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. As rapporteur, I am also delighted to note that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is on the same wavelength for the greater part of its principal report. Unfortunately, time constraints prevent me from going into any detail. But in order to bring the report of the Committee on Legal Affairs as far as possible into line with the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I tabled four more amendments in the plenary meeting. As some of these amendments are also to be found in the opinions of other committees, I believe that these amendments deserve – and will probably receive – the support of the entire Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">This is where I would like to conclude my brief report on a not unimportant contribution to what will probably be the last IGC before the largest, most historic and most risky enlargement since the inception of the present European integration process. This is why we need to seize this opportunity with both hands to prepare the European Union, with all its institutions and in all fields, to face the challenges of the 21st century successfully.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have just hurried from a meeting which, according to the Treaty, does not exist. I am participating, on behalf of Parliament, in the tripartite dialogue on the budget to set the budgetary guidelines. This is precisely the point we have raised on behalf of the Committee on Budgets. It is the adaptation of the Treaty, Article 272 in particular, to the real situation. We have spent twelve years practising with a timetable set by the interinstitutional agreements. We have renewed them three times, and we believe that the time has come to include the fundamental principles in the Treaty so that we will not find ourselves in legally dubious situations, such as the case of the meeting which I have just mentioned. Specifically, we must simplify the procedure in order to prevent the blocking of the budgetary procedure. When there are 25 members, the current procedure will not work. We should simplify it while respecting the existing balances of power.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Madam President, we also believe that Parliament, as an institution embodying democratic legitimacy, must fully participate in the decisions on own resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to raise two points. Firstly, my Committee is of the opinion that in the field of trade policy, the European Community’s authority and also, therefore, the European Commission’s negotiating mandate must be reinforced. So too, however, must be the role of Parliament. This can be done a) by introducing codecision for the common trade policy, b) by introducing an assent procedure for all external agreements and c) by according Parliament a greater role in approving and monitoring trade negotiations. </p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns energy. The Commission has concluded that a coherent European energy policy has been lacking in the past. There are no clear guidelines on institutional mechanisms for defining a common energy policy, let alone cooperation to guarantee the supply of energy or in terms of the environmental aspects of energy policy. With a view to sustainable development, a new chapter on energy policy must be included in the Treaty, as well as the relevant sections of the ECSC and EURATOM Treaties. In addition, the European Parliament powers must be adequately enhanced. This means that the codecision procedure needs to apply to the EURATOM Treaty too. It will specifically need to apply to the drafting of minimum safety standards for the design, construction and operation of nuclear reactors within the Union. So far, the Member States have had their own technical standards and regulations. In the light of Central and Eastern countries joining the EU, it is vital that uniform, European safety standards for nuclear reactors be drafted. Unfortunately, my proposal to this effect has not been included in the current report. I would therefore urge you most emphatically to vote for Amendment No 60 which I have tabled on behalf of my group, so that uniform safety standards can be drawn up for nuclear reactors. We owe this to our citizens.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is very important to mention the social market economy, as already indicated by Mr von Wogau. It provides a kind of framework for internal policy which we need and renders a whole raft of discussions redundant. I believe that this results in satisfaction all round. </p>
<p class="contents">The second major point is the Union’s legal personality. It has been formulated here as if it were only related to foreign policy but it also has enormous significance for internal policy. Indeed, it then becomes possible to ratify a number of Treaties, such as ILO Treaties and some UN Treaties in the social field, which will add legal clarity to this type of issue.</p>
<p class="contents">There are nonetheless two points that are lacking. One of them is the issue of Article 137(6) which, in my opinion, should be repealed. There are also a number of amendments on the table which I hope will yet be added. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish off with a remark on the issue of the tax policy. The report, in fact, mentions very little about this. The tax policy, which also includes social security policy, is nonetheless of great importance, and not only to the Member States. The Commission too has given the matter rather a lot of attention and has devoted a great deal of thought to it. It is rather a pity, in my opinion, that we talk about it so little. Maybe we will do so in future. The policy is implicitly included in the report but I still think that, in a sense, not dealing with it now is a missed opportunity. That does not, however, detract from the deep appreciation which we have for this report.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is about extending codecision to all aspects of agricultural policy, which is something that still remains to be done. The Treaty of Amsterdam led to a strengthening of the European Parliament’s powers, inter alia by extending codecision to various policy areas. However when it comes to agriculture, it is only when health policy and public health are under discussion that Parliament has codecision rights, as per Article 152, for the core area remains outside the codecision procedure. There is no justification for this in our eyes. The common agricultural policy is the most long-established and evolved Community policy. It is absolutely vital, particularly as we are talking about a huge budget (which actually accounts for half of the European Parliament’s total budget) for the European Parliament to make full use of its supervisory powers and its powers in the legislative sphere.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It should also be pointed out in this context that we are not in competition with the national parliaments. They no longer have any decision-making powers where agricultural policy is concerned either, for this is a policy that is decided on purely by the executive – the Council that is – in the form of legislative acts. Hence this is not about a clash between the European Parliament and the national parliaments, it is about making this policy subject to parliamentary control in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I call upon all my fellow delegates to do everything they can to persuade their respective governments to have codecision extended to agricultural policy at this Intergovernmental Conference. I would like to thank those who will be representing the European Parliament at the Intergovernmental Conference, as I know they will pursue our concerns with great vigour.</p>

The fisheries policy is one of those policies that makes a substantial contribution to the realisation of the single market. It strengthens economic and social conditions. How does it do this? Well, here in Europe, in excess of 250 000 people are still directly employed in this sector; being engaged in activities ranging from the catch itself to fish processing, through to marketing. </p>
<p class="contents">According to the latest investigations, for every euro invested there is a three-fold return. A substantial number of those employed in this sector – almost 60 000 that is – are reliant on the international agreements, since fish are, by their very nature, an extremely mobile source of food, and also – I might add – an extremely important source of protein. It is up to us, today’s politicians, to set down a marker and guarantee the fishing industry’s future. Consider the message we are to send out to those regions of Europe that depend on the industry. I refer in particular to the forthcoming fisheries reform in the year 2002. We must concern ourselves mainly with protecting and conserving this resource, which will have social, economic and environmental consequences. It is obvious that the fisheries sector is not an isolated pawn in the game, for it has an impact on sectors such as development, the environment and foreign relations.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">As a Community policy in its own right in the Union treaty, the fisheries sector will unite these aspects to good effect, for that is what we want to achieve: we want to place the fisheries sector on an independent administrative and legislative footing, in relation to agriculture for example. In fact this political responsibility inevitably gives rise to a claim to the most far-reaching of codecision rights. In addition, if qualified majority decisions in the Council and Parliament’s codecision powers accord with one another, then clearly this will help to tighten up on legislative procedures.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>

It is a fact that the Treaty of Amsterdam was a major step forward for women’s rights, since it provides a firm base for an effective policy on equality, but unfortunately it does not go further than the professional sector. For that reason we are proposing that the Treaty should include a uniform and cohesive legal base for equality between the sexes, which will include all policy sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">We declare that balanced participation of women and men in decision-making at every level is a prerequisite for democracy and social justice, and we are therefore asking for the related articles of the Treaties to be amended to take account of that principle in the composition of the Commission, the European Parliament, the Court of Justice, the Court of First Instance, the Court of Auditors, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.</p>
<p class="contents">We also stress the need for a close link between the Intergovernmental Conference and the procedure for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights, so that within the scope of the constitutionalisation of the Union, the fundamental right of equality between women and men will be enshrined in Community law. So besides the essential equilibrium and cohesion that must be secured between the Union’s large and small countries and between the more and less developed areas and population groups, it is also necessary to take into account the balance between the sexes in planning the future of the EU and in decision making.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This time the European Parliament’s participation has been reinforced through your President and two other representatives and also through full dialogue between the Council presidency and your Committee on Constitutional Affairs. This reinforcement also stems from the direct information of this House and its debate in plenary, which have no precedents. This is very encouraging for the future results of the IGC.</p>
<p class="contents">So far five main in-depth meetings of the preparatory group have been held, together with three meetings of the IGC itself. Also planned are all the events in the calendar up to the end of Portugal’s presidency, involving both the IGC and the preparatory group. A report is also to be prepared which will be submitted to the Feira European Council. The Council presidency considers that this report should not be purely theoretical but should also make practical proposals. It must enable the next holder of the Council presidency, which will be France, to continue developing this work and to reach a decision by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue tackled at the last IGC meeting was the question of extending qualified majority voting. The Member States demonstrated a certain openness towards this but many have still not made a definitive decision. Certain areas can already be identified on which the attitude of the large majority of Member States is that these should remain subject to the unanimity rule. Debates on these issues reveal that there is actually significant reticence, although this may be overcome during the IGC.</p>
<p class="contents">The preparatory work carried out to date has also involved questions connected with the European Parliament, the courts, the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee. As regards the decision-making procedure in the European Parliament, there is broad consensus that no revision of the Treaty should be effected which involves changing the existing institutional balance. As for the scope of codecision, there is some openness towards extending this procedure to all legislative acts adopted by qualified majority without, however, establishing any kind of systematic correlation.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance, a group of friends of the Council presidency has been brought together to examine possible amendments to the Treaty relating to these two courts. The study of possible amendments to the Treaty in respect of the Court of Auditors, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions has also been started. Many consider that changes should only be made where strictly necessary to ensure the effective functioning of the European Union after enlargement. Consideration has also been given to matters which may be included on the agenda of the IGC, on the Council presidency’s proposal. It should be recalled that the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council specify that the Council presidency will submit a report to the European Council and may propose in this report the insertion of new items on the IGC’s agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of security and defence and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Council presidency considers that, depending on the progress of the work, the right should be reserved to propose to the Feira European Council next June the inclusion in the IGC of any adjustments or additions to the Treaties which may prove necessary in these areas. With regard to other issues likely to be added to the IGC’s work, an initial debate has been held based on a list drawn up by the Council presidency. The argument put forward in favour of a prudent approach to the inclusion of new items on the agenda concerned the risk, inherent in the technical complexity of this debate, of causing the deadline of this December for the completion of the IGC’s work to be missed.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of the size and composition of the Commission, there is a consensus that the Commission to emerge from this IGC must be strong, independent and legitimate. Its collegiate nature must be preserved. However, there is clear disagreement between, on one hand, the small and medium-sized Member States which want a Commission composed of one national from each Member State, all with equal status, and, on the other, the large Member States which favour a fixed number of Commissioners regardless of the number of Member States. The size of the Commission is the main point of disagreement between the delegations. The rest of the debate on the Commission is dependent on this issue as some directly link this question with their positions on the composition, internal organisation and structure of this Community institution.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the individual responsibility of Commissioners, there is general support for keeping the undertaking currently made by each Commissioner to stand down when asked to do so by the Commission President. The delegations are divided into those which want to keep the informality of this undertaking and those which want the process to be enshrined in the Treaty. As for the Commission’s collective responsibility as a college, there is some reluctance to accept alterations to the current institutional framework, with the current supervision exercised by the European Parliament being regarded as sufficient. The idea submitted by this House of the Commission being able to request a vote of confidence in it was positively welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of the weighting of votes in Council, there is consensus that the criterion which should be used as the basis for qualified majority voting in Council must stem from the combination of the two elements which form the foundations of the European Union. These are the population and the existence of sovereign states. The EU is just as much a union of peoples as it is of states.</p>
<p class="contents">As for specific mechanisms to be established for the future system, there is also a split between those who defend a double-majority system and those who prefer simple reweighting. One recurring argument is that the reform should be acceptable to public opinion and likely to be ratified by the national parliaments. This is a common concern of all the Member States, whether large or small, not only due to the need, in ratifying the new Treaty, to enable enlargement and respect for its timetables, but also due to the feeling that a European crisis should not be allowed to occur on this type of reform. There is also the idea that these reforms must be submitted to public opinion in the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe so that the impression is not given that these are reforms which must be rushed through, not to improve the European Union but to prevent the new Member States from having access to the EU’s decision-making system.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to closer cooperation, the need or the usefulness for the IGC to tackle this issue was also discussed in an informal debate. Again there was a division of opinion both about the possibility of this issue being discussed and about the scope and nature of any alterations. The next informal meeting of the Representatives Group on 14 and 15 April in Sintra, Portugal, will deal specifically with this issue which is problematic as there are no examples to follow. There are no specific examples as the Treaty of Amsterdam already allows closer cooperation and so far no Member State has used this instrument and there are no theoretical examples as these are never put forward by the debaters. Although this issue comes up time and again, it is very abstract.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the substance of the issue and the introduction of closer cooperation into the Second Pillar, an informal debate has revealed that the majority regard this as unnecessary in external or common security policy, although the possibility of its use in the area of security and defence may be considered. This means that if closer cooperation were included within the Second Pillar, it would then be necessary to find a specific way of implementing this concept in this area. This could not copy the First Pillar given the dissimilarity between the operation of these two pillars.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to making the existing model more flexible, as supported in particular by the Commission, a certain openness has been detected towards eliminating the recourse to the European Council when launching closer cooperation. However, the limit of eight Member States has been questioned even by those who support altering the requirement for the participation of the majority of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, the Portuguese Presidency is continuing to make every effort to take the work forward in order to achieve a comprehensive and balanced agreement which is acceptable to everyone by the specified deadline. Close contact has been maintained with the Commission and the European Parliament. In the latter case, this has been through both the participation of your President and two selected Members and the regular information provided to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and this House. This is ensuring that this institutional reform work is carried out with a much higher degree of participation by the European Parliament than the previous revision of the Treaty. This augurs well for the success of our work.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite all the arguments and discussions we might have (and these arguments and discussions are necessary, also between the groups), what we need is a broad consensus when it comes to the future development of the European Union and the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you, and also the French Council Presidency that is to succeed you, bear a huge responsibility, because the outcome of this Intergovernmental Conference will be of historic significance, be it for positive or negative reasons. If the Intergovernmental Conference has a positive outcome, which is what we must strive for, then this conference will change the face of the European Union in the sense that it will mean more transparency, more democracy, and will bring the European Union closer to its people. That is what we need. But if this conference does not have the far-reaching outcome we desire and need, then this would be a tragedy for the European Union, for it would then be unable to undergo enlargement, and it would be awful if at the beginning of this century, the gates of the European Union were to remain closed to the countries of Central Europe, which have shaken off Communism, and if the Central European States were unable to gain access to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">That is why we must pull out all the stops to make this conference a success. We want a strong and democratic European Union that has the power to act, and how apt that we should be making such statements only a matter of weeks before the 50th Anniversary of the day, 9 May 1950 that is, on which Robert Schuman made a proposal to the effect that Europe should develop as a community. Recital 1 sets out the benchmarks that the Intergovernmental Conference must work to: balance between the institutions, dual legitimacy of the European Union as a Union of peoples and a Union of States, and – something which is particularly important – balance between the small and large States of the European Union. The all-important benchmark – and you mentioned this yourself, Mr President-in-Office of the Council – is majority voting in the Council. That is the real heart of the matter, and we must see to it that this principle of double majority, i.e. a majority in the Council and a majority support from the people, is upheld. Certainly we have yet to discuss in detail how this is to be accomplished, but the principle of double majority is fundamentally right. If majority voting fails to be drastically extended and fails to gain acceptance as the fundamental decision-making system, then this Intergovernmental Conference will have failed, and it cannot be allowed to fail in view of the enlargement process.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Commission is concerned, as I see it, the small States must still be entitled, in the future, to be represented in the European Commission, since it is felt to be important to maintain a presence in Brussels. I sympathise with this view and we must secure this, which is why the position of the President of the Commission must be strengthened. We want a strong President and a strong Commission, both now and in the future. We are particularly keen to get this message across to those who may not want to see the Commission as a strong unifying force in Europe. We must strengthen the President, and he must also be empowered to dismiss a Member of the Commission if they do not fulfil their obligations.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, the European Parliament must be the decisive factor in the democratic process, and it must participate in decisions pertaining to legislative issues in the European Union. We do not want there to be less democracy in the European Union than there is at national level.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to raise a final point, that of the European Court of Justice. This is a very important point and I am delighted that both rapporteurs saw fit to mention it. We are a Community of law and we must not subject the European Union and its institutions to political opportunism. That is why we must invest the European Court of Justice, as the legal body competent to settle disputes and conflicts, with the power to act and the ability to reach decisions in reasonable timeframes.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I have a request to make of you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council: could we – perhaps also in conjunction with the Commission, with Commissioner Barnier – inform the candidate countries in Central Europe, and of course Malta and Cyprus too, of the discussions taking place and the progress made at the Intergovernmental Conference? After all, the candidate countries have a legitimate interest in knowing what is being debated at the Intergovernmental Conference and what they will need to prepare themselves for. Therefore I believe we should take account of this justifiable interest on the part of the candidate countries by engaging in fruitful dialogue with them, for the truth is that we are to share a common future with them as Members of the European Union in the twenty-first century. On that note, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I wish you every success in the work you are to undertake at the Intergovernmental Conference, and for which I thank you.</p>

This is a truly historic moment, as has been stressed. Our fellow-citizens are waiting to be told what we are going to demand from the Intergovernmental Conference for that future.</p>
<p class="contents">Institutional proposals on particular issues without prior clarification of the basic philosophy of tomorrow’s Union of 27 are not convincing. The draft resolution is therefore quite right to define that basic view in the form of three principles. According to the draft, the European Union is, first and foremost, a Union of peoples and a Union of states. Its citizens therefore have both a European and a national identity. Secondly, it is based on an institutional equilibrium between large and small states. That must not be just on paper. Thirdly, the way the Union functions must be made more effective, so that it can cope with the major enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">The above philosophical principles, to which the draft resolution remains faithful, are not metaphysical inventions of the European Parliament but arise from the history and from the political reality which we call the area of Europe. Anyone who ignores that is building a Europe founded on sand. The Intergovernmental Conference of 2000 is taking place to make the Union as effective as is required in view of the major enlargement that has been decided. In this process Parliament’s responsibility is very great indeed. For that reason, Parliament’s approval of enlargement cannot but depend on the adequacy of the institutional changes that will be decided. That is not a threat, it is a declaration of responsible attitude.</p>
<p class="contents">In good faith, all sides are trying, by means of amendments, to make the way in which European Union functions more effective. But is it enough for procedures to be simplified and speeded up for them to be described as effective? The effectiveness of a police service, which indeed demands both simplicity and speed, is quite different from the effectiveness of the fundamental institutions of a democratic public regime. The effectiveness of democratic institutions is not measured either with a stopwatch, or according to the number of decisions taken. It is measured by the degree of legitimacy. The dual legitimacy of the European Union by its European but also its national citizens, by its peoples but also its states, makes the European Union institutionally complex by its very nature. For that reason the extent to which these procedures can be simplified and speeded up is restricted by the whole complex system of dual legitimacy. We must bear that in mind tomorrow, when we come to vote on the amendments and the text.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These issues are tricky because they expose both the exaggerated self-importance of small states and the <span class="italic">folie de grandeur</span> of the big states. These issues can only be resolved by a greater sense of trust between partners – such trust that is the essential glue of successful federal pacts. This trust is precisely the quality that is needed so that we are able to ensure the successful accession of the new Member States. The fact is – and somebody should say this – that if the IGC fails to resolve the Amsterdam questions, enlargement must be postponed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Liberal Group supports the efforts of the presidency and of the Commission to build up the extra trust required. We support the main thrust of this report. We support especially those elements which expand the European Union’s capacity for action in global affairs: those that strengthen the status and the profile of the citizen, including the Charter; and those that will postulate further political reform in the interests of a strong executive and a mature parliamentary democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect the splitting of the Treaties is vital. So is retention of unanimity within the Council exclusively for the most serious questions. Liberals everywhere support ministers that will subscribe to the development of European parliamentary democracy. But we will be savage critics of those who prefer narrow self-interest and threaten the accession of new Member States.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It plays a secondary role, as do all those who are not part of a national government. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has always maintained that the intergovernmental method, which excludes elected Members and does not allow public debate, is a very significant weakness of the reform of the Treaties and a substantial barrier to its success.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, our assessment of this report is based on the fact that it is being presented in an unsatisfactory context, in which our priorities – an open, working democracy capable of rendering economic development environmentally sustainable, which ensures the respect and consolidation of the rights of the citizens and residents, and, most importantly, which is able to enlarge to include new Member countries in a short period of time – are not the same as those of the negotiating governments. The governments have one sole objective: to reach a unanimous agreement in Nice, whatever the outcome, so that they do not have to move on to some other city as obscure as Maastricht. </p>
<p class="contents">Although Parliament cannot take part in negotiations, it has a duty to indicate the way, to define clear options for the future, without pretending to take part in the actual negotiations and without being conditioned by governmental pressure or pressure from artificial comparisons, such as the comparison between large and small countries. </p>
<p class="contents">This report only partly achieves this objective, and this is why our Group was not able to be unanimous in its final assessment. But although the final decision was not unanimous, the Group was united in its view of the positive and negative points of this resolution. We fully support certain central points, but, unfortunately, our view is not shared by many national governments. The issues on which we agree are as follows: systematic extension, not extension on a case by case basis, of the majority vote to the Council; codecision; the urgent need to make the Charter of Fundamental Rights binding and to extend the possibility of recourse to the Court beyond the economic sphere; the provisions on closer cooperation and so forth. We are, however, very critical of the reduction of the constitution issue to a mere technical operation separating the Treaties into two parts, which, apart from anything else, would be very similar. </p>
<p class="contents">This is not the constitutional process, which should bear no resemblance to convoluted diplomatic negotiations and which, we feel, is essential to give the necessary boost to the integration process which, alone, can mobilise the citizens to strive for a better Europe. We consider that the insistence on maintaining the limit on the number of Members at 700, even when we become a 20-State Europe, unnecessarily penalises the regions and those whose political orientations are neither socialist nor conservative. In this regard, we hope that our amendment will find consensus in the House. </p>
<p class="contents">The Group is divided over double majority, closer cooperation, the number of Commissioners and security policy. In particular, as regards the subject of the number of Commissioners, we will support the balanced position of those amendments which ensure both sufficient representation of the Member States and the efficiency of the Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, this report may well be useful in assisting our two representatives in their often extremely frustrating daily work at the Intergovernmental Conference where others take the decisions, but to our citizens, it will seem about as clear as an interministerial memorandum. Most importantly, in the same way as the 1984 Spinelli Treaty, this report does not live up to the challenge of being a milestone, a clear, unambiguous indication of where we want to be with those who wish to be there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must also tell them that, within my group, there are differing views, according to differing national experiences. I will say the same thing here that I have said in my group: the debate is not whether we say yes or no to federalism. The debate is how to go about European construction at the point of enlargement. It is making sure that we do not just build a Europe of the States and a Europe of the people, but, especially, a Europe of the citizens. We must create a fully democratic institutional fabric. We know that there are democratic deficits and that they are considerable. At the moment the challenge in the face of enlargement is to achieve, as the rapporteurs have said, greater efficiency and greater democracy. The Intergovernmental Conference cannot end with the same disappointment that we had in Amsterdam. We cannot create an Amsterdam 2. We have to create a Treaty which gives rise to genuine European construction in which more than 400 million Europeans can share economic prosperity, a social dimension and a democratic life. This is the great challenge for the European institutions and for European politics.</p>
<p class="contents">My vision of European construction is compatible with the fundamental lines which are laid out in the report which we are discussing today. It is, of course, necessary to give the Commission the powers it needs and make it responsible to Parliament. This is precisely the issue. We must clearly define the different democratic powers in the field of European competences and we must know who is making decisions and to whom they are responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Parliament does not take a corporate position. Our minimum demand is that Parliament be treated as an adult which has to request that the Commission take certain responsibilities, but which also has to participate actively in European construction on behalf of the European citizens. On behalf of the European citizens, we have to ask today not only for that fine-tuning of decision making but also for the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaty. The Charter of Fundamental Rights must give citizens the capacity to demand compliance with these rights in the European courts. This is the position which we can adopt in our Group, asking for more efficiency and more democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What we urgently need today, on the eve of enlargement, is not to deepen the integration of the existing Member States at a faster rate. It is not to trot out the old federalist recipes of the European Movement yet again. It is not to propose a super-State again, with its own constitution, uniform rules and majority decisions. No, what we urgently need today, ladies and gentlemen, is to show some evidence of clear-headedness, to accept that economic and political integration cannot be taken any further and to design new forms of cooperation that are far freer, and that will enable 30 or more States to work together on a basis of mutual respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, it would seem that the latest debates within the most well-informed groups of society stop at the doors of this Parliament. In this matter, as in the case of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, our Parliament seems unable to depart from the federalist line it has been pursuing for many years. That approach leads to an impasse, to what Mr Tsatsos a moment ago, if I understood him rightly, called a Europe built on sand.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it takes us away from the concept of Europe as an association of states, an association of national democracies, and puts all the countries, great or small, that are afraid of being marginalised on the defensive. More generally, the rigid federalist approach reflects a more or less unconscious desire to set up institutional barriers against enlargement, which will once again call in question a whole range of long-standing patterns of behaviour. </p>
<p class="contents">We must adopt a more positive approach. We must promote enlargement by adopting a new form of cooperation that is more differentiated, shows greater respect for national sovereignty, that is based on full recognition of the Luxembourg compromise, as I explained in the minority opinion attached to the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Top class lawyers and accountants are being convicted one after the other because they have helped strip companies of assets and then left them with tax liabilities. Asset stripping is a punishable offence. The Intergovernmental Conference is designed to strip our constitutions and fundamental laws of assets and leave the voters with a democratic deficit, but constitution stripping of this kind is not punished. The asset under our constitutions is the right of voters to be heard and to choose representatives who can pass laws on our behalf. If we are dissatisfied with the laws, we can choose new representatives and obtain new laws. This is the beating heart of our democracies, a heart which, because of the constitution strippers, will stop beating. They are taking legislative power from our 15 national parliaments and transferring it to officials and ministers, from voters and elected representatives to the executive and from open assemblies to meetings behind closed doors in Brussels. Electoral power is being transferred from our constitutions, but is not being transferred to the European Parliament. We parliamentarians have been side-tracked. Power lies with the Commission and the Council of Ministers. The EU is not a parliamentary democracy, and the national parliaments have been still further marginalised. A number of us in this House have therefore prepared 19 proposals for democratic reform of the EU. We call the initiative SOS Democracy – “SOS” because it is a matter of urgency and “Democracy” because that is the heart of the problem. We do not have democracy in today’s EU. We should like to have it in tomorrow’s. We have different opinions as to how the laws should look. We have support across the political spectrum from communists to conservatives. We disagree about a lot but agree that our differences should be resolved in democratic parliaments. The voters in our countries should always have the last word. We reject any attempt to strip our constitutions of democratic content and we urge the public to get involved in the negotiations concerning the Nice Treaty before it is too late. Join us in SOS Democracy.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There has been a marked change in attitudes towards closer cooperation since the adoption of the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I can still clearly remember how long we used to spend discussing this, in what was still the institutional committee at the time. The upshot was that Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Tsatsos – whom I greatly esteem – produced a report highlighting the risks associated with Member States developing at different rates, and welcoming the fact that the Treaty would be framed in such a way as to keep these risks down to a manageable level. The present view taken by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen is that closer cooperation must serve to stimulate the development of the Union, and they even recommend that it should have its own chapter in the EU Treaty. This is an astonishing turn of events, when one considers that this idea was once deemed the ultimate threat to the integration process. A multi-speed Europe has become the order of the day. We are now looking, by way of an attempt to deal with enlargement, to the possibility of a third of Member States forming a “vanguard”. All this means is that those Member States not wishing to join the frontrunners will be left with a choice between complete non-participation or joining a system that was originally thought to be without merit at a later stage. Multi-speed integration of this kind cannot act as a guarantee for coherent and stable development of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, I am convinced that this plan is far more likely to jeopardise the Union’s goals than to help improve its decision-making structures. In any case, that was the view taken by the architects of the EU as recently as 1996. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to tell you how much I appreciate the very high quality of the report presented by your two rapporteurs, Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos and Jo Leinen, which we are now debating. The report is clear and comprehensive. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs has set out a determined position and I want to pay tribute to its work and that of its chairman, Mr Napolitano.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two comments to make on the report. The first is that, objectively speaking, the positions of your committee, which will probably be shared by the House when you come to the vote, are in many respects very close to the Commission’s. Parliament, like the Commission, has sized up the challenge facing the Union with the prospect of an unprecedented increase in the number of Member States which, by the same token, will accentuate their diversity. Your Parliament is aware that the reform of the institutions is necessary, that it must be tackled seriously and that, if need be, we must look beyond short-term national interests and offer the people a Treaty that is substantial enough to gain their support.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what is at stake in these negotiations, which we must bring to a successful conclusion at the end of this year, at the European Council in Nice. I would stress the ‘success’ rather than the ‘concluding’, for they are two different things. And success is what we need in Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">These changes are essential to the success of enlargement. In my view they are also necessary right now because in many respects the current institutional organisation is showing its limitations. I am thinking, for example, of the Court of Justice’s workload and of the log-jams we see in some areas because of the requirement of unanimity in the Council. Your Parliament has looked in depth at the decision-making system in the Council and at the composition and functioning of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 26 January you have been well aware of the positions set out by the Commission. For example, to make things quite clear with regard to the Commission itself, we proposed that each country should certainly have one Commissioner. But we also proposed two options on that basis. Either every country will have a national representative within the Commission at the same time, or not all countries will be represented at any one time. But, if you look at those two options I have briefly described, you will find that the states will be represented on an equal footing, which is not currently the case within the Commission. On this issue, as on others, we believed it was important, over and above the basic approach, to open up a debate, to take time to consider the pros and cons of the different options, and to decide between gut reactions that would consist of changing as little as possible and the long-term requirements of giving our institutions new impetus. Negotiations on these issues have scarcely begun. Whatever solutions are finally adopted, your debates, like ours, will help the Intergovernmental Conference to take more responsible and enlightened decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I note there is broad convergence on the qualified majority issue. Qualified majority voting should become the general rule for Council decisions, together with the codecision procedure for all matters that come within the legislative sphere. The Commission itself said just that and recommended a means of achieving these results by identifying the categories of decision where unanimity must or could be retained. We are well aware that certain Member States have difficulties with some of these questions. We know there are reservations about the tax system, to give just one example.</p>
<p class="contents">What the Commission, what the European Parliament must do is precisely to look beyond these reservations and sincerely, honestly and without any ideological bias consider the coherence and effectiveness of the single market. That is what we wanted to do with our additional contribution which describes the new area of qualified majority voting in relation to certain aspects of the tax system, certain aspects of social protection, to ensure the smooth operation of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">There is agreement between our positions on other points too, such as the composition of the European Parliament, closer cooperation, the creation of a new European Public Prosecutor’s office which, as Mrs Theato pointed out, will help us to fight fraud against the Community budget, the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance. And that does not surprise me, since the Commission and the European Parliament have always been very close in their thinking on these subjects and are inspired by the same concern for the general interest of Europe. We will continue along these lines until the negotiations reach their conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment relates to the active involvement of your Parliament, which is vital to our success. Because the European Parliament has its own special perspective on things, I want to stress how necessary Parliament’s commitment is, the commitment of each and everyone of you, first of all during the negotiations – as your representatives in the negotiating teams, Elmar Brok and Professor Tsatsos, are well aware, and indeed their contributions often put the discussions back into perspective – but also during the ministerial discussions. And I must say I was pleased with the most recent joint discussions that took place with your President, Nicole Fontaine, in Luxembourg the day before yesterday at the initiative of the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Gama.</p>
<p class="contents">But I also want to emphasise how important it is for us, outside our official and institutional establishments, to explain our activities and engage in dialogue with the national parliaments and the citizens of every EU country and with the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude by drawing attention to three particular aspects, while also noting that as we speak today a number of questions about the correct scope of the agenda of these negotiations have to some extent now been resolved. I think that is a good thing. In saying that, I want to pay tribute to the Portuguese Presidency and in particular to Jame Gama and to Franciscos Seixas da Costa for electing to adopt a pragmatic and objective approach, an approach that is as objective as possible and that consists in starting out from the needs and limitations of the existing system and proposing solutions. That suggests that we can work on the basis of the Helsinki mandate as long as today’s presidency has the political will to give an impetus to tomorrow’s French Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this is a reasonably substantial and difficult agenda, there are still a few subjects that have been left aside for the time being, which we regret. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> But it will soon be time for a decision to be taken, and, on behalf of the Commission, I would like to put forward three points for consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point concerns European defence. Since the Cologne Council, and in particular the Helsinki Council, the necessary structures are being set up, on an interim basis, within the Council’s General Secretariat. As provided for by the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Union is now preparing to carry out the Petersberg tasks and missions, i.e. humanitarian and evacuation missions, peace-keeping, crisis-management and, where necessary, peace-making missions.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussions are under way on relations between the European Union and Nato. The European Union Defence Ministers met on 28 February. The first working documents have now been drafted on civil crisis management. So we can see some progress and certainly a political will to move forward. My friend and fellow Commissioner, Chris Patten, can confirm this assessment of the situation as regards these questions. In a few weeks’ time, the European Council in Feira will have to decide whether the Treaty should be amended with a view to building on the guidelines of the Helsinki European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group of representatives has not considered these questions yet, but let me share a few ideas with you. Ladies and gentlemen, after matters relating to justice and the police, a security and defence policy is without doubt the last major common policy we have to establish. The existing Treaty, as amended at Amsterdam, has enabled us to make significant progress. We can see that today. But can we resolve everything purely within the framework of that Treaty? Let us leave aside, for today, the question of future of the WEU Treaty with the collective defence commitment it contains and the different statutes of the EU Member States and of Nato and WEU member countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking only at the Petersberg tasks, I do not think the European Council has given enough thought to the organisation within the Union of a political authority that will give instructions to the chain of command that is being set up. It may be that, before it concludes, the Intergovernmental Conference will have to consider the structures and appropriateness of the existing Treaty. I do not have all the answers to this question but I think it needs to be asked, and to be asked in the context of the Conference. I think it would be premature to close this file at Feira. Instead, President Gama, I hope the presidency will give an even stronger political impetus on the question of defence.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the EU’s democratic values. The negotiating body is making good progress, or so we are told by Antonio Vitorino who is representing the Commission in it. The interest that is being shown in this draft Charter and the support for its incorporation in the Treaty confirm what I regard as the need to reaffirm, over and over again, the fundamental values of the EU, to set down once and for all the principles shared by all the citizens of Europe. It is the same need that inspired your Parliament’s report drafted by Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber. One could say that these principles are self-evident. But, as we know, what seems self-evident sometimes still needs reasserting, for all the existing Member States and for those that want to join us, because democracy and respect for citizens’ rights are never won once and for all, but need to be fought for and defended again and again.</p>
<p class="contents">Your Parliament has considered these questions, as it has considered the existing Treaty provisions that would penalise any violation of the fundamental principles of the Union. The Commission is prepared for this debate, which I believe is a necessary one, provided we keep it clear of any polemics.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and final point concerns the reorganisation of the Treaties. The report before you discusses the constitutionalisation of the Treaties or, as we sometimes rather more modestly term it, the reorganisation of the Treaties. That is a question of terminology. Let me say a few words on this. The Commission, as you know, has asked the Robert Schuman Institute in Florence to carry out a feasibility study on separating the Treaties into two parts: the essential provisions on the one hand and the applied provisions on the other. This work is making good progress and I hope to be able to tell you the outcome soon. But just as a mountain grows larger the closer you approach it, let me stress that this exercise involves major technical and legal difficulties. </p>
<p class="contents">The Treaties are not complicated in the sense of deliberately wanting to discourage the reader; they are complicated because the expression of the common resolve of 6, 9, 10, 12 or 15 Member States, over the efforts of 40 years, is not a linear operation, nor is it always as logical and simple as might be imagined after the fact, unless you start again from scratch. But who would seriously suggest that? We have to start out from what we have. We must seek the best while remaining within the realm of the possible. Then, if this reorganisation of the Treaties proves possible and convincing – as I personally believe it will – it will be time to examine the procedures for amending these restructured texts. But the Commission wants to proceed one step at a time and for the time being we are sticking to the pragmatic and meticulous job of reorganisation. I hope to present the results in May.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude by repeating that I and President Romano Prodi are prepared to continue and intensify these joint discussions so that, together with the Council, indeed all together, we will succeed in achieving a genuine reform at the end of this year. As the Conference progresses, I believe it will become ever more necessary for us to take concerted joint action.</p>

I believe that this is one of the best reports which have so far been produced in the framework of IGCs over recent years. I am making this statement as former rapporteur on the Maastricht Treaty. By the way, Maastricht is not a strange city, Mrs Frassoni, it is a very exciting city where the Dutch-Flemish, German and French cultures all flow into one. Just try one of the pavement cafés and you will see what I mean. I will repeat this to Mrs Frassoni in Italian some time.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it is rather a shame that so many amendments have been tabled as this might affect the quality and balance of the report. The large groups should, therefore, restrict themselves to the absolutely necessary amendments during the vote. This seems the best way to retain the good work which the rapporteurs have put in. </p>
<p class="contents">As far as our Group is concerned, the resolution needs to be amended on a number of points. For example, we do not agree with the proposal in the resolution to restrict the number of Commissioners to 20 and to introduce a rota system for the smaller countries. One Commissioner per Member State seems a much better solution to us. In order to boost citizens’ confidence in the European Commission, it is vital that each Member State should have a Commission Member. Our Group, too, has therefore tabled amendments to this effect. </p>
<p class="contents">Next is the number of MEPs. The resolution argues in favour of the possibility of European lists. This is a sound idea, but if we want 10% of the European members on European lists, then this should not, of course, result in additional MEPs on top of the 700 which have been agreed upon. It is important that we retain a maximum of 700, with or without the European list. Parliament is already vast, the buildings are already packed and the whole thing has to remain workable. </p>
<p class="contents">The third point concerns the issue of unanimity. We believe that in an enlarged Union, decision-making should not always be blocked by an excessive right of veto. Unanimity should, therefore, be restricted to the bare essentials. These are constitutional issues such as the deployment of military troops and issues pertaining to territorial integrity. All other decisions should be taken by qualified majority with weighted voting, as is proposed, and – this is vitally important – with colegislative powers exercised by Parliament. We would also thank the Commission for this support. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by commenting on the Charter of Fundamental Rights. According to our Group, it is of paramount importance that this Charter be included in the Treaty. Work to this effect is being carried out, and we sincerely hope that a text can be produced which everyone can agree to incorporate into the Treaty. This is a key issue for the citizens of Europe.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This report is of great value and I therefore believe we should support it today by a majority in this Parliament, because this is an opportunity for a completely open debate on the great issues still facing us in Europe. This debate is going on between political and national groups in different Member States. Please allow me to make a correction, Mr President: there are no large and small countries here. Here we must consider ourselves to be small. In the past, the countries in Europe which considered themselves to be large tried to impose their hegemony by force. Here were are all amongst small countries, especially given the challenge of globalisation. I believe this should be an important element in our coexistence.</p>
<p class="contents">In European Parliament debates, political groups, citizens of different countries and diverse interests and prejudices come into play and this allows us to be aware of when we touch a nerve and of when it is necessary for us to take special care in what we do. Therefore, this is an important debate and I believe the Council should take account of the position we take.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I believe we should also try to introduce some vision and some idealism into this debate. I have always been against the idea that we had to deal with the ‘leftovers’ from Amsterdam. Leftovers are thrown in the bin. These are clear and fundamental challenges, which refer to and are linked to the membership of the Commission, the power of the President, fair contributions by the Member States and such important questions as closer cooperation, majority voting and – a vital issue – the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I say this particularly in view of the crisis which we have seen in a Member State as a result of the presence of a party whose fundamental values are contrary to the community of values which we hold here.</p>
<p class="contents">A final consideration: Commissioner Barnier has said that, before the end of the Conference, we must resolve certain problems relating to the chain of command. Mr President, in relation to the appeal to public opinion which we are making, I believe we must clearly affirm the principles of democracy and transparency and also the chain of command. We must not allow a situation where, while we are discussing this, a kind of Loch Ness monster reappears every month in the press. I understand the journalists, but we cannot allow a situation where crises are created by certain anonymous officials, who are frustrated mandarins, and certain ambassadors, who seem to behave like a Praetorian Guard, and who do not hesitate to make anonymous declarations in the press. Here, the only risk involved in democracy is the risk taken in elections. This is the risk taken by Minister Gama, Commissioner Barnier and by all of us. However, here in the gossip shops of Brussels we create a situation and certain centres of power which do not correspond to the principles of democracy and transparency, which are precisely the principles which we have to strengthen in this Intergovernmental Conference. I believe that it is important for all of the institutions to confront this issue responsibly. If not, the Intergovernmental Conference will not have been a success for our future.</p>

In just a few years’ time, the Union is to be enlarged to include almost double the number of Member States. The euro is to be introduced. We are to have a security policy worthy of the name, implement administrative reforms and, hopefully, win back some of the confidence our citizens have lost in the European project. </p>
<p class="contents">The Intergovernmental Conference should prepare the EU for these changes. It provides us with the opportunity to adapt our work to the new Member States and to the new tasks we have before us. It is a question of finding a balance between democracy and efficiency and of maintaining the historic balance between small and large countries. These are the questions which remain following the conclusion of the Treaty of Amsterdam. It is important in these discussions not to become lost in technical details and lose sight of the goal – that of making the EU more open, more efficient and more intelligible. We must all make sacrifices in order to achieve this goal. </p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, governments appear to have lost sight of this goal. The Intergovernmental Conference is making only limited progress, which is not the fault of the Portuguese Presidency. Probably what will happen is what usually happens: at five minutes to midnight on the last day, a compromise will be reached with which no-one is entirely satisfied. The talk is already of the next Intergovernmental Conference where the major questions will <span class="italic">then</span> be solved. We have heard this before. There is starting to be a surfeit of half-baked intergovernmental conferences. Our citizens have higher expectations than that, and we do not have much time. That is why we have to take the opportunity now. The EU must be changed in the way we Liberals have demanded, that is to say in the direction of transparency, public control, more explicit accountability, a clearer distribution of competences and a common constitution. Quite simply, the EU must become more liberal. The report includes many of our amendments, and I support these with few exceptions. </p>
<p class="contents">The challenges faced by the EU are exciting and historic. They should inspire us all to roll up our shirt sleeves. We are in a position to create something unique: democratic, competitive and peaceful cooperation throughout the continent. Instead, however, of awakening hope and enthusiasm, present developments appear, rather, to be giving rise to anxiety among governments. One might well ask what has become of political leadership and vision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like them to know that my scepticism, and any decision on my part to reject this report, is no reflection on them, but on this House, which does not have the backbone to confront the European Council with its own vision of what the future should hold for European integration.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">In terms of power politics, or following a constitutional line of thought, it is quite clear what the Council wants. It wants Europe to be run by the executive, to be under the leadership of national governments, a bring-and-buy for national interests. It wants the basic model for European integration to be intergovernmental cooperation. The European Council wants Europe to be under the leadership of a handful of States, it wants Europe to be run by a board of directors, and to pursue a nineteenth century style policy aimed at striking a balance amongst the States of Central Europe. The Council does not see a democratic deficit; it sees a lack of efficiency at worst. Separation of powers, public scrutiny of legislation, parliamentarianism, unrestricted legal supervision on the part of the European Court of Justice, binding fundamental rights, strengthening of the original European institutions – the Commission, Parliament and the European Court of Justice – none of these matters are of concern to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It is the task of Parliament to stand up to the Council and to present it with its own vision. Parliament must pluck up the courage to vie with the Council when it comes to determining the future of European integration. This is about nothing less than the rediscovery of democracy in the supranational sphere. It is about nothing less – and this is, or would be Parliament’s task – than making European unification public property. We have a long way to go before we achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">If you demand a constitutional process but satisfy yourself with the division of the Treaties into two parts, then this constitutional process is already at an end! If you accept without criticism that not only does the Council see itself as a legitimate representative of the States, it also claims to represent the people by virtue of the double majority, thereby depriving Parliament of its legitimacy, then we still have a long way to go before……</p>

In addition to the massive increase in supranational forms of decision-making, the proposal contains quite a few qualitative changes in the direction of federalism, among these the proposal to remove the national right of veto in the course of changes to large parts of the current Treaty and, also, the demands for a single EU constituency in the elections for the European Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that this transformation of the EU into a federal state is a blind alley in every way. The EU’s major problem today is not a lack of centralised power but a shortage of real democracy. What the Union needs in place of more supranationalism is democratic reform leading to a dramatic reduction in the Commission’s political power, to the legislative process in the Council’s being made public and to the national parliaments’ being given decisive influence. </p>
<p class="contents">Through the Treaty changes proposed in the resolution, the EU would become a Union wholly dominated by the big Member States. The power wielded by the major countries would be increased dramatically through the introduction of a system of “double simple majority” voting in the Council of Ministers. Their power would also be increased through the increase in their representation in the European Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">In an EU which has been enlarged by a further twelve States and in which seven hundred seats in Parliament have been distributed as proposed in the resolution, Sweden would have thirteen seats, Finland seven and Ireland five. This would mean that, in many Member States, important political powers would not be represented at EU level. This also shows how weak the democratic basis of such a Parliament would be. </p>
<p class="contents">Compared with other federal states, the “EU state” would, on this model, be unusually centralised and offer little protection to small constituent States. A comparison might be made with the United States in which the one chamber in a two-chamber system has proportional representation, while representation in the second chamber is the same for all constituent States. In the EU, the big countries would instead dominate both chambers on the basis of the proposal we are now debating. </p>
<p class="contents">For anyone who wants to change anything regarding monetary union or EMU, it is now, when the Treaty is being changed, that the opportunity exists. Many adherents of EMU on the Left have, of course, argued in favour of altering the nature of monetary union in such a way that the Central Bank is placed under democratic control and that the goals of economic policy are not merely monetary. It is noticeable that they are now completely silent and that it is now only the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left which is demanding the democratisation of monetary union. As you have perhaps noted, I am going to vote against the present resolution. </p>

I know it will also increase the size of the European Union as a trading block which in time will ensure that the Union as an economic entity becomes more competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that reform within the existing European institutions must take place. However, any changes within the internal decision-making procedures must be balanced and fair. We do not want to see a two-tier European Union in which larger Member States dictate the pace at the expense of the smaller Member States. For example, the report which we are debating today recommends a rotation system for the composition of the European Commission. This will mean that the automatic entitlement of smaller Member States to have one Member of the Commission will be downgraded.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that this is a particularly sensible proposal. 380 million citizens of the Union have an affinity with the Commission. Certainly, from an Irish perspective, Irish people recognise the importance of the Commission as an institutional body within the European Union. It is still the institution that controls the operations of competition policy, the common agricultural policy, the common fisheries policy and the common transport policy. The Union must draw nearer to the citizens of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also remember that some Member States, including my country, must hold a referendum on any Treaty changes that arise at the forthcoming IGC. The loss of an automatic right to nominate a Commissioner would certainly be a very difficult, if not impossible, proposal to sell to an Irish electorate in this referendum.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to return to the issue of extending the qualified majority voting system at European Council level. The Council represents the interests of the 15 Member State governments within the institutional framework of the Union and currently, under existing EU Treaties, unanimous agreement of the 15 Member States is required for any tax changes sought within the Union. The report we are discussing today seeks to extend qualified majority voting to all legislative activities except those of a constitutional nature. I believe that national Member States should retain the right of veto on taxation matters.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish taxation system is innovative in many ways and has contributed to our present growth rates. I do not believe that the extension of qualified majority voting to taxation matters at European Council level is a particularly welcome development.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, a house built on sand has no solid foundations. This parable was meant as a reference to faith and its foundations. Nonetheless, I was reminded of this parable during the IGC discussion. The relentless attempts to turn Europe into a political unity seem to be built on quicksand. Indeed, the citizens of Europe do not feel European and this will not change overnight. Still, the discussion on the EU’s future is peppered with concepts such as European citizenship. This does not exist by any stretch of the imagination and is simply quicksand! </p>
<p class="contents">In the IGC discussion or the present report for that matter, the end goal of European cooperation is not taken into consideration. What do we want to achieve as a European Union? I would be keen to hear the Council’s and Commission’s opinion on this. If there <span class="italic">is</span> a well-considered vision on the foundation of European cooperation, the European House will be on more solid ground and will be able to brave the bad weather. I share the minority view of Mr Berthu, a member of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, as it has been included in this report. This document does include a solid foundation for the Union, namely a cooperative of independent states, in which the national democracies enjoy the highest level of legitimacy. </p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the enlargement issue, the fact that Member States joining the EU can become fully-fledged Members of the Union should be central. “Degrading” acceding countries to second-class members does not do them justice and has unwanted political consequences. Instead of the idea of different speeds, I support the idea of carrying out only the core tasks, that is to say in cross-border policy areas, at European level. </p>
<p class="contents">Another specific point I would like to raise concerns the European Commission. This high official college should in future not have more or fewer than 20 members. If necessary, combinations of countries can alternate in appointing a Euro Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the policy of granting the European Parliament codecision in all cases in which the Council decides by qualified majority. This must, however, go hand in hand with sound scrutiny by the national parliaments of their “own” ministers in the Council.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The diversity of cultural traditions in Europe is not just a colourful mosaic of artistic activities but gives expression to cultural, religious and also national diversity, to a sense of belonging and a feeling of attachment to one’s native land.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Very often in the past, Parliament regarded culture as nothing more than a breeding ground for art. However, it is much more than this, and cannot be separated from a minority’s sense of identity and its self-perception, therefore neither can it be separated from the rights of these groups, which are to be respected. Most minority groups in Europe define themselves through their cultural traditions, and it will only be possible to afford them the protection they need if we make it possible for them to integrate into mainstream society, whilst respecting their own traditions. If we are to acknowledge and comprehend these traditions, we will have to do more than register the differences purely as ethnic characteristics or as a list of discriminations.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We hear so much these days about the dangers of disregarding the rights of minorities, and very often this takes the form of cultural discrimination. The debate about the human rights of minorities, xenophobia, and racism, particularly in the light of the enlargement process, is doomed to failure unless we re-define and extend our concept of culture. Otherwise we will end up endlessly repeating hollow words that do not mean anything to most people these days.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The Convention should take account of these thoughts in its drafting of the Charter on Fundamental Rights. In defining and reworking the concept of a minority’s culture, a new dimension will be added to this very important basis for identity, and cultural issues within the EU will not be treated as a mere colourful adjunct to our other very important responsibilities.</p>

British Conservatives cannot accept the report, based on the long list of ancillary items which are not on the agenda of the IGC.</p>
<p class="contents">We are concerned by the proposals for constitutionalisation of the Union, by the proposals to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaty, by the progressive diminishing of the distinction between the first and second pillars, by the proposal that the Council should adopt broad guidelines of economic, employment and social convergence policies by qualified majority. These are just some examples of the complex and controversial issues which are raised.</p>
<p class="contents">We are overloading the wish list of the IGC. The great danger, if all these extra items were to be adopted on the agenda, is that the deadline of December 2000 would inevitably be missed. Where would that leave the candidate countries like Poland and Hungary, whose government leaders have already expressed concern over the timetable?</p>
<p class="contents">We believe the IGC should concentrate on the essential institutional reforms. It should ensure that it meets the deadline, to enable the first wave of enlargement to include Central and Eastern European countries by 2004, and to continue any further necessary reforms with the full inclusion of our new partners. If the EU delays enlargement too long, it may make it more difficult, or impossible, for some candidate countries to join within the envisaged timetable. The President-in-Office addressed some of these concerns in his speech.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Barnier in his speech said that the intention is to succeed with the reforms, not necessarily to conclude them. Some people say that this is the last opportunity for reform. I do not think that is a very fair reflection on the extraordinary reforms that many of the candidate countries have made in the last 9 and 10 years since they were within the Warsaw Pact or formerly part of the Soviet Union. Our priority is enlargement. We should not confuse or reverse our priorities.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It sends a clear message to the IGC to be ambitious, to think long-term and not short-term, to think of how a Union with nearly double the number of Member States we have now can actually function effectively and to take this opportunity to change the Treaties, because future IGCs with nearly 30 states around the table will find it even more difficult than it is now to agree on reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">The report puts forward ambitious proposals, as one would expect of the European Parliament. If adjusted by the amendments by my group, it will be a well-balanced set of proposals, well-balanced notably on the delicate question of the equilibrium between large and smaller Member States. On the size of the Commission, for instance, the formulas that are likely to be adopted tomorrow will refer either to one Commissioner per Member State or to a smaller number, a fixed number of Commissioners. The Commission cannot go on expanding indefinitely. In the second case, it will be a rotating system, so that every Member State, large and small, has equal opportunities of seeing one of its nationals serve in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of the size of the European Parliament, we have also found a point of equilibrium, based on to a minimum number of Members for each Member State. Every state will, of course, have to make a sacrifice following enlargement, but a minimum number will be guaranteed, with digressive proportionality thereafter.</p>
<p class="contents">So the report is balanced and I think can be welcomed. It is ambitious. Some people are saying: ‘ The IGC will never agree to this point or to that point’. But we are not in this Parliament trying to guess the outcome of the IGC; we are trying to encourage it to move in a particular direction, in a more ambitious direction, to make sure that we actually have a Union capable of functioning effectively when we enlarge to nearly 30 Member States. That is essential for our future.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, we need to review the interinstitutional balance, representation within the Commission and the other institutions, the weighting of votes and the areas covered by qualified majority voting. Unanimity voting must apply to decisions of a constitutional and fundamental nature. Closer cooperation must make it possible to manage diversity and avoid getting bogged down, without calling the fundamental structure of the Union into question.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by our fellow Members, whom I want to congratulate, has been substantially improved over the course of the discussions. Nonetheless, the outlined reform will hit the small Member States hardest. That applies in particular to the provisions on the composition and operation of the institutions. A Parliament in which the ceiling of four seats per Member State, which does not allow for a balanced representation of the political forces, is unacceptable. The same is true of a Council in which the qualified majority rules have to be readjusted and whose proposed method of operation will inevitably lead to deadlock and inconsistency, and of a Commission in which the rule must be one member per Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, let me bring up the question of the seat of Parliament and call for the promise made to be respected. I am always surprised to see our Parliament, which sets itself up as the committed champion of respect for minority rights when it comes to others, go against this approach when it comes to deciding on the institutional architecture of our own House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Scottish National Party, which I represent, is committed in its manifesto and its general policy to the idea of Europe as a confederation of peoples, countries and regions, not as a sovereign federal union in its own right. That is something which the parties of European Free Alliance have in common and our votes will be cast in that light.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to draw attention particularly to Amendment No 138, in its interaction with paragraph 32 of the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report. Regarding its proposal for all-Europe lists of candidates, we in Scotland – a small nation within a large Member State – are seriously concerned about the practical disappearance of Scotland as a distinct entity within the Union This would also apply to Euskadi, Flanders, Galicia, Andalusia and Wales. The reduction in Members of the European Parliament that we would face, coupled with the arrival of new Member States which are smaller in population than Scotland or Wales and which would be fully represented in all the institutions of the Union, will certainly increase the pressure for and our people’s commitment to the idea of our own independence in this great European confederation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
