Behind the guise of ‘land reforms’ the so-called ‘veterans’ loot and occupy white-owned farms at will. These bandits shrink from no form of violence. The police stand by laughing at the brutal scenes of intimidation and even murder of honest citizens. Thousands, mostly black agricultural labourers, are also robbed of their jobs and driven from their houses. Despite the fact that the judiciary has branded these activities as illegal, the pillaging goes on undeterred.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the campaign of intimidation has now also turned against the judiciary itself. Various independent senior judges have resigned as a result. The ban on the publication of ‘incorrect’ news capable of causing panic and despair, is used with increasing frequency to muzzle the free press. Opposition leader, Mr Morgan Tsvangirai, was indicted earlier this year for infringing the same law.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to second the proposal of Mr Van Orden to put forward this man’s name for the award of the Sakharov Prize.</p>
<p class="contents">The orchestrator of this state terrorism is the 77-year-old dictator Robert Mugabe. He justifies his crimes with an appeal to a renewed liberation struggle, a fight against ‘evil capitalism’ and ‘evil whites’.</p>
<p class="contents">His Vice-President, Mr Joseph Msika, takes things even one step further. He recently declared that whites are not human beings. No comment. It is becoming clear that Mugabe’s excesses are causing him to lose all credibility as a national and regional leader. Still, the isolationist President still has his own friends here and there. At the Libyan festival of revolution last weekend, Mr Mugabe sat next to Colonel Khadaffi as the principal guest. A few days before, his host, Mr Ghaddafi, had given him an oil loan of USD 360 million and a gift of USD one million for his election fund.</p>
<p class="contents">This crystal-clear joint resolution asks the Council and the Commission to take concrete steps against the criminal policy of the Mugabe regime. No Member State should be allowed to shirk this.</p>

It was a land full of hope, the civil war was over and people wanted to embark on a new future. The oppositions between white and black would cease to exist. If we look at what has come of these plans twenty years on, we see chaos, poverty, possibly famine in prospect, no press freedom and certainly no democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, Europe cannot stand idly by, just as it could not in the past. I think, however, that Europe, in particular, must encourage Africa to condemn Mr Mugabe, because if we are not careful that situation may spread to other countries in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">What are our options according to my group? In the first place, we have to suspend aid. Food aid will be a different matter. If the reports are correct, Zimbabwe’s self-sufficiency may already be under serious threat, and this will certainly be the case in future. If that happens, food aid will have to be given, but of course it must not be distributed via the government bodies, since we know what will happen to it in that case. It must be distributed by independent organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also like an investigation to be carried out into what kind of sanctions can be used against Mr Mugabe and his clan personally. Can we take steps against possessions that they have in Europe, such as the freezing of bank accounts, etc?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like the Commission to investigate whether the rumour is true that people from Zimbabwe enabled to study at European schools and universities, are mainly selected from the circles of Mugabe and his henchmen. Is that correct and does the Commission intend to do anything about it? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The wretched fact is, of course, that Mr Mugabe has extended his term of power to an unreasonable length of time and has forgotten to settle the problem of land reform himself. The way in which he is now tackling it beggars all belief and is bringing his country to the brink of collapse.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore very disappointed that Zimbabwe is still, despite the misery befalling the country, involved in the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo. I am deeply disappointed that the land occupations that this country is subject to are throwing the whole economic system out of balance and that a country that is actually suitable for food production is now itself going hungry.</p>
<p class="contents">Much of the hope awakened by Zimbabwe has meanwhile been dashed. Consequently I am disappointed by the attitude of the European Union, which is unable to adopt a coherent stand in respect of Zimbabwe and to take the necessary measures on Zimbabwe that are required to consign the government of Mr Mugabe to the past, and to give a chance to the hope for a new age.</p>

If the Council and the Commission did not feel moved to act before, then it is certainly time to act now, before the Mugabe regime destroys all hope for what is potentially one of the most prosperous countries in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">The breakdown in the rule of law, the terrible human rights abuses inflicted on all sections of the population in Zimbabwe and the catastrophic economic situation have all been well documented and have intensified. The political opposition to Mugabe's regime has been in the frontline of attacks from Zanu-PF militants. The opposition press has been bombed and critical journalists have been routinely attacked. Opposition politicians in the movement for democratic change and their supporters have been the particular targets of harassment, violent intimidation, arbitrary imprisonment and murder. In the last few weeks, many MPs and party officials have narrowly escaped death after violent attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not some family squabble between Britain and Zimbabwe. Mugabe's regime is a destabilising factor in central Africa and his human rights record is of international concern. The economic collapse in Zimbabwe is pulling down neighbouring countries. In the last two days, senior black opposition activists visiting this Parliament have insisted that the crisis is nothing to do with land, but about Mugabe's desire to hold on to power. He faces defeat in the presidential election next year, but is trying to head this off with a savage campaign of brutal intimidation against his political opponents. We must recognise that democratic norms, protection under the law and basic human rights have been abandoned in Zimbabwe for all elements of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">It takes enormous courage to stand up for democracy, liberty and freedom of speech in such circumstances. Morgan Tsvangirai, as the leader of the opposition MDC since 1999, personifies this courageous stance and the struggle for genuine freedom in Zimbabwe and deserves international recognition for his stance.</p>
<p class="contents">I had rather hoped that we would have senior Council representatives here this afternoon. This resolution is aimed at the Council in particular because there are a number of high-level meetings taking place in the next few weeks. Can I have an assurance that today the secretariat will ensure that our resolution is passed to the Presidency, so that it can brought up at the informal meeting of ministers at Genval near Brussels this weekend and formally put on the agenda of the General Affairs Council on 8 October?</p>

The major powers did not find fault with the dictatorial nature and the corruption of the regime in Zimbabwe until its dictator, Mr Mugabe, started, in order to preserve his power, to make a few demagogical gestures calling into question the privileges of the white farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">France, which is less associated with this category of privileged people, is meanwhile continuing to unscrupulously support the dictatorship. The feigned indignation of all those who, here, are protesting against the violence of Mugabe’s regime, seems, in these circumstances, to be above all a hypocritical way of defending a handful of privileged people against the right to live of millions of farmers in that country. Even though some occupations of land by groups of poor farmers are violent, that only represents a small fraction of the violence that was imposed on them in order to despoil them.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, we express our protest against Mugabe’s regime, both against its dictatorial nature and its corruption, but also because that dictatorship continues to protect revolting social inequalities and the privileges of a limited section of society to which his clique and the rich white farmers belong.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not, however, associate ourselves with this joint resolution, of which we reject both the letter and the spirit. It is up to the population of the country to settle its accounts with Mugabe and his dictatorship. It is not up to those in collusion with the privileged minority and those who conducted or supported colonial violence to give morality lessons to that country.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also like to express our solidarity with the working population of Zimbabwe and our support for their right to take possession of all the land, without any repurchase or compensation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kinnock (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I must say to the last speaker that, as somebody British, I can confirm that my ancestors had absolutely nothing to do with the oppression or repression of the people of Zimbabwe. I would like to make it clear that I and my family are in no way guilty of colluding with anything that took place in colonial days.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important for us to recognise that this resolution is being debated here today at a very important time. It is an opportunity for President Mugabe to make the decision once and for all to step back from the brink, as Mr Van Orden has clearly said. In addition to the negotiations, which are taking place as we speak in Abuja between foreign ministers of the Commonwealth, there are a number of European Union initiatives including the intended visit to the southern African countries by the Belgian Foreign Minister, representing the Presidency and Mr Solana, the high representative.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of other things going on as well. Very importantly, in about three weeks, the preparatory team will be going out to prepare for the European Union's involvement – hopefully – in the March presidential elections. That makes it extremely important. But if it turns out that all those initiatives fail and he still turns his back on the willingness of the international community to have dialogue with him, then it will be time to take stock of what is happening.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say to Mrs Maes in particular that one of the reasons the Council and the Commission have not wanted to take urgent action, as some in this Parliament would perhaps have wanted, is the danger that what Mugabe wants is an excuse to call a state of emergency in Zimbabwe so he can cancel the election, stop the democratic process and stifle the official opposition as well as any opposition from the press and media. We need to understand the potential impact of anything that the European Union, or indeed the Commonwealth, does in order to tackle what is happening in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents">The defining moment will be on 8 October when the next General Affairs Council is due to take place. If no progress has been made by this time, if the dialogue has failed, if we say this is a useless procedure, then at this point it is essential that we adopt so-called smart sanctions. We should restrict visas to all Mugabe's associates and his government and identify those individuals with foreign bank accounts and freeze their assets. Those are smart sanctions that will not hurt the poor people of Zimbabwe but would certainly hurt those Zimbabweans who very much like coming to London to shop in Harrods or visit their children who are in British public schools. Those are the kind of important things that the European Union can do. Similarly we will have to look at the possibility of the suspension of development aid because that is how the Cotonou Agreement would suggest that we should proceed. At that time, we would have to express Parliament's view, as we say now, that insufficient progress has been made on land seizures, on political violence, on all of these things that others have raised.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I support the words of Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of the Opposition Party, who this morning on the BBC was very tough on Mugabe and I will quote what he said and finish with this: 'President Mugabe has clearly violated all the tenets of the Commonwealth and all other international organisations and should now be isolated from the international community.' We should heed the words of the leader of the opposition in Zimbabwe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was in what was then Rhodesia in the 1960s and there was a great deal of injustice in that country at that time. We had such great hopes for President Mugabe. We thought we had in him a liberal, serious, intelligent leader. Unfortunately, as we see the developing chaos and threats of famine and the destruction of the economy, we can but mourn the fact that he did not fulfil the hopes we had of him.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that the smart sanctions are the way to go, because already the ordinary people of Zimbabwe are suffering grievously, as they watch their country disintegrate into chaos. I urge all colleagues to support this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nine white farmers and 360 black farm workers have been killed in the chaos over the last few months. Thousands of black farmers have lost their jobs and their homes and the farms are unworkable.</p>
<p class="contents">Zimbabwe depends on the success of agriculture and the contribution of these farmers is vital to sustain its economy. There is money available from the United Kingdom government under the Lancaster House Agreement and there is a willingness among the white farmers to give up 80% of their land to settle the black families. Mugabe must accept such a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1970, Tanzania nationalised sisal farms, businesses and real estate, killing its private sector. The same happened in Uganda in 1972, when the Asians were expelled, and those two countries' economies have been bankrupt ever since. I sympathise with the farmers and farm workers of Zimbabwe, as my family was a victim of similar confiscation and nationalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">My family has lived in Tanzania for 166 years, much longer than many white farmers in Zimbabwe. We bought land from Deutsch-Ostafrika in 1876 and I still have a title deed. We lost land and property through nationalisation without compensation and I know what that means. I share the grief of the silent black majority in Zimbabwe, who continue to live in poverty. The poorest in Zimbabwe do not want to shoot, kill, loot and burn crops. They are hungry and unemployed. They need food, education, health, employment and shelter.</p>
<p class="contents">It was the vision and quality like Nelson Mandela that at last set an example for Africa that reconciliation, cooperation, democracy and respect for all people, irrespective of their colour, is the only way to govern a developing country the only way to help the poorest to be free of poverty and disease. President Mugabe must follow Mr Mandela and accept reconciliation and democracy, allow the white farmers to thrive and continue farming and accept that Zimbabwe belongs to the people of Zimbabwe and nobody has the right to deprive them of a decent life based on peace and democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No one can claim they knew nothing about it. In taking a passive line, the Council of Ministers is guilty of aiding and abetting. It is outrageous that, yet again, the Council's ‘Africa’ working party failed to pass a resolution at its meeting in Brussels yesterday. Obviously the presidency is only paying lip service to Africa, despite advertising it as a priority. Unfortunately, France is the ringleader of a group of Member States that obviously has a different agenda. How else are we to explain the fact that, while everyone else is either stopping or drastically cutting back on funding, France is increasing it.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Member States of the European Union who want to take a more active line to step up their collaboration, even before the Treaty of Nice takes effect, and to remind France and the rest that they are surely backing the wrong horse in taking this <span class="italic">de facto</span> passive line.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, my dear Mrs Kinnock, that Mr Mugabe will have no need of our resolutions or demands if he decides to impose a state of emergency. He will do so anyway because, even if the elections are held, he will lose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to explode the myth that this is about land and land ownership: This is about politics. This is about the fact that Mugabe knows that if they had the same votes that were cast last year in the general election, he would lose a presidential election. He is driving the farmers and their farm workers off the land, out of the constituencies, so that they cannot register to vote. It is plainly about politics. It is not about colonial powers. It is about politics.</p>
<p class="contents">Those farms are well run, they provide churches, schools and hospital treatment in those areas. The communities come together. 70% of Zimbabwe is about agriculture and the economy is being destroyed. We need smart sanctions to be taken on President Mugabe. He is not listening to placations. We have got to act and we have got to act now.</p>

Our analysis is the same as that which most of you have made: the sole objective of the Zimbabwean government is to stay in power, even if that means ending up destroying a country that not long ago was considered to be one of the soundest economies and democracies in Africa. The Zimbabwean government, which could have reasonably avoided this crisis, is therefore clearly responsible for this dramatic descent into hell.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s political objective, as many of you have pointed out, is that presidential elections should be held. The Union’s main objective is presidential elections in 2002, in the best possible conditions to enable change, as we say in conventional language. The Union’s position, if that is the objective, should therefore be to seek a balance between, on the one hand, indicating our disagreement with the current development of the situation and, on the other hand, preventing it from serving as a pretext for declaring martial law, which would have the effect of delaying the elections that we want to take place. Therefore, observing the presidential elections in 2002 is, in our view, the absolute priority for the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to what was said in your speeches on the implementation of Article 8, that is political dialogue (Article 8 of Cotonou), we approve the pursuit of political dialogue, while stressing, like you, that no substantial progress has been made in this dialogue in recent months. A small hope remains, which is the forthcoming visit by the presidency to the countries involved in the Congolese crisis, an event that could perhaps lead to this dialogue being revived.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the following stage is concerned, which is the implementation of Article 96 of Cotonou, which we call consultation and adoption of appropriate measures, again in conventional language, the Council will look at this issue at the beginning of October with, of course, our participation, and we will decide then whether or not we will take this step. With regard to the impact of this situation on development cooperation, we hope to be able to maintain the programmes that the Community funds in Zimbabwe, particularly in the health and education sectors, given the humanitarian and social nature of these programmes, in order not to penalise the population, which is already being heavily affected by the economic crisis. All this is taking place, as you have all said, in an extremely worrying economic and social context. In Zimbabwe this year we see that a cereal shortage has already occurred and that should be manageable if it was only a question of the cereal shortage and its consequences for the population. However, the serious instability prevailing in the country, the economic crisis and the societal conflicts that are taking place there are an important factor in a situation of food insecurity that we think, in these conditions, is in danger of becoming worse. It is therefore the interaction between the food situation, the agricultural shortages, in this case of cereals, the economic context and the political context, which contains the germs of a crisis that is probably even more serious than that which we are currently experiencing, and which we should do everything we can to avoid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
