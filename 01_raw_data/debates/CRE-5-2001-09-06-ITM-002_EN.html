<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Söderman,</span></span>   <span class="italic">European Ombudsman</span>. – Mr President, in 1993 the Maastricht Treaty established the right to petition the European Parliament and the right to complain to the European Ombudsman as rights of European citizenship. At the Nice summit in December 2000, these rights were enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The reports and resolutions which the European Parliament is debating today concern the present state of these vital constitutional rights of European citizens. I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this important debate, which goes to the heart of European citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">Before commenting on some of the reports, I would like to express my thanks to Commissioner Loyola de Palacio for continuing to ensure that the Commission respects deadlines for answers to the Ombudsman's inquiries and provides answers which are complete and accurate. This good cooperation is vital to ensure that the Ombudsman can deal with complaints promptly and effectively and thereby fulfils his mission of enhancing relations between the citizens and the Community institutions and bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to pay tribute today to the work of Mr Jean-Claude Eeckhout. He will soon be retiring from his post in the Secretariat-General of the Commission where he deals, amongst other things, with relations between the Commission and the European Ombudsman. To me, he represents the model public servant. He is devoted not only to the European ideal, but also to the hard practical work of improving administration for the benefit of citizens.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour and congratulate Mr Roy Perry on his excellent report. It is appropriate that Mr Perry should be the rapporteur, since he first launched the idea of such a code some years ago, in the report of the Committee on Petitions on its activities in 1996-1997. Jean-Maurice Dehousse, rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, has also played an important role. He has stressed that the code should have a firm legal basis and suggested a practical way to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this report will be followed by the rapid adoption of a regulation. The Nice Charter includes good administration as one of the fundamental rights of citizenship. I cannot understand why anyone should oppose the idea of Community law providing citizens with as high a standard of legal protection <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> the European administration as national laws already provide <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> the Member States' administrations.</p>
<p class="contents">The report of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the Statute of the European Ombudsman is unusual because the Treaty makes the European Parliament the legislator and also entrusts to it the power of initiative. The role of the Council is limited to giving its approval to the Parliament's text by qualified majority, whilst the Commission gives an opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur, Teresa Almeida Garrett, for the principled approach which she has taken to the legislative process. As she has emphasised, the original Statute was drafted nearly a decade ago. Its provisions concerning the inspection of documents and the hearing of witnesses need to be updated in the light of the greater emphasis on administrative openness and the need to gain the confidence of the public and promote a modern administrative culture at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">The report of the Committee on Petitions on the Ombudsman's Annual Report for the year 2000 is also before you. I congratulate the rapporteur Mr Bösch for his excellent and constructive report, which rightly focuses on the need to serve European citizens effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with the rapporteur that the Ombudsman should deal with complaints as quickly as possible. To this end, we have continued our efforts to eliminate unnecessary delay by insisting that the institutions and bodies respect the deadlines for responding to complaints and by improving our own efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made progress towards achieving our internal management targets of acknowledging complaints within one week, deciding on their admissibility within one month and closing inquiries within one year. At the end of August last year, there were 65 cases still open after one year. By August 2001 the comparable figure was 25 cases. Of these, one remains open because we have submitted a special report to the European Parliament. In five other cases, the Statute lays down that the institution concerned has a further three months to produce a detailed opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bösch's report also refers to the problems which the Committee on Petitions has faced in obtaining the information needed to deal effectively with citizens' petitions. An example of such problems is the case of the petition concerning the regulation of the Lloyd's insurance market.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the most effective way to improve the situation could be through strengthening cooperation between the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions, especially in relation to petitions about infringements of Community law by Member States, where the Commission plays a vital role through the so-called Article 226 procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">We would be ready to handle the preparation of such cases in a professional way and thereby facilitate the work of the Committee on Petitions.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I am ready to enter discussions with the committee and the European Parliament's administration to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, I shall make some brief comments about the Commission's recently published White Paper on governance.</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper contains much talk, but few concrete proposals for action to benefit citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It could have contained firm commitments to: propose a law on good administrative behaviour, to ensure the rule of law and respect for citizens by the EU administration; reform the way that the Commission acts as Guardian of the Treaty in order to make the procedure open, fair and understandable; advise officials to use their freedom of speech to promote debate and help focus citizens' attention on European issues; reinforce the legal advice service to citizens in the Commission representations, thereby promoting the correct application of Community law. But it does not.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry to say that the Commission seems to have forgotten European citizenship. This neglect is illustrated in a brochure which the Commission has recently published called <span class="italic">Who's who in the European Union</span>. The brochure mentions the Charter on Fundamental Rights and the fact that the European Parliament exercises democratic control over the Commission's activities. However, it contains no reference to citizenship or to the right to petition the European Parliament or to complain to the Ombudsman, which the Nice Charter includes as fundamental rights of European citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to call the present Commission back to the road of making European citizenship a living reality. It is the only way to obtain the confidence of the citizens, which today seems more lost than ever before.</p>
<p class="contents">Citizenship may be less fashionable than the more technocratic sounding ‘governance’, but there are no technical solutions to the deep gulf between the rulers and ruled in Europe. This gulf was revealed not just by the Irish referendum but by every other referendum on Europe in the last decade and also by the events in Gothenburg. It can be bridged only slowly, by the development of European citizenship in an honest, fair and just way.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bösch (PSE), </span></span>  rapporteur. <span class="italic">(DE) –</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to congratulate the Ombudsman most warmly on the work which he and his colleagues carried out in 2000, and would like to lay before you some figures to emphasise these congratulations and this esteem, and which underline how this People's Advocate has become an institution whose absence from the European scene can no longer even be contemplated. In 1995 there were only 298 complaints; in 2000, to which my report refers, there were by contrast 1732.</p>
<p class="contents">There were of course many cases which, in the final analysis, were not within the remit of the European Ombudsman. However, the excellent networking of the European Ombudsman, which is to be further intensified in the future, resulted in the cases and complaints in question being passed on to the appropriate agencies. An Ombudsman is there, after all, for the citizens, and there is sometimes confusion about who is responsible for what.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman has already addressed many of the points made in my report. The ever shortening turnaround times are greatly to be welcomed; here, the Ombudsman is an example of good administrative practice on a European scale. Eighty-three per cent of complaints were against the Commission. I do not wish to make this an accusation levelled at the Commission; the division of competencies makes it quite obvious who is most going to be complained about. What I, however, find interesting is what the complaints focus on. In 28% of cases, it is a lack of transparency or the withholding of information, and in 24% avoidable delays. Over half the complaints, therefore, focus on these two areas. What this is about, Commissioner, is good governance. It is precisely in these areas that we could improve European administration at no cost whatever.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I consider it quite remarkable – and this is something that must be said very clearly in a Parliament such as this – that those at the top of the Commission have neglected to consult the European expert on good governance – namely the Ombudsman – about the White Paper on the subject. So I must ask you, Commissioner, how seriously you are taking the improvement of administration across Europe. We do not need White Papers, we have an Ombudsman who gets complaints from our fellow citizens every year. All that is needed is willingness; not repeated postponement and the commissioning of reforms and White Papers and studies and who knows what else; what we need is different administration.</p>
<p class="contents">That is perfectly clear from this report, in whose appendix I have taken the opportunity to discuss specific examples. There is an instance, Commissioner, of a submarine. You will be well aware of what significance submarines had for the previous Commission and what the consequences were. If the European Ombudsman needs to intervene nearly a dozen times in order to get the Commission to certify that such a submarine had work done on it, then that tells you something about the new Commission. If this Commission took until 2000 to concede that submarines existed, then whom are you trying to convince that this Commission is willing to take transparency and – let me say this as a Socialist – the protection of employees' rights in Europe seriously?</p>
<p class="contents">I really would like our Ombudsman to follow up instances like this rather more stringently in order to give them the critical attention they deserve, for the alternative would be undiluted flattery, credible to nobody. Mr Södermann, I would again ask you, as I did in the report, to consider presenting a special report on the issue of access to documents and data. Otherwise, I can only repeat my thanks to you for your work. In these thanks I wish to include your colleagues. I believe your work has become a quite central building block for the further development of the European Union, and I hope that it will continue as it has begun.</p>

I do not want anybody to think that the issues addressed in the joint debate this morning are not themselves of the utmost importance.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is a great ideal. The institutions are undoubtedly worthy and officials of the institutions seek to discharge their functions responsibly. As the Ombudsman himself said this morning, unfortunately the institutions of Europe do not enjoy the highest reputation amongst our citizens. It is critical, therefore, that every step is taken to ensure the quality of the administration of European affairs by the EU institutions. In Parliament we have the Petitions Committee and the Officer of the Ombudsman to oversee allegations of maladministration. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work of Herbert Bösch in his report on the Ombudsman, my colleague on the later report, Felipe Camisón on the work of the Petitions Committee and Mrs Almeida Garrett on her work on the Statute of the Ombudsman. We need a new framework agreement so that the Member States also pay more serious attention to their obligations under the EU Treaties. We should also place on record our appreciation to the Ombudsman and to his staff for the calm and efficient way in which they discharge their functions. It cannot be easy to be the complaints department of Europe. It requires special skills and Mr Söderman has shown us that he has those in abundance.</p>
<p class="contents">To turn to my own report proposing a code of good administrative behaviour, this has been a long time in the gestation and in the last Parliament there were reports from myself and from Mrs de Esteban proposing a code of good administrative behaviour. I am grateful to rapporteurs from the Citizens' Rights Committee and the Legal Affairs Committee, in particular Mr Dehousse, who have pointed to a procedural route that could, and will I hope, enable us to get this code. There are two central principles if the code is to be fully effective. One, it must be based in law. Good administration is a right, not a privilege and the code must be uniform for all the institutions. Citizens need to know where they stand and precisely what their rights are in dealing with the institutions. The right to good administration is enshrined in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. But without this code, the charter would just be a form of words. This code is to put flesh on the Charter of Fundamental Rights. It is a concept that is contained within similar laws in most of the Member States. Spain, is just one example. Its 1992 administrative law requires that citizens be treated with respect and cooperation by the authorities. Germany and its unfair practice law dating from 1909 enforces good practice upon its officials. The European Union must now follow suit with its own code of good administrative behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate that the Commission in particular, but also the other institutions, have adopted and are applying their own voluntary codes. They are good as far as they go, but they do not go far enough, and they have to be obligatory rather than voluntary. There are, however, some differences between the proposed code as now drafted by the Ombudsman, which I hope that this House will support, and the codes currently in use. I would refer just to one of them and that is the requirement that when an error has been made the official concerned has to apologise to the citizen who has suffered as a result. A readiness to apologise never comes amiss, so I particularly support that particular clause in the draft.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, British Members like me are often against written constitutions. They are alien to our tradition. They seem to us very often to concentrate on giving power to those in authority and ignoring the rights of the citizen. But from the Magna Carta 1215 to our citizens' charter of the 1990s, we in Britain have welcomed codes that set out citizens' rights. I hope that fellow Europeans will see this as a contribution to the good governance of Europe that even British Members can support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We feel that this is a fundamental objective of European integration and, as such, an area that unites us with everyone, in the sense that we are all on the same side, civil servants and politicians, taxpayers and administrators. Since 1994, European citizens have had their own Ombudsman and know that they can rely on him and his actions, always competent and judicious, to protect their rights and to sensitively and ceaselessly endeavour to correct and improve the running of Community administration.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, the Ombudsman has always been able to count on the support of this Parliament. In the course of recent years and through the presentation of annual reports, we have been able to see the increasingly visible affirmation of this still young institution and the increasingly consistent and productive results of its worthy activity. The time has come today to present you with some amendments to its statute. We are not of course, talking about a revolution. Time has proved, and the practice employed by the Ombudsman is an example of this, that the powers and the competences granted him have always been used to fulfil the central objective of his activity, in his ceaseless quest to improve the sound administrative practices of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are discussing today is simply the adaptation of the Statute’s provisions to the new legislative climate which has, fortunately, been making considerable progress towards the construction of a genuine Europe of the citizens, by improving the speed of a modern administration, which must be increasingly open and transparent. By clarifying the Ombudsman’s powers of investigation, by giving him all the resources for accessing documents and for uncovering the truth, we can be sure of improving the administration’s operating conditions and of bringing the public closer to the various European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to say one last word, Mr President, simply to mention the only area which has, on occasions, divided us, on which today an amendment to my report will be tabled which I cannot support. It concerns the possibility for members of the institutions or more specifically, members of the Commission to also be heard by the Ombudsman. I am convinced that the majority of this House will understand that given the hazy border that sometimes exists between political and administrative acts, Parliament claims for itself the monopoly on political control of the members of the Commission, as the prerogative of those who have been directly elected by the citizens of Europe and that it acknowledges that this power cannot be delegated. It is in recognition of this common philosophy that this Parliament, and its rapporteur in particular, hope that the Commission, especially Commissioner Loyola de Palácio, will deliver a favourable opinion and that the Council will approve the amendments that I have tabled today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A special thank you goes to Mrs Almeida Garrett, who has succeeded in putting her case with great ability, and has also been successful in conducting intelligent mediation.</p>
<p class="contents">Society advances and the law always follows its progress. Sometimes that progress is rapid and the law seems slow compared with practice. That is why I think the Ombudsman is right to propose amending Article 3 of the statute, which dates from the 1990s.</p>
<p class="contents">However, together with other members of the Committee on Petitions, I felt that the request to amend Article 3 went too far, in particular as regards the obligation to testify, even for members of the Community institutions. This is because there is a difficulty and confusion, including legal confusion, between control of the institutions’ administrative practices and control of political acts of members of those institutions. There was therefore a need to maintain greater balance, although there is no intention to slow down any investigation, for clarity and above all in defence of proximity and transparency, fundamental pillars contained in the Union’s Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the solution adopted of partial revision, to which the Ombudsman has also contributed with his final letter accepting the positions of the rapporteur, Mrs Almeida Garrett, and the Commissioner, is the best way forward, and in the future appropriate steps can be taken to carry out a more systematic and juridical revision of this statute, respecting Community legislation and continuing to act in accordance with that principle of proximity and transparency which governs – and should continue to govern – the relationship between European citizens and Community institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proclamation of the Charter represented an important step forward for the citizens of the European Union, even if there is controversy as to what legal reality this proclamation has achieved in the meantime. In any case, the continuation of this important process demands further efforts at every level. The Charter further laid down, in addition to other important things, a triad of significance to EU citizens which is echoed in the three reports before us: petitions, the Ombudsman and good administration. For this, the three rapporteurs, Mr Bösch, Mrs Almeida Garrett and Mr Perry, to whose report I have the honour of speaking, deserve especial thanks and also congratulations.</p>
<p class="contents">In reinforcing the triad I have referred to, they have achieved an important step forward, for there is a need for the creation of a further substructure, a network, to secure these institutions for the citizen. It will now be exciting to see how this network's ramifications will develop. The law has many instruments through which to turn rights into realities – constitutions, laws, regulations, decrees, right down to service instructions. In all these, the principle applies: the more generally a right is formulated, the higher up this hierarchy it should be set, and the more specifically, the further down it.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is good that we have a code for good administrative conduct before us, and it is right to encourage the Commission to make a regulation for this purpose. When this regulation is put into tangible form, however, we must keep a careful eye on its precise final content. In Germany, there was at one time a regulation which stated that a soldier had to start swimming, once he reached a depth of 80 cm of water. Write this into a constitution and comedians will have a field day with it. And so it was with good reason that this was not in the German constitution, but in a service regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it to be important that administration should be well organised. This does not only mean ensuring that the right decisions are taken but also touches on the question of how administration comes across to the citizen – at the shop counter, as it were. This is very important. Modern administration means that the citizen is not the authorities' supplicant, but one of its customers. Modern administration involves the authorities not thinking of themselves as superiors, but as providers of a service. That is what they are there for, and the citizen is entitled to expect good services.</p>

Also Mr Söderman for his continued unstinting defence of European citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">The approach of these reports is based on the need to create a system of transparency and understanding, so that citizens of the European Union can be confident that when they have a legitimate complaint they have recourse to the Ombudsman or the Committee on Petitions, depending on the nature of their problem. It is important that we clarify for the public the distinct functions of the two institutions and press for more publicity and a more effective information policy for both the Ombudsman's office and Parliament's petition process. I fully support the view that is necessary to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the treaties of the Union, so as to further enhance the rights of citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">To succeed as the most progressive combination of States, we must ensure that our institutions are fully democratic and accountable and that the individual and collective rights of all are guaranteed and defended. I congratulate the Ombudsman in particular for succinctly identifying – perhaps one of the few to have done so at European level – the underlying reason for the failure of the Irish referendum and that is the gulf between rulers and ruled. There is absolutely no doubt in my view that that is the case and it has given rise to all kinds of concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">The Bösch report quite rightly praises the cooperation between Parliament and the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman's office and the invaluable procedure of referring complaints to the Committee on Petitions where they fall outside his remit. I welcome the Ombudsman's suggestion that there be a much closer working relationship between the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman's office with regard to the legal implications of some of the cases that come before us.</p>
<p class="contents">The Perry report is another piece of important work and, as the Ombudsman has said, it is appropriate that Mr Perry, the author of the report, is given a role in initiating the whole idea of a code of conduct at European level. It is essential that a common code of conduct applies in all our institutions, so that citizens are not baffled or bamboozled by the response of our institutions to their problems and complaints. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear that the Ombudsman, reinforced by the Charter, plays an increasingly meaningful and forceful role in protecting the citizen from abuses of executive authority.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tabled one amendment to Article 3 of the Statute, which would bring Members of the Commission and Members of Parliament as well as members of the agencies of the Union, such as Europol, beneath the purview of the Ombudsman. The Commission opposes this reform on the grounds that it implies political interference, but we believe that the Ombudsman is perfectly capable of distinguishing between maladministration and defective politics. The right to inquire into the conduct of those supremely responsible for administration is an essential part of good governance and a necessary complement to, not a substitute for, the work of this Parliament in exercising democratic accountability in relation to the College. In most, if not all, Member States national ministers are subject to inquiries by the national ombudsman and it would be a pity if European standards of good administration fell below the norms now established in our Member States. In fact, in our view, they should be superior. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to say that the Committee on Petitions may even be the very committee in this Chamber that is able to find solutions to the gaping chasm that exists between the people and the decision-makers. In my opinion these annual discussions are always among the highlights of the year and it is most agreeable to be able to participate in them.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bösch’s report on the annual report on the Ombudsman’s activities reiterates this call by Parliament for making the Charter of Fundamental Rights a binding component of the Treaties. This deserves our enthusiastic support as this may just be one way – as Mr Bösch and the Committee state – to reinforce and broaden the scope of the right of petition instrument. Some day it might evolve into a real citizens’ initiative, found in the legislation of some Member States. With regard to the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour, the subject of Mr Perry’s report, Parliament takes the view that what is needed is a law that is binding on all the institutions making it obligatory that administration should actually serve the people. It is quite clear that the Commission should now be promoting this swiftly and determinedly.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Duff has already referred to Teresa Almeida Garrett’s report on the Statute of the European Ombudsman, and I have to say his arguments convince me that it should be possible that members of the institutions can also if necessary be heard by the Ombudsman when it is a matter of administrative error. In my opinion, Members of Parliament have nothing to fear from this as the Ombudsman’s competence is administrative and not political. I hope Mr Duff’s amendment will be widely supported.</p>

As I see it, the rapporteur, Mr Perry, is strongly advocating a code of conduct which reflects the aims guiding those who drafted Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, namely the citizens’ right to good administration.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, such a code calls for good administration by all those involved, institutions and officials alike. Furthermore, it should be implemented in the same way within all institutions. The code must be as widely known, as transparent and as accessible as possible to the citizens and should help to make the European institutions more credible and bring them closer to the citizens. Incidentally, I have to say that we still have a long way to go to achieve this. In addition, there must be no discrimination for reasons of sex, race, colour, ethnic origin, language or religion when implementing the code.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, Mr President, I think it is worth mentioning that, even in this institution, far more zeal than usual is displayed in asking one of our German colleagues for her card. It so happens that the lady is of Kurdish descent, with a dark complexion and black eyes and therefore does not look like the average Member. If such behaviour goes on here, in this very House, imagine what can happen in the wider world. It is therefore essential for the code of conduct to be implemented with no discrimination whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">The bodies already implementing the code of good conduct proposed by the Ombudsman deserve to be congratulated. I should also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Ombudsman himself on his work.</p>
<p class="contents">Through the citizens’ complaints the Ombudsman and the European Parliament’s Committee on Petitions on which I sit have become very aware of how much more still has to be done to make the European institutions more credible and bring them closer to the citizens. It is for us to work to promote such closeness and credibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We feel that giving access to all the classified documents from a Member State without the consent of that Member State, even if the documents could concern diplomatic or defence issues, is a very dangerous precedent, especially if this revision is in some way imposed on the Member States. The perverse result of this measure, if it were adopted, would obviously be that the Member States would be encouraged to retain classified documents rather than passing them on to Community bodies, and this is why my group cannot support this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, with regard to the Bösch report, we do not entirely share Mr Bösch’s optimism on the analysis of the activity of the European Ombudsman. It is true that the work done by Mr Söderman’s department seems quite remarkable given the modesty of their resources. However, just over 1 700 complaints received in 2000, of which only 297 have been declared admissible, does not demonstrate good administration by the institutions of Europe, it shows above all a lack of information to citizens on their means of defence against some aspects of Brussels bureaucracy. As for the tenor of the complaints lodged, which were mainly against the Commission, we feel they are symptomatic: refusal of information, lack of transparency, delayed payment, abuse of power, injustice and even discrimination are the main grievances. It is on the basis of these grievances that I think we should continue our discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We fought for a long time to obtain a proper statute so that the Ombudsman might have the opportunity to inspect everything. That battle was lost but must now be joined again. The statute should be revised so that the Ombudsman is entitled to see each and every document before he has to pronounce upon a matter. The Ombudsman must, of course, respect privacy and reasonable demands for confidentiality, but he must have the opportunity to see everything. If the Commission’s officials themselves can decide what they want to have inspected, then it is not of course the role of an Ombudsman we are talking about here, but a public relations function. The European Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control has the same problem. The Commission itself decides what it wishes to have inspected. Even the Court of Auditors does not have the opportunity fully to inspect the Commission. The President explained in the Committee that he too is not allowed to see every document.</p>
<p class="contents">This is where Mr Prodi ought to begin, instead of issuing further empty promises about more transparency and a closer relationship with the people. The Ombudsman and the Court of Justice have done some good work in the interests of greater transparency. Mr Söderman deserves a lot of praise, but the new regulation on transparency will not constitute great progress towards transparency. Instead, it is in danger of being an actual setback. There is therefore a need now for active efforts on the parts of the Ombudsman, the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control. A number of active members of the Committee on Budgetary Control have brought legal proceedings against the Commission, and these are something which the whole Parliament should support. The Court of Auditors ought not to accept a single refusal to let it see a document. If the event of such a refusal, Parliament should make it known that it is not giving discharge. And why – I would ask the Ombudsman – not appeal to the people and go before the Court of Justice in the event of what you consider to be an unjustified refusal to grant access to documents? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Again we see that the world has not yet managed to allow the principles of the Enlightenment, which have found their way into American case law via the Constitution and the Freedom of Information Act, to travel to Europe, because the Enlightenment unfortunately made no inroads into the French administrative tradition. That is again how one experiences these various speeches. It is a bitter experience to find that the EU is still where it was on 17 December 1992, when dealing with the draft on the Ombudsman. In any case, however, here we are, and I believe that this time we will win.</p>
<p class="contents">The many complaints from citizens having problems with EU institutions are essentially to do with so much still being withheld or suppressed. What is now being proposed in the Garrett Report, which in my opinion can only be supported, is only the first step. At first it should be the Ombudsman who is actually given access to all documents, but then it should also be the citizens themselves. We urgently need here a reversal of the burden of proof; I would, indeed, demand of the Ombudsman that he should tell us in future what documents he has still not received where regulations on confidentiality have been invoked, and that we should, by means of this reversal of the burden of proof, reach the point where we really are living out a democracy and, as far as possible, have access to all documents and also to public sittings of the Council. For I am firmly convinced that a democracy cannot exist without transparency.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wyn (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I welcome all these reports but will concentrate this morning on the Bösch report, highlighting the very important work carried out by the Ombudsman which goes some way to respecting the idea of transparency and open governance. This will hopefully show citizens that Europe's institutions do endeavour to act in the interests of its people and that cases of maladministration will always be punished. Of course the Ombudsman's powers are limited, but I am happy that the report demonstrates that the Ombudsman does his utmost in most cases in the name of fair play.</p>
<p class="contents">The bulk of the Ombudsman's report consists of a thorough account of the complaints made to him about maladministration by the European institutions, the investigations his office has carried out and the action taken, including, of course, the results. However many complaints addressed to the Ombudsman still concern actions by national authorities, for which the European Ombudsman is not competent, and many complaints prove not to merit any action. The number of cases where the Ombudsman's intervention has proved successful for the complainant shows that the Ombudsman has developed efficient ways of ensuring that the European institutions comply with his recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman's special reports, based on his right to own-initiative inquiry, make an important contribution to the interpretation and development of Community law. I particularly welcome the fact that, in connection with the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Ombudsman has strongly urged that the Charter recognise the citizen's right to an open, accountable and service-minded administration. Community bodies have a duty to shape Community policies and law in a way which is beneficial and comprehensible to citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have never had any illusions that this Nordic guarantee of legal certainty, which is of course what the Ombudsman <span class="italic">is</span>, would revolutionise the EU bureaucracies, but if only the Ombudsman could clear just a few negotiable paths in the EU jungle, we should view this as progress. The Ombudsman does not have an easy time of it. It requires a great deal of patience to put up with the EU systems’ inertia. The Ombudsman’s very moderate proposals for a Code of Good Administrative Behaviour for the individual institutions has of course been met with that mixture of verbal good will and practical passivity which, in practice, can block any progress, and the current restrictions upon the Ombudsman’s ability to obtain any of the relevant information on the matters with which he is dealing – we are concerned here with Article 3 of the statute – is downright scandalous.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman is patient, however. The institutions shelve recommendations and enquiries, but that does not cause the Ombudsman to give up. The mill turns slowly, but I believe it turns all the same. A regulation concerning good administrative behaviour – and which is not ineffectual nonsense from the Commission, but the Ombudsman’s own proposal – is something that we shall be able to support. Such a regulation will not revolutionise the various forms of administration. For that, fundamental changes to the administrative culture are required, and these will not come overnight. However, the rules can help develop legal certainty and transparency. Accordingly, we are able to support the proposal to amend Article 3 which, in its present state, really means that the institutions can refuse to provide the Ombudsman with the information needed for him to be able to exercise any supervision at all. I do not consider the proposal to be far-reaching enough, but limited progress is better than nothing. I wish Mr Söderman every success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to convince people that the work of the Ombudsman is not just important, it is crucial to the proper integration of the European Union. Unfortunately, a great many of our fellow Members still do not know this. Luckily, these duties are being carried out by the experienced Mr Söderman, with his usual degree of enthusiasm for the job.</p>
<p class="contents">I drafted the report on the application of Community law and saw the huge problems caused by the poor application of Community law at first hand. This is not just a legal problem, it is also a social problem, because the society of European citizens malfunctions as a result, and it is a political problem, because it reflects how mature we are about the type of European legal order we want. At the same time, I saw the huge role played by the Ombudsman in ensuring that this legal order operates smoothly in the Community. I need only remind you that most infringements of Community law are only discovered as the result of the complaints system.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I want to make in connection with the regulatory role of the Ombudsman is that the right of complaint and petition is tending to develop into a conciliation procedure for resolving differences amicably, which is the only way of settling differences flexibly and cheaply and freeing up the Court of the European Communities. However, first of all we must do everything humanly possible to find a way of cutting down the time taken to complete the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close by pointing out that we need a generally applicable code of conduct on general principles and that individual organisations should only have their own code of conduct on matters which relate specifically to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The institution of the Ombudsman is very important, and it is important that we should all constantly keep an eye on it and ensure that it can thrive, in the light of the new developments too. The Ombudsman himself stated that there is a gulf between the EU and its citizens. We do a lot of talking about it, but in reality we bring about very few radical steps to change the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the reasons why people cannot fathom the EU system is also, of course, the utterly hopeless way in which we have organised ourselves, with a physical presence in Luxembourg, Brussels and Strasbourg, and I think one might well ask whether it is particularly appropriate for the Ombudsman to be located here in Strasbourg, though this is, of course, also partly due to the Ombudsman’s own decision. I do not think it is appropriate. I think it means that the Ombudsman is very easily sidelined in relation to the EU’s other institutions which he has, of course, to inspect but then also to reform, and I am inclined to think that it might go some way towards creating further conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">I would go on to specify a couple of specific areas. The first is the White Paper. The Ombudsman himself touched upon this. I think this is a very good example of a situation in which, as Mr Prodi pointed out the other day, the fact that the Ombudsman does not associate with the Commission on a daily basis means that he is not mentioned at all in the White Paper, as it would otherwise have been only natural for him to have been. The other thing I should like to say is that I think, in fact, that there are too few complaints. I am well aware that the Ombudsman is pressed for time, but I cannot understand why there are not more complaints, considering the huge institutional apparatus with which we are concerned here. The third very important point is that the Ombudsman has made an effort to obtain ombudsmen for the candidate countries. It is, of course, extremely important that, when the new candidate countries come on board, we also make sure they understand the nature of good administrative behaviour, seeing that they do not of course, in reality, have any special experience of our way of administering matters. Fourthly, I am very pleased that the Ombudsman has addressed the subject of the e-mail system and that he is doing some energetic work on this so that we obtain real complaints and not only junk complaints. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I only regret that we did not pursue this issue more fully in the Parliament's own debate on access to sensitive documents.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Perry's report is also important, especially in its definition of an institution and the emphasis on the willingness to be helpful and to communicate.

I think it is on the right lines, and it is very gratifying to read that the Ombudsman has obtained the documents he asked for. I hope this practice will rub off on the rest of the EU system, for that is the way it should be. Only through openness do we ensure that it is possible to combat fraud and irregularities and that politicians have a better image in the eyes of the population. We might well have had more use for the Ombudsman in relation to a case in Britain in which Lloyd's cheated thousands of people, an event which led to a long list of tragedies in the form of suicides and much else besides. We see a lack of openness in the British government, the Council and the Commission, and it would be useful if the Ombudsman could give us further help on this issue. I believe that the Committee on Petitions should have greater powers. It is perhaps one of the most important committees, for it is here that the ordinary person within the EU system can come to raise matters. It is therefore also incredibly important that there should be a powerful committee which can help him when he does just that.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say that when I heard my fellow MEP’s, Mr Krarup’s, speech, I was very surprised indeed. Naturally, there were the snide remarks that are bound to come from an opponent but, knowing Mr Krarup as I do, what we have here is proof that he loves this system and really thinks it is fantastically good. It is just that he does not really want to say so. I believe then that, somewhere along the line, even Mr Krarup will say that we need the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has made it possible for me to discuss with you issues of an institutional nature which are important to the efficient operation of the European Union. In particular, they are important to our relations with the citizens, and we do need to bring the Union’s institutions as close to the citizens as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to turn first to the Bösch report, the annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman for the year 2000. Allow me to say once again how much the Commission appreciates the excellent work undertaken by the European Ombudsman’s office, and how grateful it is for it. The Ombudsman himself, Mr Söderman, deserves particular recognition. He is the driving force and is largely responsible for the results and beneficial effects achieved by this new institution of the European Ombudsman. It has to be said that the citizens of Europe are daily becoming more familiar with it.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Ombudsman’s work focuses on poor administration and the Commission is bound to improve its administration and the quality of services provided for the benefit of the citizens. In this context, the Commission shares the concerns expressed by the rapporteur. In particular, it agrees with the need to receive the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions as positively as possible, and provide them with every facility required.</p>
<p class="contents">One aspect of the Bösch report of particular concern to us is the follow-up to critical comments. Last year, we, in the Commission, set up a new procedure for methodical review of the conclusions to be drawn from the cases dealt with by the Ombudsman. As I see it, we have definitely improved as far as study, approval and consequently cooperation with the Ombudsman are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to refer to two examples to illustrate such follow-up. Firstly, further to the Ombudsman’s initiative, the Commission agreed to make the scripts of candidates in competitive examinations available to them as of 1 July 2000. Ladies and gentlemen, these are not empty words but actual facts. I venture to suggest that some of you should keep a closer eye on what is actually happening.</p>
<p class="contents">You have levelled some serious criticisms at the Commission. It is only fair to criticise the Commission when it acts inappropriately. In my view however, constant criticism, targeting the Commission’s work just for the sake of it, is entirely unhelpful. It does not promote the Commission, the institutions as a whole or the idea of Europe amongst the citizens. Criticism should be voiced when it is called for. We shall work towards improvements across the board. Furthermore, we shall take all critical comments into account and study, analyse and assess them.</p>
<p class="contents">Another example I should like to refer to concerns the citizens’ right to freedom of expression and lifting the age limit for staff recruitment. The Commission is inclined, for example, to offer its political support here. However, these issues go beyond our competence and impact on other institutions too. For instance, an interinstitutional agreement is required to amend the maximum age at which staff can be recruited. We do endorse and accept the view expressed and are prepared to discuss the matter with the other institutions. Nonetheless, it remains to be seen whether the latter will endorse Mr Söderman’s approach. As I said, we totally support it.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now move on to Mr Perry’s report on the code of good administrative conduct. Mr Perry has highlighted how these codes of good conduct are crucially important in guaranteeing a high quality service to European citizens. They constitute an important tool for us, as we strive to turn the right to good administration enshrined in the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights into an operational guide for the staff of the European institutions. The Commission therefore warmly welcomed the study undertaken by the European Ombudsman into the existence of such codes. Furthermore, the Commission worked closely with Mr Söderman in drawing up the code of good administrative conduct. The latter is now complete and contains a great many of his suggestions and contributions. It would not be fair to say that all his ideas have been included but most certainly have. Once again, I should like to thank Mr Söderman for his unfailingly positive approach and for always making helpful suggestions.</p>
<p class="contents">We have taken full account of the provisions contained in the Ombudsman’s draft code amongst the various other codes adopted by European institutions and bodies. Indeed, the Commission’s code approximates most closely to the model put forward by the Ombudsman. This is not only because of its content and legal nature, but also because it is binding on our officials.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wanted to urge you not to confuse issues, ladies and gentlemen. The White Paper on good governance stands for much more than administrative reform. Administrative reform is already under way and is Commissioner Kinnock’s responsibility. To date, this House has agreed with the Commission that much has already been achieved in that respect. We must carry the administrative reform through. We are quite determined to do so. Mr Kinnock is working very hard to that end, but it is a different issue, quite separate from good governance.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, the White Paper on good governance stands for much more than administrative reform. It aims to establish how best to gather, bring together and integrate the various links in the chain of responsibility within our complex society. This is a problem not only for the European institutions but for all our countries, all advanced democracies. Society is becoming ever more complex, the technological means allowing information to flow more freely are increasingly widespread, and new possibilities are opening up. In addition, the way in which citizens organise themselves is daily becoming more complex.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the significance of the White Paper. It puts all this in the context of the interplay between the European institutions. That amounts to far more than administrative reform. Consequently, administrative reform should not be confused with the White Paper on good governance being drawn up by the Commission under President Prodi’s guidance.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make it very clear to Mr Perry that the Commission agrees with him and with Mr Söderman on how unfortunate it is that such a wide range of codes of varying legal status are currently in place. This does nothing for consistency or legal clarity. It should however be borne in mind as Mr Perry suggests in his report, that it would be wise to consider the results of the codes of good conduct implemented or approved recently. In the Commission’s case, this was ten months ago. As for the Council, it was just before the summer, in July. In our view therefore it is still too early to draw conclusions on the implementation of these codes of good conduct.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall start work on a report at the end of the current year. The report will refer in particular to the Commission’s own code of good conduct which will by then have been in place for a year. As soon as sufficient information becomes available, the Commission will consider whether or not to prepare a legislative proposal for a horizontal regulation. We need to have more information available so we do not at present have a position on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Mrs Almeida Garrett’s report, I have to say that from an institutional point of view it is undoubtedly the most sensitive. I shall only refer to it briefly however, because pursuant to Article 195 of the Treaty the Commission is only competent to give an opinion, and the latter is not binding. Nonetheless, I feel it is important to make our view known.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first place, Mrs Almeida Garrett deserves to be congratulated on her excellent work. I have also had the opportunity to speak on the subject at the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and to emphasise how well the present statute has worked.</p>
<p class="contents">As I stated earlier, the Commission has followed up investigations launched by the Ombudsman. The code of good conduct is but one example of this. In general, the Commission provides a constructive response and complies with the timetable for supplying information to the Ombudsman. I am grateful to Mr Söderman for highlighting this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Constitutional Affairs has tabled three amendments. Regarding lifting the secrecy classification for access to files, I have already explained that the Commission has not resorted to this in any of the twenty requests for access submitted by the Ombudsman. We could certainly succumb to the temptation of bringing the law into line with reality and go along with the position adopted by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. On the other hand, given that everything has worked well, we might also query whether it is really necessary to amend this point.</p>
<p class="contents">We should always err on the side of caution when dealing with delicate matters, given the Commission’s role and the nature of the issues it is dealing with at present. Indeed, the latter will become increasingly delicate and varied as the building of Europe proceeds.</p>
<p class="contents">We might also encounter problems with the governments of Member States of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The structure of the European Union, based as it is on three pillars, means that the function of the Commission and also that of Parliament itself varies depending on the pillar in question. The Commission will therefore deal with these matters in greater detail in the opinion to be given and put to Parliament in the near future, once a final position on the text approved has been adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the deletion of the principle according to which when officials give evidence they speak as representatives of their administration, the Commission does not wish to be dogmatic, but we do feel that it is important for officials not to speak simply as individuals. Rather, they should put forward the details and explanations pertaining to matters they are responsible for. For the rest, they should comply with what is required of them under their statutes. Further, I should like to emphasise that as a former Member of Parliament, let alone a Commissioner, I fully endorse the position of the rapporteur, Mrs Almeida Garrett, regarding the differences between political and administrative responsibilities and the European Parliament’s responsibility concerning political responsibilities, the responsibilities of Commissioners and indeed not only Commissioners but members of other institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards access to documents emanating from the Member States it would be appropriate, as I said earlier, to be consistent with the new Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 on public access to documents. The principle of obtaining prior consent from the Member State is provided for under Article 4 Paragraph 5 of the Regulation, and in the framework agreement with Parliament. Declaration 35 annexed to the Final Act of the Treaty of Amsterdam serves a similar purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs once again. I must also say how very grateful I am to Mr Söderman for his work. It is most helpful to us because after all, criticism encourages us to improve and also offers solutions. That has to be borne in mind. We have already made progress regarding the code of good conduct, infringement procedures, and officials’ freedom, to name but a few examples. I venture to suggest in this context that many things are open to criticism, because nothing is perfect. When, however, one fails to go deeper and criticism is unfounded, it runs the risk of losing its value or at the very least, proving less effective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Söderman,</span></span>   <span class="italic">European Ombudsman</span>. – Mr President, there were a few questions, including two that were raised in Mrs Almeida Garrett's report, which I will try to clarify.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly there was the question of hearing Commissioners as witnesses and the problem that arose in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs where people felt that there might be a difficulty in drawing a line between the political control of the European Parliament, the political responsibility of Commissioners and the administrative responsibility of the same Commissioners. Many Members of the Constitutional Affairs Committee thought that this was very difficult to solve. It is very important to understand that the Commission is the executive body and in theory it is the administration of the Union which has contact with the citizen. Of course the Commissioners have administrative functions. We have had a few complaints in this connection and the Commissioners have always replied very correctly. Therefore to avoid further debate and confusion in this matter, this could be deleted from the proposal and, as the rapporteur said, one day an answer in writing might not be necessary. I would like to stress that OLAF has the right to hear the Commissioners and that was the inspiration for my proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly on the question of all documents. The idea that the Ombudsman has the right to see all documents is because the citizens do not have this access. Trust in the Ombudsman's work is based on the fact that the citizens accept that they cannot have access to all documents but they need to know that the Ombudsman has the right if necessary. This is the basis of their confidence in the Ombudsman's operations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is sometimes feared that the Ombudsman might get hold of state secrets. Having been an ombudsman now for twelve years, I have never in a case of maladministration had to ask for documents on really secret matters. I am not aware of any case in which an ombudsman has leaked documents. The principle must, however, be in place that the Ombudsman has the right to see documents. We have had some problems of interpretation here and we have lost time on both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi asked for a debate on the White Paper and this is what I have tried to start. It is very important that the White Paper is discussed because there is still one run to go. I would hope for some more concrete proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn to the criticism about the low number of complaints, publicising the work of the Ombudsman institutions, and the many complaints outside the mandate. First of all our mandate lies entirely within the European Union. Citizens may find this difficult to understand when they encounter problems with Community law. They go to a Parliament Information Office or Commission Representation, get our form and complain to us. We try to rectify the situation. There is the possibility that this limits the number of complaints but the number has been increasing over the years.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of publicising the Ombudsman's work, I would mention that we are more known than many ombudsmen on the national stage and Members of Parliament can surely do a lot to tell citizens about the right to petition and the right of complaint to the Ombudsman. After all it is you who meet the Europeans out there. It is you who have the contact with the public. If you tell people about the possibilities then they will become much better known. Many of you have done that and I am grateful.</p>
<p class="contents">I am really honoured that I had the possibility to discuss these matters. I am very grateful for the comments made by Mrs de Palacio and all of you here and thank you very much for your work.</p>
