<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Κorakas (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, the cotton sector is of great social and economic importance, as you know, to Spain and, even more so, to Greece. In Greece, cotton is becoming a national product, employing over 300 000 families and producing about 1 350 000 tonnes of cotton in Objective 1 areas, which have a far higher unemployment rate than the Community average and where the average size of holdings is much smaller than the Community average. The Community needs 4.5 million tonnes of unginned cotton. In other words, this product is in particularly short supply in the European Union, with Community production covering a mere 35% of demand.</p>
<p class="contents">Guaranteed national quantities are always irritatingly lower than actual production, which has resulted in producers' incomes being eroded by high coresponsibility levies while, paradoxically, the bigger the quota overshoot, the lower the cost to the Community budget. This unacceptable situation has justifiably exasperated our producers, who are turning out in force, just as they did years ago and again yesterday throughout the countryside in Greece. However, instead of strengthening the current regulation, as rightly demanded by our cotton growers, by bringing quotas into line with current production levels and adjusting at least some of the institutional prices, which have been frozen since 1992, along comes the European Commission and not only does it propose to keep support at its current low levels, it increases the coresponsibility levy by 20%.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's objective of drastically reducing cotton production is unjustified because this is a product in which the European Union is only 30-35% self-sufficient. It is wrong because it penalises cotton producers for the fall in international cotton prices over the last three years – despite the fact that they are not to blame and the Commission did nothing to rectify the situation. I should point out here that the European Commission tried to back up its unacceptable proposal by presenting it when international prices were at their lowest for a decade, in December 1999. Since then, international prices have doubled. Similarly, the European Union is proposing to limit aid for cotton production when it is most needed, with the United States of America channelling more and more money to its cotton producers, enabling them to increase their output and depressing international prices.</p>
<p class="contents">The environmental alibi does not stand up because cotton production – and this has been scientifically proven – is much less harmful to the environment than similar types of subsidised production which producers abandoned in order to grow cotton. The Commission has not taken any account whatsoever of Protocol 4 to the Act of Accession of Greece, which sets out the scheme for cotton with a view to aiding cotton production in the regions of the Community in which it is important to the agricultural economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Cotton producers are calling for the Community preference to be extended to cotton, especially given the shortfall in the Community in cotton. Cotton is the chief plant-based textile fibre which is a natural and healthier product than the synthetic fibres with which it competes, it provides jobs for hundreds of thousands of farmers and it may even attract young farmers to remain in the countryside, which is being depopulated.</p>
<p class="contents">What do we propose? We propose to lift all restrictions on cotton growing, quotas, coresponsibility levies, environmental consequences, so that the minimum price is paid in full to producers. Despite this, since for a variety of financial reasons some ceiling has to be set, this ceiling should cover present actual production by our cotton growers, the system of aid should be maintained, institutional prices of cotton should be adjusted in the light of official data concerning average Community inflation between 1995 and 2000, aid should be paid directly to cotton producers through their cooperative associations, without the intervention of private ginning undertakings, after studying the most suitable procedure, and Annex B of the regulation, which determines increases and reductions in the minimum producer price on the basis of quality characteristics, should be included in the new regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore feel that it is essential for the European Parliament to support the producers' call for aid. It is in precisely this spirit that we proposed a quota of 1.5 million tonnes for Greece and 450 000 tonnes for Spain. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development decided on 1 200 000 for Greece and 350 000 for Spain. We want to call on Parliament to stand by the side of farmers so that people stay in the countryside and so that, at the end of the day, our farmers can survive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, only 42% of demand was met between 1995 and 1999. Moreover it is also the case that, as Mr Korakas, whom I would like to congratulate on his report, has rightly stated, this is a crop grown in the most disadvantaged regions of Spain and Greece. The production of cotton is very labour-intensive. This means that it is essential to maintain cotton production in order to preserve the social and economic fabric of these areas. It is also the reason for the two most important requests made by Parliament: that the overshoot penalty percentage should not be increased from 50% to 60%, and that the maximum guaranteed quantities be brought into line with actual production levels. I am only advocating an approximation, not an equalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">When the Commission drew up its proposal, it was alarmed by unduly low world prices, which had reached a ten-year low. As a result the cost of aid had risen, due to the system of aid for cotton. Circumstances have now changed, Commissioner: prices have risen to almost record levels, the money allocated to paying farmers has been reduced and the proposal for a regulation can no longer be justified. However, the amendments adopted unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development certainly are justified. An increase in penalties would put many of the smallest holdings out of business, with all the social problems that this would entail. The current imbalance between actual production levels and the maximum guaranteed quantities is the reason for the huge penalties borne by farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Korakas has rightly said, we could also invoke Protocol 4 of the Act of Accession of Greece, which calls for cotton production to be maintained in those areas where it is considered important to the agricultural economy. It also states that farmers are entitled to a fair income. This would improve the agricultural infrastructure and so stabilise the market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Agriculture trusts that the amendments it has put forward will stimulate the implementation of collective environmental measures, through the sector’s producers’ associations, which we aim to promote and support.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that the Commission will take account of these arguments and amendments, and agree to amend the proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank him very much for being open to dialogue and to all manner of proposals, right from the start. He has been very willing to listen. Together with the work carried out by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development this has resulted in a splendid European Parliament report.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission adopts the amendments put forward in Mr Korakas’ report, the result will be a much improved cotton system. The improvements will include adjustment of the guaranteed national quantities, the aid system, and the establishment of a new permanent framework recognising producers’ associations. Moreover, the amendments tabled by Parliament encourage the implementation of more environmentally-friendly measures which will save water, reduce the use of pesticides, and provide for appropriate management of plastic waste materials.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in my opinion the Commission’s proposal is too minimalist. It is concerned solely with saving money and is incompatible with what is supposed to be the European Union’s top priority: protecting jobs. This is because insufficient account is taken of job preservation or creation when choosing between the options available.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I therefore urge you to vote for and support Amendment No 20, tabled by Mr Garot and myself on behalf of the Socialist Group. This amendment makes a significant proposal. We ask Member States to take employment into account when adopting measures to change the criteria for land eligible for aid. In making such decisions, account should be taken of the number of jobs dependent on these areas. We also propose that alternative crops and the existence of other options be investigated.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, Mr President, this is all about social and economic sensitivity. I trust that our amendment will be supported, and would like to congratulate the speaker once again on his magnificent report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It reveals the anxiety affecting this important sector of European agriculture and, more particularly, significant areas of Greece and Andalusia, the main producer regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Cotton is a traditional crop which provides a livelihood for thousands of European families for whom there is hardly any alternative source of income. There is a significant cotton shortfall in the European Union; we can only meet 40% of demand, and it remains the best natural fibre for fabric production, when compared to synthetic fibres. Furthermore, cotton has replaced other intensive crops which generate more pollution and greater surpluses. However, despite the improvements, it is true that there are still environmental problems we need to solve.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we support the Commission’s proposal of maintaining the present system of production aid, based on the compensation payments system. However, we do not believe that imposing stiffer penalties is the right way to restrict expenditure on this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">It is simplistic to talk of containing spending and only to present budgetary considerations for reforming the aid system, when what is really happening is that farmers’ incomes are falling whilst we are witnessing an increase in imports from outside the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This constitutes a structural change, since expenditure has been determined principally by changes to international prices, not by an actual increase in the area of land under cultivation.</p>
<p class="contents">Stiffer penalties will doubtless lead to greater concentration of the sector. It will pass into the hands of a few individuals and the viability of family farms will be seriously threatened. However, cotton growing will not cease, which is the intention.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the producers’ organisations are the best means of improving the effectiveness of the necessary self-regulation measures concerning production and environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I should like to stress that the Commission must gradually recognise the actual production in these areas. It should adjust guaranteed national quantities, bringing them into line with actual production of cotton, a product we do not produce enough of in the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One year on, world market prices have risen by 90%. The risk of excessive costs no longer exists. In fact, costs are now minimal. We therefore have to ask ourselves why the Commission has not withdrawn this proposal which no longer has a <span class="italic">raison d’être</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">It is two years since China decided to export its stockpiled cotton causing a record drop in world prices. I hope that the Commission does not attempt to maintain a proposal on the cotton system exploiting a decision by the Chinese Government, a decision which had no lasting effects.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission simply wishes to cut production aid crucial for the most disadvantaged regions of the European Union, it would be better if it said so clearly. As part of an increasingly unbalanced common agricultural policy, the effects of these proposals, including the social effects, are wholly negative as earlier speakers explained.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the merit of Mr Korakas’ report is that it corrects the Commission’s proposal. It also makes other very useful suggestions on effecting adjustment whilst taking account of some of the peculiarities of cotton.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it proposes adjusting the national guaranteed quantities in line with actual production. This will put and end to the anomalies of the aid system, in which costs increase as production decreases.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly – I must not be side-tracked by other matters – Mr Korakas’ report outlines a scheme for supporting producers’ organisations, and most importantly, a system to implement measures reducing the impact of cotton cultivation on the environment. The Commission dwells on the possible environmental problems of growing cotton, but fails to suggest solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, Commissioner, that when finalising the legislative procedure, the Commission and the Council will include the amendments unanimously approved by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as previous speakers have requested. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Baltas (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, cotton, which is the subject of today's debate, is basically grown in two Member States of the European Union, Greece and Spain, but it concerns the whole Union because there may be cotton processing and cotton fibre and textile producing factories in any Member State of the Union. So when we examine cotton growing, we must bear these two factors in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point worth noting in the case of the subject at issue is the fact that Community cotton production falls far below its actual requirements, barely covering around 35% of demand. Plus, European cotton growers are small and medium-sized farmers with an average of 4.2 hectares each, at least they are in Greece. Production, therefore, is determined by the small size of the holdings and the soil conditions which meet the specifications for this crop.</p>
<p class="contents">These objective conditions have brought about a situation over the years which, at production level, is as follows: average annual volume of cotton produced: 1 200 000 tonnes in Greece and 350 000 tonnes in Spain. The report finds a way round this in a compromise proposal – a judicious, moderate, perfectly realistic proposal – calling on the Commission to recognise this state of affairs by introducing national guaranteed quantities of unginned cotton of 1 200 000 tonnes for Greece, 350 000 tonnes for Spain and 1 500 tonnes for each of the other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this responsible and realistic approach in the report should be accepted by the Commission as it stands and strengthened in the forthcoming negotiations in the World Trade Organisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by expressing my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Korakas, and to the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for the report and for their thorough examination of the Commission’s proposal. Aid per hectare for cotton is three to four times higher than for other crops; that certainly has to be considered whenever this whole issue is discussed. In the view of the Commission, this special effort by the Community, in particular the extra financial input, is only warranted by the economic and, more importantly, the social significance attached to cotton in some regions of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last few years, however, the area of land that is planted with cotton has increased considerably, and yields per hectare have also risen sharply. This poses new risks, both to the budget and to the environment, for we must not forget that cotton planting is a very intensive form of crop farming and involves the highly concentrated use of fertilisers and pesticides. The main aim of the Commission’s proposal, therefore, is to ensure that an excessive increase in production levels is accompanied by an accelerated reduction of the minimum price levels we set.</p>
<p class="contents">Adoption of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, however, would lead to a substantial increase in the size of the budget for cotton production. This, in turn, would mean an increase rather than a decrease in production incentives, which would also tend to undermine the environmental safeguards.</p>
<p class="contents">To make it clear what is at stake here, let me tell you that, even if we assume stable yields and an average market price, the additional cost of the committee’s amendments would be in the order of EUR 650 million a year. This corresponds to an 85% increase in the budget. In view of the current budgetary situation, I certainly could not comply with such a request.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the individual amendments, Nos 1, 3, 4 and 9 to 13 seek to increase prices by 10% and the national guaranteed quantities by 50%. Apart from sending costs soaring, these measures could lead to a 60% increase in production, amounting to an additional output of 900 000 tonnes, with the consequences I have just described. Amendments Nos 5 and 14 propose that the minimum price be indexed on the basis of the quality of unginned cotton; the price scale would be adopted by the Member States if the relevant professional organisations could not reach agreement on a price scale.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had some apposite experience of such ideas in the past. It emerged very clearly that it is simply impossible to establish and administer such a system centrally, because there are quite simply far too many factors that influence the quality of raw cotton. For that reason, we must stand by our view that this question should continue to be decided by the interested parties, in other words, between the purchasers and suppliers of raw cotton.</p>
<p class="contents">We do, however, propose the introduction of a criterion, namely conformity with the weighted average of world market prices for cotton fibres. This will give us a framework that will make it easier to negotiate future agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 7, 8 and 16 to 19 relate to rules governing the formulation of official statutes by cotton producers’ organisations and specifying the activities of such organisations for which Community aid is payable. This is intended to apply to environmental measures in particular. I must draw your attention to the fact that such a regime already exists and is set forth in Regulation (EEC) No 389/1982. Moreover, the creation of producers’ organisations has been financed by the Community for the past ten years. As is customary in other sectors, these bodies are expected to meet their running costs from the funds allocated to the common organisation of the market and from environmental aid.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept these amendments, because they would mean the existence of two different sets of rules for producers’ organisations as well as two different funding systems. If we also take account of the increased production that would result from the requested rise in the national guaranteed quantities, this alone could entail annual costs in the region of EUR 80 million. As far as the environment is concerned, Amendments Nos 6, 15 and 20 seek wide scope for the Member States to amend the common organisation of the market, not only on the basis of environmental considerations but also, and above all, for economic and social reasons. This is really unacceptable because it puts the very existence of the environmental safeguards in jeopardy.</p>
<p class="contents">So there remains Amendment No 2, which is essentially intended to correct a mistake in the Spanish text. But, in point of fact, neither a translation problem nor an error has occurred here, because the expression <span class="italic">precio de objetivo</span> is meant to refer to the target price, not to the actual market price.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much regret that, on this occasion, the Commission cannot accept the committee’s amendments, but I trust I have fully explained the reasons for this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
