<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me the opportunity to present the seven point plan to reform the beef and veal market which the Commission recently adopted. What exactly is this plan? We all know that the beef and veal market is in serious crisis; consumption in the European Union has plummeted; prices in Germany, for example, have fallen by 39.2% for steer and by 41.8% for cows. These historic lows have already triggered the intervention safety net in Germany and the Netherlands. In addition, our exports have, unfortunately, collapsed. Fast action is called for. Storing meat is clearly not enough per se. It would result in an unmanageable beef mountain, quite apart from the fatal consequences for taxpayers, consumers and farmers. We therefore also need fast reform. The Commission's seven point plan is a sort of emergency package to prevent excess production over the next few years by taking another step towards extensive production, towards sustainability and towards organic farming.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this plan does not revolutionise the system completely for the simple reason that we first need to give our incipient reforms a chance. Only a small part of the Agenda 2000 reform has really been implemented. We have only just made the first step towards an overall 20% reduction in intervention prices, with a further 7.1% to follow this year and again next year. The countermove – increasing direct payments and tripling the extensification premium – has still not entered into force by a long shot. In short, implementing Agenda 2000 fully in the year 2002 will by itself contribute towards extensive cattle-raising and less production-orientated subsidies. Today we are discussing the emergency package as a result of BSE and this neither anticipates nor replaces the mid-term review of Agenda 2000. I repeat, in 2002, i.e. next year, agricultural policy as a whole will be up for review, as demanded in Berlin.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will spend 2001 analysing individual sectors in detail, so that it can then present a comprehensive, well thought out concept for the future. We need to take our time here if we are to avoid falling prey to hurried, political posturing. The seven point plan will not take food out of the mouths of European farmers. It is our only chance of mitigating farmers' loss of earnings, at least in the medium term. The Commission cannot, unfortunately, afford to make up the loss of income in full. Unsold beef, the lack of consumer confidence and escalating costs are a highly explosive mixture which could decimate beef-farming and agricultural policy. Our seven point plan should allow us to remove the detonator from this ticking time-bomb. But our plan should also ensure that beef and veal are safer than ever for consumers and that consumer confidence is restored in beef and veal.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me now to outline these seven points briefly. First, we propose to reduce the permissible stocking density for the special premium for steers and suckler cows from 2 to 1.8 livestock units. Secondly, we want the Member States to respect the so-called 90-head limit without exception, i.e. a holding will only be paid the special beef premium for a maximum of 90 animals. These two measures should increase the incentive for extensive farming. Thirdly, in order to make organic farming more attractive, we propose to allow organic farmers to cultivate fodder such as clover on set-aside areas. Fourthly, the Commission wants to set the number of rights for the special steer premium individually for each holding. This measure will also act as an incentive to reduce intensive production. Fifthly, our package also makes provision for a higher percentage – at least 20%, but no more than 40% – of animals which qualify for premiums, i.e. suckler cows, to be heifers. This should also limit beef and veal production, which depends to a considerable degree on the number of suckler cows.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly and finally, we want to set the present ceiling for intervention outside the safety net of 350 000 tonnes for 2001 and 2002, in order to prevent prices from falling even further and the safety net from having to be used in other countries or over a longer period of time.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, may I say that the measures which the Commission is proposing here today will not take full hold for a year or two. We have no alternative. Beef and veal production is not akin to a light-bulb factory and the agricultural Commissioner is not a foreman who can turn off the production line and watch everything grind to a halt. In the short term, we must consider what we are going to do with the huge quantities of unsold beef. With all due respect for the ethical aspects, with all due sympathy for those who say that it is a tragedy to destroy the cattle, we must not delude ourselves. Hundreds of thousands of cattle have been squashed into stalls in Europe for months because farmers cannot find anyone to buy their old livestock. The safety net has already been deployed in two Member States. This week alone we shall probably put up to 30 000 tonnes of meat into storage. And yet none of this is enough.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the last point of the package of measures. As soon as compulsory BSE tests for animals over 30 months old have been introduced in all the Member States, we want to replace the programme of safe removal with a new special buy-up programme which allows the Member States to decide if they prefer to store beef at their own expense or if they want to remove this meat from the market straight away, in which case we and the Member States will compensate farmers jointly for the value of the animal in a ratio of 30% from the Member State and 70% from the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">This measure is no more than a provisional emergency measure and should not last beyond the end of this year. In the medium term, there is only one way forward and that is: act today in order to limit beef production tomorrow, promote less intensive production methods and encourage organic farming. I therefore ask you to return your opinion on today's proposal as quickly as possible. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would mainly like to respond in my capacity as rapporteur for Budget 2001. My first question is as follows: what will the additional cost of these measures be in animal premiums, over a period of four to five years? According to provisional calculations, it will cost EUR 157 million this year and as much as EUR 1.75 billion over the years to come, and we are talking in terms of animal premiums.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question is does BSE have anything to do with the size of the farm? I was under the impression that it did not, yet you have set a 90-animal limit per farm nonetheless. That seems to me to be in conflict with an effective programme for fighting BSE. Nor have I heard anything about a maximum premium per hectare, for the number of animals per hectare. Could you comment on that too?</p>
<p class="contents">You are going to dispense with the 350 000 ceiling on beef taken into intervention, which is in itself a good decision. But could you comment on what the financial implications for the European Union are expected to be over the coming year? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These measures are a step in the right direction. They remain within the system, without changing the need to review the system for the next reform and take even more audacious action. But this package sends out the right signal.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just one objection: why not divide up the bull premiums over a transitional period? Half could be used to slaughter calves, i.e. for recovery, so it would not be Herod's premium, and the other half could be channelled into grasslands, to get into extensification, to get out of mass meat production and to achieve middle-of-the-road production. I also note that the figure of 90 animals applies to every holding; holdings with more animals do not fall outside the rule, as the newspapers wrongly reported. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In reply to Mrs Roth-Behrendt's questions – and this also applies to the others – we should be clear about one thing: what we are proposing here today is not a new agricultural reform. As I, in fact, said. Nor are we in a position to engage in agricultural reform at the moment. I think it would be wrong if we were to look now at the reform of the beef and veal sector in isolation. When we talk of agricultural reform – and we shall do so in good time, I can assure you, you will be hearing from us – then we must include, for example, the question of silage corn, the question of milk quotas, the question of what to do about dairy cattle versus beef cattle. And there really is too little time for that, especially if you want to prepare something carefully. What we have tabled here today is nothing more – but also nothing less – than a clear concept to get us out of the current crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to Mrs Roth-Behrendt's question as to whether we should change over from quotas to direct payments. There are no quotas for individual cattle fatteners under the current system. First we need to introduce quotas for individual cattle fatteners; what you meant, I think, is that we should deregulate the whole thing and get into rural development. But this is precisely the sort of question which can only be resolved in the context of a general debate on agricultural reform.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally – and I say so quite openly – am against the guillotine. I am against any instrument of murder and hence I am also against the guillotine. Which is why I favour seeing this 90-head limit as a franchise, by which I mean that everyone gets a subsidy up to 90 animals. Mr Maat felt that was a contradiction because it makes no difference if it is a small or a large holding when it comes to BSE. I think you are quite right. But the 90-head limit is not a measure to fight BSE, it is a measure to create incentives for more extensive beef production in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already looked into what Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf said about early marketing premiums. The thing is, we had this sort of premium in 1996 and in later years. We have calculated that this premium alone cost EUR 200 000 million. Unfortunately, the end result is somewhat questionable, because 40% of calves are slaughtered with a low weight in any case. That means we would pay nearly half the veal farmers a premium with absolutely no end result. Which is why we have shunned this measure, especially in view of our limited resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that we need to tread somewhat carefully here. We must not forget that organic farms by definition produce much less and that the organic farming system automatically has a built-in brake on production so to speak.</p>
<p class="contents">If we generally abandon the brake on production in the cereals sector, then we no longer meet the requirements for a bluebox measure. Which is why I think we need to tread carefully. As far as introducing a general grassland premium in lieu of a beef premium is concerned, we discussed this in connection with Agenda 2000. I have no objection in principle here, but there is a feasibility problem, because you must admit one thing: a meadow in Schleswig-Holstein cannot be treated in the same way as a hectare of meadow in northern Finland or a meadow in southern Portugal. There are huge differences in yield, quality and requirements. But Europe does not have a system for evaluating these differences, which is why we need to consider this question at greater length. But, as I said, I have no objection in principle, just a feasibility problem.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the question of disposal costs is concerned, the fact is that very different systems are currently being applied here. In some Member States it is done through tax measures, in other Member States the costs are simply absorbed by the national budget and in others still the farmers, or at least the agricultural sector, is left to pick up the tab.</p>
<p class="contents">Since these are national measures, national assistance rules apply. And we are doing that, we have accepted that. However, not all Member States have sent in their replies as requested, not by a long chalk. But, hopefully, we should be in a position by the next Council to formulate a more accurate overview. However, and I must stress this, a certain self-discrimination by the Member States within the framework of government aid cannot be prohibited under Community law. That is also a fact of life. But I agree with you, that it should not be allowed to go too far as, otherwise, we really shall create two types of farmholding or two types of farmer in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to the question on certified products: the certification of products is set out in the provisions which we introduced on 1 September last year. It was agreed, with Parliament's consent, that this would be done in two stages. The first stage is in force and the second will follow on 1 January next year. However, this second stage must already be complied with for any meat which enters storage. Because if we do not insist on this now, we will not be able to remove this meat from storage after 1 January 2002 because it will no longer meet labelling requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is also national certification. This national certification, which is carried out by CHA in Germany or SOPEXA in France, is subject to a notification requirement. In other words, these certifications must be notified. Then there is also private certification. These private certifications are governed solely by the principle of truth. This means that the truth must be told about what is written on the outside of a product.</p>
<p class="contents">With products involving government aid, certain rules must be respected. We are currently reforming this system, because we quite clearly take the view that the fact that a product comes from a particular region is no automatic guarantee of quality and that quality has to be defined. Only if the quality is right and only if it is checked can we talk of a proper quality label. But we have difficulties here – I freely admit – with combinations of quality and origin, when it is suggested that the quality automatically goes up if a specific product comes from a specific region.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as calves' milk is concerned – and I assume that you are basically referring to milk replacer here – the relevant adaptations are being prepared. However, they come within the remit of my colleague Commissioner Byrne. As far as the implementation of the White Paper on food security is concerned, suitable proposals will also be forthcoming here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How soon does he think the 350 000 ceiling on beef taken into intervention will be passed and how far does he expect it to go? Is it not better to incinerate animals over 30 months old rather than start putting too much of this old beef into intervention? Finally, I do not understand the 90-animal limit because surely extensification, greening the agricultural policy is the way forward. I can take the Commissioner to many farms in the UK where there are over 90 cattle being raised on an extensive-type regime and to smaller farms where cattle are intensively produced. So surely it is the extensification payment that should be altered, not this 90-animal ceiling. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Several options have been created here and a derogation should also be permitted in the future. What is important to the Commission is that there should be a plan of what will be done if a case of BSE occurs. This plan must be notified to the Commission and will be evaluated by the Commission's scientific committees. If the committees consider the plan acceptable, it is automatically approved by the Commission. This system has worked perfectly so far.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the costs of the test are concerned, may I remind you once again of what I said earlier in reply to Mr Böge's question. As far as massive imports of meat into Europe are concerned, I would qualify the term "massive" somewhat, because relatively little beef is imported into the European Union. The question of removing risk material and, more importantly, the question of whether the meat is from animals which were tested and whether the country in question guarantees that the animals were not fed with feedingstuffs containing meat and bonemeal are clear and this must be implemented accordingly. The Commission is currently working on the relevant proposals and my colleague Commissioner Byrne is working on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, I fail to see how Mr Jové Peres can say that slaughter premiums in the South are twice or several times higher. That is news to me. The slaughter premiums are the same everywhere. In reply to Mr Jové Peres' question: we do not want to incinerate meat arbitrarily; we want to store this meat, provided that it is quality meat. This disposal scheme is for meat which cannot be stored, which is not eligible for intervention; because only meat from steer qualifies for intervention, not meat from old cows. There has been a great deal of criticism here. We had suggested disposing of the meat from old cows, but we want to take account of this criticism and we therefore now offer two options: either a Member State does as Great Britain has done over the past five years – and this has also worked perfectly in a number of other Member States – or a Member State has the option of buying this old livestock. If it believes it can manufacture products from it, then obviously they must never go into commercial circulation, because first we cannot pay the full value of the animal and, secondly, this meat will then be competing with normal meat. That is out of the question, but if there is additional recovery potential here and if individual Member States see such potential, then they may make use of it.</p>
<p class="contents">The 90-head limit does not apply to cows, only to subsidies under the special beef premium; only stocks or rather only up to 90 animals a year are subsidised and no more. That is the ratio. For the rest, we also made this suggestion in connection with Agenda 2000. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By the way, I am sure that Lucerne is also included, I see no problem with that. It is vital to bear in mind that we should not let this measure undermine our WTO commitments, or else the whole thing will collapse and we will have achieved the exact opposite of what we want to achieve, because in that case we would not be able to help our farmers, and we would actually be harming them. As regards growing high-protein feed in the form of field beans and field peas and so forth, we have undertaken to investigate this whole issue from the demand side as well as from the supply side. This investigation is under way. It is too late for the present production year anyway, because changes to the existing market regime would be needed in any case, and from a purely technical point of view it is too late to do that before these high-protein plants are planted. So this is only achievable for the next production year, and that means that we still have time to carry out a proper investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as imports are concerned, it is true to say that we annually import – chiefly from South America at present – around 30 million tonnes of soya and other high-protein feeds. The shortfall which has now arisen in the form of 2.5 million tonnes of meat and bonemeal amounts to less than 10% of that. It is also necessary, and no final decision has been taken on this yet, to check whether this ban on feeding animal and bone meal to pigs and poultry will remain in force or whether the ban will be modified. In this connection, my colleague Commissioner Byrne is currently having inspections carried out in all 15 Member States to establish whether there are models that already work or whether there are problems with checks everywhere. So I cannot yet give a definitive reply on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Mr Hyland's question about tests, let me make one thing crystal clear: our first goal must always be to guarantee consumer safety. That is why we believe that it is of paramount importance for all animals over 30 months old to be tested, even if individual animals then have to be disposed of. Why? Because we otherwise run the risk, if we leave this totally in the hands of the Member States or the sector itself, that there will be a kind of pre-selection between those animals that are tested and those animals that people do not want to test. That implies certain risks which we want to avoid at all costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Our aim is to bring forward the date of 1 July so that all animals over 30 months old are tested in all Member States as from 1 April at the latest. That means that the alternative I have presented to you here can also be put into practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
