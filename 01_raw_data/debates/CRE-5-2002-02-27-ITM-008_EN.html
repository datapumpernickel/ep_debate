<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">de Miguel,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, Turkey has for several years made clear its interest in establishing closer relations with the European Union. From the signing of the Association Agreement, in 1963, and its formal request for accession in 1987 and the Customs Union signed in 1996, relations have had a long journey, which has not always been easy, characterised by mutual interest, rapprochement and, at the same time, by the clear European requirement for certain indispensable conditions that apply to every candidate for accession to the Union to be met.</p>
<p class="contents">The Copenhagen European Council laid down the political criteria that the candidate countries must fulfil, which are; achieving institutional stability that guarantees democracy, the Rule of Law, the defence of human rights and respect for minorities and their protection. Furthermore, the Helsinki European Council formally acknowledged Turkey’s application to join the Union, by concluding with the words that Turkey is a candidate country destined to join the Union on the basis of fulfilling the new criteria that also apply to the other candidate countries. From now on, Turkey should benefit from the same association strategy for accession as the other candidate countries, which should act as a stimulus and a support for its reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions of the Laeken European Council indicate that Turkey has made progress on fulfilling the political criteria set for accession, in particular by means of the recent amendment of its constitution. The prospect of opening up accession negotiations with Turkey has thereby come a step closer. The European Council urged Turkey to continue making progress on fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria, both the economic and the political criteria, especially with regard to respecting human rights, and acknowledged that Turkey is participating on an equal footing with the other candidates in a matter as vitally important as the Convention on the future of Europe, which will be inaugurated tomorrow in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Progress 2000 report stated that Turkey had initiated a very positive debate on the political reforms necessary for its accession, one of the most important of which is the fact that it has signed up to various international instruments in the field of human rights. Two-thousand-and-one saw one of the most important changes in Turkey’s process of democratisation: the adoption of a package of 34 amendments to the constitution, which is the most profound change that this fundamental legislation has undergone since its entry into force in 1982. Amongst the more innovative aspects are the recognition of the freedom of thought and expression, measures to prevent torture and the strengthening of civil authority as opposed to military authority and major prison reforms. These reforms have undoubtedly benefited from the fact that Turkey’s candidature has been acknowledged and from the prospect of its joining the Union in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, at the end of January 2002, another major step forwards was taken when the Turkish government decided to remove its opposition to Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights, concerning the right to freedom and security in relation to the maximum periods of detention an individual can be subjected to before being put on trial. The Secretary General of the Council of Europe expressed his satisfaction at this decision, and stated that this marks a step forwards in the field of the protection of prisoners’ rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also mention the decision to create a commission, comprising of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs and Human Rights, to supervise the situation at field level of the protection of human rights and adopt the necessary measures. The same applies to the entry into force in Turkey of the new Civil Code, which signifies considerable progress in the recognition of non-discrimination on the grounds of gender, in family law and also in the law of succession. We should also mention the amendment of the law on the National Security Council, which is about to be approved in the Turkish Parliament, in order to adapt it to the new wording of Article 118 of the Constitution and which increases the number of civilian members of the National Security Council, thereby more clearly demonstrating its consultative nature.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also to be welcomed that the Council of Ministers has approved the decree that will allow Amnesty International to legally open an office in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Although these constitutional amendments represent enormous hope for the process of democratisation – despite some important omissions, such as not having fully abolished the death penalty, which will still apply in the event of war or to punish particularly serious offences, such as terrorism – the legislative development of these constitutional rules has, however, been clearly inadequate. Although the legislative minipackage for developing the constitutional reforms adopts a more restrictive definition of the offence of promoting terrorism and provides greater guarantees for prisoners awaiting trial, at the same time extremely vague concepts have been introduced and even, in some cases, the range of punishable actions has been increased, as well as the fact that limits are continuing to be set on the right of association and the right to demonstrate, which is totally incompatible with current practices in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The same could be said of the reform of the Civil Code. The amendment of the status of legal persons does not solve the problem of the legal obstacles to the right of association or to the law on foundations, recently ratified by the Supreme Court, prohibiting the acquisition of property by foundations run by non-Muslim religious minorities in Turkey. It is worth pointing out, on this matter, that one of the priorities of the Association Agreement for accession is non-discrimination on the grounds of religion.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important factor that should be taken into account is the practical implementation of the reforms. It is not sufficient for the laws simply to be approved; their provisions must also be put into practice. Turkey could be said to have the basic characteristics of a democratic system, but the implementation of the reforms necessary to guarantee democracy and the Rule of Law is taking place extremely slowly. Essential reforms in the State Security Courts have still not been carried out, the situation of torture and abuse has scarcely improved, especially in the southeast, due largely to difficulties in prosecuting the members of the security forces who are responsible for these acts. There are limitations on the practical independence of the judiciary, due amongst other reasons, to the fact that the Supreme Council of judges and prosecutors is headed by the Minister of Justice, which prevents any practical separation of the competences of the executive and the judicial powers. The Law of Criminal Prosecution still prevents judgments that have been challenged from being reviewed or any measure to compensate for violations of the European Convention of Human Rights from being adopted. The action plan for the southeast has still not been made public and Turkey has yet to sign up to the Council of Europe’s framework convention on the protection of national minorities. All of this remains problematic, not to mention the major limitations inherent in the judicial system itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the legislative reforms, any real improvement in this field will depend on the correct implementation and interpretation of development legislation. In practice, it has already become clear that actions that no longer constitute an offence, in light of the recent reform of the Penal Code, could still be considered to be an offence under some other Article of criminal legislation and punished, in some cases, even more harshly.</p>
<p class="contents">An essential element of the Turkish process of democratisation is what is known as the National Programme for the Incorporation of the Acquis, presented by the Turkish government shortly after the Council of the European Union approved the Association Agreement for accession in March 2001. This represents a major step forwards in the right direction but it is inadequate because it contains various shortcomings that could endanger the objective of fully meeting the priorities and objectives required by the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In some aspects, this National Programme for the Incorporation of the Acquis is imprecisely worded, which will lead to problems of interpretation before it can move ahead. Specifically, it should mention the abolition of the death penalty, the subordination of the armed forces to civilian authority, the eradication of corruption, the socio-economic situation of the southeast of the country, which has a majority Kurdish population and the lifting of the state of emergency in the southeast. Furthermore, this plan gives no commitment to eliminate legal barriers to the transmission of radio and television programmes in mother tongues other than Turkish or to safeguard the cultural rights of Turkish minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In this process of reform and progress, in the recognition of the cultural rights of minorities, Turkey is still falling short. The recent reform of the Constitution has led to the amendment of Articles 26 and 28 and to the corresponding removal of the ban on the use of other languages. Nevertheless, the recent demonstrations by university students and parents of schoolchildren demanding the inclusion of Kurdish language courses in the academic curriculum have been harshly dealt with by the security forces, who state that the Kurdish language as such does not exist, that the only national language of the Republic is Turkish and that individuals who were arrested and who remain in prison are being detained because of their suspected support for the terrorist organisation, the Kurdistan Workers Party, otherwise known as the PKK. This message was repeated by the National Security Council when it stated that the campaigns requesting Kurdish language education have been orchestrated by the PKK with clearly separatist intentions, adding that this party, the PKK, is attempting to take another step in its strategy of politicisation and of creating a Kurdish nation.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem that cannot be sidestepped in the legislative process of Turkey’s democratisation is the problem of the recognition of the right of association, to be specific, the criminalisation and shutting down of political parties. In 1994 and as a replacement for the banned Democratic Party (DEP), accused of maintaining links with the terrorist organisation of the Kurdistan Workers Party, the People’s Democratic Party (HADEP) was created; the former members of the DEP who wished to become members of HADEP had to request the express permission of the government, which only allowed those who had no criminal record or against whom there had been no complaint to join. Since its creation, HADEP has been the dominant political force in the southeast of the country and controls the majority of the councils in the cities in this region; but also, since its inception, HADEP has had the threat of being closed down hanging over its head. The Constitutional Court’s decision of June 2001 to close down the Islamicist Fazilet Party highlighted the problems existing in the field of freedom of expression and association. The Constitutional Court is now trying the HADEP case. The public prosecutor has requested its ban on the grounds of its suspected links with the terrorist and leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party, Abdullah Ocalan. It is being accused of using party meetings to spread propaganda for Ocalan and to incite hatred against the constitutional order and the indissoluble unity of the Turkish Republic. There have been thousands of cases of people from the HADEP party being arrested, and although the majority have been released following a short period of detention, these individuals were arrested for being suspected members of the PKK terrorist organisation and were accused of being involved in terrorist activities. No one was arrested and tried simply for being a party member.</p>
<p class="contents">It can nevertheless be stated that in Turkey any mention of Kurdistan, its flag, or the call for education in the Kurdish language, is considered to be collaboration with or support for terrorist activity. It is also true, however, that, until it is banned, HADEP is a legally recognised party in Turkey and no one can be arrested simply for being a member of this party. Making it illegal would signify a step backwards in Turkey’s progress towards accession and would require the European Union to adopt a common position expressing its concern at the negative impact of such a move on freedom of expression and of association and on political pluralism, on the understanding that respect for the cultural rights of the Turkish people of Kurdish origin is one of the objectives set out in the Association Agreement for accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it cannot be denied that Turkey has made progress in fulfilling the political criteria for accession; consequently, the prospect of opening negotiations has come even closer. Nevertheless, this progress is still not sufficient to begin talks on accession. One of the main obstacles is the protection of the cultural rights of all Turks, regardless of their ethnic origin. Recently, the Secretary General for European Union Affairs, Volkan Vural, announced that a second package of legislative reforms is being prepared. This gives us hope today that we will see a new step in Turkey’s process of democratisation, which will open the way to a more fluid relationship and to negotiations, perhaps in the future, on its future incorporation into the Union.</p>

The background to our debate is the decision taken in Helsinki in 1999 to accord Turkey candidate status, and the pre-accession strategy agreed on this basis. All this strategy's elements have in the meantime been implemented. Turkey has, in particular, in order to meet the priorities of the Accession Partnership, accepted a national programme for the adoption of the acquis communautaire, thus at last setting in motion a reform process that is also playing an ever greater role in public discussion in Turkey. Initial results are already visible. Last year's constitutional reform is evidence that Turkey is seriously getting to grips with the political reforms that are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Laeken European Council paid tribute to Turkey's efforts and noted that Turkey had moved closer to its objective of joining the European Union. Allied with this is, though, the expectation on the part of the European Union that the reform process will be carried on consistently. Turkey does not at present meet the political Copenhagen criteria. During my conversations in Ankara a few days ago, I strongly encouraged the Turkish government to be determined in proceeding with their package of political and economic reforms. My conversation partners, who were from all the parties in the present coalition government, confirmed to me both their desire for reform and their objective of rapprochement with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to implement last year's constitutional changes, Turkey has, this month, enacted a first mini-package, the provisions of which the Commission welcomes in so far as they deal with pre-trial detention. Although these provisions comply with EU standards, we take the view that they do not go far enough as regards freedom of opinion. Having expected more extensive and comprehensive reforms in accordance with the constitution, we are unable to find much improvement in the new wording of the relevant articles as compared with the current legal provisions on freedom of opinion. During my brief visit to Turkey, I therefore underlined our expectation that further steps would be taken in such areas as freedom of association, the use of languages in radio, television and education, the abolition of the death penalty and the introduction of fundamental legal rights in accordance with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside changes in the law, there need to be real changes on the ground through the way the law is interpreted in Turkey. At the end of the day, we must not measure the human rights situation in Turkey according to what is written down, but have to judge it by what actually happens in practice from day to day. State prosecutors and judges have an important part to play in this. To this end, the Commission offers Turkey a range of training programmes, which are eagerly taken up.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, like Parliament, is observing developments in connection with the court case against the HADEP party in the Turkish Constitutional Court. A new hearing is to begin on 1 March, that is, the day after tomorrow, and representatives from the Commission are endeavouring to be present at it.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that the Commission assesses this case on the basis of the Copenhagen political criteria, and so I can tell you that, in our view, a ban on the HADEP party in Turkey would offend against our political principles. Last year, the Turkish parliament amended the constitution towards strengthening human rights in Turkey, but left untouched the legal basis for the banning of political parties. It has therefore to be said that current provisions in Turkey cannot accord with EU standards. The Commission therefore calls on the Turkish government to make further efforts to comply with these standards.</p>
<p class="contents">It can indeed be said that Turkey is in the midst of an intensive debate on the future course of its reform policy. Positive steps, for example the constitutional reform, can be set against other areas, in which we continue to observe deficits. As a result, though, I am confident that Turkey possesses the strength and the will to carry on with its reform policy. I see Turkey's consent to the opening of an Amnesty International office as a favourable indication. I also see it as positive that the mini-package to implement the constitutional reforms, enacted a few weeks ago, is soon to be followed by another package of legislative implementing measures, which is, apparently, to cover laws on the press and on public assembly, criminal law and the law on the powers of the police.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my hope and expectation that this legislation will clearly manifest a strong desire for reform, and so I take this opportunity again to encourage Turkey to strengthen democratic rights within its borders, set the relevant legislative initiatives in motion and bring them to a conclusion. What is and will continue to be crucial, is that human rights are safeguarded in practice and that Turkey, as regards day-by-day social coexistence guarantees the benchmarks of a democratic and pluralist society. It makes a nation – and the Turkish nation is no exception – stronger rather than weaker, when it sets itself the highest objectives as regards the realisation of democracy and human rights.</p>

<p class="contents">Turkey’s constitutional court wishes to declare a further political party illegal. Over the last 40 years, as many as 23 political parties have been declared illegal in Turkey. These have been parties with religious, regional, cultural and ethnic bases which have been considered to go against the Kemalist structure of the unitary state.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to draw a clear comparison. If we had had such a constitution among the various Member States of the European Union, a large number of parties would have been declared illegal including, for example, my own party, the Swedish Christian Democratic Party, and its sister parties throughout the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I promise that we in the European Parliament will show no lack of vigour, energy and persistence in monitoring this judicial process in Turkey. Within the framework of an ad hoc delegation, we intend to act in such a way as to protect democratic rights, the multiparty system and, of course, the rights of the Kurdish minority too in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Kemal Atatürk, who died more than 60 years ago, founded a unitary Turkish state. It is time for a debate among the Turkish people about whether this constitution and this unitary state fulfil the requirements of modern society and pluralistic democracy. My view is that the Kemalist unitary state is based more upon power, threats, compulsion and authoritarian demands for loyalty than upon winning over people’s hearts and inspiring an inner loyalty, healthy affection and patriotism in relation to their own country. The time should be past when a constitutional court declares one political party after another illegal. Moreover, these are large political parties more often than not.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey has not signed the Council of Europe’s convention governing the rights of minorities and proceeds ultimately on the basis of Kemal Atatürk’s constitution harking back to the 1920s and 1930s. I wonder if Turkey is not in actual fact scoring an own goal by not opening itself to the outside world and not acting differently towards its minorities. Only if it changes in these ways can people’s hearts be won over in Turkey and the rest of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is decisive, as the Commissioner has said, is actual practice and implementation. I sometimes rather feel that we are being led a dance when the constitution is amended, but not the implementing legislation, thus making it possible for the police and the other security authorities to act, for example, against those who want to be taught in Kurdish and sign up for courses accordingly. I believe that we cannot accept that.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who believed that the Kurdish question was resolved by Öcalan's arrest has, alas, been disappointed, as Turkey has not yet taken advantage of the chance to pursue another policy on the Kurds, for example, by giving the mayors of whom the President of the Council has spoken, the means – financial and otherwise – enabling them to improve matters in South-East Anatolia, which is what they want to do. On the other hand, admittedly, intransigent officials are arrested or abducted without it being known whether this is the work of the security forces or of private organisations and without any real attempt being made to find the people who have been abducted or those responsible for the abductions.</p>
<p class="contents">What Parliament stands by is this: We campaign for the cultural rights of the Kurds – rights that are inalienable, that do not amount to separatism or terrorism, that do not create difficulties for Turkey, but which could be the salvation of Turkey as a European country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since then, the PKK has declared a ceasefire and Turkey has started its long programme of political reform. In particular the revision of Article 69 seems to be designed to expand the scope of party political activity within the political system.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform should be taken further quickly so that no regionalist party, nor those of mainly Kurdish origin, should be under threat. It would be a very good signal of the resolve of Turkey to carry on with European integration should the Supreme Court decide this case at the very moment when Turkey takes its seats inside the Convention. The banning of the Fazilet party last year was a poor signal. If there are serious allegations against persons for connections with terrorism they should be charged, but the party itself should be saved for parliamentary democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

HADEP is a democratic party which is trying to defend the cause of the Kurds peacefully, and has done so in the past. It is therefore only right that the Council, the Commission and Parliament, too, should denounce this charge unequivocally. I can only hope, therefore, that the decision to re-examine this case next Friday in terms of the present constitution and the proposed constitutional changes, and not to proceed full steam ahead towards a ban, forms part of a more general change of direction regarding what, in my view, is the central issue under debate here, namely the question of how political, cultural and religious minorities in Turkey should be accorded a place in the political system.</p>
<p class="contents">This is about fundamental human rights: the right to speak one’s own language, the right to use that language in the media and the right to be taught in that language. But more than anything, it is about the need for crucial political reforms. In this sense, the case against HADEP epitomises the choice which Turkey is facing: either the country opts for pluralism, democracy and freedom of expression, or these basic European principles remain subordinate to a dogmatic view of state security.</p>
<p class="contents">However, let there be no misunderstanding about the fact that this criticism of Turkey and this support for HADEP are based on one crucial premise, namely that it is to be welcomed that Turkey is one of the EU’s candidate countries and that the European Union must do everything in its power to enable Turkey to acquire membership. Consequently, it is not my intention, by supporting HADEP and criticising the Turkish government and authorities, to keep Turkey outside the EU indefinitely, but rather to prepare Turkey for fully-fledged democratic membership of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, we quickly became aware of the limits of this process. We were refused permission to visit Mrs Leyla Zana, the Sakharov prize-winner, and other former MPs of Kurdish origin, who are still in prison. Whilst the human rights organisations welcome every advance that is made, the sheer number of specific cases they deal with demonstrate how much work still needs to be done before we see the democratic Turkey that we all hope and pray for.</p>
<p class="contents">We did not expect, however, to find out some weeks later from the President of the HADEP party himself, Mr Murat Bozlak, that he was summoned before the Constitutional Court to face a likely ban on the political party that he leads. In order to encourage the European Parliament to react strongly to this extremely serious and arbitrary development, we immediately invited President Bozlak to come and meet all the groups and proposed sending a parliamentary delegation to Turkey. I welcome the unanimous support for both these initiatives. The only crime that HADEP has committed is that of continuing to gain influence throughout Turkey, to the point where it is now guaranteed, if elections were to be held, that it would enter parliament, in spite of a specially made law, which sets a 10% minimum score for parties to be represented in parliament. I also welcome the fact that we decided, by means of a resolution which all the groups support, to send a clear message to the Turkish authorities, and the following statement, in particular: ‘The European Parliament calls for the case against HADEP to be dropped’. I therefore propose that together we undertake to ensure that this is done. It is the very least that we can demand of a country that will tomorrow be taking part in the Convention on the future of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am in favour of Turkey's admittance to the EU, but the Copenhagen criteria must be met. Whilst I welcome the amendments to the constitution, they fall far short of my expectations. Turkey must take still further action, or else it will not be able to join the EU. The death penalty has not been abolished, but only restricted. Turkish politicians show little zeal when it comes to putting the changes to the constitution into practice. Whilst Arabic, English, German and Chinese may be taught at Turkish institutions of higher education, Kurdish, the mother tongue of 12 million people, remains barred from the education system.</p>
<p class="contents">Over 10 000 students who availed themselves of their constitutionally guaranteed right and petitioned for Kurdish to be allowed, now face criminal proceedings. They are charged with separatism. Any peaceful and political solution to the Kurdish issue will involve the lifting of the ban on the language and the incorporation of Kurdish as a subject in the curriculum. The Copenhagen criteria include the right to native-language teaching and media, and must be a non-negotiable condition for accession. Members of HADEP have also been arrested and accused of initiating the Kurdish campaign. The opening of proceedings to ban HADEP have seen increased repression of its members. In the past year, 2001, 3 245 HADEP members were arrested, over fifty-five offices were searched and shut down. Over 3 000 HADEP members were arrested on World Peace Day, and one person was even killed.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Verheugen, I challenge you to travel to South-East Turkey and talk to the thirty-seven mayors who belong to HADEP, and who receive no financial aid. The villages that were destroyed have still not yet been rebuilt. How are the thousand refugees meant to survive? Why is it that the South-East gets no money from MEDA Programme funds, even though the rules require it? Banning HADEP will be a backward step for democracy, and will set Turkey off on a march in the wrong direction on the road that leads to Europe. Along with my group, I vehemently demand that the proceedings against HADEP be abandoned at once. The Conference of Presidents has resolved to send a delegation to Turkey. Until such time as Turkey publicly speaks out against banning HADEP, any delegation must show its solidarity with HADEP and support it. We must show here and now that this House does not accept undemocratic actions!</p>
