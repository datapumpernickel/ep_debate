<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi, Romano,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is not without some emotion that I stand before you for the last time as President of the European Commission. In a few days, in fact, the road we have been travelling together for five years will come to an end. These five years have been marked by major political and institutional changes and momentous events in Europe and around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to begin this meeting of ours by reminding you where the European Union stood in 1999. On the institutional front, there were many who wanted to limit reform to the so-called ‘leftovers’ from Amsterdam and who proposed an institutional agenda that was limited in scope and certainly not up to the new challenges facing the Union. In the unfavourable economic climate of the time, there was very strong concern, doubt and scepticism about the actual chances of bringing in the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as strong were the uncertainties about when to carry out enlargement and the number of countries to include. Many were pressing to limit enlargement to six countries at most. No definite time frame or clear rules had been set out, and the press and public opinion voiced deep-seated fears. Then there were the even greater threats of the Balkan situation looming over the whole continent, in the absence of a clear and convincing EU strategy in the region. Lastly, the Commission itself was in crisis, shaken by the events of 1998 and 1999. Its credibility and authority had fallen to their lowest ebb, and therefore it needed to restore its image by carrying out the first serious, comprehensive overhaul of its administrative structure.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, faced with this situation, we took up the challenge. Working together with you, we put forward an ambitious agenda for Europe. The kingpin of this agenda, the unifying element that drove our actions and gave them coherence, was enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">The unification of Europe – involving the inclusion of ten new countries, a clear timetable for the other candidate countries and real prospects for the full integration of all the Balkan countries – is the greatest contribution that the European Union could make to the stabilisation and the political, economic and cultural growth of the continent as a whole. To meet the challenge of enlargement, we had to strike the right balance. We could not move too slowly and run the risk of losing the momentum for joining Europe that was very strong in the candidate countries. We could not rush the process either, without ensuring that we had the support of the people in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore watched over the reform processes under way in central and eastern Europe and gave them our firm support, and at the same time we took on board the concerns voiced by Europeans about the costs of enlargement, population movements, environmental risks, nuclear safety and corruption. Public support in the new Member States exceeded all expectations, as shown by the success of the various referendums. We have demonstrated that negotiation and dialogue, though at times difficult, complicated and painstaking, are the only democratic way to export democracy and stability.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the ambitious enlargement of the Union to meet half the continent’s aspirations for freedom, security and democracy meant that we had to be equally ambitious in dealing with the overhaul of our institutional set-up. Therefore, at first alone but later with the support of an ever-growing consensus, we pressed for reforms that would be equal to the demands of running a Europe of 25 or more Member States. Thus we have been constantly involved in negotiations on institutional reform for the last five years, with the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Nice Conference, the initial rejection by the Irish of the new treaty and its consequences, the European Convention and the Constitutional Treaty. Thanks to the joint efforts of Parliament and the Commission, the convention method has finally established itself, raising the levels of democracy and transparency in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the scepticism surrounding this proposal, which I have supported ever since that night in Nice, was very deep. Never have two views on Europe clashed so much as they did then. On the one side a strong, political Europe, equal to the global challenges facing us, and on the other a weak Europe, seen merely as an area of prosperity, stability and regulation and not as a real political entity. For the rest, Europe has changed considerably compared with the 1980s and 1990s, as have the various governments’ attitudes and policies on Europe, as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Over these years, alliances between governments have very often been pragmatic, one-off affairs, linked to specific proposals or the current domestic or international political situation; there have been no groupings of countries consistently pressing for closer integration. We, for our part, have always fought to make our Union stronger, more democratic and more effective. We put forward highly innovative proposals – for the EU Foreign Minister, for instance – both at the European Convention and at the Intergovernmental Conference that followed.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we have reached the end of the story. In a few days’ time, the Constitutional Treaty will be signed in Rome. This will, without a doubt, be a highly significant event for Europe, bringing greater democracy, greater simplicity and greater transparency, although it does have other, less satisfactory aspects – the situations where unanimity is still needed, for instance. This is a story to which we, and especially you, the Members of the European Parliament, have made a fundamental contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I have spoken about enlargement, institutional reform and policies for growth and peace: none of that would have been possible if, while we were working on all those areas, we had not restored order, strength, prestige and pride to our own institution, the European Commission. Indeed, there can be no change without comprehensive reform of the structures and apparatus of administration. The first positive effects are now starting to be felt in several sectors, such as decentralised financial control or external aid programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, however, the reforms contained strong political messages and were designed to restore the Commission’s legitimacy, independence and efficiency. I need only mention the system for the rotation of the directors-general, after long years when certain directorates-general had regularly been allocated to officials of the same nationality; or the nationality rules for Commissioners and their staff; or, lastly, the decision to move the Commissioners closer to the departments they control.</p>
<p class="contents">More than anything else, however, there is one element that has characterised my Commission and of which I am particularly proud: its collegiality. I have been able to rely on a close-knit, highly professional team, which has worked together in great harmony. Some members of this Commission today hold top positions in their national governments and parliaments. These too, I feel, are clear, tangible signs of the renewal and growth of the institution over which I have had the honour of presiding for more than five years. I am also sure that the Commission will become even stronger under the presidency of José Manuel Barroso, and I wish him every success.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the process of unifying our continent gives us a great opportunity to extend the stability and prosperity of the Union throughout the region surrounding it. Therefore, we have not confined ourselves to pushing the divide, the ‘Wall’, a few hundred kilometres further east or south. For years there was talk about the borders of Europe, but no working proposal was ever put forward. We have now proposed a new vision for the Union’s borders through our neighbourhood policy, which aims at setting up a genuine special relationship with the whole arc of countries from Russia to Morocco. The European Constitution itself recognises the need – which we highlighted – to establish a new relationship between the Union and our neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when everybody is talking about a ‘clash of civilisations’ – although I am convinced that it is mostly a ‘clash of ignorance’ – we have given a great boost to intercultural dialogue and mutual understanding, particularly in the Euro-Mediterranean area. On the subject of the Mediterranean, I remember well the fierce criticism I received when I wanted to open up to Colonel Gaddafi’s Libya. Now, two days after the sanctions against Libya were lifted, that moment really seems a long time ago. It has been just four years, but four years of discreet, constant, intense work that have enabled us to set important changes in motion in that country and have paved the way for Libya to be readmitted into the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, throughout these years we have always come out strongly and clearly in favour of multilateralism. More world and regional governance, a closer partnership with the United Nations, and less disparity between North and South have been the goals inspiring our actions. We have not merely ‘talked’ of multilateralism: we have put it into practice in order to achieve our goals and political options.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall mention just a few examples. We have linked the objective of liberalising trade to the need to take greater account of the legitimate demands of civil society and developing countries. We have played a central role in enlarging the World Trade Organisation in order to encourage more effective world governance. We have geared our cooperation and development and our humanitarian programmes above all towards the reduction of poverty. We have strengthened our links with other regions of the world, such as Latin America or Asia, and have assisted in new regional integration processes, such as the African Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we have made a real contribution to strengthening the transatlantic relationship. After the war in Iraq, many claimed that the gap between the two continents could no longer be bridged. I have never believed that kind of idea, since I am certain that, in those areas where Europe has its own identity and is not paralysed by national vetoes, it can achieve significant results when working alongside Washington – and on equal terms. We have therefore worked hard and effectively with our US partners on practical issues of great importance, both in the area of security and the fight against terrorism, and in certain parts of the world such as the Balkans. I have said this before and I say it again: in this difficult, often tragic world, Europe – and Europe alone – has been able to export democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the economic field, the euro has without doubt been the star of our mandate. From the outset, the euro was to be the cornerstone of the new Europe. From the outset, therefore, we regarded the euro as a great political project and not just an economic one; a project for political leaders and not just central bankers; a project requiring vision, authority and coordination. Throughout our mandate we have stressed the need for stronger economic governance, because the cost to Europe of not standing united in this area is still too high.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, we have drawn up several proposals to adapt the Stability and Growth Pact to Europe’s new requirements and new economic reality, and we have finally opened up a debate that several players had called for but none had had the courage to begin. I must admit I smiled when, after all the criticism about my stand, a well-known French daily wrote that the Commission’s recent proposals had made the pact ‘smarter’.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we have consistently made our contributions to the Lisbon Strategy and put forward the various proposals needed to achieve our goal of making the Union the world’s most competitive and dynamic economy by 2010. To mention just a few examples, just think of the European Research Area, the emphasis placed on innovation in enterprises and on the information society, the new lifelong learning programmes in education and training, and the opening-up of our universities to the world. The reform of the competition policy itself is one of our most significant contributions to improving our competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">In the social field, the Social Policy Agenda has been the frame of reference for a whole series of measures in the field of employment, social security, health and safety in the workplace, equal opportunities and social inclusion. We have to be honest, however, and admit that many objectives in this field have not been met. Above all, we have not achieved those objectives where we could not resort to the Community method and were held back by the need for unanimity. One of the most telling examples is perhaps the difficulties we encountered with the Community patent, which was repeatedly blocked on linguistic grounds. If the Member States do not learn to behave otherwise, the Lisbon strategy is at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are all the results we have achieved and the proposals we have put forward to set up the area of freedom, security and justice, to improve environmental protection, for the energy and transport sectors, and to strengthen health and consumer protection. For example, there is the implementation of the Tampere agenda and the efforts made to respond to the new challenges of international terrorism after the attacks of 11 September 2001. There is the Gothenburg sustainable development strategy, the Johannesburg Summit and Europe’s action to further the Kyoto Protocol, which now seems capable of producing its final results. In these areas we have truly led the world and demonstrated in practical terms how Europe’s intervention can produce added value in a multilateral context.</p>
<p class="contents">We have combined strategic decisions of enormous significance for the future of Europe – such as the European satellite navigation system Galileo, or the global strategy for the ‘single European sky’ – with prompt reactions in emergency situations, such as the shipwrecks of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> in 1999 and the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">At the beginning of our mandate there was another sector where it was essential to restore consumer confidence in the wake of the ‘mad cow’ crisis: the food sector. We responded with the integrated ‘farm-to-fork’ strategy, alongside measures such as the European Food Safety Agency. The reform of the common agricultural policy itself is designed to respond to the new challenges on the domestic and world fronts, aiming at a more sustainable strategy that is more mindful of rural development.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have put forward our political project – our vision – for post-enlargement Europe, with our proposals for the new Financial Perspective. This is a political project designed to bring a genuine European citizenship into being, a project for a Union now continental in extent which must take on new responsibilities towards its people and shoulder its own responsibilities on the international stage. This, too, has been our ambition: to make Europe a leading player on the world stage, to enable Europe to make its voice heard and work towards creating a world of peace, security and balanced development.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to conclude by mentioning one final point which, I believe, should be laid to the credit of this Commission and the European Parliament. It is the drawing-up of the framework agreement between our two institutions for the whole duration of our terms of office. The agreement has enhanced our shared initiatives, such as the practice of making it a priority to formally notify Parliament of the Commission’s major initiatives. These agreements have strengthened the political role between the Commission and the basis of its democratic legitimacy, which to a great extent lies in the European Parliament. This is undeniably an advance in democracy which I value highly and for which I am grateful to you.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to highlight the deep understanding between Parliament and the Commission on legislative matters. Conflicts between us can be counted on the fingers of one hand. We should be delighted at that: it is one of the great merits of the codecision procedure and shows how well the three institutions involved have applied it. At the end of these five years, then, I am pleased with the way constructive relations have developed between the Commission and Parliament. I hope and believe that they will remain like that in future.</p>
<p class="contents">If that is the case, it will mean that the outgoing Commission has not only developed good relations with Parliament but has also laid the groundwork for democracy to grow even stronger in Europe. Indeed, I am firmly convinced of the need to have even more Europe and even more ‘Union’ in Europe. We must commit fully to the European political project and take it forwards with strength, conviction and courage. That is what we have done over these years, and I am truly grateful to you for the help and support that you have never failed to give us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Before giving the floor to the spokespeople of the political groups, I would like – on behalf of Parliament and on my own behalf – to thank you for your work at the head of the Commission, and point out that you took up your post at a particularly difficult time in the history of Europe, and that five years later – at the end of your mandate – Europe has undergone certain historic transformations. Yes, they have been truly historic. This is not rhetoric but is truly the right word to describe what has happened in Europe during your mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">The effective implementation of the euro, the effective implementation of Monetary Union – which has been dreamt of for so long and which has taken so much work to achieve – will bear the name of the ‘Prodi Commission’. The greatest enlargement of the European Union – which will surely never be repeated – has also been carried out under your Presidency. This is one of the structural transformations of Europe that history will associate with your name and the Commission you have presided over, and also with your valuable and intense participation in the work on the Constitution, which will be subject to a referendum.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of these three issues alone, Mr Prodi, you are leaving the Presidency of the Commission with a fine record, with many achievements, political achievements, which have profoundly transformed the reality of Europe and enhanced its unity.</p>
<p class="contents">My predecessors have told me that you have always taken notice of the European Parliament, which has always found you to be a good listener. Although we have perhaps not always followed your advice, the Members of this House have always at least valued your friendliness and your constant accessibility. And, first and foremost, your commitment to Europe. It was because of that commitment to Europe – which is widely recognised – that you became President of the Commission. You can feel satisfied above all because, on leaving the Presidency, that commitment to Europe is even more widely recognised than before.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important debate, one that merits the presence of the Presidency of the Council, and one that also deserves to be attended by the entire Commission. What I would like to see in future is the Commission as a whole being present in the plenary not only when it seeks our vote of confidence, but also when assessing results on which our future, too, depends. So I would have liked today, to see both the Commission, and also the Council, fully represented.</p>
<p class="contents">This Commission, under Romano Prodi’s presidency, had – as is usual in human and political life – its light as well as its shadows. In communication terms, we have a dual role; on the one hand, we are the Commission’s allies, in that we defend the Community model, but we are also there to keep tabs on it, and we are determined to carry on doing so in future. I agree with the outgoing President of the Commission when he says that the Interinstitutional Agreement has strengthened democracy and the parliamentary approach, and we see the new Commission, too, as being bound by what we have agreed with the Commission under Mr Prodi.</p>
<p class="contents">In one historic area – that of enlargement – we achieved great things together. Our group was always a driving force behind membership for the countries of Central Europe, as well as Malta and Cyprus, and the fact that, as a result of the last elections to the European Parliament in June, Members from the ten new countries are able to take part in this debate in our House is something in which we can all take pride.</p>
<p class="contents">The outgoing President of the Commission used the term ‘intelligent’ with reference to something he once described as stupid, that being the Maastricht criteria. This utterance, this comment, by Romano Prodi is something that we still do not regard as his finest hour. We do, though, very much appreciate the work of the departing Commissioner who had responsibility for monetary matters – I do not want to name names, for if I did, I would be forced to do so in many other instances – and the way in which the former Commissioner defended the stability of Europe’s currency. I hope that the new member of the Commission with responsibility for this, and indeed the new Commission as a whole, will defend the Stability Pact and Europe’s monetary stability.</p>
<p class="contents">We were not exactly satisfied with the proposals on chemicals policy, with which we will have to deal over the coming months and quite possibly for years to come. Without wanting to go into detail, I would say that it is important that we enable this Europe of ours to compete rather than pursuing a policy that will end up with a de-industrialised Europe and the loss of jobs. We need a sensible balance between ecology and economics, and the best social policy is about creating jobs and keeping the ones we have. So it was perhaps a failing on the part both of this House and also, and in particular, of the Commission, that the targets we set as part of the Lisbon strategy were insufficiently ambitious and too diffuse. When completing the internal market, we had definite goals and fixed dates, and what we should all learn from that for the future is that we, if we want to make Europe more competitive, have to set strategic goals, and also firm dates, so that Europe is better able to compete.</p>
<p class="contents">Farewells, of course, always involve some regrets, and so let me say to you, Mr Prodi, as President of the Commission, that you know what high regard I have for you as a person, and it would be less than honest of me if I were not to mention today how I found it regrettable that you have, in recent months – one might say, in the last eighteen months or the last two years – given priority to domestic politics in Italy. I would have preferred you to have focussed all your efforts on European politics and on your work as President of the Commission. All in all, though, I would like us to take our leave of each other on a positive note. I would like to thank you all, and if I were to single out one of you, it would be Mrs Loyola de Palacio, who, as Vice-President of the Commission, was responsible for relations with the European Parliament. I would, however, like to thank all the members of the Commission for their commitment and wish them all the best. In saying that, I am not directly referring to the personal political commitments of all of them, but, personally, I wish you all the best, and I shall take it as read that the Commission as a whole wanted to do its best for this Europe of ours as a community, and that is what we, Commission and Parliament together, must continue to do, so warm thanks and best wishes to you all.</p>

Both the President of this House and Mr Poettering have already listed a number of milestones of your term of office. You took office at a difficult time; relations between Parliament and the Commission were strained in the aftermath of the fall of the Commission headed by Jacques Santer. You achieved <span class="italic">détente</span>, and did it by meeting Parliament halfway, by the way in which you in your personal conduct as President of the Commission, and also that of all your Commission, made apparent the respect that you, within the interinstitutional framework, had for this House as the representative body for Europe’s peoples. For that we are grateful to you, for you have thereby set down a milestone in the history of the European Union. Your successor will be measured by the standard you have set in your dealings with this House. Anyone who wants, as President of the Commission, to enjoy the confidence of this House, cannot do less than Romano Prodi has done.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">There is something else, Mr President of the Commission, of which you can be proud and for which we are grateful to you. In a very difficult period for Europe’s European and international policy, you took up a position to which I want again to make reference. Here, in this House, President Prodi declared that the use of arms must always and only be the policy of last resort, that recourse may be had to arms only when all the alternatives and all the policy instruments have been exhausted, and that the United Nations is the only forum in which such decisions may legitimately be taken. He affirmed that the consequences of warfare would be disastrous and incalculable. That was a visionary speech that you made that day. As far as the ‘wrong war’ against Iraq is concerned, you, as President of the European Commission, came to the right conclusions, and that I say with gratitude on behalf of our group as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Reference has been made to the introduction of the euro. Your campaign, and that by your Commissioners, for the Constitution – a campaign that is still going on, for it may be signed in Rome on 29 October, but this will not mean that it has been ratified – this campaign was a cause you stood up for. When it came to enlargement, too, you and Commissioner Verheugen, whom I want to mention, worked in an exemplary manner. I believe that, when things are weighed in the balance, Romano Prodi can look back with pride on a term of office, in which, as always, there were high and low points that we do not wish to gloss over. We Socialists, too, have from time to time had cause to voice criticisms, and when I compare Mr Poettering’s speech at the beginning of your term of office with the one he delivered today, the euphoria has ebbed away a bit over the five years, but that is a fact of political life.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, you are now going back to Italy, and you have as yet taken no final decisions as to what you want to do there and actually will do there. Let me tell you, though, on behalf of the Socialist Group, that, whatever you decide – and I hope you will make the right decision – the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is alongside you in that decision, not only in mind and heart, but also with political will. Many, many thanks for the cooperation over the past five years.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ALDE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, Mr Prodi, five years and one month ago you addressed this house as President-designate of an untested Commission. You told us that you wanted to put Europe at the service of the people of Europe. Liberals and Democrats backed you then, and five exhausting years later, we back you now.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberals and Democrats believe that in the long view of the Prodi Commission certain things will stand out. Your Commission launched the Lisbon Agenda and inaugurated the euro. Your Commission began the work of internal reform. It was the steward of Europe's enlargement from 15 to 25 states. Your Commission moved Europe into the world of common European security against terror.</p>
<p class="contents">You inherited a Commission badly scarred by scandal. You promised this House that you would put the Commission's house in order. That work is not finished, but it has been courageously championed by Commissioner Kinnock and you leave behind you a Commission in which reform has a firm foothold. As part of that process you have worked to make the Commission's relationship with this House open, productive and respectful. Your successor will do well to do the same.</p>
<p class="contents">Your Commission inherited a Europe searching for the road to economic reform. It leaves behind a Europe which found that road at Lisbon, however hesitantly we have stepped down it. In the service of the Lisbon Agenda your Commission has been an engine of intelligent, inventive, reformist single market legislation. Liberals and Democrats recognise and honour the exceptional personal stamp that Commissioner Bolkestein has placed on that work. In particular, the launch of the euro – the single largest logistical operation in Europe in 60 years – was a practical and political triumph.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberals and Democrats believe that we have not gone far enough on the road to economic reform or achieved what we could have. But if Europe is unlikely to achieve the Lisbon goals, the fault lies not with a Commission that failed to set the rules, but with Member States that too often failed to keep them. The Lisbon Agenda has too often been subordinated to the Paris Agenda or the Berlin Agenda or the London Agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Your Commission inherited the battered but hopeful Europe of 1989, still divided by a line from Trieste to Gdansk. Today that line is gone, wiped away by an historic enlargement that this Commission has every right to take credit for. We recognise your work, and the work of Commissioner Verheugen and the work of the hundreds of dedicated Commission staff who made the climb.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, in my country politicians most often get into trouble in their brushes with the other sex! I can think of two in your case: Penelope and Marta. You quickly dropped the first, and I am delighted to see today that you have finally ditched the second.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the conviction of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that the Prodi Commission has honoured the commitments it made to this House five years ago. Some will use today the tired claim that you have been more interested in Italian politics than the stewardship of the European Commission. But how can one review the achievements of this Commission and then insist that you had only one foot in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">It was said of the Emperor Augustus of Rome – another Italian with a European destiny – that he inherited a city of brick and left behind a city of marble. Liberals and Democrats believe that handed a city of brick, your Commission leaves behind a bigger, better, wiser Europe. I can sum it all up in one Italian word, Mr Prodi: <span class="italic">bravo</span>!</p>

<p class="contents">We acknowledge the fact that during the reform of the European Union and the work of the Convention, you and your Commission have been able to steer a straight course towards the strengthening and democratisation of the European Union, even amidst attacks not only on you personally, but also on the very existence of an autonomous and truly European institution such as yours. I must say – and here I am in agreement with Mr Schultz – that your position on Iraq was also clear and that we agreed with it.</p>
<p class="contents">This, however, did not help to avoid the war because the European Union as a whole refused once again to speak with one voice and to organise itself in such a way as to be able to speak with one voice on issues of war and peace.</p>
<p class="contents">We also acknowledge the fact that your Commission was able to resist the pressures of those governments – which I can only describe as miserly and short-sighted – who think that they can make Europe progress while keeping its budget under 1%. Let us hope, indeed, that your successor will be able to hold a firm line on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Your Commission, as has already been said, is the Commission of the enlargement and in this connection we too recognise the enormous amount of work that has also been done in preparation for the next, future enlargements, particularly with regard to Turkey. I will not, however, hide from you our disappointment at the failure to solve the Cyprus issue, regarding which we had long been asking for a firmer initiative from the Commission, which unfortunately was not forthcoming.</p>
<p class="contents">We have certainly welcomed your leadership and that of the majority of your Commission – not all, alas, and here I refer particularly to Commissioner de Palacio – on the issue of the Kyoto protocol and on climate change in general. Naturally, we would very much have liked the Commission to have proposed a Stability Pact on climate change too, an honest-to-goodness plan, with clear figures and sanctions. This did not happen, but we hope to succeed in bringing this about in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Stability Pact, as you know and as you remember, we very strongly supported your description of it as stupid. But there was no immediate initiative. We agree and are fairly satisfied with the proposal which your Commission has put forward in this regard, but it has come too late, following a serious crisis within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">On at least three issues, however, we have found ourselves on opposing sides. We regret this, and hope to convince not only you but also your successor. The first issue on which there was serious conflict with our group was undoubtedly genetically modified organisms: it was an error to lift the moratorium and I believe that EU citizens are aware of this. Then, in relation to the issue of energy and the environment, very little has been done with regard to stepping up the role of renewable energies, which over these last five years have remained a little like the Cinderella of the debate. Finally, Mr President, the PNR affair. In our view it was a grave error on the Commission’s part to concentrate on a procedure which definitively and very clearly excluded Parliament from participation in an issue which affects citizens’ rights very closely. Let us hope that we no longer have to deal with a Commission that believes that Parliament should not have a say on such matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I shall content myself with identifying a few salient features that, in our view, illustrate broad trends that have characterised, and still characterise, the action of the EU’s executive and the EU in general.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be clear that I am not putting a question mark over individuals. I am calling a policy into question. Over and above the political and national divisions, the present Commission embraces some brilliant personalities, from Mr Lamy to Mr Patten. It is the direction followed that is problematic.</p>
<p class="contents">The first example of this is the Lisbon agenda. Four years after the adoption of what the European Council called a new strategic objective for the decade, where are we? One of the proclaimed ambitions, I would point out, was to achieve full employment, whereas the figures of the Commission itself now indicate that, for the first time in ten years, we are destroying more jobs than we are creating. The other ambition was to construct the world’s most dynamic knowledge economy, whereas the Commission acknowledges a general decline in investment in key areas such as research, education and training. One figure, quoted by the Commission, really makes one shudder: more than 17% of Europe’s 15 year-olds lack the minimum reading, writing and arithmetical skills required. One might therefore have expected, at the very least, to see some initial questions asked and some tentative doubt raised as to the relevance of the headlong flight into liberalism of recent years, of which these failures might be the price. No, the question is never asked. During the crisis, the liberal wave rolls on and grows larger.</p>
<p class="contents">The second example is the 1999 Tampere programme, in particular European policy on asylum and migration. Has what human rights militants called Fortress Europe led to satisfactory results in terms of the much-touted control of migration flows? No, the repeated dramas along the Sicilian coast are testimony to the fact. Is there, therefore, a resolve to tackle the problems from the other end, that is to say by bringing about a shift in the pitiless rules of the world economy in an attempt to curb, at source, these migrations motivated by the need to survive? Emphatically, no. Heedless of the ethical, humanitarian and legal problems, the Commission is launching pilot projects aimed at establishing detention centres on the southern shore of the Mediterranean, intended for refugees intercepted at sea. What will be the next stage?</p>
<p class="contents">The last example is transatlantic relations. In the wake of 9/11, the idea had taken root that our expression of solidarity with the American people did not have to mean a docile acceptance of its leaders’ ideas on international security. ‘Allied but not aligned’ was the message. That did not prevent the Commission from declaring to President Bush at the transatlantic summit of June 2003 – in other words, after the start of the war in Iraq – that when Europe and the United States are united, no enemy can stand up to us. The fact is, history has not since borne out that bold synopsis. What public lesson has, however, been drawn from this turn of events? There’s the rub, Mr President. Alternative options are never discussed. It is, as they say, business as usual. It is time to breathe some spirit of criticism into our institutions, contradiction being an engine of progress.</p>

All of the previous EU enlargements were carried out in accordance with the principle that the same conditions which applied to the countries that were already part of the EU should apply to the new members. This was the case not only for countries such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland, which had national incomes as low as that of Poland, but which had market economies and were thus in a position to take rapid advantage of EU mechanisms. It was also the case for East Germany, which, like Poland, had to undergo political transformation. From the day of its entry to the EU, the German Democratic Republic received agricultural subsidies equivalent to 100% of those paid to farmers in West Germany, as well as production limits that equalled consumption. The conditions upon which Poland and the other Eastern Bloc countries were accepted were much worse, as well as being unjust. This injustice will continue to serve as a calling card for the work of your Commission, Mr Prodi. The EU monitors democracy in various countries outside the EU which do not have the slightest chance of ever joining it, and yet it lacked the courage to examine whether the referendums on EU accession were carried out in a democratic manner, and whether equal media time was available to both supporters and opponents of accession. Unfortunately neither equality nor democracy were in evidence, and yet the EU preferred to ignore this fact. This is another injustice that characterises the outgoing Commission’s term of office, and there are further causes for dissatisfaction with the work carried out by the Commission under your presidency. The draft Constitution was presented during this time, and the Commission’s support for this draft means that the EU is fast heading towards becoming a single state. There is talk of the principle of subsidiarity, but at the same time Member States are being deprived of competences in matters they could perfectly well regulate themselves. Little by little, plans are being drawn up for the creation of an EU army, a single foreign policy, a common currency, common legislation and a common jurisdiction. The Commission is gradually becoming a European government, and yet there is no consensus that this should happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, to date many of these are yet to be untangled. The Commission, together with the Council, did not succeed in making the changeover to the euro less costly for citizens and until the other day the Generalised System of Preferences criteria had not yet been laid down, leaving open for years to come the problem of proper development and cooperation between Europe and poorer countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Food Safety Authority of which we spoke at the start of your mandate has remained partially on paper, and the Council also has some responsibility for this: that is, it is not operational as we had promised. Furthermore, measures to combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings have been tackled in, let us say, a marginal way; the fight against terrorism has not been a real priority, despite the signs which even before 11 September were making it obvious that there was a need for stronger political and organisational action.</p>
<p class="contents">For instance, we were ignored every time we highlighted the need for regulation of information technology, at least for EU countries, with the result that today international terrorism has also become mass media terrorism. In fact, it has learnt how to use the new technologies against us, whereas these should be used not only to pursue economic goals but also to disseminate the principles of freedom, democracy and human rights. There are rules for the press, for television, for the print media, but not for the Internet, and this is an unresolved problem. These are only a few of the deficiencies which have gone unremedied over these past years.</p>
<p class="contents">They have, of course, been years of great and positive innovation: from the euro to European reunification and the Constitutional Treaty, and we thank the Commission as a whole and you, Mr President, for having worked to achieve these goals. Unfortunately, though, you have not been successful in giving Europe the change the citizens asked for, and that is more subsidiarity, less bureaucracy and more policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, as Italians we regret the fact, Mr President, that in recent times you have no longer remained above party politics while carrying out your duties, and have thus laid yourself open to criticism on many sides. As the proceedings of this Chamber testify, we have on many occasions tried to support and defend the Commission against the criticism it received at the start of the mandate. Now, however, we have been left high and dry because of your dual role, that of President of the Commission in Brussels and leader of the centre left in Italy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This meeting took place during an official visit by Mr Buzek, who was Prime Minister of Poland at the time and is now a Member of the European Parliament. I accompanied Mr Buzek as Minister for European Affairs. Even after so many years, I still have warm memories of your friendliness and openness towards my country, Mr Prodi, and would like to thank you for this.</p>
<p class="contents">You have presided over the European Commission during a historic period, which included the fifth and largest enlargement in the history of the EU. You have made history and will go down in history. Since enlargement the EU has become more European and more representative of our continent, and we hope that given time we will also be able to compete more effectively with America and Asia. Yet your term of office was not only one of great change, but also one that raised a great many questions which your Portuguese successor will have to deal with. You have left us with high levels of unemployment in the EU and the idea of a two-speed Europe, that is to say, of a superior and an inferior Europe. Following in the footsteps of Jacques Delors is not an easy task, although following in those of Jacques Santer is much easier, as his strides were not and are not giant ones. In conclusion, however, today we are sitting in a Parliament that represents 25 countries and not 15, and the credit for this is yours, Mr Prodi. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fear that, when it comes to taking stock, the role you have played has not come up to our expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">Admittedly, a lot of Commissioners have done some excellent work, and we are sorry to see them go. There have been many instances of progress in the field of security in all its forms. We thank Mrs de Palacio, whose courage we have appreciated; Mr Liikanen, who has succeeded in carrying a number of important issues forward; Mr Busquin, for his efforts on research; and Mr Barnier, who has offered us a new vision of the regional funds. I must also mention the difficulties overcome by Mr Byrne in confronting the problems of food safety, and Mrs Reding and Mr Vitorino, whose skills we have appreciated.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, Mr Prodi, where was the inspiration so eagerly awaited by MEPs? Although you have successfully carried enlargement through, you have never clearly launched the debate on Europe’s borders and on migration flows. You have lacked ambition in implementing the Lisbon strategy, in improving economic governance and in promoting policies in favour of young people.</p>
<p class="contents">Why, Mr Prodi, is the image of the European Commission deteriorating to such an extent in the eyes of our fellow citizens? Here is one practical example: this morning, I learn that, in connection with the Geneva-Lyon-Bordeaux axis, your Commission, urged on by Mr Bolkestein, is being extremely and incomprehensibly rigid in requiring a second European call for tenders for completion of the remaining 50 kilometres at a time when a tender has already been accepted for the Lyon-Bordeaux axis. Issuing a second European call for tenders, for the sake of 50 kilometres, is a waste of time and money. It is a technocratic decision that goes against common sense. How am I to explain to my fellow citizens that this decision will be more expensive and that it will cause delay? I know what they will say to me on the subject of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, if the Commission acts in this way, no amount of communication strategies will prevent your and our efforts on the ground from being in vain. If people are to believe in a strong Europe that is closer to the people, there is still everything to be done in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I speak on behalf of my group and of many Members of this House when I confirm that you have indeed worked very closely and very well with this House. The same can be said of the Vice-Presidents, Mrs de Palacio and Mr Kinnock and of all the members of this Commission. A milestone has been reached, standards have been set, and so it shall remain. I wonder, Mrs Grossetête, whether the Barroso Commission will adhere to these standards. Mr Barroso has not so far demonstrated that, whereas Mr Prodi has.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and contrary to what some Members have said, enlargement and the Mediterranean policy prove you right, and in these areas too, we will have demands to make of Mr Barroso; we will be asking whether he can pursue these to the same extent and with the same care as did the Commission under Mr Prodi. This leads me to mention dialogue with Islam. As President of the Commission, Mr Prodi pointed out that, if we want greater security, it is not more weapons that we need, but willingness to engage in dialogue with our neighbours as part of the neighbourhood policy, and where did that originate? It came from the Prodi Commission. It was a major achievement, and we must not merely say thank you for it, but also follow it through in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I would have liked more in the field of employment policy and also in many other areas, but here it was not the Commission, but the Council that was, regrettably, very cautious and hesitant, as President Prodi has already pointed out. He it was who was the first to have the courage to say, in language that was perhaps rather provocative, that the Stability Pact as it had been applied was not very intelligent. Proposals have now been made, and I am convinced that most of us will back them, as will most of the finance ministers. As an economist, I say that every economic rule must be applied intelligently rather than dogmatically and bureaucratically. I am sure that Professor Prodi was also the first to recognise that.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say one thing in conclusion with reference to the subject currently under debate, something of which Mr Bourlanges, who is sitting here beside me, can speak with experience. Contrary to what journalists would have us believe, what matters is not that a man or anyone should be shot down in flames for belonging to a particular government or following a particular political line. What we Social Democrats and the majority in this House are doing is seeking to uphold the standards that this Commission has set in fundamental rights and freedoms and in non-discrimination. To these we want a clear response. The question will be, in the days to come, whether the Barroso Commission is able, particularly where fundamental rights and freedoms are concerned – the catalogue of which you were very actively involved in drawing up – to uphold these standards. The role of women needs to be promoted more, and there must be no discrimination on the grounds of gender or of sexual orientation. These standards, set by the Prodi Commission, are what it is all about. Mr Barroso must demonstrate his ability to maintain them.</p>

I wish, in this House, to emphasise the quality of your track record.</p>
<p class="contents">You were given responsibility for launching the euro in coin of the realm. It was an onerous responsibility, and you managed to carry it out successfully. We were promised a shambles but, ever since the first day of January 2002, and thanks to skilful preparation, our fellow citizens have had no trouble making the single European currency their own. Where the environment is concerned, it has been possible to accomplish major progress thanks to the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol, the Water Framework Directive and the directive on waste reduction and recycling.<span class="bold"> </span>By preparing a genuine common policy on asylum and immigration and stepping up the fight against crime at Community level, progress has been made in promoting freedom of movement and establishment within the EU. Measures have also been taken to promote the mobility of students, researchers and workers. All these advances show the degree to which you have been able to place European citizens at the heart of your concerns in order to assure them of a better environment.</p>
<p class="contents">You had to lead the difficult negotiations for enlargement of the EU, this great reunification of the European family. In spite of pressure from the European Council, you managed to stay the course without flinching, so that welcoming the ten new states did not lead to the EU becoming paralysed.</p>
<p class="contents">At the institutional level, we cannot but be satisfied with the preparation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the necessary and courageous reform of the Commission. Moreover, the positions you defended during the IGC have been taken into account in the draft European Constitution, which will, I hope, enable us in future to help this enlarged EU to thrive all the more. In this regard, your budget proposals for the future constitute, moreover, a clear-sighted vision of our needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, the principal objectives you presented to Parliament on 15 February 2000 have been achieved. Your actions have been fair and inspired.

The European Free Alliance parties welcome our new neighbours and look forward to the day when our own countries – Scotland, Wales and Catalonia for example – can take their place at the top table as independent Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Five years ago, Mr Prodi, you spoke at some length about the need for the European Union to reconnect with its citizens. Until five years ago opinion polls showed there to be higher levels of public support for the EU in Scotland than in other parts of the UK. However, that support differential has now been eroded. One of the principal reasons for that is a policy that has been one of the European Union’s biggest failures – the common fisheries policy. Your Commission had the task of reforming the CFP. You had an opportunity to give hope to Scotland’s fishing communities, but instead you gave despair. You could have taken up proposals from this Parliament to establish meaningful, devolved, regional management of fisheries, but instead you promoted toothless advisory councils. The blame cannot be laid solely on the European Commission, as successive UK governments have repeatedly sacrificed Scotland’s interests, but the final straw for my party – a pro-European party – was the illogical decision taken this year to include the CFP as one of only a handful of exclusive competences in the draft Constitution. With that clause remaining, we will be voting against the Constitution in any referendum. The Commission's end-of-term report, fisheries section, must therefore read 'failed'! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Can we cherish the fond illusion of the excellence of a gradualistic process subordinate to this globalisation, without realising that globalisation is consuming the rights which matured in the welfare states of the twentieth century and is creating new global dynamics of injustice and disenfranchisement?</p>

<p class="contents">First: the introduction of the euro has of course been an important achievement. The Commission, however, could have done more to support the Member States in combating the resulting rise in prices and in helping businesses forced to square accounts with a euro that was too strong.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: the problems relating to enlargement are very far from solved. The new countries complain of still being thought of as second-class, while the old ones will have to deal with a situation where there is less funding available and a workforce in the enlargement countries that is much cheaper than their own.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must lament the fact that the reform of the Stability Pact, which has been considered an urgent matter since 2001, is still incomplete, particularly after the crisis following 11 September. As other Members have done, I would also like to remind you that in this Chamber, or rather in the Chamber of Strasbourg, it was Mr Prodi himself who correctly described the pact as stupid.</p>
<p class="contents">From the future Commission, we expect concrete and rapid answers to these problems, and we expect it to speed up Euro-bureaucracy as much as possible. To conclude, it has truly saddened us, Mr Prodi, perhaps because in 1999 we too gave you our trust, to have seen you all too often playing a leading party role in Italian national politics.

I think that we could easily fill a whole sitting with the Eurostat issue alone, for example. However, that will be unnecessary because last week, the Prodi Commission pronounced what I regard as a damning final verdict about itself with its own advice about Turkey’s possible accession to the European Union. Indeed, in doing so, the Commission performed the ultimate anti-European act. The EU’s previous enlargement to include countries of former eastern Europe is open to criticism as regards its timescale or some of the modalities involved, but nobody challenges the principle that those eastern European countries belong to the common European civilisation. This favourable response to Turkey, however, a country that is not European, whether in geographical, political, cultural, historical or religious terms, is worse than a mistake.

You said that if the turnout at the 2004 European elections were to be higher than in 1999, you would have completed your task successfully. Unfortunately, you yourself are aware of the outcome of those elections; you, too, know that 45.7% of the people voted. That is not only exceptionally low, but, above all, is also 4% lower than in 1999. Obviously, we do not wish to pass judgment in the old way, using one single criterion – certainly as an advocate of the Community method, I would definitely not venture to do anything like that – so I admit that many positive things have happened in each of the four areas for which you set strategic objectives, and for that I am indebted to you. I would also like to thank all the Members of the Commission who have probably worked very hard for five years running.</p>
<p class="contents">If, however, I ask myself whether the Union’s benefits are felt and understood by its citizens, if I see how people react to enlargement, if I see how the Commission and all other European institutions are, time and again, associated with fraud, if I conclude that the image of the European institutions has not improved – it is enough to look at the latest Eurobarometer surveys – then I have to say that the policy has certainly failed in one area, and that is building bridges with the public. Is this something to do with the substance of the policy, or with the lack of contact and consultation with the representative civil society? Is this attributable to a lack of professionalism in communicating, or is it a combination of the three? I would like to find out from the President of the Commission how he himself deals with this, and whether he has any recommendations to make to his successor as to how to make a better job of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to begin with the historic transformation represented by the reunification of Europe, or a major part of Europe, after the Cold War years. A great triumph for democracy and stability. Over and above individual achievements, which it would be all too easy to enumerate, I believe that the most politically significant aspect of the Prodi Commission’s record is actually in the conception of the Commission’s role: it has been seen not as a bureaucratic body, but as a political body, which has given impetus and vigour to the entire European process. The dialogue and cooperation between Commission and Parliament have reinforced that political core itself, that driving force of the Union which, if one adopts a European and federalist vision, as I do, is the only approach which can truly turn Europe into a great supranational political power. At times this may have annoyed certain national governments, but there is no doubt that it has represented a great step forward for the Union, and it has been put on an official footing for the first time in the new principles of the Constitutional Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, Europe still has difficult challenges ahead in creating peace and security, in combating terrorism in a truly effective way, and not with war, and in restoring impetus to our societies and economies along the Lisbon lines. But these are challenges that can be met only if we have stronger institutions, as you said, and a more united Europe, and this is the approach that the Prodi Commission has adopted in its patient and resolute work.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to see Parliament extend its thanks to you and all the Commissioners, as is indeed happening. As far as I am concerned in particular – since five years ago I had the honour, together with Chancellor Schroeder, to put your name forward as Commission President at the Berlin European Council and as I also nominated Mario Monti – I would like to say to you, Romano, and to Mario Monti, that Italy feels honoured by the way in which you, in your European labours, have been a model of the best pro-European and democratic traditions of our country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the face of these challenges, the Member States have not always responded with one voice. But the Commission under your command has firmly held its course in the direction of an ever greater and more unified Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, no one can deny that you have achieved historic goals, which are certain to change for ever the conception of Europe and its role on the international stage. Thanks to your actions, the Commission has regained impetus, respectability and authority.</p>
<p class="contents">The unification of Europe that has been achieved through the accession of ten new countries, the greatest enlargement ever seen in history, has healed the scars of fifty years of divisions and has been the political response to the end of the Cold War.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of the euro and its performance on the international markets has increased Europe’s economic stature worldwide and today these are fundamental ingredients for the strengthening of our continent in an era of economic interdependence and globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The neighbourhood policy has made it possible to stabilise the Balkans and Europe’s borders. Finally, the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe is an historic step and for us represents a new starting point on the route towards the goal of political integration.</p>
<p class="contents">These objectives would not have been achieved without your leadership, your moral integrity and your dedication to the cause of the European Union. Our group therefore thanks you for the vision and courage you have displayed over the last five years, laying the foundations for a Europe which is more united within and a leading player on the world stage.

Thanks to you, Mr Prodi, today we can say that the political union of Europe is closer, and for this very reason I do not believe it is worthwhile repeating the goals that have been achieved in the political and institutional spheres. On the other hand, it is worth noting what we still lack in order to have peace as an objective and as a tool with which to resolve political conflicts throughout the world and to achieve true multipolarism as rapidly as possible, with a view to combating the clash between civilisations that is the fruit of preventive war and of terrorism.</p>

One of your key aims was successful enlargement of the European Union. In May this year the EU welcomed ten new Member States in the largest expansion since its creation. This was a historic moment in the post-Cold War history of our continent and it is only right to acknowledge your role in attaining this political milestone. I also wish to say that the Commission has developed some, at least, of the more liberal economic strategies that your successor has now pledged to advance. The Lisbon Strategy was embarked upon under your watch but, sadly, too little progress has been made and Mr Wim Kok’s report to the Council in November will probably reveal this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the positive remarks about the Commission end there. For the past five years the Commission has become fatally addicted to constitutional change. When you spoke to Parliament in 2000, setting out your priorities as President, you said: ‘Europe’s citizens are disenchanted and anxious. They have lost faith in the European institutions’. I am afraid that the intervening period has brought us the Constitutional Convention, the IGC and what may eventually be an EU Constitution. It is clear from the turnout in this year’s European elections that this process has failed to inspire. Indeed, it has reinforced the perception across Europe that institutions like the Commission are too self-serving.</p>
<p class="contents">In that 2000 speech you also said that a simple benchmark of whether the EU had delivered would be a higher turnout in the 2004 European Parliamentary elections. One of the key reasons for your goal not being reached has been this obsession with constitutional change, which means very little to our constituents. At the same time – and it saddens me to say this, particularly as Vice-President Kinnock is sitting alongside you in the Chamber – too little progress has been made on the reform of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret to say that all this was inevitable, because over the past 12 months the Commission has been rudderless. I make no apology for saying that this is in large measure due to your decision to spend a significant amount of your time attacking Mr Berlusconi, the Italian Prime Minister, and constructing alliances to challenge him. These activities have undermined the impartiality of the office of the President of the Commission and have ensured that the Commission has come to be seen as something of a lame duck. All presidents are entitled to their political opinions, but I regret to say that your political interventions have been …</p>

This Parliament was then in a rather paradoxical situation. The problem was that it had for too long been too indulgent towards the institution to which it was closest, namely your own. Because it had been too indulgent, Parliament had suddenly had to bang its fist on the table and almost censure your predecessor. You arrived filled with a spirit of distrust of our institution because, ever since we had ceased to be indulgent and had banged our fists on the table, the Commission saw us as a threat and seemed to tremble whenever our institution took the slightest initiative. For your part, the governing idea of your legislature was that you would be the government of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, it seems to me that matters have righted themselves. You have renewed the closeness that existed between our two institutions, and you have not become the government of Europe, with or without the Draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, which our nations are now asked to consider. You have presided over a college. I should like to salute the track records of a number of its members and, as you will not be surprised to hear, particularly of Mr Vitorino, Mr Lamy, Mr Verheugen, Mr Almunia and his predecessor, and Mr Busquin. I believe that it is thanks to the energy of these Commissioners, and of a number of others, that the college over which you have presided has been able to achieve its, and your, present track record.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, I wish to commend one particular feature of your term of office: almost paradoxically, a sometimes too visionary form of perhaps unwarranted intelligence. I refer to three of your experiments. The first is the occasion on which you appointed a group of ‘wise men’ around Mr Dehaene who, intelligently enough, had proposed that our documents be divided into two parts and that our common policies be revised to reflect the majority opinion. There were also the Sapir and Penelope reports.</p>

<p class="contents">I have to be equally honest and say that other objectives which fall within the Commission’s remit have been disregarded. First, the Lisbon tasks have been trivialised, and the spring reports have often disappointed us; secondly, in industrial policy there has been a lack of activity in making proposals and planning; thirdly, with regard to legislative activity, the annual programmes have never topped 50%; fourthly, with regard to the reform of the Commission, there has been too much parachuting in from above to fill appointments. To sum up, over these last five years there have been many shadows which have dimmed the good work done by so many Commissioners, starting with Mrs Loyola de Palacio.</p>
<p class="contents">For all that, Mr Prodi, your term of office had begun with the best possible omens. Parliament had given you its almost unanimous approval. Even we, your political opponents in Italy, had given you our vote of confidence for the sake of the greater interests of the European Union and of our country. We wanted to show you that national polemics is one thing, but that the leadership of the European institutions is quite another. Because of our great sense of responsibility, we have never withdrawn our support from you in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">You, on the other hand, have preferred to use your prestigious post in order to carry out political activities in Italy directed against the government and to take on the leadership of the opposition. We have been deeply saddened by this. We would have preferred to see you adopt an attitude like that of Jacques Delors, who forsook the leadership of the commune of Clichy before taking on the presidency of the Commission. That was an overt way of making it clear that leading the Commission cannot be combined with participating in national politics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a huge legislative package which has raised our status once again, for example, as a legislator on the world stage, and in putting us in a position to compete once more with the United States. Monopolies and duopolies have been dissolved to the benefit of consumers and users, which is important. This has been a great achievement. We have achieved just as much with regard to energy issues as well. We are now acquiring and constructing Trans-European energy networks. All of us understand how important this is for a reliable and consumer-friendly system.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be taking better care of those people who, as the barriers come down, remain on the wrong side of our internal borders. It is a fact that intellectual and social barriers are becoming ever more rigid.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement is an important matter, and we are now reaping its benefits: equality and justice. It should make these qualities visible outside Europe as well. For this reason I would say that sexual discrimination on the part of the Commission, for example, is an intolerable idea, and this Parliament will not be able to co-exist with a Commission that acts in such a way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that during the term in office of this particular Commission the largest EU enlargement was carried out successfully and my homeland, Lithuania, became a fully-fledged member of the European Union. It is most likely that in the near future the name of Romano Prodi will be in the textbooks of Lithuanian children.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would like to make a few comments about one of the Commission’s responsibilities: external relations, and especially the European neighbourhood policy, mentioned by Mr Prodi today. This policy, which is of the greatest importance, seeks not just to extend the borders of the EU, but also to extend the area of peace and stability in Europe. It is a fact that sometimes our neighbours are countries with a highly developed bureaucracy and controlled democracy. Sometimes these are countries where human rights are undermined and violated every day, for example Belarus. The European Parliament resolution on EU-Russia policy states that this policy is far from adequate: objectives are not clearly defined, there is a lack of internal coherence, interests and values are not effectively promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">If one looks at the figures on financial assistance for strengthening democracy in Belarus and guaranteeing civil and human rights, comparing the United States of America and the EU one might question whether Belarus is on the eastern border of the United States or the EU. I would add Moldova to this list, given that so far there is no EU permanent representation in that country. Only six EU Member States have embassies there, in comparison to the presence of EU representatives in many countries that are quite a distance from the EU and are not very important players at all.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to finish by saying that I sincerely hope that the Lisbon Strategy, with all the high expectations placed in it, will not become an unfinished European project, as have some promising strategies in the past. I wish the Members of the Commission well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This enlargement brought into the EU countries which were once divided from it by the Iron Curtain. Yet although the enlargement itself was a success for the Prodi Commission, it is hard to view the conditions upon which it was carried out as such. The Commission imposed tough and unfair negotiating conditions on the candidate countries, and the process of achieving full membership rights and levelling out development differences will be a long one. The firmly established division into an old EU and a new EU will cause problems for us all, and it is a pity that this historic opportunity was not exploited fully. There was a lack of political imagination, and of a vision of a Europe fully committed to solidarity. As a Polish MEP, I am concerned by the tenor of certain changes in agricultural policy. Liberalisation and a departure from the previous protection of the EU agricultural market are a blow to European agriculture, and most of all to farmers in the new Member States. Polish farmers must face up to competition which is doubly unfair. They have to compete on unfair terms both within the EU, as Poland receives significantly lower subsidies, and globally, as the EU is opening up to the global market on a massive scale. Measures to fight global poverty must not be implemented at the cost of perpetuating or intensifying poverty within the EU. The sugar market reforms proposed by the Commission will result in the bankruptcy of a large part of the European sugar industry, and could lead to utter disaster for farmers and producers in Poland. As Polish members of the People’s Party, we want nothing to do with such reforms and such a policy. On the other hand, we very much welcome the Commission’s refusal to give in to pressure to reduce the EU budget. Such a reduction could rob enlargement of its economic sense, and eventually of its political sense also. I would like to congratulate Mr Prodi on having accomplished his mission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that, I think that the Commission and the Member States deserve both thanks and congratulations.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it is a new Europe that is faced with new challenges, and it also has to be said that the present Commission has not been equally successful at dealing with many of those challenges, specifically when it comes to being able to rise above the temptations of national party politics. If this cannot be done, there will be insufficient impetus for pressing ahead with the European project of unification.</p>
<p class="contents">We are concerned here with the ability to drive the Lisbon process forward. We now face the challenge of ensuring that enlargement is successful in a real, and not just a formal, sense. This demands a Lisbon process ensuring that all parts of the EU can become progressively more competitive and that the new Member States are given the opportunity to grow on their own terms, and not on someone else’s.</p>
<p class="contents">It also makes demands of our ability to operate in an international context. The European Union must have a credible policy for the Middle East, and that is why it is important for the EU to have the strength and ability to identify those threats to peace that exist.</p>
<p class="contents">The big threat to peace in the Middle East lies not with the small democracy there but with the big dictatorships. It lies, in particular, with a country that openly supports terrorism, that has the open aim of destroying another country and that constantly shows the extent to which it is equipped with nuclear and medium-range weapons. I believe that the European Union must also develop a policy for the Middle East that dares to get to grips with the problems that Iran now presents.</p>

The presidency of Mr Santer saw the evolution of the process of bringing the candidate states into the greatest enlargement of the European Union in its history.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, under your presidency, after exacting negotiations and accommodations, the ten new Member States have become fully fledged members of the European Union with the expectation that this foundation will result in a truly united Europe, built not just by professional Europeans, but by its citizens, both men and women. As I have, on various occasions and in different functions, had the opportunity to participate in this process on the Slovenian side, I am aware of just how much will, coordination, and mutual attention this project has demanded.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am pleased that the Commission has followed the vision and the priorities that you set out from the very beginning of your presidency, and I am also pleased that your efforts have left a powerful impression on this unique period in the development of the European Union and on European history. Please allow me, as leader of the Slovene delegation in the PPE-DE, to express my sincere gratitude for your contribution and particularly for the attention that you have shown towards Slovenia. I would also like to thank you for emphasising, with your presence on 1 May 2004 at the celebration marking the enlargement of Europe on the Slovene-Italian border, the south-western edge of the former Iron Curtain, that the era of totalitarianism and a divided Europe was over.</p>

I have noted and digested what you have all said on industrial development, on the need for an economic upturn in Europe and on the fact that the rules which apply to industry ought not to act as a brake on this development. The same applies to the suggestions concerning energy, the environment and the progress to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, I would like to conclude simply with a remark and with my thanks. The remark is this: all your speeches – even those that contained criticisms or particular points of view – at bottom were conscious of the fact that the European model has a special character and that we have given the world a lesson in how to achieve progress using a method which is not only the traditional one of power politics, and to do so without being under any illusions, without believing that we are something we are not and without believing that the world is other than it is.</p>
<p class="contents">The priority that we give to multilateralism, our way of seeing the world as a single whole, for the first time ever in so many different realms – that of the environment, the economy, energy – and therefore trying to find working methods that are suited to this view: this is the extraordinary contribution that Europe is striving to give to the globalised world.</p>
<p class="contents">I have quite rightly heard criticism with regard to globalisation: but globalisation exists and is increasing. The problem is to interpret it, and only the European method has done this so far. Why? Because we have given an example through the way in which we are uniting together and now, at the end of my mandate, I would like to repeat the true, unique, great definition of Europe, which I learnt when I went to the Romanian parliament for the first talks in the negotiations. On that occasion I was told: ‘We want to join Europe because Europe is a union of minorities; it is a union in which no one is the arbiter of the others, no one has power over the others’. We are, truly, small and large countries gathered in this great, difficult balancing act, and this is a lesson for the world, a great lesson that we are giving.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are obviously also failures, individual aspects, the difficulties inherent in translating these aspirations and feelings into everyday policy. It is an effort, however, that is being increasingly understood. In recent weeks I went to the countries of the Caucasus and saw the national flag flying next to the European flag, for no reason at all, if not for that feeling of being safe next to a great structure that has no colonial desires, no desires for domination or desires for supremacy: this is the lesson that we can give to the world.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what we have tried to do in the Commission, within limits and with shortcomings, naturally, but with an enormous sense of harmony. In this Commission you have never perceived disputes or tensions; we have never acted spitefully towards each other. Perhaps we too have been influenced by that European spirit of being a union of minorities in the Commission itself, and thus absorbing this lesson which, in my opinion, is the greatest legacy that we can give to all the world’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end with thanks for your cooperation, for your comprehension, and also for having tolerated some excesses and some choices with which you have not agreed, but whose spirit you have perhaps understood: in truth, if we do not have a strong and politically robust Parliament and a strong and politically robust Commission in the future, it will be difficult for us to achieve our objectives, objectives which – as I can see – we truly all share. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
