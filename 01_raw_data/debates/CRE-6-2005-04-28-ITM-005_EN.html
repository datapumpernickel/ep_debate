Groundwater is an important resource, which is used for drinking water, and by industry and agriculture. It also has an important environmental value, given that it interacts with surface water and wetlands and, as such, forms an important part of the water cycle, which needs protection. The protection of groundwater from pollution has been the subject of Community legislation since as far back as 1980; most recently, in the Water Framework Directive passed in 2000. Nonetheless, there are still some gaps. There are no clear criteria for defining targets for the environmental quality of groundwater; more importantly, there are no good chemical status targets. In addition, special measures are needed to prevent and control the pollution of groundwater. This was acknowledged when the Water Framework Directive was approved, article 17 of which calls on the Commission to submit proposals to address the relevant requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this framework, and following extensive consultations with the interested parties, the Commission submitted the proposal being debated today, which includes the main following elements:</p>
<p class="contents">- a compliance procedure for assessing good groundwater chemical status, in order to limit the number of pollutants, where Community standards already apply;</p>
<p class="contents">- criteria for assessing the chemical status of groundwater on the basis of environmental quality standards, which need to be adopted by the Member States at the appropriate national, regional or local level, depending on variations in natural groundwater conditions, the pressures identified and the chemical substances connected with pollution;</p>
<p class="contents">- criteria for determining deterioration in the quality of groundwater and for reversing pollution trends and</p>
<p class="contents">- measures to prevent or limit the direct and, more importantly, the indirect discharge of dangerous substances into the groundwater.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal contains clear specifications which will ensure that the environmental targets of the Water Framework Directive are met in respect of groundwater. Similarly, the proposal strikes a satisfactory balance between issues which need to be addressed at Community level and issues which should preferably be left in the hands of the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Groundwater is, though, not just a vital resource for the extraction of our drinking water; it is also essential to agriculture, industry and our eco-system. However hard we try to keep our water – and our groundwater in particular – clean, and to restore its purity where it is already polluted, we must, not least at European level, strike a sensible balance between the requirements of the water industry, the needs of agriculture, the eco-systems and the resources available for maintaining and restoring the purity of water in the Member States. As the re-purification of polluted groundwater is very difficult, very time-consuming and, in particular, very costly, prevention and the protection of the groundwater eco-system are particularly important.</p>
<p class="contents">On the European continent, at any rate, groundwater bodies, like rivers, know no borders. It is for that reason, and also because differing requirements in the Member States inevitably lead to distortions of competition for industry and agriculture, that the protection of groundwater is a task for Europe. Fortunately, though, we are not starting from nothing. This proposal from the Commission is derived from the Water Framework Directive, which has been in force since the year 2000, and was meant to be transposed in all the Member States from the end of December 2003. The primary task imposed on the Member States by the Water Framework Directive was the inventarisation of all waters by 22 March 2005. If all the Member States have met that deadline – and perhaps Commissioner Dimas can tell us whether or not they have – then every one of them ought, by now at the latest, to know in what condition its waters and groundwater are.</p>
<p class="contents">The Water Framework Directive lays down quality and quantity targets for all Community waters, including groundwater, and specifies the means whereby they are to be achieved. This daughter directive is intended to deal with two points that remain outstanding, firstly the criteria by reference to which groundwater is to be categorised as ‘good’ or ‘poor’ and, secondly, the point in time at which action must be taken if deterioration is established. We must also determine whether there is a need to enact rules on the indirect introduction of pollutants from point sources and diffuse sources.</p>
<p class="contents">We must consider in their context all the relevant directives: the Water Framework Directive, the Priority Substances Directive, the Nitrates Directive and the Plant Protection Products Directive. The costs incurred in administering and implementing them, and in monitoring their implementation, must be tolerable, without making it less likely that groundwater will be maintained in a good chemical status in all 25 EU Member States, for that is our objective.</p>
<p class="contents">We would, though, risk missing this target if we were to adopt the so-called compromise amendment 94 to Article 6, which has been tabled jointly by the PSE, the Liberals, the Greens and the GUE/NGL Group, and which would alter the fundamental direction not only of my report, but also of the Commission proposal and of the Water Framework Directive. It seeks to overburden the Member States by drawing up new lists of what it describes as hazardous substances and by imposing tasks to be regulated by the chemicals policy now in REACH. It proposes a new category of groundwater bodies mandated with the certification of safety zones with the chemical status of ‘very good’, and calls for an array of new examination, reporting and supervision requirements, the additional costs of which would be borne by the Member States and by municipalities. The amendment is also couched in very vague and repetitious terms. It goes as far as to do away with all the derogations from Article 6(2) that water experts regard as necessary and that are also contained in the 1980 Groundwater Directive. We must not accept this amendment; the laboriously-achieved compromise in the Water Framework Directive must not be altered by a daughter directive on groundwater.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two other amendments proposing uniform European standards on the quality of groundwater for important indicators and pollutants. I think it very important, if we are to avoid distortions of competition and have a comparable standard of groundwater protection throughout our Member States, that we in this House should call for uniform European categories of this kind for the evaluation of groundwater as ‘good’ or ‘poor’, and so, with this in mind, I ask you to support Amendments 111 and 112.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to draw a clear distinction between pollutants and indicators. I have tried to separate them completely, for sulphate, chloride and aluminium are not in fact pollutants, but rather important indicators of the chemical status of the groundwater and of the possible presence of certain impurities and pollutants. It is ultimately impossible to constantly monitor every conceivable pollutant, for there are hundreds or even thousands of them. Let me conclude by asking the House to support Amendments 89 and 90, which divide the list into indicators and pollutants. I ask you all to ensure today that our waters will, in future, be well protected by a Europe that acts together.</p>

However, groundwater is one of our most important resources. Its protection should be taken seriously: indeed, wars are being increasingly fought over water resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this proposal for a directive to protect groundwater should come into force despite its shortcomings. As has been mentioned, it will complement the Water Framework Directive. This will be a difficult issue throughout the Union. In my country, Finland, there are thousands of small groundwater areas, none of which will be sources of contamination in the near future, but which now need to be investigated. We nevertheless agree with this law, even if it is not necessary for us. I believe that it is now our turn to reach a reciprocal agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Groundwater in Central Europe covers large areas, and these are being threatened by various chemicals. The problem with the aquifers on the Iberian Peninsula is often to do with seawater. We on the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy managed to draw up a statement in a congenial atmosphere, for which I thank my colleagues. Unfortunately, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the committee responsible for this issue, did not agree to support compromise proposal 94 as the other groups did.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is needed. The first reading is only an intermediate stage, as the Council’s joint position is very different. It is worth making a combined effort to ensure that groundwater is properly protected. It affects our quality of life, it affects agriculture, and it affects human happiness and health.</p>

<p class="contents">As far as the Committee on Agriculture is concerned, two points stood out in particular, and it will not surprise you to learn that the essential one, to which previous speakers have already referred, was that the Committee on Agriculture is also, of course, in favour of clean water. Since something has to be done about this, we can, in principle, support the proposals in this groundwater directive. We consider it vital, though, that different measuring methods be introduced in Europe which reflect climatic and soil type differences. The situation on clay soil is different from that on peat, or sandy soil, and one soil type can also differ from Finland down to the heel of Italy. This will need to be taken into consideration when we measure the 50 mg.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Committee on Agriculture wanted to take existing legislation into account. With regard to nitrate, it looks like two directives will be in place soon: the existing nitrates directive alongside the groundwater directive. If, for example, a farmer somewhere in Europe complies with the groundwater directive and is, with 30 mg, for example, below the 50 mg threshold, he will still be bound by the nitrates directive, and it is possible that a farmer with three cows per hectare will fail to comply with the provisions of the nitrates directive but will be complying with those of the groundwater directive, because if we measure the nitrate level, we are below 50 mg. It is then illogical to my mind that we have to ask that farmer to reduce the number of cattle units per hectare. It is one or the other. That is why the Committee on Agriculture has proposed to assess the need for the nitrates directive in 2008. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety rejected two amendments in this connection; the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has subsequently re-submitted them, and I would now like to warmly recommend them to you.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly – and in this last minute, I am speaking on behalf of the ALDE Group – I go along with the idea that clean water should be available, but what we should take into consideration is the cost involved. What are the socio-economic consequences if we introduce certain legislation? This is also the subject of a number of amendments tabled by the ALDE Group, which, needless to say, I should like to see adopted. It strikes me as being absolutely logical that the introduction of directives is not at the expense of everything else. We must have a timeframe in which things are kept realistic and affordable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, from the outset, we found ourselves, at least in certain sectors within my group and certain countries, in a particularly uncomfortable situation, because the directive did not fulfil all the objectives we had hoped for.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, it did not deal with one fundamental issue relating to the control of aquifers — quantity — and focussed solely on quality, although, in reality, the water directive, in its respective annexes, talked about controlling quantities — volumes of water — and controlling quality at the same time. The failure to link quality and quantity in a government measure, a management measure, is something we cannot understand.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, there is no insistence on the need for control either on the part of the Member States or on the part of river basins, which is what the water Directive lays down for the management of water; it does not provide for control by means of river basins but rather by means of countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the artificial refilling of aquifers is not considered either, despite the fact that this is an essential phenomenon.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must point out that we believe that many of Parliament’s amendments make the situation worse, because they are intended to standardise all aquifers and all controls of substances, although we are well aware that European geology is very diverse and that the concept of Europe's geological diversity must be a fundamental consideration of this policy, because sustainable development must be appropriate for each location.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we believe that some of the amendments would be impossible to implement, such as Amendment 94, because a State cannot guarantee what enters its aquifers, since in many cases they are shared. If Amendment 94 is approved, therefore, we are going to vote against the directive because it would be incomplete and would not provide for control of quantities of water. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must therefore take the view that, given that the possibility of purifying an aquifer is very limited, control and prevention are absolutely essential in order to ensure that polluting substances do not build up in groundwater. We must not forget that groundwater is the European Union's most sensitive and important water resource and, in particular, it is the main source of public drinking water supply.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, and given that the measures to prevent or restrict the introduction of pollutants into groundwater are a vital element of the proposed directive, it is very important, despite what the previous speaker said, that we approve the compromise amendment on Article 6, which we have presented jointly with other Members, in order to ensure that Member States control indirect dumping on the basis of best environmental practices and techniques that are sufficient to prevent such dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would like to point out that, in its proposed annex of polluting substances, the Commission has not taken sufficient account of the fact that, due to the geological nature of the existing sub-soils, there are certain substances, such as chlorides and sulphates, that occur naturally in many of the European Union's aquifers, and that, from a scientific point of view, it is arguable whether these salts should even be classified as pollutants.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that the proposal presented to us is not very ambitious, since it is limited to the minimum requirements of the framework directive, but, despite that, I am confident that the work of all of us will lead to a better directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We then should allow Member States to establish threshold values for a range of other substances. In the longer term, in the light of experience and information as a result of implementing the framework Water Directive, we may then be in a much better position to translate threshold values at national level into EU-wide groundwater quality standards.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion this is a more reasonable and pragmatic way forward, but critically it is workable and achievable. And when do we amend legislation in this Parliament? It is essential that it is workable across 25 countries and it is essential that the subsidiarity principle is enshrined in our legislation so that we can achieve high standards that work at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to agree with the opinion put forward by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which suggests that the Commission should analyse whether the Nitrates Directive can be repealed from 2008. I agree with this in the context of what I have just said. Legislation should be adequate and workable, but most importantly it should achieve its stated objectives. The Nitrates Directive is certainly not doing this with 12 of the 15 Member States being taken to court over wrong or inadequate implementation. But the essential points are that it does not take soil or climatic conditions into consideration and, most critically, that the goal of the Nitrates Directive should be defined at Community level but not the mechanism to achieve that goal.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday evening I went to see the exhibition hosted by the Joint Research Centre. One of the exhibits informed me that there are 28 different soil groups all over Europe and six of these soil groups are present in Ireland. How can a one-size-fits-all directive, like the Nitrates Directive, work efficiently in these circumstances? Moreover, it is not just soil that matters; it makes an important difference whether the area is grassland or ploughed land.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the issue of climate, all I can say is that in Ireland we do not have a climate, we have weather. And if Irish farmers were to follow the letter of the directive and spread slurry when allowed, they would cause pollution rather than prevent it. We all want clean water but the legislation we put in place must be adequate to achieve it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the question we could ask today is whether the objectives of the Water Framework Directive and the objectives of preventing and controlling groundwater pollution will be achieved by the proposals contained in the report. The protection of groundwater is indeed a crucial issue, since it relates not only to our own water resources today, but also to those of future generations, and to the aquatic ecosystem as a whole. We know how complicated the study of groundwater is, and we also know that, once a body of water is polluted, it remains so for years.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, these resources are threatened by a wide variety of forms of pollution. Some aquifers have already seriously deteriorated due to the effects of intensive farming, with massive use of pesticides, herbicides and fertilisers, including nitrates. The precautionary principle requires us to give a higher priority to the prevention of pollution than to the remediation or cleaning of groundwater, even supposing we could seriously contemplate easily cleaning an aquifer.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to prevent groundwater pollution, our most urgent priority must be to eliminate sources of pollution. However, certain amendments lead us to fear that, no doubt for reasons to do with sectoral interests, the urgent need to take a more radical approach to the prevention of pollution has not been grasped. Specifically, certain indirect discharges have been excluded: fertilisers and plant treatment products used in accordance with good agricultural practice. In fact, this comes down to official acceptance of agricultural pollution, which is unacceptable, particularly as we know that the main culprit in groundwater pollution is, of course, agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">The position proposed in Amendment 45 must be rejected out of hand if we want to achieve results with regard to protecting our water resources. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, already disappointed that the Commission’s initial draft did not go far enough to actually protect the quality of groundwater, is worried that this report is further weakening even the Commission’s position. If some of these amendments were adopted, this draft would amount to a licence to pollute and would, of course, in the end make European consumers pay the price of drinking water that would have been polluted practically legally.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, Article 6 and the compromise put forward by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and ourselves are the most important, because they require a clear prevention policy that bans the most dangerous chemicals and strictly limits other pollutants. That is why we call on Parliament to support this compromise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In our opinion, we need clear criteria for examining the qualitative status of water and a common European denominator, so that these criteria are comparable. We therefore support the need for the gradual elaboration of a common European policy for protecting groundwater, which will, however, also take account of the specific characteristics of each area. We attach exceptional importance to the compromise amendment which we have signed together with other political groups on Article 6, in which we state our wish for intensive protection. The scope of Article 6 must not be confined merely to indirect discharges to groundwater. We also support the need for a list to be created by the Member States, which will include the pollutants which are of specific concern in a river basin district. As there is no European definition of the best practice for farming, we call on the Member States to take additional measures to prevent pollution in this sector. At the same time, farmers need to be supported in their effort to achieve a cleaner environment through rural development programmes, so that the objectives both of the Water Framework Directive and the Groundwater Directive can be achieved. We also propose that the Member States list and conduct a midterm assessment of measures taken to prevent pollution. In this way, prevention can be strengthened and irreversible consequences avoided. The emphasis on prevention, the strict protection of groundwater and measures to prevent its deterioration are both necessary and an investment for future generations. That is why I totally fail to understand those who say that they have no money to invest in the future, in the environment or in our children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In all honesty, I find it a bit strange that Mrs Klaß did exactly that. Her point is that the amendments adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety leave too much room for Member States’ own policy. I can only stress at this point that I consider the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to have done the right thing in adopting these amendments; after all, groundwater is mainly a national issue. When the framework directive on water was discussed, it was acknowledged that groundwater should be treated separately. Not least because of the subsidiarity principle, there can be no legal basis for this daughter directive other than Article 175(1). Groundwater is an endangered natural resource; we do well to give it our attention by exchanging best practice and encouraging better protection, but this is not the place for rigid Europe-wide standards. We already know that it is extremely difficult to measure the content of a substance in groundwater objectively for a region, never mind a Member State. For example, the concentration level of chloride can vary between 20 mg/l and more than 10 000 mg/l within a 10 km radius. Finally, I should like to briefly draw the Members’ attention to the issue surrounding the ban on dumping. Amendment 43 is crucial in this respect. Due to the way in which drinking water is extracted in some of the Member States, namely via infiltration of surface water, it is extremely important not to introduce an absolute dumping ban. I would therefore ask you to vote against Amendment 43, while Amendment 103 of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is acceptable. I eagerly await the outcome of the forthcoming vote, although I cannot guarantee that I will be very pleased with it. That will depend on which amendments this House adopts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Illegal discharges, which unfortunately take place in various regions of the Union, both in the new accession countries and in the older Member States, like Italy, cause severe and uncontrolled groundwater pollution. Introducing threshold values for pollutants at the discretion of the Member States is a serious step backwards as regards the protection of the environment. Maintaining a gradual approach on this issue, as the Commission plans, does not in this case mean respecting the rights of individual countries, which is something that we would welcome in many other cases, but will result in harm to the environment and to consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">By looking at the labels on bottles of mineral water, consumers can perhaps judge whether or not to buy the product, but they cannot do the same for vegetables and cereals. I therefore hope that, in the course of the legislative process, we succeed in amending the directive and establishing identical threshold values for pollutants for all the Member States, so as to guarantee the same levels of toxicity for human beings and the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to echo the words of thanks to our rapporteur, Mrs Klass, because although I know that she was of a different opinion on certain things, she had a constructive input and was prepared to help support positions that Members from other Member States saw as important.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is important, because it is about achieving an ecological balance. Moreover, groundwater is important for agriculture, industry and for drinking water. In the framework directive, we have opted for a basin-led approach, which has a bearing on the assessment of the groundwater directive. It means that it is impossible to apply uniform standards to certain substances, but that uniform measuring methods, and such like, must be established.</p>
<p class="contents">On a different note, I have tabled Amendment 110 in relation to indirect discharges, with which Article 6 of this directive concerns itself. You may well ask what my intention was in doing so. I am from a province which has to contend with floods on a regular basis. As we are in the process of clearing space for rivers, we will have them widened and use some of the sediment in order to raise their banks. If we adopt this framework directive on water, and certainly compromise amendment 94, which has been tabled by the Group of the Greens, that means that everything that is dug out of these rivers would have to be left beside the rivers for the sake of safety of the province and the Netherlands, and that it would have to be wrapped in foil. The cost involved for the small region I come from is EUR 100 million. Since that cannot be the intention, I am urging you to vote in favour of Amendment 110 and reject Amendments 43 and 94. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is our duty to prevent natural resources from being polluted and exhausted, and, as groundwater accounts for 60% of drinking water in the Netherlands, this is sufficient reason to do all we can to prevent pollution. We must prescribe strict standards for the quality of our groundwater, but how strict should the threshold values be? Should we impose them at European level or should we leave this up to the Member States? There is quite a bit of concern in the Netherlands about European regulations, which often have repercussions for farmers, builders and companies. The quality of air, manure and the protection of the environment are all areas covered by directives with major consequences and difficult to explain to somebody who can see their building project grind to a complete halt because of abstract European rules. ‘This is yet another example of Brussels interfering’. The Dutch Labour Party is clear in its own mind: we do not want common threshold values for our groundwater. Major differences, brought about by natural circumstances, in the chemical composition of groundwater in the Member States make harmonised threshold values undesirable. Threshold values that are too strict can lead to human activities being banned in certain areas. The Dutch Labour Party does not say that the Netherlands should be behind lock and key, nor is there any political backing for rules that are all too obtrusive without there being any need for them. That is why we are opposed to Amendments 111 and 112. Rest assured, though, the Dutch Labour Part is as green as ever. What we are in favour of, though, is an emphatic common conduct standard intended to prevent or limit the contribution of polluted substances in groundwater. That means that each incidence of groundwater being polluted with a number of well-defined substances is inadmissible. We also want the ‘polluter pays’ principle to be taken seriously. My amendment to translate the costs of pollution by herbicides into a levy has received broad support, which I welcome, because many town councils consider manual weeding too expensive. To date, the cost of pollution has not been included in chemical control. If that were the case, the use of harmful substances would drop. Finally, I should like to mention a few amendments related to nitrates and the manure issue. It is beyond me that precisely at a time when various Member States put a lot of work into the nitrates directive, a message is being sent that this directive might be superfluous. That is why we do not back those amendments, although we will be happy to support Amendment 110 tabled by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Groundwater pollution affects rivers, lakes and valuable ecosystems, increases the cost of drinking water and threatens its secure supply. The Commission proposal on the protection of groundwater needs to be improved, especially as cleaning up groundwater may take decades. As far as prevention is concerned, our objective is to protect groundwater with preventive measures, not to try and simply improve the status of polluted water. We need a proposal which protects from pollution with defined criteria and limits, while the Member States need to be forced to submit periodic reports on the status of their water and the effective measures which they have taken. Amendment 94, which proposes preventing and limiting substances that are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic and introduces a procedure for controls by the Member States, is a positive effort to improve the report. According to the European Environment Agency, 87% of European groundwater does not meet the criteria for nitrates, while 10 out of 11 countries report a risk of water pollution from pesticides. We need strict criteria for nitrates and pesticides and I therefore call on you to vote in favour of Amendments 101 and 102. Another point is the ecosystems in groundwater. The microscopic flora and fauna help to improve the quality of groundwater and the quality of drinking water. Amendments 96 and 98 introduce groundwater protection zones, while Amendments 95 and 100 call for more research into groundwater ecosystems, which is why I call on you to vote for them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Concerning the draft directive on protecting groundwater from pollution, it would seem that further work is called for, in particular as regards listing the pollutants that represent the main threats to the environment. It is also necessary to set threshold values for those naturally occurring substances identified as active ingredients of biocides and whose natural concentration is higher than the values proposed. Account should also be taken of the fact that these substances impact on the physiological activity of live organisms. Monitoring and research are therefore needed to establish their impact on human beings. I also feel it must be made very clear that in the interests of protecting groundwater, preventive and educational measures should be taken to make the population aware of the facts relating to water pollution, and to provide information on methods of protection and their implementation. Water should not only be protected through payments for its use, but also through penalties for wasting and polluting it. Furthermore, implementing measures such as legal rules and regulations need to be practical and workable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why, therefore, is it necessary for this groundwater directive also to deal with nitrates? It is wholly unsatisfactory to have two directives addressing the same issue with different approaches and mechanisms and, for the hapless farming community, dual enforcement. Either the Nitrates Directive should be repealed or compliance with one should remove the other from the equation. The combined effects of this directive and the Water Framework Directive will make the Nitrates Directive wholly superfluous. Under this directive there is a requirement to put in place trend reversal measures once pollution levels reach 75 per cent of the decreed quality standard. This is more demanding than the standards required under the Nitrates Directive in the nitrate-vulnerable zones. Again, we have conflict, contradiction and dual standards. We need cogent, slimmed-down regulation, not costly duplication. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would be very interesting for all of us to have the opinion of the Commission specifically on those.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to focus quickly on 111 and 112, the two amendments which the rapporteur appeared to endorse in her opening speech, which deal with the application of the universal standards through the groundwater directive. As she knows, this idea was rejected in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, in favour of the framework approach of the Commission on the basis of river-basin management. Are those of us who oppose universal standards correct in saying that river-basin management or local management of the groundwater directive would mean that you do not need universal standards? Many speakers have commented on how important it is to recognise that it would be crazy to try to implement universal standards. Forty per cent of European groundwater is already well over the standard set in the Florenz amendments. I am sorry that as rapporteur Mrs Klaß used her time as speaker to endorse amendments that she knew the committee had rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">Just a quick second point. The origin of the groundwater directive is really the impact of landfill sites on groundwater quality. Can the Commissioner reassure us that the Commission really is following up the landfill directive? We are told that there are still thousands of illegal landfills in France, Italy and other countries. If this is the case it makes nonsense of our trying to get better standards for groundwater when the origin of the trouble is still in place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe she has done a very constructive job of work, and the issue with which she is dealing is one for which it is not only necessary to get a majority in this House, as the dividing lines really do run between the various groups. I believe it to be important that these uniform standards, as proposed in various amendments, should apply to the most important pollutants right across Europe in order to avoid not only distortions of competition, but also environmental dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 6 of the Groundwater Directive contains additional provisions on the protection of groundwater bodies, for the Water Framework Directive has nothing to say about how the indirect introduction of pollutants is to be addressed. In that respect – and as regards the way in which it enables us to send out a very penetrating and clear signal about the protection of the environment – I regard Article 6 as very important, and I also hope that this House will reject any attempts at watering it down. Amendment 45, which envisages a general derogation for good agricultural practice, I regard as counter-productive in terms of groundwater protection. Despite the provisions on adherence to good agricultural practice, which have been in force for years, the agricultural sector is still the most significant source of impurities in groundwater. According to the latest report by the European Environmental Agency, every groundwater body in the EU exceeds the threshold values for nitrates, and these make up 87% of the groundwater in agricultural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Although some Members – it appears to me to be a large number of them – have come to the conclusion that the Nitrates Directive is superfluous, I believe that conclusion to be false; what is superfluous, in my view, is today’s debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is something it may, in some places, achieve, moreover, by means of limit values on the quantity of, for example, spray pesticides in the water. In Denmark, a decentralised system supplies us with groundwater that has not been chemically purified and that we drink directly. For us, it therefore seems wrong to allow poison in groundwater. We need to react not only when a limit value or upper limit has been reached. We must react as soon as we can measure the fact that a pesticide or its breakdown product has penetrated the root zone of the earth’s crust. Pesticides should only be approved specifically on condition that they cannot penetrate the top stratum of the earth and so reach the groundwater. When we can measure the pesticides and their breakdown products in the water, it was a mistake to have approved them, and they must immediately cease to be used. In Denmark, we have by far the most bans on the use of pesticides, but the EU now wishes to lift some of these. This shows that, despite the Constitution’s talk of a high level of protection, the most stringent protection can be removed. It also shows that the so-called environmental guarantee is, for the most part, propaganda. Groundwater is, of course, one area in which special rules in Denmark can be justified, because we drink non-purified groundwater. Not even in the light of this will it, however, be accepted that we are entitled to special consideration. How are we supposed to prove that Danes are more vulnerable than Germans to, for example, allergy-producing and carcinogenic substances. The June Movement’s amendment is designed to ensure that intervention takes place as soon as there is a measurable level of pollution. If this amendment cannot be adopted, I would call upon the Commission to declare that countries in which non-purified groundwater is drunk directly can introduce a higher level of protection.

We find clean water from the tap the most obvious thing in the world, but elsewhere thousands of children are dying every day as a result of waterborne diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">What that clearly shows is that drinking water is first among all foodstuffs, and that we must, of course, protect our groundwater throughout Europe, so that we do not end up in future turning our own tap off and sentencing future generations to a similar fate.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the quantity of water in the world remains unchanged, the quality of groundwater is impaired by pollution from agriculture, building work, landfill sites, residual contamination and increased traffic. It follows that it makes a great deal of sense to lay down uniform standards and measuring procedures for groundwater quality throughout the EU, and, inadequate though this report is in my view, it is for that reason that I, too, will be voting in favour of it.</p>
<p class="contents">As the report itself observes, impurities can become apparent as long as decades later, and so it is absolutely vital to handle these living resources with care. The increased value attached to organic agriculture as a consequence of the reform of the CAP was a step in the right direction, but if we promote such things as transport or trans-European convoys or the intensive use of insecticides in the cultivation of maize or tobacco, for example, we are also making it more likely that groundwater will be polluted. In the light of this, we should therefore take a critical and penetrating look at our support schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, as a Member from Austria, a country with large reserves of drinking water, which are vital and precious to us, careful handling of water, particularly of groundwater, throughout Europe is important. If we do not, it is inevitable that many more people will be casting covetous eyes in the direction of our water, and that is something we want to avoid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Turning to this report by Mrs Klaß, I would like to point out that farmers will probably be the sector most affected by the Directive on the protection of groundwater that we are discussing, and that, despite this, their opinion has not been taken into account when producing the draft we have on the table. In many European regions, agriculture guarantees the existence of plant mass that prevents the desertification of the land, a phenomenon that leads to a significant increase in the natural pollutants in groundwater. The drastic reduction in this agricultural activity, which some people apparently want to see, would therefore run counter to the very objectives of the Directive that we are debating today.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to express my disappointment at the lack of interest shown by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in the amendments presented by this Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, in particular those that call for ‘quantity of water’ to be taken into account when establishing the factors that contribute to the pollution of groundwater.</p>
<p class="contents">The smaller aquifers, such as those often found in many southern regions of Europe, particularly during dry seasons, reach higher salinity levels and hence greater concentrations of sulphate; I would insist that this salinity is closely related to volumes of water, and this has not been taken into account in the report we are dealing with. I also reject the establishment of Community standards to replace national thresholds with quality standards, since that would introduce a static element which is incompatible with the diversity of soils and waters in many European regions. Furthermore, the farmers will be the main victims of these measures, because the tolerance levels of certain substances, in particular sulphates, which are generated by nature itself in many areas, depend on the characteristics of soils and crops, and there are examples of crops, such as rice, which endure higher levels of sulphates than other plant species. Therefore, to establish Community standards for this type of substance, which at no point endangers the health of consumers, could lead to unjustified halts in irrigation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Schools need to be targeted, and also the main users of water, who are intent on poisoning the environment as if they themselves were immortal. It is crucially important for the Cohesion Fund to remain at the level initially proposed by the European Commission, as it is supporting the enormous task of protecting the waters of the new EU Member States. We should not skimp on building infrastructure, sewage systems and treatment plants, because this is the only way of evening out the enormous differences between the various countries. The natural environment of Central and Eastern Europe was abused by heavy industry working to meet the demand for armaments. It is vital that the Member States meet the deadline for submitting data concerning the condition of groundwater, as such an overview is essential for precise and efficient monitoring in the future. Parliament has raised the issue of the quantitative status of groundwater. The draft directive sets out to deal exclusively with the chemical condition of water, with reference to Article 17 of the Water Framework Directive, so this is not the right time to introduce provisions concerning the quantitative status of water into the draft. Amendment 7 and Amendment 10 should therefore be rejected. Amendment 54 concerns new provisions for the protection of spas and medicinal water sources. It should be supported, as to date EU legislation has not dealt with the protection of these special high-quality waters. Provision does need to be made for them, and I would ask the Commissioner and the European Commission as a whole to pay particular attention to this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The approach of the Commission is to establish groundwater quality standards at EU level for nitrates and pesticides – on which many colleagues have commented – and to allow Member States themselves to establish threshold values for a range of other substances such as arsenic and cadmium, a minimum list of which is set out in the directive. I agree with that approach, as there is no need for any further harmonisation across Europe. We must respect differences in climate and soil type.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall go one step further. Eventually that approach, which allows Member States to decide on the basis of river-basin management plans – which under the Framework Directive will eventually manage all freshwater sources once they are put in place – will also allow Member States to manage their nitrate and pesticide pollutants. We should eventually take this approach to everything.</p>
<p class="contents">The Nitrates Directive has been mentioned. Farmers also need and want clean water. Nobody can be allowed to pollute our groundwater or freshwater with nitrates or anything else. However, a one-size-fits-all policy has proved extremely difficult, as colleagues have said, with 12 out of 15 of the older Member States currently in court for non-transposition or improper transposition of the Nitrates Directive. It was never a comfortable directive. It never fitted properly, because we did not respect the differences in Member States and we did not trust Member States to monitor their own pollution in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to ask Commissioner Dimas specifically why he continues to allow the Irish Government to add a pollutant, fluoride, to our public drinking water supply. I know it is not directly an issue for the Commission, but how can we stand up here and wax eloquent about water safety and about water being essential for life – on which we all agree – if we continue to allow a Member State to pollute the public water supply with fluoride? I ask the Commissioner to do something about that urgently or all this legislation – framework directives, water directives and so on – will come to nought. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This directive is aimed at protecting one of the most important treasuries of this resource, groundwater, and although we have a common goal, our solutions differ.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my belief that norms need to be established at a Community level, as the good quality of continuous bodies of water, that reach beyond state borders, can only be guaranteed if neighbouring countries are all bound by strict provisions. Of course, when we talk of qualitative norms, the different natural characteristics of the soil and bodies of water must be taken into consideration. Naturally occurring substances in water must be examined when setting limit values; the high arsenic content of groundwater in the Southern Plains region in Hungary is a good example. The proposal for a directive continues to prohibit direct discharge of pollutants into groundwater. In the case of permitting indirect discharge, I find it crucial that the presence of other pollutants encumbering the given environment is taken into consideration. I was glad to find that my relevant proposal for amendment was welcomed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Another valuable part of the report is that it promotes the definition of protection areas for aquifers which supply medicinal water sources. In order to improve the quality of groundwater, current agricultural practice must be changed, contamination from disused waste disposal plants, for instance, must be dealt with, and action plans and resources are needed. Let us clearly define now how vital these issues are so that Member States will take this important environmental task seriously. Finally, let me congratulate Commissioner Klaß on this excellent report on the proposal for a directive, that after its adoption, will play a crucial part in the protection of groundwater after 2003. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Differences exist as to how we are going to achieve those objectives: the optimist in me says we are almost halfway there. Groundwater is a major national resource. In Ireland groundwater and aquifers provide one quarter of our drinking water. Monitoring of Irish groundwater by the Environmental Protection Agency shows that there is no widespread contamination of individual aquifers. Most samples taken by the agency reflected unpolluted conditions. This is as it should be and it is good news, but we need vigilance.</p>
<p class="contents">We need uniform measurement techniques across the EU, but we do not need common threshold values other than for nitrates and pesticides. Soil and subsoil types are important considerations in characterising the vulnerability of aquifers to contamination. These vary considerably throughout the Union. Equally, however, allowing for different threshold values in Member States to take account of these local natural conditions must not lead to unacceptable differences in the protection level or distortions in competition and trade.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have already heard, experience with the Nitrates Directive has not been good and it should guide us in how we frame the groundwater directive. The Nitrates Directive fails to take account of climate or soil conditions in Member States. It prescribes a very rigid regime of farming by dates: not exactly as nature intended. It may well do more harm than good. The debacle over nitrates does little to endear the Commission to EU citizens. A similar fate must not befall the groundwater directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Good though it was that she should be so committed from the start, the report now produced by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety appears to tend towards tightening up the Commission’s original proposal; Amendments 43, 103 and 94 to it certainly do. I wonder how Parliament intends to deal with those. Acceptance of those amendments will once again result in an increase in the burden and cost, particularly for European agriculture and horticulture – two areas that are self-evidently bound to benefit from clean water. Although the proposal, fortunately, also leaves sufficient room for subsidiarity, it cannot be denied that when the budget for European agricultural policy is reduced and the markets become more deregulated, it will drive up still more the cost price for European agriculture and horticulture. It is unacceptable that this House should on the one hand increase the burden and on the other hand deregulate the markets even further, it thereby puts the European countryside in an impossible position. I would like to urge this House in any event not to make the Commission proposal any more stringent, and certainly to vote against Amendments 43 and 94. I should also like to back Mrs Oomen-Ruijten’s Amendment 110, which would make the groundwater directive considerably more workable with regard to river policy in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of Europe’s greatest treasures flows in our innumerable springs, streams and rivers, and so it is our responsibility to protect our water resources. It is for that reason that the protection of groundwater must be among the Community’s foremost environmental priorities. We also have to bear in mind the fact that it is much harder to remove impurities from polluted groundwater than from surface waters. It is also often used to provide drinking water, and, if it is polluted, those pollutants can be a hazard to human health, which will in turn impose a burden on our healthcare systems.</p>
<p class="contents">By adopting the Water Framework Directive, we agreed that Europe’s waters should be of good chemical status by 2015. These daughter directives which we are now to adopt must lay down procedures and parameters whereby this high quality standard may prevail throughout the Community. Amendments 111 and 112 are intended to enact annexes stipulating the level of these parameters. Were we not to lay down such values, this Water Framework Directive would be toothless and hard to apply. We are not, however, trying to apply the same standards to everything in the Community, but rather to ensure a high standard of quality in groundwater for the good of the public, while very definitely taking account of local and regional differences, particularly geological conditions. It is for that reason that we have tabled Amendment 91, which takes account of differing conditions throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need, though, is precise procedures and not the vague approaches that the Commission has proposed, if we are to be able to lay down these parameters. I therefore reject the Commission’s proposals for this. As for the demand for the revision and possible suspension of the Nitrates Directive, which is what is sought via Amendments 108 and 109, I am opposed to this principally on legal grounds. What agriculture throughout Europe needs is not distorted competition, but a level playing field.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stavros Dimas,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Μember of the Commission</span>. <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, the Commission believes that, given the current lack of knowledge about the environmental quality of groundwater and the huge variety of natural conditions which exist in Europe, it is not technically feasible, nor is it desirable to introduce on this basis new standards for a more comprehensive list of substances at the level of the European Union. That is why the Commission proposed a small number of quality standards at European Union level and took care to ensure that the Member States would adopt appropriate threshold values for other dangerous substances which are considered to be a risk to groundwater. The term 'threshold value' was used purely and simply to distinguish the national standards in question from the standards at European Union level. Nonetheless, we accept that the adoption of the term 'threshold values' may cause confusion.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we are prepared to accept in principle Amendments 17 and 57 and the related Amendments 30, 31 34, 69, 70 and 71. Using the term 'groundwater quality standards' throughout the text clarifies at the same time that, for certain substances, the quality standards in question will be adopted at European Union level and that, for other substances, the standards in question will be adopted by the Member States. The Commission likewise welcomes Amendment 65, which calls for the adoption of a common methodology in the proposal, so that groundwater quality standards are adopted on the basis of common criteria. As far as the compliance procedure is concerned, the Commission is in a position to agree in principle with Amendments 28, 29 and 58, in order to allow some degree of flexibility when the good chemical status of groundwater is defined. However, greater flexibility cannot mean compromise as far as environmental targets are concerned, and the text must be absolutely clear on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments 1 and 2 propose that it should be clarified that the directive concerns the protection of groundwater against chemical pollution and deterioration, a proposal which we can support. Nonetheless, the references to parameters relating to drinking water, as defined in Amendments 3 and 4, would appear to be off the mark, given that the proposal focuses on environmental targets relating to groundwater, while the measures for drinking water are satisfactorily covered by Article 7 of the Water Framework Directive. As regards Amendment 94, which numerous speakers referred to today, I should like to clarify that the Commission cannot accept it. The proposed changes may cause confusion and water down the arrangements which already exist in the Water Framework Directive. Similarly, I am not in a position to accept amendments touching on matters which are already covered by the Water Framework Directive. This applies to Amendments 7, 10 and 15 relating to the quantitative aspects of groundwater management, Amendment 16 referring to the characterisation of groundwater and Amendment 52 referring to the 'polluter pays' principle. Amendments 21 and 22, relating to the new definitions of deterioration and background concentration, are acceptable to the Commission. However, acceptance of Amendments 23 and 49, which propose a new definition and separate system for historical contaminated sites, cannot be supported, given that management of the sites in question does not come within the scope of the present proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as monitoring is concerned, the Commission agrees with Amendments 14, 41 and 43 on the need to tighten up demands in relation to the requirements of the Water Framework Directive relating to the harmonisation of measurement methods and the compatibility and pertinence of the related data. As regards preventing and limiting discharges to groundwater, the Commission is in a position to accept in principle the majority of the clarifications proposed in Amendments 19, 20, 43 and 48. As regards determining and reversing trends in the quality of groundwater, the Commission agrees with Amendment 37 on the attention which needs to be given to increases in concentrations as a result of human activity. Other amendments, including Amendments 38 and 39, concerning the reference to baseline concentrations and the special assessment of trends in relation to point sources of pollution, are accepted by the Commission. Finally, Amendments 74, 75 and 79 concerning technical specifications are acceptable to the Commission, whereas others, such as Amendments 76 to 78 and 83 to 85, are acceptable in principle but require further clarification.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments 108 and 109 on the possible review and repeal of the directive on nitrates cannot be accepted by the Commission. The directive on nitrates has helped to reduce pollution from farming and will continue to help in future. The Water Framework Directive, the directive on nitrates and the present proposal for a directive on groundwater are complementary and mutually supportive. In reply to the question asked, I wish to emphasise that the directive on nitrates only covers zones which are sensitive to nitrates, while the directive on groundwater will apply to the whole of Europe. Amendments 111 and 112 are not accepted by the Commission, because they introduce standards at European level for various pollutants, which the Commission believes should be left, for the time being, to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I should like to emphasise that many of the amendments are useful in clarifying the proposal and improve how it stands in relation to the Water Framework Directive and the previous directive on groundwater. I am pleased to say that the Commission is in a position to accept 31 amendments in full and a further 44 amendments in principle or in part. Nonetheless, 48 amendments are unacceptable to the Commission. I am giving the Bureau a full list of the Commission's positions on the amendments<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.
