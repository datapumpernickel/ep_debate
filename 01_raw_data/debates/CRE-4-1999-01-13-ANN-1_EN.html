<p class="contents">Question No 12 by <span class="bold">Richard Howitt </span>(H−1200/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Progress on the new Structural Fund regulations</span></p>
<p class="contents">Since the publication of the draft regulations for Structural Fund Reform on 18 March 1998, there has been much progress in the negotiations between the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council, not least the completion of the first reading in Parliament. As it will prove difficult for all those involved to focus on the areas of importance without an official instrument from which to work, does the Council intend to issue an official updated version of the draft regulations in good time before the second reading takes place, one which will reflect the changes which have occurred since negotiations began?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The question of the European Parliament"s participation in the legislative process for Agenda 2000, including Structural Fund Reform, has already been the subject of correspondence between the Council and the European Parliament. I would remind you of the assurances given by the individual Presidents of the Council to the President of the European Parliament regarding the implementation of the legislative process for Agenda 2000. The presidents of the Council have always stressed the importance of effective coordination and of a regular exchange of information concerning discussions in both institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this, and having regard to the procedures laid down in the treaties, the presidency began informal dialogue with the European Parliament, during which the European Parliament was informed of the progress of discussions in the Council. This informal dialogue will continue under the German Presidency. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 19 by <span class="bold">James Nicholson </span>(H−1218/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Vienna Summit conclusion on Northern Ireland</span></p>
<p class="contents">Is the Council satisfied that the Commission has taken due regard of the conclusions of the Cardiff Summit in June 1998, reaffirmed in the conclusions of the Vienna Summit in December 1998, in which the Council noted Parliament's request to the Council and Commission to consider as a matter of urgency how the Belfast Agreement might be supported in practical terms and invited the Commission to submit appropriate proposals?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">As the Council pointed out in a written answer to a question put by the honourable Member in the framework of Question Time at the December session, the Council is satisfied that the Belfast Agreement was supported in practical terms by the European Community even many years before it came into existence, since this agreement largely results from the efforts of all those involved in the peace process in Ireland during the years up to 10 April 1998. The European Community, as the people of Ireland and the authorities on both sides of the border acknowledge, among many others brought an important contribution to this peace process, both through the PEACE Community initiative and through the Community contribution to the International Fund for Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">Shortly after the Belfast Agreement was signed, the Commission proposed in the preliminary draft budget for 1999 to increase the overall financial framework originally foreseen for PEACE by 100 million euros which the Council accepted in both its readings of the draft budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council meeting in Vienna in December 1998 recognised the importance of maintaining the momentum created by the historic agreement reached in Belfast on 10 April and of seizing the opportunities created by that agreement. It reiterated its determination, which is fully shared by Parliament and the Commission, that the Union should continue to play an active part in promoting lasting peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland and reaffirms the conclusions of the Cardiff European Council in that regard. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 20 by <span class="bold">Maj Theorin </span>(H−1220/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Children in war situations</span></p>
<p class="contents">Children are particularly vulnerable in war situations. An annex to the Geneva Convention stipulates that they must be afforded special protection. Children caught up in wars and armed conflicts must be treated with special respect and protected against all forms of cruelty and other dangers.</p>
<p class="contents">Often, the majority of a war's victims are civilians. The EU Member States are cooperating with armed forces in peace‐keeping missions and in a number of conflicts. Military personnel come into contact with the civilian population and also have a duty to protect them.</p>
<p class="contents">Military personnel must be made aware of the formal rights of the civilian population and of how their actions affect civilians. A positive encounter with an adult could be a turning point for a child that has been badly treated.</p>
<p class="contents">Since more and more conflicts are causing suffering amongst civilians, a large part of the training given to military personnel should focus on the needs of the civilian population. How, in the Council's view, can we best provide support for civilians and in particular children who are victims of wars?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">Within the Council, promoting the rights of children has a high priority. The Austrian Presidency stressed the importance of this issue in its speech to the 53rd Conference of the United Nations General Assembly, and called for a worldwide coalition to promote the rights of children and to fight against the exploitation of children. The position of the EU is based on the principle that children must be able to live in peace, freedom, prosperity and security, free from abuse, violence and exploitation.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is deeply troubled by the situation of civilian populations – especially that of children – in war‐torn areas and in areas affected by armed conflict. For this reason the EU has actively supported the work of Mr Otunnu, the UN special envoy for children caught up in armed conflict, as well as that of his predecessor, Mrs Machel. It is of particular concern to the presidency and to Member States that progress is made in the drafting of an optional protocol concerning the use of children in armed conflict. As soon as a text has been agreed, the EU will call on all states to accede to the protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU further welcomes the fact that, pursuant to Article 18 of the Statute of the International Criminal Court, the conscription or recruitment of children under 15 years of age to serve with the armed forces, or their enlistment to take an active part in hostilities in international or internal conflicts, are to be regarded as war crimes, over which the Court will have jurisdiction. This will help to protect children from direct participation in hostile confrontations and thereby reduce the danger to their lives that results from acts of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU regularly brings up the issue of the rights of children during meetings held with third countries in the context of political dialogue. It calls on the parties involved directly or indirectly in conflicts to comply with international standards and to make every conceivable effort to protect children from acts of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has not looked into the question of the training of those people serving in the armed forces and involved in peace‐keeping missions. It is, as always, the responsibility of the Member States to see to it that their nationals who serve in peace‐ keeping forces work towards implementing the goals stated at the beginning. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 21 by <span class="bold">Ioannis Theonas </span>(H−1223/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Barbaric bombardment of Iraqi people and flagrant violation of international law</span></p>
<p class="contents">The wide‐ranging military action by the USA and the UK against Iraq in the form of the bombing of that country on 16 December – bypassing all UN procedures – is a violation of every concept of international legality and a flagrantly undemocratic act of provocation, replacing the international institutions with force of arms and international terrorism. This barbaric act is a severe blow to the already humiliated Iraqi people and yet again provides Saddam Hussein and his regime with a form of justification.</p>
<p class="contents">Was the Council informed of the USA and UK military action? Does not the participation of the UK – especially in the event that the Council was not previously informed – constitute a violation of the Community treaties, Community law and the Charter of Human Rights, the 50th anniversary of which fell on the very eve of the bombing raids? Does it intend to condemn the USA and the UK for this barbaric attack on the Iraqi people and put the matter before the international bodies, taking all the measures necessary to put an immediate end to military intervention in Iraq and avoid any repetition of measures which allow a particular party to act as world policeman, spurning the procedures available to achieve a peaceful settlement of international disputes?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">On a number of occasions the EU has called on the Iraqi authorities to ensure full cooperation with the representatives of UNSCOM and the IAEA, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the UNSCR. The last of these was in December 1998, when the Heads of State and Government met in Vienna under the auspices of the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to the question posed by the honourable Member in respect of the raids carried out against targets on Iraqi territory, the Council has never been asked to take joint action to tackle this situation. The Council is therefore not in a position to provide an answer to this question.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Council would like to stress that the raids on Iraq were motivated by the persistent refusal of the Iraqi authorities to comply with the obligations arising from the memorandum of understanding between the Secretary‐General of the United Nations and the Government of Iraq of 23 February 1998 and the settlement reached on 14 November 1998, as well as the relevant resolutions of the UNSCR.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Council once again expresses its commitment to compliance with the resolutions of the United Nations, with international treaties and with the universal principles on which the Charter of the United Nations was founded. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 22 by <span class="bold">Nikitas Kaklamanis </span>(H−1224/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Lack of transparency in Council proceedings and decisions</span></p>
<p class="contents">The meetings of the Council of Ministers of the Union are held behind closed doors, while no official record is kept of their proceedings. There is a lack of transparency in this situation which makes the Council the only legislative body in the world (together with the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China) which legislates in secret.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Council state the reasons for this lack of transparency and what measures it will take to ensure that European citizens have access to the decision‐making procedure of this key institution?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Council does not share the view of the honourable Member that there is a lack of transparency in Council proceedings. As proof of this I should like to mention the publication of the second report on the implementation of Council Decision 93/731/EC on public access to Council documents, including the minutes of Council meetings, which provide information on all points discussed during Council meetings as well as all the texts adopted. This report shows that the percentage of documents transmitted rose from 58.7 % in the period 1994‐1995 to 78.3 % in the period 1996‐1997, despite the fact that the number of requested documents increased twelve‐fold during the same period.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to point out to the honourable Member that many Council debates on general political issues are broadcast publicly.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the transparency of Community proceedings and decisions, the increasingly important role played by the European Parliament should not be underestimated. In the wake of the revision of the treaties – most recently in Amsterdam – the European Parliament"s rule‐making powers have been widened considerably, and this has been done on the basis of procedures such as the cooperation, assent and codecision procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">This role of co‐legislator also means that the European Parliament will have greater involvement – side by side with the Council – in the task of making the debates and, above all, the decisions reached by the institutions, more comprehensible to the general public.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has confidence in the mechanism it has introduced. This mechanism will be developed further in order to enable satisfactory transparency to be achieved in the decision‐making process.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress made so far reflects the experiences that the Council and the General Secretariat have gathered through the practical implementation of this new policy of openness, and demonstrates – as the Council established in its conclusions of 29 June 1998 – the effectiveness of Council Decision 93/731/EC in terms of increased transparency of the EU and greater closeness to the citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">Further efforts will be needed to enable the Council to put the finishing touches to the instruments it has established. To this end, in its conclusions of 29 July 1998, it declared its intention to grant the widest possible access to documents relating to the acts that it, as legislator, has adopted, and to reduce recourse to Article 4(2) of Council Decision 93/731/EC to a minimum. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 23 by <span class="bold">Bernd Posselt </span>(H−1229/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Immigration into the EU</span></p>
<p class="contents">What scope does the German Presidency see for reducing immigration into the European Union and at the same time establishing a system using fixed quotas for sharing the burden of accommodating asylum applicants and refugees from civil wars?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The fight against illegal immigration is of great importance to the Council. However, a clear distinction must be made between illegal and legal immigration. In mid−1998, the Austrian Presidency submitted a strategy paper on immigration and asylum policy, and in the course of initial deliberations in the Council, in which emphasis was placed on the need to draw up a coherent plan to combat illegal immigration and in particular to step up the fight against trade in human beings, the advantages of a well‐ordered and legal immigration programme were underlined. Despite the efforts of the last few years, the presidency sees further need for action in the fight against illegal immigration. Within the recently established high‐level asylum and immigration group, it will push ahead with work to elaborate a joint, integrated programme to encompass all pillars, in respect of the as yet unestablished countries of origin and transit countries of asylum seekers and immigrants, which aims to stem the flow of immigrants out of these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the presidency intends to pursue the discussion already begun under the Austrian Presidency on conducting information campaigns in the countries of origin and transit countries, concerning the legal prerequisites for the influx of third country nationals into Member States. The aim is to reach an agreement on the content and form of such campaigns by the end of the presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also the case that speedy and effective concerted measures against illegal immigration can be introduced only if timely information is available on early signs of illegal immigration flows and of trends towards the spread of immigration. A substantial proportion of the flow of immigrants reaches the EU via South‐East and Eastern Europe. The Austrian Presidency proposed an early warning system for illegal immigration to ensure a speedier reaction to events and the immediate introduction of counter measures. The German Presidency takes the view that the countries of Central and Eastern Europe should be included in this system.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency will also continue the work introduced by the Austrian Presidency in the CIREFI to speed up the exchange of information between Member States, and it will extend this process to include the applicant countries. The aim is to achieve this within two years.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to returning illegal immigrants to their country of origin, the presidency will continue the process begun under the Austrian Presidency to elaborate a joint draft readmission agreement with third countries. In this connection, the inclusion of readmission clauses in European Community and Member State agreements, and the use of standardised EU travel documents will be discussed further.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency also plans to deal with selected transit problems when formulating repatriation measures. Efforts could be made to introduce a joint measure to provide support from the competent authorities in the transit countries for the officials responsible for repatriation in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of burden sharing raised in the second part of the question, which will be discussed within the framework of the Commission proposals for temporary protection and solidarity in receiving and accommodating refugees from civil wars, is of the utmost importance to the Council. It is doubtful, however, whether fixed quotas are consistent with the requirement of the European Parliament, as put forward in its opinion, that any distribution process presupposes the consent of those involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency will support a solution which expresses the idea of European solidarity. Intensive discussions will thus be held in respect of distribution criteria. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 24 by <span class="bold">Christine Oddy </span>(H−1231/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Puerto Morazan – Hurricane Mitch</span></p>
<p class="contents">Would the Council advise how much construction help, in the form of road and bridge repair teams and equipment, it has sent to Nicaragua and Honduras?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Council has twice examined the effects of Hurricane Mitch and the possibilities of organising construction aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States have kept each other informed of the emergency aid they have supplied, and the Commission has helped to coordinate emergency aid on the spot. Be that as it may, road and bridge repair has not been part of any specific coordination plan. Moreover, when the advisory group for the reconstruction of Central America met in Washington on 10 and 11 December 1998, the Commission made clear its intention to concentrate its aid in the areas of education, health and possibly the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is waiting for a Commission communication concerning the organisation of reconstruction aid in the wake of Hurricane Mitch. This communication will contain a needs analysis, a reconstruction programme and a finance programme. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 25 by <span class="bold">Sören Wibe </span>(H−1238/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Economic sanctions against Israel</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Israeli Government's sabotage of the Middle East peace process is outrageous. No matter what concessions the Palestinian leadership makes, the Netanyahu administration claims that they are insufficient. They openly break agreements they have entered into and pursue a policy that threatens world peace.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that the Israeli Government does not listen to appeals from the international community. All the resolutions adopted by the Union on this issue have been ignored. Unfortunately, the Israeli Government appears to listen to nothing except the language of pure force. In the light of this situation, does the Council not consider it justified to impose economic sanctions on Israel in order to assist the oppressed Palestinian people and to force Israel to conduct itself with greater propriety in the peace process?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">On numerous occasions the Council has strongly urged both sides to push forward with implementing the Wye River Memorandum which they signed in October 1998. When the European Council met in Vienna it backed the EU"s determination to contribute politically and economically to ensuring the success of the peace process. However, the Council does not take the view that measures such as those proposed by the honourable Member would serve to achieve this goal.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the current strained political situation in the country and the early elections which are now going to take place, the peace process is the focus of attention in Israel. The Council hopes that these elections will pave the way towards full implementation of the Wye River Memorandum and towards the successful conclusion of the peace process. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 26 by <span class="bold">Vassilis Ephremidis </span>(H−1243/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Payment by Germany of war reparations to Greece</span></p>
<p class="contents">The question of the payment by Germany to Greece of reparations and the repayment of loans arising from the Second World War and the Occupation remained unresolved following the recent bilateral meeting between Mr Simitis and Mr Schröder, since the Germany Chancellor refused to discuss the matter in direct contradiction with pre‐electoral commitments by the parties belonging to the present German coalition government.</p>
<p class="contents">Eight years following the signature of the Moscow Agreement and the unification of Germany which resolved any remaining procedural or legal questions, nothing has been done to address this problem, which includes repayment of the compulsory loan obtained by the occupying authorities from the Bank of Greece, reparations for material damage of all kinds, satisfaction of claims by the victims of the occupying forces and other reparations owing from the First World War and compliance with decisions by the Greek‐German Joint Arbitration Court concerning damages from the First World War.</p>
<p class="contents">What steps will the Council and in particular the German Presidency take to resolve these outstanding issues in compliance with international law, thereby eliminating this major problem affecting relations between the two countries?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The question posed by the honourable Member relates exclusively to bilateral relations between Greece and Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member will therefore understand that it is quite impossible for me, in my capacity as President‐in‐Office, to respond to an issue such as payment of war reparations, which is clearly outside the scope of the Treaty establishing the European Community. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 27 by <span class="bold">John Cushnahan </span>(H−1246/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: EU‐US Summit</span></p>
<p class="contents">What progress did the summit make in relation to taking initiatives on terrorism, drugs, child pornography and organised crime?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The summit was able to take stock on a number of important issues relating to the fight against organised crime and to agree to continue cooperation in this matter which is a concern both to the Union and to the United States. It confirmed the commitment to see to it that all states sign and ratify the eleven international counterterrorism conventions and agreed to begin work on an international convention for the suppression of terrorist financing. Furthermore, the summit launched cooperation on combating child pornography on the Internet with a view to holding a joint experts' conference in Vienna next year. The summit noted the practical cooperation which takes place in fight against organised crime and the continued implementation of the US‐EU precursor chemicals agreement. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 28 by <span class="bold">Olivier Dupuis </span>(H−1248/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Kosovo</span></p>
<p class="contents">The fact that Albanian Kosovans are not directly involved in the Holbrooke‐Milosevic negotiations and, even more so, the recent rise in the perpetration by the Yugoslav and Serbian authorities of criminal acts against both the Serbian and Albanian populations of Kosovo, and of threats against the OSCE observers, point to a grim outlook for the next few months and even weeks in Kosovo. In this context, does the Council not deem it essential, and a matter of urgency, to put the question of the indictment of Slobodan Milosevic before the tribunal on crimes committed in former Yugoslavia on the agenda of the UN Security Council, via the Member States which are represented on it, to step up cooperation between the Member States and the tribunal regarding the collection of evidence about the intrigues of the Serb and Yugoslav authorities in Kosovo, to grant official recognition to the Kosovo Liberation Army as quickly as possible, and to set up a European Union radio station to broadcast around the clock in both Serb and Albanian throughout the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Council shares the disappointment of the honourable Member at the worsening situation in Kosovo. It utterly condemns those responsible for the latest incidents there. It has asked the Belgrade administration to investigate these incidents immediately and has called upon all those involved to cooperate unreservedly with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in its investigation of human rights abuses within its jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="contents">Responsibility for the origins of the crisis in Kosovo lies first and foremost with Belgrade. The Albanian Kosovans in general and the Kosovo Liberation Army in particular are partly responsible for the fact that it has so far been impossible to get substantive negotiations off the ground which could bring about a peaceful solution such as that sought by the international community, based therefore not on independence but on far‐reaching autonomy for Kosovo within the Federal Republic of Jugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">The procedure put forward by the honourable Member (indictment of Milosevic, official recognition of the KLA which, despite the cease‐fire it has itself declared, has not abandoned its goal of achieving independence through force) would hardly be conducive to bringing about the rapprochement of both sides that is necessary to ensure a peaceful settlement. On the contrary, it would encourage extremism, an escalation of armed conflict and the spread of instability throughout the whole of the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The Albanian Kosovans must seize the opportunity afforded by the current fragile cease‐fire to reach an interim agreement which would enable them to determine their own affairs to a far greater extent. In tandem with the USA and others, the EU is endeavouring to put together a unified Albanian Kosovan negotiating team, in which all political persuasions are represented, in order to ensure that the Kosovans play an active role in the negotiation process. The current practice of informal contact with the political wing of the KLA, and contact with Mr Rugova as the only elected leader of the Albanian Kosovans, go some way towards achieving this goal. It is a goal which must be achieved if the alleged willingness on the part of the Yugoslavs to grant autonomy to Kosovo is to be seriously measured against what is happening on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Council agrees unreservedly with the view that is implicit in the honourable Member"s question that independent, objective information on the ground is vitally important for Kosovo in supporting the interim agreement and would make it easier for the political leadership to accept and back the agreement. The EU special envoy is continuing his efforts to put in place an information strategy, and Member States have been asked to suggest to their media that they broadcast more extensively to Serbia and that they strengthen their contacts with representatives of the independent Serbian media. The Council would like to remind you that, in 1998, ECU 10 million were made available in support of the independent media in the former Yugoslavia, of which ECU 6 million were earmarked for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In the context of the EU"s future information strategy, consideration will be given to setting up a radio station under the OSCE and to a special media centre for the Kosovo verification mission. </p><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<p class="contents">Question No 40 by <span class="bold">Gerard Collins </span>(H−1206/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Research into the provision of public transport on un‐economic routes</span></p>
<p class="contents">Many parts of rural Ireland are suffering from severe demographic and infrastructure problems. An analysis of the most recent census figures for parts of West Limerick and North Cork reveals large numbers of elderly people living alone and lacking transport services.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission indicate what research it has undertaken, or intends to undertake, into ways of improving public transport on un‐economic routes.</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member will be aware that much public transport is socially desirable but financially unprofitable, so the challenges include getting the best value for money from public funding; raising the quality and attractiveness of services; and organising services in innovative ways which reduce their costs and make it easier to provide transport in areas where demand is low for structural reasons. The Commission has undertaken, or is supporting, research on all three points.</p>
<p class="contents">The ISOTOPE project completed in 1997 examined the effectiveness and efficiency of different organisational structures in urban public transport and concluded that the best approach is through a measure of ‘controlled competition' – without the loss of service integration that would come from a totally free market. The Commission is considering how to take best advantage of these recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the QUATTRO project has studied how to enhance quality in public transport management and contracts and the MOTIF project is analysing the match between ‘the market' and the broad scope of possible public transport solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">As an alternative to strictly scheduled but under‐utilised services, demand‐responsive transport is one way to offer lower‐cost services in areas of low patronage. The SAMPO and SAMPLUS projects, which were cofinanced by the Telematics Applications Programme, have, therefore, looked into the potential of telematics services for information, for reservation and for flexible vehicle planning and management in order to promote maximum ‘accessibility' (in the broadest sense) of rural transport.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, better use may be made of car‐sharing and of public sector vehicles such as postbuses and ‘people carrier' taxis in rural areas. The VIRGIL project is, consequently, preparing an extensive inventory and analysis of various practices in rural transport all over Europe. It will also provide recommendations for further research in consultation with participants in public transport services and experts and there should be further follow up through the ‘Sustainable Mobility and Intermodality' key action in the Fifth Framework Research and Development Programme. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 41 by <span class="bold">Robert Sturdy </span>(H−1226/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Trans‐European road network</span></p>
<p class="contents">A number of people have been killed because of congestion on the A14 near Cambridge, England, a trans‐European network road. It is 20 years since the road was upgraded. What action can the Commission take to persuade the British Government to bring forward urgent improvements to this road?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Member will know, the guidelines covering general objectives, priorities and the broad lines of measures for the development of the trans‐European transport network identify eligible projects of common interest. The guidelines allow the Community to give financial support to projects that have the purpose of improving transport conditions – in particular safety and reliability.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst the A14 is included in the network guidelines, the honourable Member will be aware that under the TENs Financial Regulation, the Community can only cofinance feasibility studies or infrastructure investments on the basis of specific requests from the Member State concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the Commission can only take further steps when the UK authorities have submitted such a request and the honourable Member will be interested to know that the UK has included a multimodal study of the Cambridge‐Huntingdon section of the A14 in the list of projects for which it seeks TENs support in 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is, therefore, now giving active attention to that list and will make a recommendation after the normal procedures are concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the Commission understands from its enquiries that the UK Highways Agency has identified a number of safety‐related improvements for the Huntingdon‐Cambridge section of the route, which will be implemented during 1999. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 42 by <span class="bold">Reinhard Rack </span>(H−1234/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Stage reached in planning central transport links in Europe (TENs)</span></p>
<p class="contents">According to the current stage of planning in the East of the Union, abutting its external borders with the CEECs, what progress is being made with central north/south transport links, specifically those connecting the Berlin/Warsaw region to the Milan/southern Europe region? The development of which links, particularly road and rail links, is being given priority for this region?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Member will know, the Trans‐European Transport Network guidelines specify the important transport links within the Community, identifying links with the Central and East European countries and include, in an annex, the 14 projects adopted by the Essen European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The 10 Pan‐European multimodal Transport Corridors – the so‐called ‘Crete' corridors – constitute the major international links between the Central and East European countries and between them and the Community. Meanwhile, the Transport Infrastructure Needs Assessment (TINA) established in 1996 is providing an outline of the future Trans‐European Transport Network in the countries that are candidates for accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this framework, the links between the Berlin/Warsaw region to Milan and Southern Central Europe are covered by the north/south high speed train/combined transport TENs project to link Berlin and Verona in conjunction with Crete Corridors V and VI. These corridors have priority in the present planning of the relevant countries. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 49 by <span class="bold">Patricia McKenna </span>(H−1173/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: EU/WEU cooperation</span></p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission report fully on the state of cooperation between the EU and the WEU, as exemplified by the decision taken at the recent meeting of the Energy Council on joint monitoring in Kosovo?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">With a view to ensuring that the decisions and actions which the EU asks the WEU to implement are done so rapidly and effectively, the two organisations have drawn up an organisation chart showing the way in which their decision‐making processes interact whenever the EU avails itself of the WEU pursuant to Article J.4(2) of the TEU.</p>
<p class="contents">Major efforts were made during 1998 to step up institutional and practical cooperation between the EU and the WEU and to lay the best possible foundations for effective implementation of the relevant provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">During that year, the EU Council made a number of requests to the WEU pursuant to Article J.4(2) of the TEU, namely: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ on 22 September 1998 the EU Council adopted a decision calling on the WEU to complete as a matter of urgency its feasibility study into possible options for international police operations in Albania aimed at assisting the Albanian authorities in re‐establishing law and order in that country; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ on 9 November 1998 the EU Council adopted a decision calling on the WEU to implement an EU decision on a specific Union action covering assistance with mine clearing operations in Croatia; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ on 13 November 1998 the EU Council adopted a decision calling on the WEU to provide relevant information from its Satellite Centre regarding the state of implementation of the agreements signed in Belgrade on 16 October 1998 between the FRY and the OSCE and on 15 October 1998 between the FRY and NATO and, in this connection, on the situation of refugees and displaced persons and of infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and the WEU are currently analysing these initial experiences with a view to improving cooperation between them in the future. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 50 by <span class="bold">Alexandros Alavanos </span>(H−1175/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Greek court judgment and Community directives on recognition of diplomas</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Greek Supreme Court has ruled against recognition of diplomas of students who begin their studies in Greece with a two‐year programme at ‘Free Study Centres' and continue at partner universities in a Member State of the European Union from which they receive an academic qualification., In the event that the diplomas in question are recognised by the Member State awarding the academic qualification as giving access to professions which are regulated by law, will the Commission clarify whether the above Greek court decision is in keeping with Community directives on the recognition of diplomas?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The question asked by the honourable Member is linked to the problem of franchised or transnational training programmes. It relates to training programmes provided in a Member State, in this case Greece, by an institution, university, private or other training body in another Member State. The diploma awarded on completion of the programme is not a Greek diploma, but a diploma of the Member State where the training body is based.</p>
<p class="contents">This phenomenon of transnational training is a relatively recent one and is evolving very rapidly. It is a matter of reconciling the principles of freedom of movement, freedom to provide services and encouragement of cooperation between the educational institutions of the different Member States, with the need to maintain a high level of quality in higher education.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of Community directives, it can be considered that, if a diploma which is issued at the end of a period of franchised training conforms to the definition of the diploma in the directive, especially as regards the level of training, the holder of the diploma could invoke the provisions of these directives in order to obtain recognition. It is vital that diplomas marking the successful conclusion of the franchised training programmes are rigorously controlled by the competent authorities in the country of origin, so that the principle of mutual trust which inspires the recognition mechanisms within the Community is not called into question.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission draws the attention of the honourable Member to the fact that Greece has not yet incorporated into national law Directive 89/48/EEC on a general system for the recognition of higher‐education diplomas. There still remain obstacles to the recognition of diplomas in Greece, not only in respect of franchised training programmes. The Commission has referred this to the Court of Justice on the basis of Article 171 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the ruling of the Greek Supreme Court is concerned, the Commission is unable to give an opinion until it has made a careful examination of this judgment. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 51 by <span class="bold">Graham Watson </span>(H−1179/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: EU fire safety recommendations</span></p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission satisfied with the conclusions of the study it commissioned Ceten‐Apave to undertake on compliance and non‐compliance with the 1986 EU fire safety recommendations and does it intend to bring forward proposals for an EEC fire safety directive?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission has instigated a number of measures in this area, including: the Council Recommendation of 22 December 1986 on fire safety in existing hotels (Recommendation 86/666/EEC)<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> , the Council Directive on construction products (Directive 89/106/EEC)<a href="#def_1_2" name="ref_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and the provisions on fire detection and fire fighting laid down in the Council Directive concerning minimum safety and health requirements at the workplace (Directive 89/654/EEC)<a href="#def_1_3" name="ref_1_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> .</p>
<p class="contents">In response to the call for a directive on hotel safety based on the 1986 recommendation, the Commission inter alia commissioned a study, the main aim of which was to check that all Member States had properly interpreted and transposed into national law all the provisions contained in that recommendation (laying down minimum requirements designed to ensure that all hotels provide acceptable safety standards for guests throughout the Community).</p>
<p class="contents">The main findings of the study are that the provisions of the recommendation are in almost all cases covered by national legislation and may therefore be considered minimum requirements which are met and exceeded in most cases. Furthermore, in cases where the relevant legislation was not sufficiently comprehensive, the recommendation has had a major impact in that, in most cases, it has been more or less transposed into national law.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the study has demonstrated the success of the measures already adopted, the Commission does not, at present, intend to take any further action on these recommendations. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 52 by <span class="bold">John McCartin </span>(H−1181/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Duty free treatment</span></p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware of the recent adverse publicity in both British and Irish media regarding access to duty‐free shops which Members of the Commission are entitled to, and what is the Commission doing to correct the negative image that this has created?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">Belgium treats the 20 Members of the Commission as diplomats. They therefore enjoy various financial benefits which are granted to all diplomats serving in Belgium and to all others with an equivalent status. One of these benefits is the ability to purchase goods for personal use free of VAT and/or excise duty. The terms governing such purchases are laid down on an annual basis by the Belgian authorities. The current ceiling for such purchases (1998 figures) is given in the answer to question H−1080/98 by Mrs Banotti.</p>
<p class="contents">The benefits enjoyed by diplomats serving outside their own countries are generally recognised by all countries and are based on long‐standing practice in international relations. Furthermore, within the Community they are governed by specific provisions laid down in the current directives on VAT and excise duty (77/388/EEC<a href="#def_1_4" name="ref_1_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> and 92/12/EEC<a href="#def_1_5" name="ref_1_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> ) and the regulation on customs duty (EEC No 918/83)<a href="#def_1_6" name="ref_1_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> .</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has looked into the issue of whether such privileges for EU nationals enjoying diplomatic status and serving in one of the Member States – including Members of the Commission – are compatible with the single market and is currently considering possible legislative initiatives. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 53 by <span class="bold">Nuala Ahern </span>(H−1184/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Disposal of solid radioactive waste by the UK authorities into the Irish Sea and air experiments over west Wales in the 1950s and early 1960s</span></p>
<p class="contents">Has the Commission already carried out a study of the Irish Sea with a view to assessing whether the disposal by the United Kingdom authorities of solid radioactive waste into the Irish Sea and the air experiments involving germ weapons carried out over west Wales in the 1950s and early 1960s have had damaging environmental and health effects on the people of Ireland, or does it have plans to carry out such a study?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The competent authorities of Ireland and of the United Kingdom have for many years routinely monitored the levels of radioactivity in the Irish Sea and published reports providing the levels of radioactive contamination and estimates of doses to the population. There is no reason to suspect that any health or environmental effects have occurred.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has no information on germ weapon experiments in Wales. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 54 by <span class="bold">Gerardo Galeote Quecedo </span>(H−1186/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Communication on the First EU‐Latin America and Caribbean Summit</span></p>
<p class="contents">The First EU‐Latin America and Caribbean Summit of heads of state and government is to be held in Brazil in June 1999. This will be an event of major importance marking a turning‐point in economic, commercial and political relations between the two regions, at a time when the EU is devoting increasing attention to this geographical area.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the above, when does the Commission intend to submit a communication to Parliament on the EU‐Latin America and Caribbean Summit, to enable Parliament to hold a debate in plenary?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently endeavouring to finalise the text of a communication to Parliament and to the Council on the future of EU‐Latin America and Caribbean relations, in view of the next summit in Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p class="contents">This document will be submitted to the European Parliament in time to allow it to hold a debate in plenary. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 55 by <span class="bold">Phillip Whitehead </span>(H−1187/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Funds for nature conservation</span></p>
<p class="contents">According to Article 8 of the Habitat Directive (92/43)<a href="#def_1_7" name="ref_1_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a> , Member States must send to the Commission estimates of the Community cofinancing necessary to conserve these specifically designated areas of Community importance. The Commission must also assess this financing. So far, this has not been done, despite the fact that nature conservation plays an important role in rural development and provides direct employment for an increasing number of people. It cannot be done without the integration of environmental measures and their financial enablement.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the Commission planning to do to ensure that there are funds for nature conservation and in particular how is it going to organise itself to redirect funds through the Structural Funds and Common Agriculture Policy budget to nature conservation purposes?</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission say how much money will be available for this purpose?</p>
<p class="contents">What is the Commission's position on the LIFE three regulation and what budget is going to be allocated from this programme to LIFE‐nature?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">In order to be able to cofinance implementation of the Habitat Directive, the Commission must first of all receive complete lists of the sites put forward by the Member States, and then their estimates of the amounts deemed necessary. No such estimates have been received to date.</p>
<p class="contents">The experience which several Member States have gained with the current Structural Funds and the agri‐environmental measures has demonstrated that funds do exist, but can only be allocated to nature conservation measures. In the future, the Commission will encourage the Member States to make optimum use of the opportunities which Agenda 2000 affords.</p>
<p class="contents">The new regulation on general provisions on the Structural Funds, as proposed by the Commission on 18 March 1998, for the first time explicitly includes the protection <span class="italic">and improvement</span> of the environment among the funds' objectives. However, nature protection is only eligible for funding if the measures to be funded contribute to economic development or job creation. The extent to which nature conservation is financed by the Structural Funds is determined by the programmes and the priorities fixed there by the national or regional authorities. Therefore, the amount allocated to nature conservation varies significantly from programme to programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission recently submitted a Life III regulation with an overall budget of EUR 613 million, covering the period 2000‐2004. The importance of the Life‐Nature programme is reflected in the fact that it accounts for 47 % of the available budget. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 56 by <span class="bold">Richard Corbett </span>(H−1190/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Use of hired cars from third countries</span></p>
<p class="contents">In view of the answer given by Mr Monti to my Written Question E−2758/98, does this mean that an EU citizen flying to Geneva Airport and hiring a car to travel to the nearby French Alps for a holiday risks fine and prosecution?</p>
<p class="contents">If so, does the Commission agree that the law needs to be changed?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">1. The Commission would repeat what it said in its answer to Written Question E−2758/98, namely that, except under the temporary admission procedure provided for in Article 719 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, any EU resident using on the territory of a Member State a rented vehicle registered in a non‐Community country (such as Switzerland) may face prosecution and a fine.</p>
<p class="contents">2. The Commission agrees with the honourable Member that Community law should be changed so as to enable EU residents to use rental cars hired in a neighbouring third country, subject to certain restrictions. Therefore, with a view to drafting a proposal making the necessary amendments to the current legislation, discussions have been held with the appropriate parties on the basis of the procedures normally followed for such matters. The Commission will endeavour to settle this matter during the first half of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 57 by <span class="bold">Anne McIntosh </span>(H−1194/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Third country poultry hygiene inspections</span></p>
<p class="contents">What inspection measures is the Commission taking to ensure that EU hygiene standards are being met in imported poultry from third countries?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">In addition to the guarantees which third countries are required to provide in the form of veterinary certificates, poultry meat and poultry from third countries are subjected to veterinary inspections at accredited frontier posts. The frequency with which physical checks are carried out is laid down by Community regulations and is based inter alia on the veterinary agreements concluded with certain third countries. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 58 by <span class="bold">Ulla Sandbæk </span>(H−1196/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Genetically modified food and funding of research</span></p>
<p class="contents">Many consumers in Europe are becoming increasingly alarmed about the use of genetically modified food.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, little is currently known about the possible consequences for nature or our health if natural crops are replaced by genetically engineered plants.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission state what financial resources have been set aside over the past two years both for the development of gene technology and biotechnology and for research into the risks posed by genetic engineering?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">Since the mid−1980s the Commission has funded a number of research projects relating to the possible consequences for the environment and human health of genetically modified crops used for human food. This research has indicated that there are no inherent risks in genetic engineering and any risks that might arise depend on the specific characteristics introduced into the crop.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last 2 years the Commission has spent EUR 134.97 million in 1997 and EUR 160.67 million in 1998 on biotechnology research and EUR 1 669 998 in 1997 and EUR 7 521 159 in 1998 on biosafety research. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 59 by <span class="bold">Raúl Rosado Fernandes </span>(H−1197/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Future Portuguese tomato quota</span></p>
<p class="contents">Tomatoes are historically Portugal's most competitive crop from the agro‐industrial point of view. The disastrously high rainfall in April and May 1997 caused a 15 % shortfall against the Portuguese quota. The quota was exceeded in 1996 and 1998. In 1999 the quota will be calculated on the basis of production in 1997 and 1998, which will mean a reduction in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">What action can the Commission take, similar to that taken in respect of other COMs for crops affected by bad weather, in order to avert a cut in the Portuguese quota, thus preventing irreparable damage to an exporting sector in which Portuguese agriculture and industry have invested heavily and which is also, in contrast to some other cases, completely unaffected by fraud?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission will calculate the distribution of quotas among Member States for the marketing year 1999/2000 according to the average quantities produced, for which the minimum price was respected, during the marketing years 1997/1998 and 1998/1999, as provided for in Article 6(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2202/96.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the problem of fraud, which was mentioned by the honourable Member, the Commission is only aware of judicial enquiries being underway in one Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">In the event that the honourable Member has accurate and reliable information on this matter of fraud, he is kindly requested to make this available to the Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 60 by <span class="bold">Marjo Matikainen‐Kallström </span>(H−1198/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Damage to health in Asia caused by tobacco</span></p>
<p class="contents">According to research published by the World Health Organisation, smoking is increasing so rapidly in Asian countries that by 2050 it will be killing more people there than for example Aids and tuberculosis combined. In China alone, where 70 % of men smoke, it is estimated that by 2050 tobacco will be killing around three million people each year. As there are no restrictions on tobacco advertising in Asia and as health legislation is inadequate, tobacco consumption can only be controlled by means of international cooperation and pressure. International tobacco companies' immoral operations in undeveloped countries in Asia are leading to a real catastrophe.</p>
<p class="contents">How will the Commission help Asian countries to educate the public about the dangers of tobacco and update their tobacco legislation? How will the Commission bring pressure to bear on international tobacco companies in order to halt the rapid increase in tobacco consumption in Asia?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of the importance of the problem of smoking in Asia and its consequences in terms of a public health hazard. The Commission's strategy in health development cooperation in Asia includes the promotion of a healthy environment and tobacco consumption is dealt with in the overall support to preventive policies.</p>
<p class="contents">In most countries where the Commission supports health systems development, education and information about the dangers of smoking is included as part of the health prevention behaviour and attitudes campaigns, although no funds are specifically earmarked for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has, however, no specific financial instrument for developing countries that aims at reducing the commercial activities of tobacco companies or to develop specific legislation on tobacco advertising.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission supports the views of the European Parliament that reducing tobacco advertising and consumption is a priority for public health action in developing countries, particularly when considering the health of young people. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 61 by <span class="bold">Josu Imaz San Miguel </span>(H−1201/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Equatorial Guinea</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 18 June 1998<a href="#def_1_8" name="ref_1_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a> , Parliament adopted a resolution in which it condemned the lack of democratic guarantees in the trial to which 117 persons of the Bubi ethnic group were subjected in Equatorial Guinea. In that same resolution the Commission was called upon to reconsider its cooperation links with Equatorial Guinea until such time as democratic freedoms and respect for human rights and the rights of minorities have been re‐established. In the light of this resolution, could the Commission describe the current state of cooperation links between the European Union and Equatorial Guinea? What action has the Commission taken (or is it intending to take) in order to ensure that democratic freedoms, basic rights and the rights of minorities are re‐established in Equatorial Guinea?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission is closely monitoring the human rights situation as it unfolds in Equatorial Guinea. On a number of occasions it has intervened through the proper channels on behalf of people who have been arrested or convicted following incidents that took place on the island of Bioko last January and which were referred to in the European Parliament resolution of 18 June 1998. On 9 September 1998 President Obiang finally commuted the 15 death penalties to life imprisonment.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1997 the Commission gradually resumed cooperation with Equatorial Guinea and this only in respect of the National Indicative Programme within the framework of the seventh EDF. This gradual resumption of cooperation is linked to progress made in terms of respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law, in accordance with Article 5 of the Lomé IV Convention. As a first stage, the Commission will use only the resources of the seventh EDF, ensuring that the basic needs of the most disadvantaged sections of the population are satisfied.</p>
<p class="contents">Planning the resources of the eighth EDF will depend on whether the government has respected its commitments with regard to democratisation and human rights. With this in mind, the Commission has recently identified a support programme, which it is prepared to implement with the agreement of the government and of other partners in Equatorial Guinea, and in coordination with actions financed by other donor countries. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 62 by <span class="bold">Veronica Hardstaff </span>(H−1202/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Ecolabel for paint – concern over first revision</span></p>
<p class="contents">The first revision of the Ecolabel for paint took place on 8 October 1998. The Committee revised titanium dioxide levels without consulting manufacturers of TiO2, and this led to much concern amongst producers. Titanium dioxide production is a highly capital‐intensive industry, and major changes need considerable time and planning before they can be reimplemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Why did the Commission not consult companies with expert knowledge of titanium dioxide, and will it re‐open the discussions on future criteria so as to allow experts to give their views?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">On 8 October 1998, the Eco‐Label Regulatory Committee, established further to Article 7 of Council Regulation No 880/92 on a Community Eco‐Label Award Scheme<a href="#def_1_9" name="ref_1_9"><sup>(9)</sup></a> , approved the proposal for a revised Commission decision establishing the ecological criteria for the award of the Community eco‐label to paints and varnishes.</p>
<p class="contents">The product group ‘paints and varnishes', established by the previous Commission Decision 96/13/EC<a href="#def_1_10" name="ref_1_10"><sup>(10)</sup></a> , had attracted successful applications from 23 producers of paints from 10 Member States and for 55 of their products.</p>
<p class="contents">The interest groups were invited to participate in the different meetings held in 1998 of the Ad Hoc Working Group, the Eco‐Label Consultation Forum and of the Eco‐Label Competent Bodies preparing the revision of the criteria for paints and varnishes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States represented in the Regulatory Committee voted in favour, amongst others, of a change in the criterion related to white pigments, and in particular to the emissions and discharges of waste related to the production of titanium dioxide. The previous criterion allowed up to 400 mg per m2 of SOx emissions and up to 30 g per m2 of sulphate wastes. It had been noted that a manufacturer of paints purchasing titanium dioxide from any producer complying with Articles 6 and 9 of Council Directive 92/112/EEC on procedures for harmonising the programmes for the reduction and eventual elimination of pollution caused by waste from the titanium dioxide industry<a href="#def_1_11" name="ref_1_11"><sup>(11)</sup></a> would automatically be in compliance with this criterion, even using the maximum of 40 g per m2 of titanium dioxide it allows. The criterion therefore had no significant selectivity.</p>
<p class="contents">Eco‐label policy aims to adapt criteria regularly to take into account technical progress and to set criteria such that between 5 and 30 % of the products currently on the market qualify for the eco‐label. Accordingly, it was decided during the meeting of the Regulatory Committee on 8 December to introduce an appropriate degree of selectivity to this criterion.</p>
<p class="contents">The new criterion on white pigments therefore allows up to 300 mg per m2 of SOx emissions and up to 20 g per m2 of sulphate wastes. The data available from the awards to 23 producers showed that 90 % of the paints currently bearing the Community eco‐label would also comply with these new values.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission met with representatives of the Titanium Dioxide Manufacturers Association on 18 December to discuss the issue and to explain in more detail the changes and their potential impact.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Commission Decision enters into force on 1 January 1999 and is valid for three years. During this period, particular attention will be paid to consulting the interest groups well in advance on possible future changes. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 63 by <span class="bold">Liam Hyland </span>(H−1208/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Direct payments under EU schemes</span></p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission provide information on the performance of individual Member States in making direct payments under EU schemes, such as Arable Aid, Suckler Cow, Special Beef and Sheep Premiums and will it also provide information on the proportion of funds paid out by each Member State under the various 1998 schemes within one month, two months and three months of their commencement?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">With regard to the first question – namely, the performance of Member States in making direct payments of the relevant aid – the Commission has measured such performance in terms of the payments made by the Member States during the course of the 1998 financial year.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question, regarding the payments made by the Member States during the first three months of each of the aid schemes referred to, requires the production of more detailed figures. The Commission will therefore draw up tables setting out the information requested in the two questions and forward them to the honourable Member separately. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 64 by <span class="bold">Niall Andrews </span>(H−1210/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Homelessness</span></p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission give details of any initiatives it has undertaken at EU level during the course of 1998 aimed at better understanding and alleviating the problem of homelessness, and is it in a position to provide an estimate of the extent of homelessness in the EU, of its concentration in cities, and of those who are most affected?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">Statistics on the number of persons living in precarious housing conditions including homelessness remain weak in most Member States and it is therefore difficult to provide reliable statistics at Community level. European associations such as FEANTSA estimate that approximately 15 million people in the Community live in sub‐standard or overcrowded accommodation and that about 3 million people live without a fixed home of their own. Studies and experience also show that the pattern of homelessness may be changing; although adult men remain the largest group, there are indications that more women, children and young people become homeless.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the current Treaty, the Community has no competence to undertake any initiatives against homelessness. Once ratified however the Amsterdam Treaty will create scope for Community action which supports MS in their efforts to combat all forms of social exclusion, including homelessness.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context it is important to underline that the desirability for Community action in the field of housing from the perspective of social exclusion was reiterated by the Community Housing Ministers in their final communiqué issued on the occasion of their 10th Informal Meeting which was held in Graz from 22‐23 October 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">To help prepare proposals and action in this field, the Commission took the following initiatives during 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">Recognising the importance of reliable indicators and statistics for better understanding and policy making against exclusion, the Commission in close collaboration with national statistical offices in the MS, took the initiative during 1998 to establish a special Task Force on Social Exclusion and Poverty Statistics (TFSEP), involving experts from both Member States and the Commission. Work by the TFSEP led to approval by the Community Statistical Programming Committee at the end of 1998 of a set of recommendations on improving indicators and statistics on social exclusion and poverty in the Community during the coming years. One of the recommendations of the TFSEP draws attention to the importance of strengthening statistical information on persons and groups with a high risk of being excluded from statistical sources, such as the homeless. To follow up this recommendation, the Commission has already organised a first working meeting with FEANTSA to explore the possibilities of improving indicators on homelessness and precarious housing conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Also during 1998, the Commission, under budget lines B3‐4101, B3‐4102 and B3‐4116 gave financial support to NGOs and other civil society organisations active in promoting a better understanding of social exclusion (including homelessness) and in the exchange of best practice in this field. Funding of these measures was undertaken as preparatory action to future Community initiatives in this area once the Treaty of Amsterdam has come into effect. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 65 by <span class="bold">Pat Gallagher </span>(H−1212/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: New initiatives for the textile and clothing industry</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 14 July 1998, the European Parliament adopted a resolution (A−0224/98) on the Commission's plan of action to increase the competitiveness of the European textile and clothing industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission now indicate what action it has taken, or is taking, to follow up the proposals put forward by the European Parliament, with particular regard to the development of new initiatives to promote employment in the industry, especially in SMUs, including those in the less‐favoured regions, and given the high percentage of female employment in the sector and the need to improve or up‐date skills levels?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">1. Further to the action plan, the Commission has drawn up a management chart setting out, inter alia, all the issues relating to the industry's competitiveness, which also cover the concerns expressed by the honourable Member.</p>
<p class="contents">The chart contains details of the various types of action to be taken, the programmes, projects and measures to be implemented or already being implemented, and the various stages and schedules relating thereto.</p>
<p class="contents">These are all practical initiatives to be launched this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The initiatives relating specifically to employment and training will cover inter alia: </p>
<p class="contents">. the transfer of SMUs (by inheritance or other means); <br />. undeclared employment; <br />. social dialogue; <br />. reducing social security contributions (study of impact on the international competitiveness of companies operating in the sector); <br />. versatility and good practice; <br />. an ongoing inventory of vocational training; <br />. foreign trade training programmes for SMUs.</p>
<p class="contents">The instruments to be used to fund these initiatives are also included in the chart. Under the Leonardo II programme, for example, provision is made for an initiative covering an ongoing inventory of vocational training. It is, however, up to the operators themselves to submit projects which will then be considered and selected on the basis of merit.</p>
<p class="contents">The priority initiatives set out in the action plan include the promotion of innovation, the use of new technologies, the consolidation of the textile and clothing industry and vocational training. The companies working in the sector will concentrate on making progress on such issues with the help of the public authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">2. The economic and social impact of job losses in the sector must be taken carefully into account in the Community's employment policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures and guidelines laid down with a view inter alia to providing support for innovative companies in the follow‐up to the Amsterdam, Luxembourg and (most recently) Vienna European Councils and all concerted employment policy initiatives taken by the Member States must take the sector's special needs into account.</p>
<p class="contents">3. The Commission is particularly sensitive to the issue of female employment in the textile and clothing industry. The clothing sector in particular is highly labour‐intensive, with women accounting for more than 70 % of the workforce. Such jobs are sometimes concentrated in areas with no alternative industries, are low‐skilled and are in direct competition with jobs in low‐wage economies. Women therefore suffer most from competition from non‐Community countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1994 the Commission conducted a survey of the clothing industry's skill requirements. A similar survey of the textile sector is also planned. The clothing industry survey found that, in order to remain competitive with low‐wage economies, European industry must base its strategy on enhancing added value, flexibility and responding effectively and swiftly to the needs of an increasingly globalised market. The use of new technologies must also be stepped up.</p>
<p class="contents">New qualifications, linked to the use of information technology, an improved understanding of the market and versatility, can improve the situation of women working in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is convinced that there is an urgent need to support all vocational training measures aimed at women working in SMUs and in less‐favoured regions, with a view to adjusting to and even getting ahead of technological progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The priority which the Commission has accorded to female employment is reflected in the Structural Funds and will be a feature of all new Community programmes. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 66 by <span class="bold">James Fitzsimons </span>(H−1214/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Facilitating access for SMUs to markets, credit and cross‐border investment</span></p>
<p class="contents">As the Commission is no doubt aware, European Economic Interest Groupings can help SMUs to exploit the opportunities of the single market, to open up national procurement markets and to increase transnational cooperation. However, the rate of use of EEIGs by SMUs is low.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the Commission now doing to enable SMUs to exploit market opportunities to the full, including access to public procurement markets, access to credit and instruments for encouraging cross‐border investment?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the opinion of the honourable Member of the importance of the European Economic Interest Grouping for the Europeanisation of SMEs, which so far have not yet seized all the opportunities stemming from the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Whereas the share of SMEs in employment and turnover is between 60 and 70 %, trade and foreign direct investment with other Member States and third countries is largely dominated by large businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Economic Interest Grouping is a very useful instrument to help SMEs to access more easily to the markets of other Member States and in particular the public procurement markets. The European Economic Interest Grouping allows SMEs: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ to pool their knowledge about foreign markets, very often with one member having long experience with those markets and the public authorities; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ to share their limited financial resources; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ to reduce the entry costs to new markets; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ to build on the linguistic capabilities of a partner, which facilitates communication with clients from the private and public sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission regrets that the European Economic Interest Groupings have not yet received the success they deserve and that the number so far created falls far below expectation.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to promote the EEIG, the Commission will publish shortly a practical handbook on the EEIGs in all working languages of the EU, containing a model contract, so that entrepreneurs may better understand the advantages of the EEIG.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to allow SMEs to take better advantage of the single market and facilitate the creation of transnational Joint ventures by SMEs within the Community, the European Commission created in November 1997 the Joint European Venture (JEV) Programme. This programme then became one of the three facilities of the European Growth and Employment Initiative, which was prepared on request by the European Parliament and adopted by the Council (Decision 98/347/98) on measures of financial assistance for innovative and job‐creating SMEs. This three‐year programme has earmarked EUR 80‐100 million for JEV. JEV is run by a network of 80 financial intermediaries and therefore also accessible for SMEs in the regions. This network is open‐ended and the Commission hopes that new financial intermediaries will join it.</p>
<p class="contents">Under JEV the Commission cofinances feasibility studies and provides a 10 % investment support up to a maximum of EUR 100 000 per project.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in addition to the first‐stop‐shop network (Euro‐Info‐Centre) and partner search instruments such as BC‐Net, BRE, INTERPRISE workshops, EUROPARTENARIAT and IBEX events, the Community has now an operational instrument to support cross‐border investments of SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">If the conditions of the above‐mentioned Council Decision are met, then SMEs who want to create a European Economic Interest Grouping which will have to be operational for at least five years, can introduce a request for support to one of the members of the financial intermediary network.</p>
<p class="contents">SMEs wishing to establish a transnational joint venture face particular difficulties with regard to access to finance, as banks do not have sufficient information about the quality of the foreign partners and consider a joint venture to be of higher risk. Therefore the JEV network of financial intermediaries helps SMEs to have easier access to finance as support under JEV allows to prepare better business plans.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the public procurement markets in other Member States it is well known that those markets are very difficult for SMEs and only the best SMEs which know already the private markets of those Member States have a real chance to get a contract. It should be noted that the Commission, in its Communication on Public Procurement in the European Union (COM(98)143 of 11 March 1998), has already proposed a set of measures aimed at the development of a favourable environment for businesses, and in particular SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning access to credit, the introduction of the euro will increase the chances of SMEs to get more easily a loan from banks established in other Member States. However, given the diversity of bank traditions and cultures each bank applies risk assessment methods which are quite diverse, and the credit rating of SMEs by independent rating agencies is still too expensive.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of the 3rd Round Table of Bankers and SMEs launched in October 1998, the Commission encourages the exchange of best experiences in the field of access to credits for business creators, women entrepreneurs and young entrepreneurs. In addition to loan financing, also access to equity such as business angels, seed capital and venture capital will be considered. The results will be available in November 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it should be added that under the abovementioned Growth and Employment initiative, the Council has reserved EUR 320 million for a start‐up facility and an SME guarantee facility. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 67 by <span class="bold">James Nicholson </span>(H−1219/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: SPARD Capital Grants Scheme</span></p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware that the United Kingdom Government has decided against reopening the SPARD Capital Grants Scheme to applications, with the result that the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland is unable to receive £7.5 million of European funds, and what is the Commission's view of the implications of this decision?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission is fully aware of the decision of the United Kingdom Government not to re‐open the SPARD Capital Grants Scheme to further applications. This matter has been discussed in the relevant Working Committee and the Monitoring Committee for the Single Programming Document 1994‐1999 for Northern Ireland, where the Commission has expressed disappointment that the commitment entered into in the SPD cannot be honoured. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 68 by <span class="bold">Charlotte Cederschiöld </span>(H−1221/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Human rights</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is stated in the Treaty of Amsterdam that the development of an area of freedom, security and justice will be one of the EU's next objectives. There should be a body to which members of the public who feel that their human rights are being violated can take their grievances. Appeals via national legal authorities and the European Court of Justice take a long time, and the Ombudsman cannot alter that fact. A proposal has been submitted for a European authority which does not have a general supervisory role but is able to give the public advance notice if it is likely that a Member State, through certain of its actions, will violate human rights. The filing of 5000 reports against Sweden recently resulted in an inquiry into the legal situation. The legal shortcomings became clear, and Commissioner Wulf‐Mathies pointed out in plenary that the Community's powers in this area were not adequate.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission consider that members of the public should be given greater opportunity to have their basic human rights situation reviewed and, if so, how?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The question raised by the honourable Member concerns the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which is currently being ratified. In the meantime, the Commission is studying ways of ensuring its implementation when the time comes. It shall not fail to communicate the option chosen at the appropriate time. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 69 by <span class="bold">Jean Querbes </span>(H−1228/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Postponement of the abolition of intra‐Community duty‐free shopping</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 19 May 1998 the Council confirmed that the decision it took in 1991 to abolish intra‐Community duty‐free shopping would indeed be implemented on 1 July 1999. All the studies that have been carried out highlight the very large number of job losses which will result from the abolition of duty‐free shopping in airports and on ferries. In France, for example, more than 12 000 jobs would disappear in regions where unemployment levels are already very high.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission prepared to draw the appropriate conclusions from these impact studies and to propose to the Council that the actual implementation of the decision abolishing intra‐Community duty‐free sales should be postponed?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission has received quite a number of studies relating to the impact that the abolition of duty‐free shopping will have on jobs. These studies all reach very different conclusions, according to whether they were issued by the lobby group concerned or by other, more neutral, bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council has just called on the Commission and the ECOFIN Council to examine, by March, the problems that the abolition of intra‐Community duty‐free shopping could pose for employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does indeed intend to respond to this invitation and, once it has examined the situation, it will submit its conclusions to the ECOFIN Council. As the examination has not yet been completed it would be premature to comment on the result. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 70 by <span class="bold">Antoinette Spaak </span>(H−1233/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Installation of an incinerator</span></p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware of the fact that the Flanders Region, which has responsibility for environmental matters in Belgium, is planning to install a waste incineration unit on the edge of the Brussels Region?</p>
<p class="contents">Under European law, is it possible for such a unit to be installed so close to the most densely populated part of the country?</p>
<p class="contents">Has the Commission received (and, if so, has it replied to) any communication from the Brussels regional government?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission has received several complaints in relation to this incinerator and is aware of the decision taken in this matter by the competent Belgian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Having been informed of these complaints, the Commission intends to examine the case in January 1999 and will decide whether it would be appropriate to initiate proceedings against Belgium for violation of Article 169 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Brussels Region has the opportunity, as does any other natural or legal person, to lodge a complaint with the Commission, if it considers that it has to draw the Commission"s attention to a possible violation of Community law. In such case, it would have the right, like any other plaintiff, to confidentiality. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 71 by <span class="bold">Jens‐Peter Bonde </span>(H−1235/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Early retirement pension in Denmark</span></p>
<p class="contents">Is the new Danish early retirement pension scheme consistent with the Commission's understanding of Community law?</p>
<p class="contents">Will it be possible for wage earners who have paid contributions to the new scheme to transfer those contributions to an early retirement insurance scheme in another country? Will it also be possible to receive payment pro rata of the state's contribution to the early retirement pension if one has made a total of 25 years' contributions to an unemployment fund and/or an early retirement pension scheme in another Member State?</p>
<p class="contents">If one has paid 25 years' contributions in Denmark, is it possible to have the early retirement pension paid in another Member State and, if so, have it taxed in a new country of residence?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member has asked a question which relates to the compatibility of Denmark"s revised early retirement pension scheme (’efterløn") with Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the information at the disposal of the Commission, any person has the right to receive a Danish early retirement pension from the age of 60, provided that person has contributed to the Danish unemployment scheme for at least 20 out of the last 25 years (or 10 out of the last 15 years if that person was born before 1 March 1992 and has been affiliated to a Danish unemployment organisation for the period from 31 March 1992 up to the age of entitlement to the pension) and provided that person resides in Denmark.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has received a number of complaints from citizens of Member States who have worked in Denmark and have been refused payment of this pension on the grounds that either they were no longer resident in Denmark, or they did not fulfil the conditions relating to the minimum insurance period in Denmark.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this benefit does not fall within the scope of Regulation 1408/71, the Commission is currently looking into whether it is consistent with Community law that this benefit cannot be exported and that the principle of aggregation is not applied in granting this benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has sent a letter to the Danish Government in which it asks for further information and for its comments on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently examining the reply received from the Danish authorities and will keep the honourable Member informed of the action it intends to take in response to this. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 72 by <span class="bold">Inger Schörling </span>(H−1237/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: ECHELON</span></p>
<p class="contents">One of the subjects discussed during a debate in Parliament on 14 September was the ECHELON surveillance system. The Commission said on that occasion that it had no knowledge of the existence of ECHELON. It would, therefore, be valuable to know what emerged during the Council meeting on justice and home affairs of 3‐4 December 1998, particularly with regard to covert listening and monitoring of telecommunications and how that relates to ENFOPOL 98, 10951/98 and 10951/1/98 REV 1 amending the Council resolution of 17 January 1995<a href="#def_1_12" name="ref_1_12"><sup>(12)</sup></a> .</p>
<p class="contents">Why does the Commission not find it appropriate to discuss these matters openly with Parliament, particularly in view of the fact that they concern the individual's right to a private life and that any agreements concluded may be in direct conflict with Member States' national legislation?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">As far as the Commission is concerned, the honourable Member is referred to the answers to written questions E−1039/98 from Mrs Van Dijk, E−1040/98 from Mrs Van Dijk, E−1306/98 from Ms Muscardini and others, E−1429/98 from Ms Raschhofer, E−1776/98 from Mr Manisco, E−1987/98 from Mr Kaklamanis and oral question H−1067/98 from Ms McKenna. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 73 by <span class="bold">Maj Theorin </span>(H−1240/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Afghanistan</span></p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost I should like to express my appreciation of the Commissioner's commitment to the cause of women in Afghanistan. The situation is dreadful and untenable and the Union must demonstrate in practical terms that we do not accept what is happening in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier this year I asked the Commission what measures it intended to take in support of the women of Afghanistan. The Commission replied that Community aid would be seriously reviewed if there was no improvement very soon. No such improvement has occurred and I would, therefore, ask in what way Community aid has now been altered and whether the Commission considers that these measures are sufficient?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">Since the honourable Member's question H−0660/98 in July 1998, to which she refers, and as she indicates in her present question, there has been no identifiable improvement in the overall situation in Afghanistan or in the policies of the Taliban towards the treatment of women.</p>
<p class="contents">This has indeed resulted in the rethinking of Community aid policies towards Afghanistan as set out in the Commission's reply to the Member's earlier question. This action has been carried out in the context of a similar policy review by the international donor community within the Afghan Support Group, which includes Member States, other bilateral donors, EC and concerned UN agencies with a view to arriving at coherent concerted policies on aid delivery in the current circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the deterioration of working conditions in Kabul, the Commission has decided to suspend all its programmes to the city until the authorities allow NGOs to work in a principled manner and to deliver aid without any discrimination. In the meantime, aid continues in rural areas, but is administered in the country by local Afghan partners, on a temporary basis. As far as the Commission is concerned, a few winter relief and medical programmes are being implemented in Hazarajat and the North, with expatriates.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is continuing to monitor the situation in Afghanistan closely through the EC Delegation in Islamabad and the EC Coordination Office in Peshawar, Pakistan. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 74 by <span class="bold">Sören Wibe </span>(H−1241/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Trade war between EU and USA</span></p>
<p class="contents">A number of small and medium‐sized firms in Sweden will be affected by the trade war between the Union and the USA. It is particularly harsh given that Sweden wanted no part in this conflict as our trade policy on bananas caused no problems at all with the WTO before Sweden became a Member State of the Union. A settlement must be reached soon. The trade war is causing unemployment to rise in Sweden.</p>
<p class="contents">Are there any plans to compensate those firms – in Sweden, for example – that will be affected by the USA's 100 % penalty tariffs? Is there are possibility of Sweden being able to opt out of the Union's quota scheme for bananas and thereby escape the USA's trade reprisals?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Commission is making every effort possible to avoid any US sanctions from entering into force. The Commission considers that the Community has faithfully implemented the recommendations of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body in the bananas case by taking the necessary measures to bring the EC banana regime into conformity with WTO rules. The WTO conformity of these implementing measures is, as for any trade measures, open to examination by a WTO panel. In absence of any condemnation by a WTO panel of those measures, it is our view that any US request to the Dispute Settlement Body for authorisation to suspend concessions against the EC is inadmissible. The measures proposed by the US are therefore unilateral actions outside the WTO rules.</p>
<p class="contents">There are no plans, at least not at the level of the European Commission, to compensate European firms that would be affected by a possible US suspension of concessions in respect of EC exports. Whether any such plans exist at the level of the Member States is not known to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no legal possibility for Sweden to opt out of the Community regime for the imports of bananas. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 75 by <span class="bold">Ioannis Theonas </span>(H−1242/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Plans to build and operate a nuclear power station in Akkuyu in Turkey</span></p>
<p class="contents">Plans to build and operate a nuclear power station in Akkuyu in Turkey are causing particular concern among the Eastern Mediterranean peoples. The chief danger arises from the major risk of earth tremors but also in connection with the management of effluent and the use of the plutonium produced. These fears are leading to increased doubts regarding the advisability of investment in this project, given that, according to official information released by the Turkish authorities, the cost, compared with the expected benefit, will be particularly high, since the projected power station is expected to supply only 2 to 3 % of the country's future energy needs. In addition, the project runs directly counter to the current of opinion at international level, questioning the advisability of nuclear power stations and leading to the shutting down of many of them, including eight in Canada, which use the same technology as the power station being proposed in Turkey, together with others in Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">What steps will the Commission take to end the projected construction and operation of the nuclear power station in Akkuyu, which would endanger the surrounding area and infringe international commitments concerning the protection of the environment and public health from dangers arising from the use of nuclear energy?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The plan to build the nuclear power station in Akkuyu aims to respond to the growing demand for civilian energy that has been forecast in Turkey for the years to come. The start of energy production is forecast for the year 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">In its first regular report on Turkey"s progress towards accession, which was adopted on 4 November 1998, the Commission pointed out that the construction of nuclear power stations in Turkey should enable bottlenecks to be removed and should promote diversification of energy sources. It also pointed out in the same report that the decision to build the nuclear power station in Akkuyu would require an evaluation of the possible repercussions in relation to the existence of an earthquake zone relatively close to the chosen site.</p>
<p class="contents">The information gathered by the Commission points to the fact that the Akkuyu site was chosen by the Turkish authorities after in‐depth seismic, geological and environmental studies were carried out by specialised departments at several Turkish universities.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, the contractual framework of relations between the Community and Turkey does not permit the Commission to cooperate with Turkey in matters of nuclear energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the European Commission does not have the competence to participate in the selection of nuclear sites. It is the Turkish authorities and, in particular, the ‘Turkish Atomic Energy Authority" (TAEA) who are responsible for making the selection, within the guidelines of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, this project concerns power stations built outside the territory of the Community, therefore the Community directives obviously do not apply.</p>
<p class="contents">In its communication on a European strategy in support of Turkey, adopted on 4 March 1998, the Commission put forward a proposal for cooperation in environmental matters, in order to set in motion sustainable development in this country and to include this sector in the other economic policies. Such cooperation would entail intervention on the part of the Community budget. On 21 October the Commission adopted two proposals for regulations to allow financial support for the European strategy. The Commission hopes that the budgetary authority can approve these proposals in as short a time as possible. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 76 by <span class="bold">Vassilis Ephremidis </span>(H−1244/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Protection of the Sounion historic park</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Sounion historic park, covering an area of 750 hectares is being threatened by property development turning it into a summer resort, and resulting in unauthorised building activities. In addition to providing a vital green belt within Attiki, an area which suffers from severe environmental pollution, this national park is an historic site containing archaeological remains and in particular the famous temple of Poseidon on Sounion promontory.</p>
<p class="contents">Has the Commission provided funding for programmes seeking to restore and preserve Sounion park and will it take more necessary measures to protect it? What steps will it take to prevent property development in this area?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The Sounion National Park (SNP) covers the biggest part of a Site of Community Importance proposed by the Hellenic authorities, according to Directive 92/43/EEC<a href="#def_1_13" name="ref_1_13"><sup>(13)</sup></a> , to be included in the European ecological network Natura 2000. This site hosts a number of priority habitats and species and, therefore, any activity that could seriously affect its integrity should be avoided in view of its future inclusion into the Natura 2000 network.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has not provided so far any specific funding for nature conservation purposes in the SNP. The protection of that site from any potentially harmful activities, including property development, falls within the responsibility of Hellenic competent authorities which should ensure that its conservation value is maintained. The Commission could intervene in case of a clear breach of Community legislation. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 77 by <span class="bold">Mihail Papayannakis </span>(H−1245/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Greek ‘health and welfare' optional operational programme</span></p>
<p class="contents">In view of existing shortcomings concerning hospital equipment and inadequate infrastructures for the development of training programmes for medical personnel under the existing health‐care system, can the Commission say what have been the take‐up rates to date for each of the five measures under the health sub‐programme?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The take‐up rate of Community appropriations under the ‘health and welfare" operational programme (OP) currently stands at 62 % in terms of commitments and 40 % in terms of payments as a proportion of the total budget of the Structural Funds (EUR 225 million) which was agreed for the period 1994‐1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Public spending within the Community, as declared to the Commission, for the entire OP up to 25 September 1998, was EUR 63.824 million.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the five measures of the single ‘health" sub‐programme is concerned, the following amounts were declared: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ Measure 1, basic infrastructure and equipment: EUR 43.390 million</p>
<p class="contents">‐ Measure 2, infrastructure for research: EUR 1.714 million</p>
<p class="contents">‐ Measure 3, emergency medicine: EUR 8.427 million</p>
<p class="contents">‐ Measure 4, information systems: EUR 1.088 million</p>
<p class="contents">‐ Measure 5, blood collection: EUR 0.228 million</p>
<p class="contents">Question No 78 by <span class="bold">John Cushnahan </span>(H−1247/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Riding helmet standards</span></p>
<p class="contents">Has the Working Group 5 on standards met to discuss the safety issues relating to equestrian helmets, with particular reference to document N326, as requested by Parliament's Petitions Committee?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">Given that helmets for equestrian activities are items of personal protective equipment covered by Directive 89/686/EEC, the Commission instructed the CEN to draw up a harmonised standard indicating compliance with the basic health and safety requirements laid down in that Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The resulting standard – EN 1384, 'Helmets for equestrian activities' – was adopted in September 1996 and its reference was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities of 14 June 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would point out that, while all helmets must meet the requirements laid down in the Directive, implementation of which is compulsory, manufacturers are not obliged to comply with standards, which are always of a voluntary nature.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Downes submitted a petition seeking to improve the safety of riding helmets, with particular reference to the protection afforded by standard EN 1384, which he considers inadequate. The Commission fully supports this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Although standards are drawn up by European standardisation bodies, which are private organisations to which the Commission may not give orders, it expressly asked CEN/TC 158, which is responsible for this standard, to review at the earliest opportunity the requirements laid down for riding helmets.</p>
<p class="contents">The CEN/TC 158 technical committee and its working group agreed that there was a need to improve the standard for helmets for equestrian activities and took immediate action towards this end.</p>
<p class="contents">Specialised working group CEN/TC 158 WG 5 met on 14 October 1998 to consider the substance of the standard on the basis of document CEN/TC 158 N 326, to which the honourable Member's question refers. The petitioner and Mr Costello, who drew up that document, attended the meeting. The next meeting is to be held on 3 March 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is monitoring the standardisation work extremely closely with a view to ensuring that a solution acceptable to all is found in the form of a helmet which affords riders greater protection. </p>
<p class="contents">Question No 79 by <span class="bold">Konstantinos Hatzidakis </span>(H−1249/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Failure to bring Greek law into line with Community directives on the liberalisation of telecommunications</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Greek Government has failed to incorporate into its legislation the following directives concerning the liberalisation of telecommunications: 95/62/EC<a href="#def_1_14" name="ref_1_14"><sup>(14)</sup></a> , 97/13/EC<a href="#def_1_15" name="ref_1_15"><sup>(15)</sup></a> , 97/33/EC<a href="#def_1_16" name="ref_1_16"><sup>(16)</sup></a> and 95/51/EC<a href="#def_1_17" name="ref_1_17"><sup>(17)</sup></a> and has incorporated only in part the following directives: 97/51/EC<a href="#def_1_18" name="ref_1_18"><sup>(18)</sup></a> , 90/388/EC<a href="#def_1_19" name="ref_1_19"><sup>(19)</sup></a> , 96/2/EC<a href="#def_1_20" name="ref_1_20"><sup>(20)</sup></a> and 96/19/EC<a href="#def_1_21" name="ref_1_21"><sup>(21)</sup></a> . As a result of this delay, the Commission has suspended Community funding for the ‘telecommunications' operational programme. Can the Commission say what are the consequences for Greek consumers of the failure of Greece to comply with the above directives and what additional measures will the relevant Community authorities take if Greece fails to comply on time with Community directives?</p><span class="italic"> Answer</span>
<p class="contents">The objective of the liberalisation and harmonisation directives is to open markets to competition and to create the conditions for the establishment of a single European telecommunications market. As stated in the Commission's Fourth Report on the implementation of the telecommunications regulatory package, adopted on 25 November 1998<a href="#def_1_22" name="ref_1_22"><sup>(22)</sup></a> , this is intended on the one hand to contribute to growth and employment, and on the other to provide users and consumers with a wider choice of service providers, improved quality of service, an opportunity to take advantage of the development of new technologies, and the benefit of lower tariffs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that, given the delays in Greece in implementing in particular the directives on interconnection, licensing, voice telephony and leased lines, and to a certain extent those relating to the liberalisation of telecommunications markets, consumers in Greece are deprived of the full benefit of the advantages referred to above.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has consistently stressed, not least in the Fourth Report, that it will act where Member States fail to take the necessary measures to implement the telecommunications directives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Justice has to date delivered one judgment against Greece for failure to implement; there are currently five proceedings ongoing in respect of the harmonisation directives and three in respect of the liberalisation directives. </p>
