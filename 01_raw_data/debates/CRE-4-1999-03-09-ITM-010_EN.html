<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brittan, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. ‐</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since I last spoke about this topic on 10 February this year, several new developments have taken place. On 15 February the WTO General Council discussed the EC request for an authoritative interpretation that a member cannot be authorised to suspend concessions in the absence of any WTO ruling on the conformity of the measures complained of. Most WTO members who spoke supported our position on this and rejected unilateralism. However, because of a widespread reluctance on the part of other members to vote on this, we opted for a chairman's conclusion registering the prevailing sentiment in the General Council.</p>
<p class="contents">On 2 March we obtained the establishment of a panel against the United States' section 301 legislation. As you know, this legislation is the domestic legal base for the United States' unilateral threats and actions in the banana case. This panel will start its work shortly. Also on 2 March, the arbitrators, who had been appointed to examine whether the US proposed level of concessions of $520 million is equivalent to the level of nullification or impairment, rendered an initial decision. This decision states very clearly – as we had argued all along – that it is not possible for the arbitrators to set any level of concessions in the absence of an examination of the WTO conformity of the revised banana regime. This point of principle is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">The arbitrators also ruled that the 60‐day time limit from the end of the reasonable period for amending the regime which the US had claimed to be all‐determinant is, in fact, not a decisive factor. This removes any excuse from the United States to claim a right to take sanctions at the expiry of the 60‐day period. Finally, the arbitrators also gave a clear indication that the American estimate of damage will at least have to be reduced by the amount of indirect damage they have wrongly claimed which should, in any event, reduce the total damage by half. The arbitrators have requested further information from the European Union and the US by 15 March and their final ruling is expected shortly after that.</p>
<p class="contents">Notwithstanding this initial ruling, the US decided on 3 March to impose sanctions effective as of that date against over $500m of European imports. These sanctions take the form of withholding liquidation and subjecting imports to a contingent liability of 100 % duties to be imposed retroactively. This is not just a provisional measure to preserve US rights. Its real intent and effect is to stop all imports of the products in question immediately. The United States has admitted as much. From information we have received from European industry this is exactly what seems to have occurred. This action is a blatant defiance of WTO rules which explicitly prohibit the suspension of concessions while arbitration is still taking place.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission reacted immediately by asking on the same day for urgent dispute settlement consultations with the United States. This will permit us to request a further panel on this issue after 20 days. The Commission also requested a special General Council meeting. That took place on 8 March. The United States' behaviour was strongly criticised by most WTO members. The position of the European Union as agreed with Member States is that our own reaction should be in conformity with the WTO rules. We do not intend to follow the American approach of taking unilateral and illegal action. The WTO procedures will inevitably lead to a condemnation of current US behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, the panels launched by Ecuador and the EC regarding the WTO conformity of the revised EC banana regime are due to issue their rulings on 12 April. In parallel we continue to be willing to pursue our discussions with the United States on the substance of the banana regime. With a view to exploring the American position and the possibilities of solving the problem, the Commission has, at the request of the Member States, entered into informal discussions with Washington. We have made it very clear to the United States, however, that any ideas for resolving the dispute must take into account the rights and economic well‐being of the ACP countries. We have not been negotiating but are continuing to explore the US position.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, our approach is two‐fold. Firstly, we will resolutely oppose American unilateralism and take all steps available to us in the WTO system to see to it that this behaviour is condemned and that action flowing from that condemnation can be taken if necessary. Secondly, it is important to stress that we will find out shortly from the WTO dispute settlement system whether or not our current amended banana regime complies with the WTO rules and, to the extent that it does not, we will have to put our house in order. This dispute must not be allowed to fester and we will continue to strive urgently to resolve it. But Europe will not stand by while the world's trade rules are flouted.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Mann, Erika </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Sir Leon, this is the second time this year that the European Parliament is reacting to the current transatlantic trade dispute about bananas. Sir Leon has just described the background very accurately. The dispute is becoming increasingly bitter and is beginning to look like a trade war. It is becoming more and more absurd and putting the credibility of the WTO and its procedures as a whole at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union put a new and revised banana regime in place on 1 January 1999. It did so after the WTO decided that the previous regime was not in conformity with WTO rules. The USA continues to doubt whether even this new, revised complies with WTO rules. That is its right. But it is not within its rights to pronounce unilateral trade sanctions in the form of punitive tariffs directed against the companies of its transatlantic partner. This conflicts in every respect with the spirit of the World Trade Organisation and therefore means a breach of the WTO rules, in particular Articles 1, 2 and 22. In so doing the United States is placing itself outside the multilateral legal system. Sanctions may not be imposed before the conclusion of the arbitration procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">My group supports the Commission"s negotiating position. We support the Commission"s statement that our side will not impose unilateral measures and we want to remain in conformity with WTO rules. However, we certainly believe it would be sensible to keep all the options open.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me at this point appeal to our American colleagues in the Congress and the Senate. It is especially important that the transatlantic partnership, and in particular the economic partnership that we have approved, prove themselves in times of crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">However much sympathy I have for national interests, however much sympathy I have for the desire to make up the American trade deficit, these must not put the very fragile WTO rules at risk. It is rather ironic that the EU‐USA parliamentary delegation will, we hope, be holding its first video conference this week at which it will be discussing and also organising closer political coordination and management of the transatlantic dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we should jointly discuss how we can strengthen a common world organisation and ensure that we do not unilaterally put it at risk by playing on national interests.</p>

The European People"s Party also finds that the USA has quite clearly breached the WTO rules. But that does not necessarily mean we know what will happen next. We are familiar with the Americans" political rules of play; the US Administration feels under pressure from Congress, and rather like the case of the Helms‐Burton Act, it no longer pays any heed to the rules of international law but seeks instead ways of defending itself from within, which is presumably how we should regard the imposition of unilateral sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me point out quite firmly that we would be well‐advised – even if we are in the right with the second part – not to forget that the panel, that the WTO, will probably only find conditionally in our favour on the main issue. That happens to be the way things go in international law, which is why I would advise the Commission, on behalf of the European People"s Party, to do all it can to explore further in the discussions – which Sir Leon described as informal – with the US Administration where there are possibilities of resolving the conflict, rather than leaving it to the final WTO decision, if only because we will be facing an incredible number of points of conflict with the USA in the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">If we believe we have to win this time, we will be the losers in other cases where there might be a willingness to compromise. That is why we, who all supported and wanted the WTO, urge that it not be regarded merely as a pawn in the conflict of interests between the USA and Europe.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Moorhouse </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – Mr President, the quarrel between the USA and the EU runs very deep. It is no longer merely a question of bananas but threatens to affect EU/US trade on a much wider scale. More than that, it could conceivably affect the very future of the WTO and tip the balance away from free trade to protectionism.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said in a letter to the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> this very day, it is a great misfortune that European Union political leaders, including the UK Prime Minister, Mr Blair, I regret to say, have failed to heed the many warning signals and failed to grasp the nettle with the Americans at a much earlier stage. For that and many other reasons we support the motion for a resolution.</p>

<p class="contents">At the same time, the European Parliament warned of the need for the European Union to make plans to retaliate against the US decision. Despite our appeals the Americans have carried out their threats. The Commission should not accept this situation and must react against this blatant provocation which to my mind is typically imperialistic. It must block all transatlantic economic partnership negotiations, protest against the Helms‐Burton and D'Amato Acts as the European Parliament has already demanded, and block access by all American products to European markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States has shown that it holds negotiations in contempt. We have to take action rather than insisting on an approach that is clearly not being respected. The Commission must also reassert its commitment to defend Community law and to fulfill its obligations towards the ACP countries and Community banana producers. The Commission must also tell the United States that it will not let it undermine the European Union's social and employment policies or try and jeopardise public health and the environment in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commission and all the Member States, without exception, must tell the United States that the tactic of divide and rule is an ancient one but is well known to us Europeans and will not work with the European Union.</p>

Fiercer world competition is forcing the protagonists to take a clear and tough position. But the US, in threatening a trade boycott, is overstepping the bounds of that clear position and the bounds of the transatlantic partnership. The boycott is illegal until such time as the WTO panel has given its verdict and it is politically unacceptable, coming at a time when we have just concluded our economic partnership. This uncompromising attitude undermines the authority and rules of the WTO, poses a major problem for the next ‘millennium round" of talks due to begin in December in Seattle, and will not least be harmful – if the US gets its way – to British exporters above all. Once again, none of the parties, least of all the Caribbean banana producers, have anything to gain from a trade war.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Brittan has played a leading role in the debate on world free trade. According to today"s <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> , your swan song could turn out to be bananas – because we shall hear it one day when you step down. But I doubt it, because in recent years you have dealt with all manner of trade issues. So I ask you, where do we go from here? Do we wait for the ruling of the WTO panel? Are Washington and Brussels going to talk, or is the EU going to pay the US back in the same coin? And if so, what coin will that be?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Kreissl‐Dörfler </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, it is with bananas of all things that the USA is currently making huge efforts to dismantle the WTO. Just because Bill Clinton promised the US Congress in autumn 1998 to impose punitive tariffs on 3 March, the WTO rules were bent and broken. But in fact this will go on happening even after the banana dispute: in May there will the ban on meat with hormones, next will come genetically modified food.</p>
<p class="contents">The USA announced and began this massive campaign for free trade a long time ago, without regard for human health or the environment. But just to appeal to one"s adversary to be reasonable really is not enough. What we must remember is that the USA is overruling the legislation in force. We must not go on negotiating considerately with opponents of this kind because, Sir Leon, that is precisely the way to further undermine the credibility of the WTO. The dispute must be settled by the WTO and until that happens all other negotiations with the USA should be suspended. Here I am thinking in particular of the TEP and the preparations for the millennium round.</p>

But we learned from the press – if they are correct – that both parties in America get substantial donations from the three big banana companies. That makes the situation even worse.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, one wonders why they are so greedy as they seem to have 40 % of the EU bananas and the Caribbean only 9 %. They seem to be prepared to write off the Third World. I am glad that Commissioner Brittan mentioned the ACP. Why is it that we have been in Lomé all these years? We have always had this commitment of access to our markets. Why now? It is a most puzzling matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I represent Moray where there is a big cashmere mill. Along with mills on the borders, a fragile area, they are losing orders of £1 million. Commissioner Brittan should know this. I heard it on Friday. Even before the event, orders are being cut down and people are being put out of jobs. I also have the shortbread biscuits. So I feel that in the north of Scotland, at any rate, any claim of a special relationship will be treated with some considerable derision.</p>

The banana regime may have doubly adverse effects on the people and therefore on the consumers, in Austria for example. Since its accession to the European Union, banana prices have risen steeply. In a country with a continental climate, this hits the so‐called man in the street, who relies heavily on bananas for his fresh fruit supplies in winter, particularly hard.</p>
<p class="contents">I realise that is not the issue today. But if as a result of possible protective tariffs against European exports, our exports to the USA, our most important overseas market, were to fall, that could lead to bankruptcies and massive redundancies. In view of the extremely difficult situation on the European labour market, the Commission should therefore take a more pragmatic stance on this question, which unlike the case of meat with hormones does not involve health considerations, in order to prevent the dispute from escalating.</p>

It must attempt at one and the same time to defend its own legitimate interests and those of its ACP partners, and to prevent the escalation of a trade war consisting of reprisals on both sides, which could severely damage Europe's political, economic and commercial interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The appropriate forum for the settlement of this dispute is the World Trade Organisation. It was the WTO which condemned the previous rules on banana imports and sales in the EU. The decision of the WTO ‘banana panel' was what made the Union move its own goalposts. The onus is now on the WTO, to which the United States has again appealed concerning the new European regime, to issue an unequivocal condemnation of the illegal, unilateral steps taken by the American administration.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States is now triggering a fully‐fledged trade war, which could do serious damage not only to vital export sectors in the Community – and particularly in Italy – but also to transatlantic relations in general.</p>
<p class="contents">Although there is no doubt that the commercial interests of the US and the EU differ – indeed in the near future they will conflict increasingly – what seems unacceptable is that the Union should submit to WTO rulings even when they are clearly biased, as in the case of bananas, but that the United States should flout them at will.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, this situation strengthens our conviction that, in the new age of globalisation, the European countries' interests very often converge with those of many developing countries, especially the ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union must therefore take steps, both bilaterally, multilaterally and within international organisations, to stand shoulder to shoulder with the poorest countries more often, beginning with the ACP countries, to give us greater strength to face the challenges confronting us.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Elles </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr President, it is astonishing that we are confronted by a dispute about a product of which neither the EU nor the US is a major producer. Intemperate comments are the order of the day. One has the cynical feeling that in the United States the degree of intensity of their comments perhaps depends on the degree of lobbying which they have had from, as one speaker said, the three companies which control over 80 % of the world banana trade.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to congratulate the acts that have been taken so far by the Commissioner on our behalf and, in particular, to look after our European interests in the context of the WTO and to make sure that the solution is fair to ACP producers.</p>
<p class="contents">In <span class="italic">The Times</span> today a comment sums it up for me: ‘Justice, fairness, mutual global responsibility should outweigh lumbering regulation. Chiquita and the rest do not depend desperately on that last little slice of the European market. The Caribbean producers do. If big producers can sleep easy at night after fighting this ignoble cause of the day, the same should not be true of responsible world leaders.".</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, secondly, in the light of the fact that the EU and the US are the leaders of the global economy, we should now see an initiative at presidency level: of that of the head of the EU presidency with President Clinton to make sure that the proper procedures in the WTO are followed and to lessen some of the rising political impact of this conflict which could become very dangerous.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it seems to me that there is a lesson for our longer‐term transatlantic partnership. We can invent any dialogue that we like or an economic partnership, but unless you get the political communities buying into this system with a broader partnership agreement between the EU and the US so that we can, as politicians, not talk by video conference but actually have a deeper dialogue between the two sides of the Atlantic, then the situation will not improve. I therefore urge the German presidency to take whatever initiative is necessary in the Bonn EU/US summit in June.</p>

The United States of America is advancing with a ‘Colt" 301 at its hip whereas Sir Leon Brittan is advancing with his hands behind his back prattling on about the law. This banana dispute is definitely revealing the hidden truth about Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe represents a union of great strength, yet we have been giving way on this issue for three years. Europe represents cooperation with Africa, yet we are abandoning Cameroon and the Côte d"Ivoire. Europe represents the ultra‐peripheral regions, yet we are abandoning Crete, Madeira, the Canaries, Guadeloupe and Martinique. Europe represents social welfare, yet we are abandoning the banana workers, paid EUR 10 per hour, in favour of the slaves of the multinationals, paid EUR 2 per hour. Europe represents the market and free trade of which Sir Leon is a symbol, yet we are yielding to American protectionism, to Section 301 and to 100 % customs duties. Europe represents the law and the superiority of European law, yet we are yielding to the law of Geneva.</p>
<p class="contents">Just two multinationals, Chiquita and Dole, are forcing the European Commission, the Council of Ministers and the European Union as a whole to their knees. This is why there must be changes in Europe. We too must adopt a Section 301. We must reestablish unanimity, and the European Commission must not be left to defend our commercial interests because where there is sovereignty there is freedom and superiority.</p>

I do support his point of view, but according to him, neither the United States nor the European Union are major producers of bananas. This is something the CNN channel has been reiterating in a campaign on behalf of the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not sure if this is true of the United States, but Europe certainly is a major producer of bananas. We produce about a million tonnes of bananas in the European Union, in the autonomous community I represent, in Madeira, Greece, Martinique and Guadeloupe. The European Union is indeed a major producer of bananas. I do however agree with everything else James Elles said and, of course, I agree entirely with Erika Mann.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union is currently involved in a legal dispute. In such a situation, when a country like the United States has flouted the law, the only course of action open for the Community is to defend its position from within the law.</p>
<p class="contents">I find the position advocated by the Group of the European People"s Party through its spokesman Mr Kittelmann rather dangerous. The proposal made was that we should now sit down and negotiate with the United States. It is as if someone were to steal my wallet and I were then expected to sit down and negotiate with him. If someone stole my wallet, I would go straight to the police, I would not sit down and negotiate with the thief.</p>
<p class="contents">The present situation is that the United States is in breach of the World Trade Organisation regulations and the only possible response is to take the action the Commission has taken, and deal with the matter through legal channels. I should like to draw the Commissioner"s attention to certain statements printed in the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> . They may not be correct, but Mr Rod Abbot, the European Union Ambassador to the World Trade Organisation is quoted as saying that ‘they will find probably something out of line" and ‘I don"t expect the answer to be zero because this is a political process as well". The Union is not involved in a political process at this juncture. What we are involved in is essentially a legal process. The time to sit down and negotiate will be after the World Trade Organisation has decided on the solution. I have asked the Commission to advise its representative to consider his actions carefully, because any statement by him may later be used against the Union.</p>

As the experience of history teaches us, they can all too easily escalate, thereby causing harm to both the parties involved.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital to respect the WTO rules. The rule of law, international law included, is in everyone's interests. It is of the utmost importance that the EU, in its negotiations and actions, complies with WTO rules. This will strengthen the EU's position and, I am glad to say, is also consistent with the Commission's standpoint. In the current phase, it is the USA that deserves criticism. However, the EU also needs to take a critical look at its own position, with a view to working constructively towards an amicable solution. It seems likely that the WTO panel of arbitrators will decide that the EU's actions are unacceptable in the light of their earlier ruling, which gives us good reason to exercise restraint.</p>
<p class="contents">Giving assistance to former colonies through special trade arrangements leads to discrimination and protectionism. To a certain extent, the American point of view is therefore understandable, especially when it is shared by some of the EU's own Member States. It is said that trade is better than aid. Of course, but in point of fact it is free trade that is better than aid. Another way must be found to assist the ACP countries which does not involve protectionism. Aid is better than trade distortion – and better than a trade war.</p>
<p class="contents">Individual businesses are now being penalised as a result of the American counter‐measures. This is very unfortunate and difficult to comprehend, particularly when it affects businesses in countries such as Sweden which are not involved in the ‘banana war".</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that an agreement will soon be reached under the auspices of the WTO. I should once again like to stress that it is vitally important for the EU to strengthen its position, while awaiting the panel's opinion, by complying with WTO rules.</p>

<p class="contents">Very often the problem is not so much the size of the banana production in these regions or countries but the important part that it plays in their economy or social and environmental fabric. We cannot only look at volume or quantities; we have to take into account our communities, our European Union and our ultraperipheral regions, regardless of whether they are small or big producers.</p>
<p class="contents">The ACP countries represent a pledge made by the European Union, a pledge that it has to honoured. We have already given in to the World Trade Organisation on many occasions. What is the aim? To flood the European Union with bananas produced in countries where low labour costs mean that they can practise unfair competition. The attitude of the United States is an unfair one and calls for a firm stance from the Commission, with no giving in. Fundamentally, the Commission must continue to fight for the interests of the small and poor regions that still exist in the European Union.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brittan, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. ‐</span> Mr President, I wish to begin by saying how much I appreciate the broad degree of support that Parliament has given to the position that the European Union, and the Commission in particular, has taken. That support is not only appreciated; it is heartening, because it has to be added to the support given by the international community represented by the members of the WTO in their deliberations in Geneva. I can assure all concerned that I share the sense of indignation expressed, for example by Mr Smith and Mrs Kinnock, at the fact that innocent people, both in Europe and in the banana‐producing countries of the ACP, are being taken hostage in a battle for which they have no responsibility whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that we, the European Union, will take action against the United States, have taken action against the United States, but we shall do so in accordance with the rules of the WTO. In discussing matters with the United States, as I was careful to say in my opening statement, we will stress above all our obligations to the ACP countries but also to producers of bananas within the European Union. It is indeed the case that the companies concerned already have some 70 % and more of the market. It is not the case that they are being excluded from Europe in any sense of the word.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also the case, as Mr Medina Ortega has rightly said, that we are engaged at the moment in a legal, and not just a political, process. We shall abide by the law, when it is pronounced, and we shall condemn those, such as the United States, who break it in advance of any decision. We shall not only condemn them. We shall, as we have done, take them to the WTO and follow the consequences of that action.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to say that there has been talk of trade wars. We have not started a trade war and we shall not pursue a trade war but we shall do what we are entitled to do under the WTO rules. Talk has also been prevalent about the impact of this on transatlantic relations generally. I would say both to this House and to our American friends that it is impossible for action to be taken in flagrant violation of the rules of the WTO by the United States and for the United States to believe that can have no impact on our relations generally, important as they are. I believe I have worked as hard as anybody not only to maintain but to develop those relations. That is in the interests of Europe, it is in the interests of the United States and it is in the interests of the world as well. However, for that to happen and for that to happen effectively and for the work of those who have striven to improve those relations not to be set at naught, the United States must play its part: it must abandon its resort to unilateralism and conform to the rules of world trade. That is the appeal I launched to them but it is not just a vain appeal; it is also expressed with the support of this Parliament and the determination of the European Union to defend its legitimate interests.</p>
<p class="contents">One speaker referred to an article which suggested that bananas might be my nemesis. We all have our nemeses in due course. It affects people and it reaches them at different times and on different issues. I am not afraid of a banana nemesis because I know that the policy we are pursuing, with your support, is one of complete adherence to world trade, of a determination to build a relationship with the United States but on the solid basis of mutual respect and of equality on both sides of the Atlantic. On that basis, nemesis can be avoided. However, let us, in avoiding that nemesis in this way, also recognise that wiser counsels exist. It is our task to ensure that wiser counsels prevail.</p>
