And the European Union needs a good relationship between the Council, the Commission and Parliament in order to win the full confidence of its citizens. Mr Prodi has proved to be fully aware of these considerations. An institutional crisis would weaken the Commission but also this new Parliament at a time which is crucial for European federalism. In our political opinion, the Commission’s programme is very important in that it intends to build on past triumphs and strengthen the commitment to peace, security, stability, employment and the well-being of all Europeans, but also people from other nearby countries, to the East and South. But regarding the appointment of the Commission, the method of government is important too, in terms of its collegiate nature but also in terms of the behaviour of individual Commissioners. We think that Mr Prodi will perform the duties of President with authority regarding this matter. Taken together, the issues we have discussed allow us to express a vote of confidence in what Mr Prodi called ‘a new start’: a term commonly used to refer to the Commission, but also in my opinion, that applies to this new Parliament too.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope you know the other word which Mr Gorbachov made famous – <span class="italic">perestroika</span>, meaning restructuring, reforming - because we expect that from you too. You have to regain the confidence of the public of Europe. Everyone has said that this morning. You will only do that if you show these qualities: clarity, leadership, honesty and humility.</p>
<p class="contents">Clarity: your political vision, as expounded this morning, does not completely satisfy our vision, and you have to expand and think very much about social Europe, the environment and other aspects. We want from you concrete objectives. That is what people understand, and we want, as part of this clarity, evidence that you can listen. That evidence is not forthcoming at the moment. We want evidence that you can listen and understand what your role is, what our role is and what the roles of of the Council of Ministers, of lobbyists and of members of the directorates-general are.</p>
<p class="contents">Leadership: you have to show willpower, integrity and you have to show that you have very good eyes and ears and that you are a competent person.</p>
<p class="contents">Honesty: telling the truth even when it is not comfortable to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Your Commissioners are being tested on the same grounds. Our committee, the Industry Committee, questioned three Commissioners and sent delegations to three others. We questioned Commissioners Liikanen, Lamy and Busquin and we went to the hearings of de Palacio, Patten and Wallström. We had the widest grasp of any committee. When we questioned Commissioners Liikanen and Lamy, we did so objectively, asking questions about their role. That was not the case with half of the Members there for Commissioner Busquin. Commissioner Busquin’s hearing revealed far more about that side of the House than it did about Commissioner Busquin. That is because he was subjected, unlike any other Commissioner-designate, to a sadistic, preplanned and concerted attack. There was no reaction to his repeated, very clear answers to the same question, and issues involving internal Belgian politics which had no bearing on Mr Busquin’s future role, given that this is a multilingual House, were repeated ad nauseam. No other Commissioner was subjected to this ordeal and it is bitterly resented by those of us who wanted to do this thing properly and to objectively listen to what Commissioners would say about their future work. That side of the House should be thoroughly ashamed of their conduct in the Busquin hearing.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike those opposite we listened to the answers to questions about the future roles. The six Commissioners with whom we had dealings satisfied us as to their future competence in the roles which they will undertake.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These factors ensure that you will gain the confidence of this House, and because of you, many of us will be voting for your whole team. You will be responsible for the common interests of Europe. This is the mission that the Commission has. I think that the common interests of Europe today will require you to face up to two main challenges over the next five years.</p>
<p class="contents">The first challenge is the European people’s complete lack of understanding of the European Institutions. What we have here are institutions for beginners, which people do not understand, which they are not informed about, and as these institutions are a mystery to them, they are suspicious about them, sometimes excessively so. It is your duty, as defender of the common interests of Europe, and it is our duty as the people’s representatives, to give this action clarity, and this is why we are defending, as you know, the idea of a constitution, of working towards a European constitution. </p>
<p class="contents">The second challenge, which is even more important, is to find out if there is a social action programme for Europe. Europe was made for just such a programme, and in these times of globalisation, when our citizens have the impression, the feeling that all the real decisions are made somewhere else, and particularly in the world of finance, it is important to revive the idea of a plan for Europe which is understood by the citizens and defended by the institutions. The task of formulating a plan for Europe falls to you as President of the Commission, just as it falls to us as representatives of the people.</p>
<p class="contents">As you well know, and I shall end now, it is through dialogue, between the European Parliament and the European Commission then, that we will find the key to Europe’s future.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is precisely in the area of budget policy that these three basic principles need to be given concrete expression. If we want to win back the confidence of our citizens, we need transparency regarding the implementation of the EU budget in all its details, a sense of responsibility in handling tax revenue and efficiency in transposing Community budget policies. Clearly, this is a task for the Commission as a whole, all Commissioners and all departments. </p>
<p class="contents">In the person of Mrs Schreyer you have introduced us to an experienced politician who still has to find her way around one or two corridors here and go through one or two new experiences at a European level but who is also, however, someone who has become quickly and comprehensively acquainted with the very complicated material of budget policy and who is very aware of the forthcoming challenges of budget policy. She has set out budgetary discipline as being, for her, one of the cardinal virtues. This is praiseworthy stuff. However, we shall also take care to ensure that it is not just a question here of describing new tasks and slipping these into our budget. Instead, we shall need, together with yourself, to go before the Council and say that new tasks require new money.</p>
<p class="contents">I was gratified to hear Mrs Schreyer say, very undiplomatically, that the distinction between non-compulsory and compulsory funds has to be removed. This would mean equal rights for all parts of the Parliament. A courageous statement like that is worth repeating. She also said that control over revenue needs to be shifted in this direction, something we must set about discussing very soon. I think Mrs Schreyer is among those proposed candidates who will do full justice to their tasks in this Parliament. We shall have no cause – over here at least – to doubt your team.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr President Prodi, your references to the extreme importance of enlargement as well as your dedication to full integration and to the political union of Europe are principles with which we sympathise.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that Europe may indeed have a future only as a political, social and cultural entity. Its goal should be to become a place where freedom and social justice prevails for all European citizens. However, such a place needs the full participation of all the citizens. The last European elections were characterised by the very low turnout. You know that in the minds of the European citizens the structure of Europe is not so much an issue as is peaceful existence between the people. The recent crisis and the resignation of the European Commission due to certain individuals who did not fulfil their duties contributed to the disillusionment of the European people. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President Prodi, you are assuming your responsibilities at a time of great uncertainty but this Europe, despite its concerns and misgivings, will not go away and you and your Commissioners have serious responsibilities. When you were designated President, we thought, based on your statements, that the final decision for appointing each of the Commissioners would have your seal of approval. However, it did not quite happen in this way. Of course, we are not asking you to breach any treaties. We are, however, asking you to bring about a new start, to defy and take a stand against the badly construed texts of the past and to take account of Parliament’s recommendations. </p>
<p class="contents">We, the New Democracy Party of Greece, will vote in favour of your Commission, regardless of any reservations, because we are hopeful that you will respect your commitments of the previous week on the one hand and because we agree with the political content of today’s statements on the other. This is not a blank cheque but a move of confidence in you, in a Europe which must forge ahead. We hope that you will make transparency within the functioning of the European Commission a priority and set your initial goal as policies covering citizen protection, employment, cultural development as well as solidarity amongst those who suffer from an absence of democracy and from poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We will give her every encouragement and the support she will need to pursue progress for social Europe through the college of the Commission. We hope she will be heard fairly there.</p>
<p class="contents">She knows some of the tests we will apply to her. I should like to mention three. Firstly, a commitment to sit down at the earliest opportunity with members of the committee to devise a new social action programme to cover the term of office of the new Commission, which will recognise the realities of the new world brought by the euro and the new possibilities arising from Amsterdam to promote employment and opportunity and to combat insecurity and exclusion. Secondly, to seek with Parliament a new understanding on the operation of the social dialogue provisions of the social chapter. Neither the procedure itself nor the legitimate expectations of this democratically-elected institution have been met in the way the procedure has been used so far. That is an urgent priority. Thirdly, to join with Parliament in calling upon the Council to remedy the exclusion of Parliament from the macroeconomic dialogue agreed at Cologne. The last thing we need now is to add to the democratic deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">Should all go well tomorrow, we look forward to working with her on these and other matters.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed it is because of these doubts that two critical passages have been included in the resolutions. It is clearly stated under 3 and 5(a), (b) of our resolution that if Parliament loses confidence in a Commissioner then we will only need a simple majority to ask the President, Mr Prodi, to dismiss the Commissioner concerned. Point 5(b) adds that if a judicial accusation is made on account of corruption then that too is a reason for the Commissioner concerned to depart. In addition, point 5(f) of the resolution reiterates that Parliament can request for there to be an exchange of portfolios if there is good reason for this. I would like to ask Mr Prodi again to respond to this. </p>
<p class="contents">My second comment relates to the agreements that have already been made under paragraphs 1 and 4 of the resolution and under paragraph 5 up to and including (h). It must be evident from the additional questions that other than the points I have just mentioned, the undertakings that have been made have been inadequate. But I also want to refer to the obligation to provide information, to the need to pass documents through to Parliament whenever requested to do so. I have already presented a draft regulation in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs as regards this obligation to provide information. We believe this matter should be speedily resolved. Either you draw up a draft regulation or the Committee will do it itself, in which case there is already a text.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I have a message for Mr Bolkestein, who is not in fact present. For years, he has presented himself as a euro-critic and euro-sceptic, and during the hearing he made a 180º turn. As Christian Democrats, we must, of course, support anyone who repents. But we are assuming that it wasn’t a turn just for the purposes of the hearing, but one which will also be given expression in his work. We will follow this with a very critical eye</p>
<p class="contents">The question as to whether we will vote for or against tomorrow, or whether we will abstain, depends on the answers provided by Mr Prodi to the paragraphs in the second half of our resolution.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The hearings have been extremely useful. They generally took place in a constructive atmosphere. I would like, nevertheless, to warn Members against any attempt to ape certain practises of the American Congress, particularly its intrusions into the private lives of politicians, both male and female. It is reasonable to require anyone on the political stage to declare his or her interests, but transparency must stop when it reaches the private domain. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is not the holy inquisition, although this idea might not please some of our apprentice Torquemadas whether they are Bavarian or Flemish who did their best to denigrate Philippe Busquin. Flanders is one of the cradles of European civilisation. The Flemish people deserve better than the Vlaams Blok. Having known Philippe Busquin for years, I have full confidence in his personal integrity.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also taking up arms against those who seem to want to bring about a political emasculation of the future Commissioners. I do not share Mr Bolkestein’s political ideals, but he is entirely within his rights to remain active within the Liberal International.</p>
<p class="contents">Future Commissioners will have to abstain from standing in political elections during their term of office. I hope, though, that they will remain faithful to their political convictions.</p>
<p class="contents">No one criticised the excessive number of Commissioners with Socialist allegiances. This fact is perhaps less a reflection of the current political composition of Parliament than of the image of the power held by Socialists across the fifteen Member States. Whatever the reason, the Commission must rise above traditional political divisions. It must, at all costs, remain a College. Even if many MEPs are sorely tempted to judge the Commissioners individually, the Treaty requires – and quite rightly so – a vote for the whole body.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty also gives the Commission the only right of initiative relating to the administration of Europe. An attempt to change this would mean turning the Commission into a merely executive body. It is in Parliament’s interest to defend the Commission’s powers and particularly its right of initiative, without which the power of national governments and bureaucracies would become overwhelming. Parliament has nothing to gain from neutralising the Commission’s powers.</p>
<p class="contents">The hearings showed that the Prodi Commission wants to co-operate with Parliament, to take note of our suggestions and of our legislative work. When they appeared before the Economic and Monetary Committee, Commissioners Monti and Solbes laid down bases, solid bases for future collaboration. Be that as it may, the Commission and its Commissioners should be judged on their political action. What President Prodi gave us this morning was a preliminary sketch. I hope that we will be able to see, by the beginning of the year 2000, a much larger portrait of Europe.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I thank you for your interest in this matter, and I call on the Commission to understand clearly that the issue of Timor will, unfortunately, remain open for some time, and to demand that urgent action be taken, both in terms of humanitarian aid and in political and security terms, because the announcement of intervention by an international force does not <span class="italic">per se</span> guarantee security conditions in the region, as it must intervene without any kind of condition imposed by the Indonesian authorities, and the urgency of providing humanitarian aid is URGENT in the true sense of the word.</p>
<p class="contents">I can confirm this as I witnessed the elections in Timor personally, on behalf of this Parliament. The situation is extremely serious and requires immediate intervention and relentless, immediate pressure from all European institutions because nothing has yet been guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">The start of a new Commission’s work is a moment of hope for Europe. We know that the circumstances in which the proposal for the composition of the Commission arrived in this Parliament were far from ideal. We know and reaffirm the legitimate doubts as to the factors which led governments to the individual nomination of Members, and we see with some concern that the composition of the Commission takes into account neither the results of the recent European elections nor the old tradition of political pluralism.</p>
<p class="contents">But these objections do not mean that we do not wish the Commission well in its task. The forthcoming turn of the century will be a decisive event for Europe. We hope that the Commission will be able to face up to what will probably be its main task, which is to reconcile social and economic cohesion with enlargement. If it does not achieve these two objectives in a coherent and integrated way, it will find it very difficult to make the borders showing Europe’s politics and well-being match Europe’s geographical borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Conscious of the fact that this is the Commission’s main task, we would like to assure Professor Prodi and the Members of the Commission that we wish them well in their work and to state that he can count on the votes of the Portuguese MEPs of the European People’s Party.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You spoke in this connection of the need, here and now, for glasnost. In doing so, you went to the heart of the problem. Last year’s conflict between the Commission and Parliament was largely due to the Commission’s culture of secrecy and to the arrogance with which the Commission handled Parliament’s justified concerns. I hope all this belongs to the past and look forward with yourself, Mr President of the Commission, to a new beginning. </p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to the Committee’s hearings specifically in connection with foreign affairs, human rights, and the common security and defence policy. A general remark, first of all. If we were to set the qualifying standard for Commissioners at the level displayed by my colleague Ingo Friedrich at the hearings and also in today’s debate, we would not have any difficulties with anyone. However, Commissioners-designate Günther Verheugen and Chris Patten have no need of formal qualifying standards. They have both engaged in an excellent debate in committee and provided real proof not only of their specialist qualifications but also – and this is almost more important – of the new political culture to which you yourself have referred, Commissioner, and of the dialogue between the European Parliament and the Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we have identified differences when it comes to political opinions. It would not be understandable if it were otherwise, but it is precisely that which makes collaboration interesting and preserves us from boredom. All the co-ordinators were subsequently correct in agreeing that our committee had gained two valuable and esteemed partners in dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has also arrived at the same consensus regarding Commissioner-designate Nielson. I say this because our committee too was involved in this matter. I should like to assure you and also the other Commissioners that we shall offer critical co-operation and engagement in dialogue. I have no difficulty in repeating what my group chairman said a short while ago, namely that we shall be expressing our confidence in you.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What the citizens of Europe are expecting is for work finally to begin again after the long months of crisis and paralysis, but under better conditions which increase people’s confidence in the Commission. The great weakness in the construction of the European Union is still there, whether or not, at the end of the day, we can only approve the Commission as a whole (and this despite the fact that we have grave reservations, at least about one Commissioner-designate). I am aware of the fact that, as President-designate of the Commission, you have already accepted significant political demands on our part in order to make it possible for the principle of individual responsibility to be transposed. I especially emphasise this because this demand for individual responsibility is anchored in a proposal of mine which was included in the European Parliament’s resolution of 23 March 1999. </p>
<p class="contents">What I wish for on behalf of my delegation but also as one of my country’s MEPs is proper supervisory control over the Commission and confidence on the part of the citizens in both the Commission and the European Parliament. Confidence of this kind cannot be taken for granted but has to be justified over and over again. We cannot just issue a blank cheque, nor would we want to. We need strong, functioning institutions. Otherwise, the European idea will not translate credibly into practice. I subscribe totally to your programme, which is dedicated to glasnost, which is not about just tinkering with the institutions but about far-reaching reform, which strives for sustainable job creation through consistent liberalisation of the economy, which attaches a high value to the principle of subsidiarity and which considers it necessary to find adequate responses to demographic developments in Europe. The European Union must remain attractive as a model. The zone of peace and prosperity must, with credibility and a sense of vision, be extended to include the candidate countries for accession to an enlarged EU. The European idea which forms the basis of the EU needs a new impulse. The personalities who translate this idea into practice must be in a position to do this. Individual responsibility and co-operation with Parliament in all phases of the process are indispensable prior conditions of this.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Prodi, your agreement with Mr Poettering points to a new era, the possibility of an entirely new Commission culture aimed at winning back citizens’ confidence and interest in our European Union. It has been a dizzying but, in my view, absolutely necessary process for the Union. </p>
<p class="contents">Let me go back to December 1998 when we in the Group of the European People’s Party, together with Liberals and the Greens, fought for openness and the need for accountability in the debate for adoption of the budget. Then, the Socialists opted for party considerations, evasion and cowardliness in the face of the Council. Without the willingness of ourselves in the right-of-centre parties to exercise supervisory power, to take responsibility for this and, in a spirit of openness before all else, to demand to have all the papers in full view on the table, we would <span class="italic">never</span> have come as far as we have in fact today. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, Commissioners-designate, when it comes to enlargement of the Union, foreign and security policy, strengthening free trade in the world, opening up markets, maintaining a vigorous policy on the environment and continuing to pursue economic liberalisation in Europe and with a common currency that is more competitive, Europe is going to need, for all these things, a very strong and functioning Commission in which you, Professor Prodi, will have our confidence and approval of your legislative arrangements. When you obtain these things, you also acquire, however, a responsibility to make sure that each and every one of the Commissioners can live up to the ideals, share the focus and conviction and meet the requirements of justice and propriety that we all demand now.

I hope that in the process, we shall also overcome an understandable degree of mistrust on the part of Europe’s citizens and create a new confidence in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">However, drawing a line under the matter does not mean just filing it away. The European Parliament will remain alert and keep a sharp eye on the Commission in future too. That is why we were elected by the peoples of Europe. We shall ensure that, if need be, individual Members of the Commission are removed if they are no longer acceptable for professional or personal reasons. I am convinced that, for example, Mr Bolkestein would fail the test tomorrow if, in appointing the Commission, we had the opportunity to vote on individual Commissioners. A Commissioner responsible for the internal market who, during the hearings, was forever mouthing the word “subsidiarity” has clearly not understood enough about the great common tasks facing Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Europe expect to benefit from a leadership which focuses upon the common good and not upon the sum total of individual interests in the Member States. When Mr Bolkestein learns to understand this, then he may go on to share for a long time in the success which I wish Mr Prodi and his Commission. If he does not, then he is a candidate for the sack. Mr Prodi, since Mr Bolkestein is still not back yet, I trust you will pass the message on to him.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Thyssen (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, on behalf of the Belgian delegation, the Belgian Members of the PPE Group, I want to start by driving home the message that the voting due to take place this morning places before us a decision of the utmost importance. We have no doubts about Mr Prodi’s Presidency. We were impressed by his introduction, we are expecting positive answers to the points contained in our Resolution, and we have faith in Mr Prodi’s ability to lead the Commission in a responsible and professional manner. If we had been asked to give our opinion on each of the Commissioners-designate individually then indeed we would have given most of them our support. But now of course, we have to give our opinion of the Commission as a College. We know that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Unfortunately, we feel that one particular link in the chain is indeed weak.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the crisis situation in the institutions to continue? Not as far as we are concerned, for it is high time that the Commission was able to get down to work again, exercising its full authority. So you will not find us voting against the Resolution. The weak link, and everyone now knows who it is, is the candidate put forward by the Belgian government. This government could have done its own country a better service. The hearing with Mr Busquin was not a great success for the candidate. We, that is almost all those present in that committee, were agreed on this. But sadly enough, this assessment did not find expression in the letter to the President of the Parliament. It is anyone’s guess as to why.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, Mr Busquin did not show the least sensitivity towards, let alone demonstrate any commitment to, the question of defending the use of Dutch in the European institutions, which was an insult to the six million Flemish people. Those of us who represent the Flemish people cannot just overlook this. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you will not be surprised to learn that the Belgian delegation of the PPE cannot give its approval to this College with one voice, but we do intend to adopt a constructive attitude over the coming years in order to work with the College.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
