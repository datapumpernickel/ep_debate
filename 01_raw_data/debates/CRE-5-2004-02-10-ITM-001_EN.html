<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, avian influenza has affected poultry populations in nine countries in Asia so far, namely Cambodia, the People's Republic of China, including the special administrative region of Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Pakistan, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam.</p>
<p class="contents">According to an FAO-WHO-OIE expert panel held on 3 and 4 February in Rome, the current epidemic is still evolving and not yet under control. As of today, the disease has taken 18 human lives in Vietnam and Thailand, but a new virus, fully transmissible to humans and capable of spreading from human to human, has not yet emerged.</p>
<p class="contents">In total Asia has around 40% of the world's poultry population and accounts for 25% of world trade in poultry. There are 6664 million birds in the affected areas. Already the situation is affecting the world's grain and meat markets.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a devastating disease in poultry causing very high mortality – up to 95% in 24 hours. Many millions of birds have already died of the disease, or have been destroyed in the fight to halt its spread.</p>
<p class="contents">In its sanitary and its economic dimension, not forgetting the animal welfare aspects, this outbreak of avian influenza is unprecedented and, although there is at present no indication of a developing human pandemic, this risk cannot be excluded according to the WHO.</p>
<p class="contents">The disease impact is likely to be most felt by smallholders and owners of backyard flocks which form their main food supply. It may be more difficult to prevent the disease in these flocks than in larger commercial units. This has the potential to accelerate trends towards the industrialisation of poultry operations in the affected countries and therefore could have some negative social and environmental consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the situation affects the European Community at many levels and the Commission, as well as the Member States, has taken decisive action. The Commission has immediately taken safeguard measures to ensure adequate protection against possible disease introduction in the territory of the Community via imports of live birds and poultry products from the countries concerned to protect both animal and public health.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has made appropriate arrangements to send an animal health and two public health experts to Vietnam to assist in combating the disease in collaboration with the WHO. In addition, Member States have also sent experts to various other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been, and we will continue, monitoring the situation carefully via our delegations, the WHO, FAO, OIE, as well as governmental and other non-governmental information sources. The Member States have contingency plans in place according to Community legislation, approved by the Commission to be implemented in case of avian influenza outbreaks in poultry. The Commission services are at present scrutinising the plans submitted by acceding countries so that they can become operational on the date of accession.</p>
<p class="contents">In the public health domain, assessment of risk to humans is carried out on a continuous basis in cooperation with the WHO and experts from the Member States. Rapid exchange of information and mutual consultation on guidelines and measures taken or planned by the Member States is ensured via the early-warning and response system of the European Community. Further measures and guidelines and consultation procedures could be taken by the Commission should the need arise. Moreover, the Commission intends to publish a working paper on pandemic influenza preparedness and response planning, which sets out a series of steps to be taken by Member States and the European Community to address the threat of an avian influenza pandemic.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is collaborating closely with the affected countries to identify areas where help is needed and where it can provide the greatest benefit. Not only the Directorate for Health and Consumer Protection, but also those for Development, EuropeAid and our Humanitarian Aid Office, are actively collaborating with local governments and non-governmental organisations. The EC delegations in the region are actively involved in this process and are coordinating with Member State embassies.</p>
<p class="contents">Right now the Commission is preparing a major Community contribution to support Vietnam's efforts against avian influenza by the financing of up to EUR 1 million worth of protective and laboratory equipment under two ongoing EC assistance programmes under the auspices of DG EuropeAid. This will be the largest contribution to date by any donor to Vietnam. An agreement is due to be signed with the WHO, which should be finalised by the middle of this week.</p>
<p class="contents">As time is an important factor, the Commission services at all levels are in continuous dialogue with the World Health Organisation, the FAO and World Organisation for Animal Health, and local authorities to share our experience and expertise in disease control as rapidly and with as little red tape as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate our staff for this extra effort.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission hopes that all these measures and activities will be successful in containing and ultimately eradicating the disease and that we can restore normal practices in our trade and other dealings with the countries affected sooner rather than later.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to follow the issue closely and support affected countries in collaboration and coordination with the relevant international organisations and the Member States, and it will adjust Community measures in proportion to the risks posed by the disease situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jackson (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his remarks and I think we can all join him in hoping that what he has outlined will be successful. I would like to make three points.</p>
<p class="contents">First, in relation to the European Union's own services, one imagines that those operating on our behalf in south-east Asia are mainly from the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin: our team of European Union health and food inspectors. Could the Commissioner tell the House how many people are involved in this work? He briefly mentioned that. One of the things that worries the MEPs who have visited the Food and Veterinary Office is that it is very understaffed. In fact, I believe there are only 90 inspectors for the entire world. What worries me is that, if this pandemic in Asia is tying up a lot of the efforts of such inspectors, where is the work not being done?</p>
<p class="contents">One of the things we were talking about in the Committee recently was the importation of chicken meat from Brazil because of the danger that this was impregnated with nitrofurans. Now if we are looking at south-east Asia, can the Commissioner reassure me that somebody is still looking at what is happening in Brazil?</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is about the human health dimension, because although this obviously has an animal health issue at its starting point, the human health dimension is very important. Is Mr Byrne satisfied that the European Union already has the capacity to monitor effectively any signs that an animal epidemic, or a major human pandemic, has started to occur here, given the likelihood of concealment? We have come across the element of concealment already in the countries where this has arisen. There is a temptation, I am sure, for concealment to happen elsewhere in the world also. Will he give some thought to setting up a rapid response team dedicated to planning for the worst in the European Union? He has outlined something of this, but not perhaps talked about that precise team.</p>
<p class="contents">The next report we are debating is very relevant – Mr Bowis' report on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Unfortunately, that centre has not yet been set up. Would it be possible for an advance guard of the new Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to set up a planning team with which the European Parliament can have a dialogue?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Mr Byrne is also responsible for food safety at home and for legislation regarding food labelling. Given that we do not know exactly what the route of transmission is – if there is a route to humans – and that consumers are wary of food of unknown origin at such a time, would the Commission consider providing consumers with extra information via the labelling of the country of origin of the poultry meat component of composite foods which account for a very large section of the European Union market? I note that Mr Byrne said that the Commission had banned the import of poultry meat and poultry products. Oh really? Many consumers will tell you that it is impossible to tell where the poultry meat comes from in the composite foods we buy throughout the European Union. This is some of the information which I believe in this context should be given to the consumer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also wonder whether what we do is always enough, and whether we really are thinking in terms of what is called preventative consumer protection. In saying this, Commissioner Byrne, it is not you alone that I have in mind, but all of us, as well as the governments and your fellow-Commissioners. I will come to that in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">As soon as we heard the first reports of avian influenza, we immediately stopped imports from Thailand into the European Union. Not much imagination would have been needed to announce on the same day that the whole of Asia would be sealed off, which would have been sensible. It is, perhaps, not very smart to use the domino approach by starting with Thailand and then moving on to Vietnam and then China. It would have made sense in view of what we know about how business is done in these countries and how birds and other animals, are traded and sold within them.</p>
<p class="contents">What bothers me is the permanent state of <span class="italic">re</span>-action. We are always <span class="italic">re</span>-acting. Along comes avian influenza, we react to it, and then, for whatever reason, nothing happens for a long time. We discover that poultry meat contains dioxin – and we react. We discover the presence of prohibited, toxic, and carcinogenic pharmaceuticals in shrimps and other products – and we react. We react, though, always and only on the spur of the moment, and promptly forget all about it. That is so naive, so boundlessly naive, for we know that the conditions under which animals are kept in the countries under discussion, and the standards of hygiene in Asian countries, but in Brazil as well, are dire in comparison with our own. As this is something we keep asking about in this House, I really would like to know what happens when the Commissioners discuss this around their table. When we ask Commissioner Lamy to give priority, in discussions on the World Trade Organisation, to consumer protection and hygiene policy as matters to be negotiated with third countries, I know that the most we can expect by way of response is a warm smile. We can content ourselves with that, but if we do not change our own system too, we will keep on ending up in situations like this one, of having to react to a pandemic which frightens our people and – I say this quite seriously – will of course have an effect on the economy. As Mrs Jackson said, most chicken mince ends up in burgers or in Chinese ready meals of one sort or another. People are unsettled; they will stop buying these products for a period of time, and that, to a large extent, will of course have an effect on our economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The reasons for all this are very simple, and are to be found not only in the hygiene conditions, but also – and let me make this quite clear – in our having been too soft. As you will recall, Commissioner Byrne, I called upon you some time ago, when we were discussing dioxin and other products, to announce a ban on imports from China and other countries, simply for disciplinary or educational effect. Then we are always kind and say that these countries must have our support. That is a mistake. We will have something to say later on about the European Centre on Communicable Diseases. You made reference to serious steps, that is, to serious measures and courses of action; I am sure they will all be marvellous, but only after a few years have passed. Right now, they are no use to us whatever; right now, the only thing that is any use is to announce that we will protect the people of the European Union, for it is for them that we are working in this House. Let us protect them! Are we certain that the viruses that transmit avian influenza among birds and poultry cannot be passed on to human beings? Have we done enough research?</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to my next point, and – Mr President – it will be my last. When we are discussing the European Union’s Budget and the financial perspective, I always hear a lot said about regional policy, and a lot about aid policy and other matters. Do I even once hear anything said about how we are stringently requiring the Member States to ensure that enough research is being done into ways of protecting human beings from disease? In that context, never; nor is it one of the European Union’s priorities. I would be grateful to you, Commissioner Byrne, if you could ensure that the financial perspective will include, as one of its priorities, an obligation on the Member States to spend money on research into vaccines capable of protecting people against the diseases that may come our way in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whilst he, the past few years, has become well-versed in the field of epidemics and animal diseases, the big question is: What have we learnt from them? One of the Commission's most important conclusions with regard to the fight against FMD was that the external borders have to be protected. What has been done about this conclusion? When I enter, let us say, Amsterdam or Dublin, I can still see a major difference in comparison with, to take one example, the United States of America. In my view, control procedures have hardly changed over the past few years. I could be wrong, but I should like to hear from the Commissioner what specific measures have been taken. Why is it that I read in the paper that at Schiphol in Amsterdam, disinfectant mats have been put in place, while this is not being done anywhere else in Europe? Why is it that entirely different measures are being taken in Belgium? What official recommendations does the Commission give the Member States and how is this advice being acted upon?</p>
<p class="contents">Imports from Thailand and other countries have been suspended. This weekend, there were rumours in the Dutch press that chicken meat from those countries would enter the European Union after all via a side entrance, namely via the new acceding countries. Is this true or not? Mrs Roth-Behrendt has already spoken about the need for further research, vaccines and testing methods, among other things. The point is that this Parliament has given the Commission the opportunity of using this extra money twice in the past two years. I am not talking about the resources in Category 3 for research, but extra resources in Category 1a of the agricultural budget. The Commission has chosen not to spend them. Why not, despite the fact that the self-same Commissioner has declared in this plenary that that would be the case? The Commission has failed to meet a request from the budgetary authority, and I should like to know why that is?</p>
<p class="contents">Crisis management: the Commission has already stated that there is an emergency plan. I gather that there are indeed certain plans afoot, but what is the situation as regards human health? The flu medicine that could help the public is now available to a limited extent. Has the Commission consulted the Member States on how it will be used in the different countries if there are inadequate supplies of this medicine in certain other countries?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a word about the OIE. Trade depends on trust and many aspects cannot be monitored by the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin alone, which is dependent on the information that countries pass on to the OIE. It has now transpired that Indonesia, Vietnam and possibly China, have probably waited many months before informing the OIE. What does the Commission intend to do in this context in order to enhance the provision of information, and to ensure that trading can take place under fair conditions, with no risk of our suddenly being faced with illegal imports of products of this kind? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You said, Commissioner, that work is being done right now, on the ground, to combat the epidemic. Good though that is, were you on the spot straightaway when the epidemic started? Were you informed of it then, or only later on when the press picked up the story, and when there was general uproar among us?</p>
<p class="contents">You said, Commissioner, that small businesses have been affected, and that this could provide the impetus for industrialisation. I take the view that it is precisely the moves towards industrialisation that have taken place in these countries that have created the conditions for this pandemic, for they have brought indigenous and adapted breeds into contact with genetically developed breeds that may have adapted to industrialisation but have genetic defects and lack resistance to this disease.</p>
<p class="contents">So, if you favour on-the-spot controls in this case, as we do, they must form part of a constant analytical process if these problems are to be addressed. It is not the small-time poultry farmers who export to the European Union, but the large industrial plants, and their standards of hygiene must be equal to our own. That will not, however, be achieved by having controls at borders or by tightening up the ones that are already in place – and always in a visible way, as the sort of reaction that Mrs Roth-Behrendt described; what we need instead is special external protection.</p>
<p class="contents">What this means is that prevention does not start at the border; rather, we must impose our standards, and monitor adherence to them, in the countries that supply us, enabling us to guarantee preventative observation and action to reorient production in these countries.</p>

We are told today that the whole of South-East Asia is affected, with 19 human victims – 14 in Vietnam and five in Thailand – and 50 million birds slaughtered on the Asian continent. One case has been reported in the United States. We would like to know, Commissioner, what is the likelihood of contamination and to what extent it is possible to say that the virus that has appeared in the US is or is not the same one as has appeared in Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention a number of precedents: bovine spongiform encephalitis, to which my colleague Mr Martinez repeatedly tried to draw the Commission’s attention over five years before it burst upon the world in the shape of the famous mad cow affair; foot and mouth disease in the UK and dioxin-contaminated chicken in Belgium. Last year there were cases of avian influenza in the Netherlands, not to mention the swine fever that recurs in our countries. I am glad that we have understood the full extent of the problem right away this time.</p>
<p class="contents">As my fellow Members have said, however, we also need to deal with the causes. While the causes of these diseases are sometimes concealed to avoid damaging the industry or turning away the consumer, we do – at least in the previous cases – have a pretty good idea what they are. We know it was mainly the quest for high yields and high-density farming on the one hand, as the previous speaker said, and, on the other, generalised free trade and the systematic opening of borders. This theory, which used to be stigmatised as the ‘free fox in the free henhouse’, fits the situation perfectly, the fox here rather symbolising free trade. Not only has it eaten the chicken but, what is far worse, it has contaminated it.</p>
<p class="contents">True, the Commission has proposed an embargo on imports of Thai chicken until August 2004, but that seems to us inadequate given the scale the phenomenon is assuming.</p>
<p class="contents">Remember, Commissioner, that the Commission hauled France before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg for refusing to lift the embargo on British beef when there was no guarantee that the British meat was harmless and BSE was still wreaking havoc in the United Kingdom and Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">France, which produces 2 million tonnes of poultry a year, 35 to 45% of it for export, could return for a time – and not only France but others too – to traditional markets from which it was ousted by competition from Brazil, which practices dumping prices and where, it also appears, production conditions are atrocious. So much so, incidentally, that Europe’s number one poultry producer, Doux, has relocated to Brazil to take advantage of cheap labour and plentiful raw materials at low prices.</p>
<p class="contents">Systematic free trade not only destabilises our producers and our poultry farmers, it also forces us, as part of the WTO, to accept ridiculous clauses that make you wonder what they have got to do with a free economy and a free market. I am thinking of the one that was signed at the GATT in 1994 stipulating that Europe commits itself to importing 5% of its poultry meat consumption, or one million tonnes in 2002. For the present there has been no transmission of avian influenza between humans, but if there is a risk of a world pandemic and if the H5N1 virus were to combine with a human virus like the flu virus to create a new, highly contagious fatal strain, then I think, Commissioner, that the EUR 1 million credit you have just announced could prove tragically inadequate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My speech is, I am sorry to say, based on press information, information which – at least as regards Italy – is awakening considerable concerns since, for example, dead peregrine falcons and migratory ducks, two species of a very resistant nature, have been discovered.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to make two simple and precise comments. The first concerns the health aspect. We are not being caught completely unawares by the H5N1 strain, because it was identified back in 1997 and it reappeared as H7N1 between 1999 and 2001. Now, because the strain is continually mutating, we would ask the Commission what it intends to do as regards prevention, because – as some Members rightly stated before me – we always spring into action after the emergency arises. Some Member States are equipped with their own national laboratories, but the European Centre for Infectious Diseases must set up a group to monitor the ways in which the health situation is monitored in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect concerns the Commission’s work. As Commissioner Lamy announced, there is an extremely serious option, within the talks to revive the WTO, aimed at increasing the number of countries involved in the EBA initiative. So then, what are the guarantees offered to our consumers as regards the globalisation of markets? Does the Commission not believe that, on this subject, a think-tank should be set up, within the actual context of the WTO, concerning the relationship between globalisation and health problems? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This illness shows that communicable diseases go beyond the framework of the Member States and impose the need for immediate measures which guarantee prevention and protect the health of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">On 1 February 2004, the World Health Organisation pointed out the danger of the flu virus spreading from human to human. So far 19 people have died, 23 have been contaminated and the virus has emerged in ten Asian countries. Not only is the virus highly communicable, but the delay yet again in providing the relevant information has helped it to spread. The European Commission perhaps underestimated the danger, considering that the virus cannot be transmitted from human to human. However, we know that flu viruses are genetically unstable and their behaviour cannot be predicted. So this specific epidemic may change quickly and continually.</p>
<p class="contents">Without question, I welcome the measures taken to ban imports of meat and poultry for six months and imports of live birds as domestic animals from Asian countries. But we must not stop at that, Commissioner. As you well know, the virus is also carried by wild birds as their flocks move. We need the expertise of the Food and Agriculture Organisation, so that suitable guidelines can be issued and the importance of preventive vaccination, where possible, can be highlighted.</p>
<p class="contents">History has taught us that, in cases where a disease has economic repercussions on the agricultural sector and may also harm human health, the risk to man must not be underestimated; it must take priority if we really want to maintain consumer confidence. I do not feel that this is what has happened so far with the measures announced.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, we must be certain that livestock breeders in the areas affected are in a position to obtain suitable means to incinerate animals attacked by the disease without any risk of its spreading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, like the Liberals, we cannot fail to observe that we do not only have one external border, but fifteen different external borders where assorted attempts are being made at controlling the possible import of avian influenza. We have witnessed a similar scenario in the case of FMD, and we must take measures in order to prevent a similar situation from occurring again.</p>
<p class="contents">I need to get something else off my chest. If our elderly are at risk of contracting flu, vaccines are available on a massive scale. In this case too, we know that vaccines are necessary, but nothing, or far too little, is being done about it. The only country that is working on vaccines is Italy. I think that the European Union should make a concerted effort to develop vaccines so that we can combat this disease in a humane manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was almost a year ago exactly that this House discussed SARS. Now, as then, many Members are saying that globalisation and the European internal market, which are essentially good things, can work well only if we also take action to protect people’s health. This is where Europe needs to take joint action, for viruses and bacteria do not, after all, stop at borders. Let me pick up Mr Mulder’s example. Düsseldorf’s airport is very, very close to the Dutch border, and so it is from Düsseldorf that many Dutch people fly when they go on holiday, and a lot of people from the part of North Rhine-Westphalia around Düsseldorf fly from Schiphol. People will not understand why safety measures at Schiphol have to be quite different from those in Düsseldorf. In any case, viruses do not make a stop at the borders, which are themselves established in different ways by nation-states, and so I believe this is where we need more measures taken at European level. A year ago, I backed Commissioner Byrne when he was trying to get more competences to combat this sort of threat included in the European constitution. Admittedly, he does often overshoot the mark, and when he did, I told him so, but, in this case, he really is right, and we should be behind him.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Convention did not achieve what we actually wanted, progress has been made, and that is another reason to press for a European constitution, which will better enable us to combat these dangers.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by taking up Mrs Roth-Behrendt’s point about research. We do indeed have to do more for medical research, and when we do, we must not think only in terms of products that are capable of being used in the short term. The protection of people’s health is a research objective too, one that it is worth pushing, one on which it is worth spending money if there are no firms willing to do it in the short term. Dangers can present themselves without warning, and so we have to be prepared, even if industry has made no effort by the time the danger arises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was only when you returned that you later found that it was actually avian flu. I welcome the ban you have imposed on Thai chicken meat but you have not banned cooked meat or canned meat, and this accounts for about 75% of our imports from Thailand.</p>
<p class="contents">The Thai authorities have been found wanting in international compliance. They have hidden the Thai flu for maybe two months. If they protect their market from a deadly disease, surely they will protect it against minor infringements of EU standards. Will they run the same risk with cooked meats? Will we see nitrofuran residues and hormones entering the EU in this cooked meat? Is the public health of the EU overridden by the trade interests of EU exporters?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe Thailand should be completely delisted from all poultry meat exports until that country can prove it has the infrastructure and the integrity to apply EU standards all the time. Can we also have a labelling of country of origin for principal ingredients in processed food, because this is where most of this Thai cooked meat comes in? How can we be sure that meat cooked in Thailand has reached the correct temperature? There is perhaps a slight risk – how do we know? Cooked chicken may come into the UK frozen, then thaw and be eaten with no further treatment from the time the Thais cooked it. Is this a risk to our consumers?</p>
<p class="contents">The tariff for Thai cooked chicken meat is one seventh of that on frozen fresh chicken. Why is this so, Commissioner? This seems to be a loophole. Finally, has the disease moved to the United States of America? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are actually only a few questions of importance not only to the consumer, but also to the sector itself.</p>
<p class="contents">The very first question we have to ask is whether Europe finally determined what it is that we do not want to let in. I sometimes feel sorry for the Commissioner, because he can only implement what has been agreed in the Member States. The order did not become valid until 6 February. This means that the system governing the Commission’s relations with the Member States – after all, you cannot always do everything – probably still leaves something to be desired. Moreover, I wonder what the situation is as regards meat, because the order stipulates 1 January as the date on which imports are no longer permitted. What about meat that has been imported from those countries prior to that date?</p>
<p class="contents">My next question is as follows. I gather that there is now also a problem in the United States. Admittedly, it is not the real avian influenza as we know it in Asia, but it appears to be related. What do we do with those countries? What do the consumers want? They want the guarantee that they receive safe products. They also want sound information, which states that, since you normally do not eat raw meat, chicken meat in a different composition or other method of preparation can do no harm. Let us make sure we can provide this collective information.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of Members have already mentioned vaccines. I see this as an area in which Europe should develop far more resources and scope in order to act as one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While what has happened in Asia is unfortunate, we have to protect the European market, because it is an extremely large market for the poultry industry. I am concerned about the length of time it took the authorities in Asia to notify us of the outbreak. This is a very worrying aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to ask the Commissioner to give serious consideration to the depth of our scrutiny of the chicken Asia is producing and exporting to Europe. There is cause for grave concern. Our producers produce chicken and broiler chicken meat of an extremely high standard for the consumers in Europe. But the standard of chicken, not only from the Far East but also from other parts of the world, is seriously questionable. We can sit back on our laurels and wait and see. Before this ban is lifted again, Commissioner, I would like your assurance that you will do everything to ensure that our veterinary inspection in the Far East where the outbreaks took place is of the highest quality, and we accept no excuses.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also raise the point of the import of chicken feathers. This might not look like a problem, but I am told that it is the most serious way of exporting Asian bird flu to Europe.

It is certainly not my intention to draw a comparison between our Commissioner and that animal, but it is absolutely true that the Commission is often late in responding to certain epidemics of animal diseases. We saw this in the case of FMD and we are witnessing it again now. The Commissioner visited Thailand in early January and stated there, during his visit, that he was pleased about how the problem was being dealt with and that there was certainly no risk of avian influenza. Meanwhile, one month on, we are in the middle of a worldwide crisis. We in the CDA delegation in this House demand from the Commissioner that the line of approach similar to the one we have in the Netherlands, the so-called Veerman approach, should be extended Europe-wide: a ban on the imports of all poultry, so including cooked meat, from South-East Asia, a ban on the imports of ornamental birds, tighter control on flights from Asia and disinfectant mats on all international airports with direct or indirect connections to Asia. That is at the moment the only way of warding off this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I should like the Commissioner to shed light on the rumour that FMD has broken out in 26 towns in Vietnam. We can now fight the problem in good time and, if that is the case, we can ensure that, this time round, adequate measures are taken and we should not wait until the disaster has spread in South-East Asia again before we take action. We are in favour of supporting the Asian countries in the fight against avian influenza, but we in Europe should not be injecting funds into this while a number of countries ride roughshod over the quarantine measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission should start a worldwide debate on the fight against animal diseases. Similarly, preventive vaccination should gradually become a subject of discussion worldwide, from the point of view of both public and animal health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am deeply concerned about some of the issues that have been raised in this meeting today. Is this a matter of public health or public safety, or is it just a trade issue? I strongly believe that this is a matter of public health. I should like to ask the Commissioner how long it took him to decide to ban chicken from coming into the European Union? Is chicken that is still in transit coming into the European Union, or has that also been stopped? We heard from Mr Parish that there is a problem of cooked and chilled meats coming in. Why has it not been decided to ban all meats coming in? It is said that the flu virus is killed at 70 degrees – given an absolutely perfect situation – but we do not know how these products are cooked. Can you, Commissioner, guarantee the safety of children in my constituency? For example, schools in Bedford are using Thai chicken to prepare meals for the pupils. Can we totally guarantee their safety?</p>
<p class="contents">I have three direct questions for you, Commissioner. What are you doing to ensure the safety of meat coming into this country? How many qualified inspectors do we have today on our borders, checking the safety and quality of products coming into the European Union? You were asked what you were going to do about labelling. Can we guarantee the consumer that labelling will show the country of origin of production? It is particularly important that you look at this, Commissioner. This is not just about trade, it is about health. Mr Nicholson mentioned feathers. Have you stopped the import of feathers as of today? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ongoing helplessness of the specialists in the face of this epidemic led to a further sense of insecurity and resulted in a high number of casualties and also a climate of instability in society because it emphasised the deadly risk to anyone contracting the disease. Because I believe that life and health are the most precious assets we have, I must express my concern at this new epidemic: a form of flu whose virus comes from chickens and for which no cure has yet been found.</p>
<p class="contents">According to studies published recently by the scientific community, only one thing is certain: this disease is highly contagious. What can be done to counter it? Use vaccines? How effective are they? Draw boundaries around neighbourhoods, cities and countries and cut them off from the outside world? This is what happened 80 years ago and we all know what the outcome was. How safe are imports of this meat across the world? We all need more complete information at least so that the population at large is not gripped by panic. We have a duty to ensure that our actions contribute to making health policies accountable, as regards this new disease too, in the face of which we feel powerless. We must find out whether other animals in our food chain are equally at risk, because a few days ago pigs were said to be amongst the animals most vulnerable to this type of virus. To allay these legitimate concerns, all the necessary means must be made available to prevent and treat this epidemic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Animal disease now travels far and fast in types of farming and food distribution. That makes it very difficult to control.</p>
<p class="contents">In the age of global trade, retailers and manufacturers source their raw materials where they are cheapest, and the European poultry industry has struggled to compete with prices from south-east Asia and Brazil, where labour costs are very much lower. The UK alone imported 36 649 tonnes of poultry meat from Thailand in the first ten months of last year, a 50% increase on the previous year. But in the light of this flu virus we must maintain the strictest food safety standards here in the European Union, ensuring that all imports meet those very same high standards. Modern food systems mean that animal diseases travel far and travel quickly. The outbreak of avian flu in the Netherlands last year illustrated how hard the disease can be to contain.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission believe that all health authorities in the European Union would spot avian flu and be able to react decisively enough if it arrived on this continent? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I have been asked a number of questions and I will endeavour to answer as many as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">First, Mrs Jackson asks whether I am satisfied with the inspection services that we have, particularly in relation to our work in Asia. In relation to the FVO, I should say that I have not sent the FVO to Thailand in respect of this particular outbreak. The experts who are there, who have been offered by me, have been supplying their services through the World Health Organisation and are in place working with the OIE <span class="italic">in situ</span>, in Vietnam particularly. The FVO will be involved in this exercise only when it is believed there is something profitable to be gained from it, that is in circumstances where there is the possibility of lifting the ban. I have made it clear on a number of occasions publicly that it is not my intention to lift this ban on the importation of Thai chicken until such time as there is an independent evaluation of the situation there, in view of the history that a number of you have referred to. The evaluation will be made as a result of a visit from the inspectors of the FVO and following a report from them as to the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Jackson also asked me whether, in view of the likelihood of concealment, we are getting good information and whether we have a proper rapid response team in place. As I indicated in my earlier remarks, there is in existence an early warning response system. This system is in place, working from Luxembourg, and has been in operation for some time. You will remember when I reported to Parliament last year on the SARS issue, I also pointed to the work of this committee. There is a Communicable Diseases Network which also works in conjunction with the relevant authorities in the Member States. I am absolutely satisfied that the system of rapid response that we have in relation to animal and human diseases is very effective. You will remember the very quick response of the Commission and my services to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease some years ago, when the Commission responded within a matter of hours and all the relevant authorities and Member States knew within a matter of hours that there had been this outbreak in the United Kingdom. The same is true of public health because we have this system in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Mention was also made of the next item on Parliament's agenda: the legislation establishing the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. I can assure Parliament that the evidence is there that the Commission and other institutions of the European Union are working well to respond quickly to these kinds of issues and to give proper information to the public and, indeed, to respond well and appropriately to outbreaks of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of food labelling, there is Community law in place relating to labelling. It may need upgrading and I am looking at that. The legislation in place requires country of origin labelling and certification and stamps from countries such as Thailand. So, if cooked chicken from Thailand comes pre-packed it has a stamp on it which indicates that and the label also states the country of origin which, as I indicated in this case, is Thailand.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Roth-Behrendt asked me if we are doing enough in respect of avian flu and, in particular, blocking food products from Asia. It is important to emphasise that we do not trade in any poultry products with any country in Asia other than Thailand, so the responses given relate to that country. Of course we are concerned about the outbreak of animal and bird diseases in other parts of the world and we make sure that we respond properly to those issues.</p>
<p class="contents">As a number of people mentioned during this debate, we must not lose sight of the fact that we have had these outbreaks of avian influenza in the European Union also. We had an outbreak in Italy two or three years ago; we had an outbreak in the Netherlands last year; there have been outbreaks in Belgium and Germany too.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Roth-Behrendt also asked me what I am doing about imports from China. It is public knowledge that we banned imports from China some years ago; there was a lot of publicity about that at the time. There are a number of food products we do not import from China, including poultry.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of research into vaccinations, this is being done – DG Research does have a research programme on food safety. On this same subject which Mrs Roth-Behrendt and others referred to, an informal meeting of the health ministers of the EU and accession countries will be taking place in Brussels on Thursday evening. One of the items on the agenda is the question of the stockpiling of vaccines in respect of diseases of this kind, of which flu is obviously one. We had a discussion in Parliament last year on appropriate responses to the bioterrorism issue, such as stockpiling vaccines against smallpox. There is ongoing work in relation to that also. However, I must emphasise, as Mr Liese has said, that the competences available to us at European Union level in respect of public health issues are quite limited. An attempt was made to extend these competences in the European Convention and we made some progress. I still have hopes that we might ultimately make more progress on this before the finalisation of the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mulder asked me about the inspection systems. In his opinion inspections are not carried out at the same level for products coming in from outside the European Union. Under Commission Decision 2002/995/EC, all personal imports of meat in the luggage of passengers from Asia have been banned with the exception of small amounts of specialist food products, such as baby food. Under these rules, poultry meat and meat products carried by passengers cannot be introduced into the EU without conforming to the same health requirements as commercial imports. As I said earlier, no commercial imports of poultry meat are allowed from any Asian country where the disease is present.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf then asked me whether I reacted quickly or only when the press publicised this issue. As has been indicated by a number of other speakers, I was in Asia when this outbreak became public. I had been in Vietnam, from where we do not import any poultry meat, so the issue does not arise there. But I had also been in Thailand. It is public knowledge that in the early part of the week when I was there, there was some lack of transparency, if could express it in that way. I was concerned during the couple of days I was there at the mounting circumstantial evidence tending in the other direction. Following pressing questions from me, it was made clear to me two or three days later that in fact avian flu was present, both in the human and bird populations. I am satisfied that my presence in Thailand helped to improve transparency in relation to this issue. As soon as the presence of avian flu was confirmed to me on 23 January, I put a ban in place within a matter of hours. The ban went in place on that Friday at 12 o'clock, Brussels time. Any suggestion that the Commission reacted slowly is incorrect. I cannot imagine any greater degree of surveillance or monitoring than the Commissioner being there himself, asking questions, not being satisfied with the answers, pressing further, getting the truth and acting within hours.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Gollnisch asked me about the risk of contamination of the United States virus. It is believed, but not yet confirmed, that this virus is a low pathogenic virus and therefore would not require the same degree of response as for the Asian influenza from Thailand. However, that is not confirmed, we are still looking at it and our response will depend on our information. I assure him that the lifting of the ban will only take place after independent evaluation of the circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Fiori asked me about pet birds and other birds. A ban has been put in place in respect of the importation of pet birds. He asked me about coordinating groups. There is a regulatory committee of the EU, which includes Member States' experts, who deal with that. He asked me about links between globalisation and diseases. The OIE in Paris continues evaluating the situation. The Commission is a member of that, Member States are involved. They are meeting later this month in relation to this issue. The SPS Agreement is also a relevant contributor to the protection of animal and public health in relation to the WTO issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr de Roo asked me about borders. Once again, I refer back to the lack of competences that we have in relation to borders and communicable diseases, but I hope more progress will be made on this. I refer him also to my earlier answer that the health ministers are meeting later this week to deal with many of the issues that he raised about the public health aspect and in particular vaccinations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Parish said that it was only when I returned that I discovered there was a problem and that I reacted well. As I indicated earlier, that was not the case; I reacted while I was there and the Commission responded well to this issue. We have not banned cooked meats for the reasons that have been stated. I am advised that cooked meats above 60 degrees – and we put in a safety margin of another 10 degrees – are safe for human consumption. The inspectors in the European Union, and in the Member States themselves, know what is necessary and carry out appropriate inspections to ensure that there are no breaches of Community law in relation to this issue. He also referred to labelling and I refer him to my earlier answer.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Oomen-Ruijten asked me whether we followed the Member States' lead in this. The actual chronology of events is that on 23 January the Commission put in place the ban in circumstances I have already outlined; Member States responded with the regulatory committee confirming that ban on 6 February; and a further ban was put in place in respect of feathers – Mr Nicholson asked me about that – on 28 January.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sturdy asked me how long it took for the ban to be put in place. I have already answered that question.</p>
<p class="contents">There were a number of questions in relation to the number of inspectors at the border posts. This is a Member State competence. The Member States themselves make sure that they have enough officials to ensure that the importation is properly inspected. The Food and Veterinary Office inspectors monitor this when they carry out their inspections. They report, and the reports are public. There are no reports of any concerns in relation to this.</p>
<p class="contents">On labelling, I refer you to my earlier answer.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning feathers, again I refer you to my earlier answer: that ban has been in place since 28 January.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Cardoso made reference to the vulnerability of pigs and I would confirm that this is a concern and is being watched very closely. There have been reports of some infection found in the noses of some pigs in Vietnam, but it has not extended any further and there has been no evidence of mutation of the flu virus. This is, however, being watched very closely because of the similarity between the immune system of pigs and of humans. Therefore, as she rightly points out, it is of considerable concern.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wyn asked me whether the health authorities are doing everything that they can to stop the spread of this disease. I am impressed by the work undertaken by my own staff. I have had detailed consultations and briefings and I am satisfied that their own work, their interaction with the WHO, the FAO and the OIE, and also their interaction with the experts in the Member States, indicate to me that this issue is being taken very seriously, that the officials, at both national and international level, understand the seriousness of this and that they are doing everything in their power to ensure that the disease is not spread.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the difficulties being faced in some poorer areas is that the stamping-out of the disease is best achieved by killing the birds in question. This is of course a matter of concern in poor countries, because unless the authorities involved face up to the question of compensation there is a risk that a disease of this kind may be hidden. That may be a contributing factor to the earlier lack of full transparency about this issue in that part of the world. This has to be faced and we have to emphasise it in our relations with the authorities in Member States. These kinds of diseases cannot be hidden, their presence will come out, will be known, and the consequences ultimately will be worse for those countries who engage in that exercise, because they undermine the confidence of the authorities engaged in food safety, like ours in the European Union. The stringent measures necessary before the ban is lifted in Thailand, with the requirement that there will be independent evaluation, will be particularly necessary in this instance because of the lack of transparency at an earlier stage. We must be assured that our own authorities are satisfied, which is why no lifting of the ban in Thailand will take place until the FVO has carried out an inspection on the ground and reported back that things are satisfactory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The items he mentions as requiring financing are being financed. The question is: under what heading will they be dealt with? If it is believed to be necessary to transfer from one budget heading to another and that this is the best way of dealing with it, then this can be done. This matter is under review. However, it is important to emphasise that the items he mentions as requiring financing are not being under-financed. They are being financed. Whatever refinement may be necessary in the future can be dealt with at that time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
