<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicolas Schmit,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council.</span> <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Uzbekistan remains extremely serious, with President Karimov continuing to reject calls for an international inquiry into the recent tragic events. According to the various reports, over 500 Uzbek refugees are still in Kyrgyzstan.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s efforts are currently focused on two aims, namely to put pressure on President Karimov for an international inquiry, and to assist the refugees in Kyrgyzstan. In the longer term, however, we cannot neglect the need to promote democracy, the rule of law and human rights in the region, as well as to push ahead with internal reforms in Uzbekistan.</p>
<p class="contents">At the start of the events in Andijan, the Presidency published a statement, dated 14 May 2005, expressing serious concern at the situation and inviting the parties to refrain from violence and to find a peaceful solution. The Council followed developments in Uzbekistan closely and discussed this issue at the highest level. On 23 May 2005, it adopted conclusions on the situation in eastern Uzbekistan. These conclusions sent an urgent, clear and relevant message to the Uzbek authorities. The Council expressed its grave concern at the latest developments in eastern Uzbekistan and roundly condemned the excessive and disproportionate use of force by the Uzbek security forces.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council urged the Uzbek authorities to comply with their international obligations in terms of democracy, the rule of law and human rights. It also invited them to allow the humanitarian agencies and other international organisations immediate and unfettered access to the region concerned. Additionally, the Council stressed the need to deal with the underlying causes of instability in the country through in-depth internal reforms to be implemented by the Uzbek authorities. The Council will coordinate its action with the OSCE and other members of the international community such as the Russian Federation and the USA, in order to provide its support to the reform process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s message to the Uzbek authorities is therefore clear: we stand ready to help you, but only if a peaceful and lasting solution can be found to the present situation, and if internal reforms are implemented to deal with the deeper causes of the country’s instability. On 1 June 2005, the local British presidency in Tashkent approached the Uzbek Foreign Minister, Mr Ganiev, asking him to request the Uzbek authorities to reconsider their rejection of an independent international inquiry and to draw his attention to the country’s international obligations. The invitation by the Uzbek authorities to EU ambassadors resident in Tashkent to observe the national investigation into the events in Andijan, an inquiry to be conducted by the Public Prosecutor and the Uzbek Parliament, is not acceptable as a valid alternative to an independent international inquiry. The Secretary-General/High Representative, Mr Solana, decided to send his personal representative on human rights, Mr Matthiessen, to Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. His mission had to be aborted because the Uzbek authorities refused to grant him a visa. The Council views this episode as a very disappointing – indeed worrying – development in relations between the European Union and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite President Karimov’s continuing refusal to demands for an independent international inquiry into events in Andijan, the Council will continue to insist and, in conjunction with the OSCE, the UN and other international organisations will coordinate the operational procedures for such an inquiry, in the event that the Uzbek authorities reconsider their decision. The Council will take appropriate measures in the light of the reply from the Uzbek authorities and the results of the possible inquiry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have been shocked by the appalling loss of life. We are concerned by the resulting movements of people away from the violence over the border with Kyrgyzstan and by the reported excessive and disproportionate use of force by the Uzbek security forces.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear to the Commission that the people of Uzbekistan urgently need to work towards a peaceful and sustainable solution to the present situation. The Commission notes the suggestion made by the Uzbek authorities in relation to the international inquiry contained in the letter of 31 May from President Karimov to United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, a copy of which was sent to Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner. It is essential that the Uzbek authorities immediately allow a full independent international inquiry into the recent events. The Commission considers it important that dialogue is maintained and that it is possible for diplomatic envoys to transmit messages to Uzbekistan.</p>
<p class="contents">Even before the shocking recent events, the Commission was working to bolster Uzbekistan’s fragile reform process. We have to be realistic about what can be achieved, but I believe that working, for example, with the Uzbek Parliament to help create a modern legislature is crucial to improving the lot of the Uzbek people.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have seen in Uzbekistan in recent weeks, following the events in Andijan – not only the appalling loss of life, but the response by the authorities to international criticism and the reported crack-down on human rights groups and defenders – only underlines how important it is to keep the reform process alive. This would be the worst possible moment to pull out or to isolate the country. At the same time, however, this does not mean business as usual.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already sent a delegation of officials to Uzbekistan to investigate what more we can do to support reforms and importantly, to improve living conditions in the Fergana Valley. In the coming weeks, we shall be finalising our proposals to be implemented under the TACIS programme. Our existing poverty reduction programme for the Fergana Valley works in all three countries – Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan – amongst which the valley is divided. There is some scope within our existing resources to do more and the Commission is determined that the opportunity is not missed.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, we will continue to work to the TACIS technical assistance programme to promote social and economic reforms, both at the governmental and grassroots civil society level.</p>
<p class="contents">While pushing for a fully independent investigation into the events that have already taken place, we must not lose sight of how those who took part in the unrest may yet be treated. It is clear that the authorities regard all participation as criminal. In this context, the Commission is looking at a range of projects, including improving the management of prisons and treatment of detainees.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission commends the cooperation between the authorities in Kyrgyzstan – who have been faced with a very difficult humanitarian situation – and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. We therefore welcome the recent decision to relocate the asylum seekers, who currently number 475, away from the border region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The brutality with which the Uzbek Government has responded is setting the earth smouldering in Uzbekistan. In that light, the European Union cannot afford to remain on the fence, for we, including the European Parliament, have a solid relationship with that country. After all, we also have a cooperation delegation for Central Asia. Every year, the European Union spends EUR 10 million in aid to Uzbekistan, including a sum for the Uzbek parliament. In the 2005 budget, I tabled an amendment against this with the intention of freezing part of the budget. Unfortunately, the amendment was rejected by a majority of one vote. That is odd, since the majority of political parties in Uzbekistan were forbidden to take part in the parliamentary elections.</p>
<p class="contents">What is now needed is for the European Union to exert more pressure to get reforms implemented and the legal structure improved. In addition, all aid that passes via the government or parliament should be frozen, for European resources should not be used to fund state repression. Civil society and NGOs also need to be supported, and the freedom of the press and religion guaranteed, for it is too crazy for words that churches, among others, should be obstructed and harassed despite being completely unconnected with religious fundamentalism, let alone terrorism or anything else. In the long run, the political pressure will need to lead to more political freedom and fresh elections. This is essential, for Uzbekistan, albeit still a poverty-stricken country, has a growing economy. It is crucial to stability in the region that economic growth should go hand in hand with true democracy and freedom of expression of opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall not revert to the account of recent events in Uzbekistan, but I should like to reaffirm the need for a rapid and determined response by the European Parliament to the extremely serious situation for the local population, and particularly for the refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the tragic events in Andijan, I would firstly stress the overriding need to set up an international commission of inquiry as soon as possible, to clarify what happened and oblige the Karimov government to face up to its responsibilities. Additionally, the Union must act with the NGOs and the office of the High Commissioner for Refugees to ensure that refugees on the Kyrgyzstan border are well treated.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must also urge Uzbekistan to implement in-depth reforms and put the country on the path to true democracy and economic development for the benefit of all of its citizens. The proliferation of arbitrary imprisonment and the use of torture and execution must stop, once and for all. Respect for freedom of expression, and freedom of the press, but also freedom of NGOs, are preconditions for the smooth running of our partnership and cooperation agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise that the ferment of popular demonstrations and confusion in Uzbekistan is rooted in depressed economic and social conditions, in poverty and in powerlessness in the face of corruption. Should we use a stick and carrot approach? If the Tacis programme, with scrupulous monitoring of the allocation of funds, is to continue, we can remind the Karimov government that partnership and cooperation agreements are subject to strict compliance with the clauses on democracy and respect for human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Honourable Members, today I urge you to show your support for a general resolution condemning the particularly violent reprisals undertaken by Uzbek President Islam Karimov [against protesters] in Andijan. The President ordered the shooting of people who merely wished for true democracy and real change. In actual fact, this is a recurrence of the events at Tiananmen Square, and we must present a fair and adequate evaluation of these events. The nations of Central Asia suffer continuous violations of human rights, and restrictions imposed on the activities of the opposition and mass media. The development of a civil society in that region is insufficient. Uzbekistan is a country with the most stringent authoritarian regime in the region. The country lacks an independent and fair system of courts and freedoms of expression and religion; the activities of opposition parties and civil society are prohibited, the freedom of press is banned and reprisals and torture by the militia are widespread. Although the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan raises some hopes for a long-term democratic process, the latest events in the Uzbek town of Andijan and the following reactions of neighbouring Central Asian republics are a matter of great concern to us. The events in Andijan are the expression of the resistance of the Uzbek nation against oppression. The European Parliament cannot stay aloof. We need to know what has happened and what is happening now in order for adequate measures to be taken. We demand an independent investigation of the events. We urge America to renounce the deployment of its military forces in Uzbekistan, which requires huge payments that essentially contribute to the further strengthening of President Karimov’s regime. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen: the priorities of our Parliament should continue to target the prevention of violence and bloodshed. We must spare no efforts in strengthening civil society and the freedom of speech.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The human rights organisation Human Rights Watch, having interviewed 50 witnesses, all of whose statements concurred, described the result as ‘a massacre’. The extent of the shooting was so enormous and its character so random and disproportionate, that it would not be unreasonable to describe it as butchery.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in total agreement with the remarks of both the Council and the Commission, and certainly with Mr Borg when he says that we cannot continue as if nothing has happened, as if it were ‘business as usual’. We in the European Union must give a strong message to this dictatorial and highly authoritarian regime, and so I agree with those Members who insist on more political pressure, on speeding up reforms, on stopping aid from passing via the government or parliament and allowing only grant aid via NGOs; this international enquiry must be mounted, otherwise we cannot simply continue the cooperation and partnership agreement we have concluded with Uzbekistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Uzbekistan has no historic traditions of democracy or good governance, having been ruled in the distant past by Khanates, followed by Tsarists and Soviet Russia, only to find itself unexpectedly a sovereign state in 1991, following the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Inevitably the then existing Uzbek nomenclatura filled the power vacuum; hence the composition of the current regime.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no doubt that President Karimov has ruled in an authoritarian way and human rights abuses have been common, particularly against the Islamic movement of Uzbekistan, a close ally of the then Taliban in Afghanistan but now largely defeated or replaced by the nominally peaceful, although still fundamentalist, Hizb ut-Tahrir, which rather surprisingly has offices in the European Union to gather funds and recruit supporters.</p>
<p class="contents">During the recent debate on the Coveney human rights report, I tried to strike a balance between the stick of Uzbekistan-bashing and the carrot of more dialogue with the Uzbek President if he continues to cooperate with fighting international terrorism and delivers on his commitment to give independence to the judiciary, freedom to the press and punishment to those responsible for torture and human rights abuses. Sadly, no sooner had we adopted this report than the Andizhan tragedy occurred. The full story is still very confused. Who were these 23 prisoners bounced out of prison by armed insurgents? Who took civilian hostages to negotiate with the regional governor? Who called the crowds out to protest? And who gave the orders for the troops to shoot innocent protestors?</p>
<p class="contents">I of course deeply regret Mr Karimov’s refusal of an international inquiry and so I call upon the OSCE to involve the little-known Moscow mechanism last used with Turkmenistan, also an authoritarian regime, to impose an international inquiry and to report with or without Uzbekistan’s consent. This method, to my mind, is more likely to produce a result than any other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I find the very idea that the West and Europe consider Islam Karimov an ally to be genuinely concerning, because no one who uses terrorist methods against his own people can be considered an ally.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Parliament and the Commission ought to firmly insist on the creation of an international commission of inquiry that can clarify who was responsible for the massacre.

<p class="contents">Europe has to be able to clearly distinguish itself in the eyes of the Uzbek people, both from the reason of state of the Russian and Chinese Governments, and from the outright cynicism of Washington, which continues to pay out millions of dollars to Karimov in exchange for military bases. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If this does not succeed, it could lead to destabilisation not just in Uzbekistan, but also in the wider region of Central Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">Demands for an independent international investigation have already been expressed by the UN through the High Commissioner for Human Rights, by the European Union through its Council and by the OSCE through the Chairman-in-Office of that organisation. In this light we can of course merely support the decisions of the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and others that wish to participate in resolving this extraordinarily complex and challenging issue must be entirely clear about the causes, the course and the consequences of these tragic events. I believe that alongside the investigation that has been demanded any number of times, there must be a comprehensive analysis of the sources of any further potential destabilisation in Uzbekistan. I am convinced that the exceptionally complex state of affairs cannot be attributed simply to terrorism or religious fundamentalism. We should not allow ourselves the luxury of superficial diagnosis, since that could lead to mistaken policies. Certain other elements of instability have already been mentioned here today.</p>
<p class="contents">What is essential for the European Union is that we should make every effort to ensure that within a democratic framework Uzbekistan can arrive at stability and introduce reforms, which would lead to a simplification of the internal political dialogue and then take the country to a higher level of democracy and economic progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is not in our, or anyone’s, interest. We have to concede that there are fundamentalist elements in that country, but they must not be used as a pretext for keeping the Uzbek people in a straightjacket, because that is precisely what is happening. The government of President Karimov uses this spectre, this more or less genuine threat from fundamentalists, as a way of keeping his oppressive regime in power.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we must keep up the pressure on the Uzbek Government and on President Karimov. We must urge him to accept an international inquiry and clearly show our solidarity. From that point of view, the resolution you are about to adopt is important. We must make it clear that the European Union will not tolerate the attitudes and policies seen in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">Far from destabilising the country, this solidarity must be a way of stabilising it in order to foster democracy, because that is our aim.

ECHO is monitoring the situation on the ground and, should the need arise, the Commission would be able to quickly mobilise humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said in my introductory remarks, we believe that we must remain engaged with TACIS programmes, which deal essentially with democratic and economic reforms, these being at the root of the problems that have arisen. The Commission has already allocated EUR 3 million of assistance to the Uzbek enclaves in Kyrgyz territory for poverty reduction, cross-border cooperation and avoidance of an escalation of tension in this volatile area.</p>
