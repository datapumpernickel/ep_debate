The Commission adopted this proposal for a third directive on the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing less than a year ago! And today it is before this House. This testifies to the importance of this text.</p>
<p class="contents">Work has progressed fast because all the institutions of the European Union have been fully dedicated to ensuring that the European Union is equipped with state<span class="bold">–</span>of<span class="bold">–</span>the<span class="bold">–</span>art defences in the field. This directive builds on existing Community texts and incorporates into Community law the revised 40 recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force on money laundering and terrorist financing.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive tightens the controls in the financial sector against money launderers and terrorist financers and strengthens cooperation between countries. Not only will the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing benefit from this, but so will the integrity and stability of the financial sector. The EU is also setting an example for other countries in the world to follow and match.</p>
<p class="contents">The third anti<span class="bold">–</span>money laundering directive will prohibit money laundering as well as terrorist financing. It is applicable to the financial sector as well as to lawyers, notaries, accountants, real estate agents and casinos, trust and company service providers as well as all providers of goods when payments are made in cash in excess of EUR 15 000. These people need, firstly, to identify and verify the identity of their customer and of its beneficial owner and to monitor transactions with the customer, while taking into account a risk<span class="bold">–</span>based approach; secondly, to report suspicions on money laundering and terrorist financing to the national financial intelligence unit; and, thirdly, to take supporting measures, such as record keeping, training of personnel and the establishment of internal policies and procedures. The directive is completed with a section on supervision and offers the possibility to take implementing measures.</p>
<p class="contents">With this updated system we have progressed enormously. I should like in particular to underline the following elements.</p>
<p class="contents">The cooperation between the European Parliament, the presidency and the Commission on this directive has been extremely constructive. This shows not only the willingness to have a fast<span class="bold">–</span>track adoption at first reading, but also the priority that all of us give to combating money laundering and fighting terrorist financing.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I especially appreciated the fact that we have all shown a sincere desire to achieve a compromise on the main issues, i.e. the definition of the beneficial owner, the definition of and the application of enhanced due diligence in respect of politically exposed persons, the coverage of trusts and lawyers and last, but not least, comitology.</p>
<p class="contents">In respect of comitology, I underline that in the actual situation the Commission as a maximum is willing to accept a sunset clause. This clause provides for the suspension of the comitology procedure four years after the entry into force of the directive. In accordance with Article 251 of the Treaty, these measures may be renewed by Parliament and the Council on a proposal from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Parliament in advance for making a first reading agreement possible and in particular I would like to congratulate warmly Mr Nassauer, Mr Muscat and the shadow rapporteurs on the quality of their work and thank them for the extremely constructive spirit in which they have produced their report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hartmut Nassauer (PPE–DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union first adopted regulations aimed at combating money laundering in 1991. These prohibited the laundering of money from drug trafficking, and obligations were imposed primarily on financial service providers, or in other words on banks. In 2001, the scope of the Money Laundering Directive was expanded to cover a much broader range of offences. Most importantly, its obligations were extended to cover a much larger number of professions, in particular lawyers and notaries. This gave rise to considerable controversy at the time, and rightly so, because it raised questions such as whether lawyers would have to disclose confidential information they had learnt from their clients. A compromise was reached at the time, which remains in force today.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s rules are based on recommendations from the ominous<span class="bold">–</span>sounding FATF – the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering – which is a G7 body. These recommendations set out harmonised rules on combating money laundering, and are especially useful in that they are also applied in other countries outside the EU. It is, therefore, only sensible for us to incorporate these rules into our legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The task now before us is to amend the money laundering regulations for the third time. There are three reasons for this; firstly, the FATF – to which I have already referred – altered its recommendations in the summer of 2003, and these changes must now be transposed into law. Secondly, the Commission had in any case been asked to provide a definition of the term ‘serious offence’, which it had failed to do last time. The third reason, and perhaps the most important, is that the Directive will now also prohibit the financing of terrorism. No one would dispute the need for this instrument in the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">We agreed to adopt this Directive in a single reading. Of course, this meant that intense and complex negotiations were necessary in order to accommodate the interests not only of Parliament, but also of the Commission and the Council before today’s deadline. I am glad to say that we achieved this goal, but we were forced to make compromises in order to do so. What I am presenting to the House does not therefore correspond entirely to my own ideas, but unfortunately that is the nature of compromise. Parliament was prepared to play its part to ensure that the Directive could be adopted as speedily as possible, so that instruments for combating money laundering and terrorism could be made available without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the issue of impact assessment, there can be no disputing the fact that we must do something to stop money laundering and the financing of terrorism. I should like to point out, however, that we have been presented with this Directive before we have had a chance to assess properly how effective the Second Directive has been. It goes without saying that the new Directive will mean more bureaucracy and extra costs for financial service providers, lawyers and tax consultants, and in this day and age we must make quite sure that the demands we make of those concerned bear a reasonable relationship to the benefit we expect to derive. It has not yet been possible to verify whether this is the case, and the conclusion I would draw from this is that no further amendments should be tabled before this House for the foreseeable future, or until the issue of whether our endeavours in this field serve any real purpose has been settled.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of improvements have been made to the Directive, and these include the incorporation of a risk<span class="bold">–</span>based approach, which will make it possible to refrain from further measures if the latter are not mandatory from the outset. This approach is now enshrined in the Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I should briefly like to touch upon three points of contention. As a general rule, the Directive requires clients, for example of a bank, to be identified. It further stipulates that a bank must inform the authorities if it suspects that money laundering is taking place. It follows from this that the beneficial owners of legal entities must also be identified, and the question arises, with regard to public limited companies for example, of the number of shares that must be held in order to be regarded as a beneficial owner. We agreed on a compromise of 25%. As was to be expected, problems relating to politically exposed persons, or PEPs, caused somewhat of a stir in the House. I would note, however, that this Directive is not in actual fact aimed at MEPs, but at persons who are guilty of money laundering or similar offences, and we were forced to find a way of making this rule workable. We therefore came to a compromise whereby the residents of a Member State will be exempt from special surveillance measures, but that the latter will apply to residents of other Member States. It is open to debate as to whether this is a good idea, but that was the compromise that was reached.</p>
<p class="contents">As a final point, I have every sympathy for the attempts that lawyers naturally made to gain exemption from this Directive, particularly in view of the fact that it was only when the latter was amended for the second time that they were included in its scope. I myself would have been prepared to make the relevant changes, but I must admit that my pleas to both the Commission and the Council in this regard fell on deaf ears, and so the rules in question have essentially stayed the same. At least some progress has been made, however, in that it has now been made clear that lawyers do not have to disclose information to which they become privy during confidential legal consultations or legal representation.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank Mr Peillon and Mr Muscat, as well as Baroness Ludford, for their cooperation, which made it possible for us to conclude the matter at first reading. I would ask Members to vote in favour of this draft report tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to begin by endorsing what Mr Muscat said. In our committee it is always very difficult to get interpretation into the mother tongue from even large countries – Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic; countries that are now at the heart of our European Union. However, if we cannot speak in mother tongue languages in this Chamber, where it is known that we have an interest in the debate taking place, what kind of European Union do we have? I just want to endorse in the strongest terms what has been said here today by Mr Muscat.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope I will get injury time on Mr Muscat’s behalf for saying that, because I now want to make some warm remarks about the rapporteur, Mr Nassauer. I want to thank him for the work he has done at a time when he was enormously engaged in the REACH proposals, which are now before our committee. He has taken a subject of real public relevance: the security of the citizen and how best we ensure it. He has found an effective compromise and I hope our own amendments in the IMCO Committee, of which he is also a distinguished member, will support that. He has been able to tread the perilous path between alarmism on the one hand and complacency on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">My main concern with the amendments we tabled was to ensure that ordinary consumers would not be disproportionately inconvenienced in carrying out financial transactions, whilst we know that we need to combat money laundering. This, of course, is not the first money laundering definition.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know whether Thomas Jefferson would approve, but the times in which we live need a balance to be struck between liberty and security. However, we do not want to exchange one category of vulnerability for another. The vulnerable citizen can be made vulnerable by excessive security measures, as well as by the processes of terrorists themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Just at the time that our committee was describing these matters, a terrorist bank raid took place in Northern Ireland – the largest bank raid in the history of that province. That shows the importance today of stopping up the areas where terrorists operate and finance themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The various draftsmen of opinions from the different committees have all provided the expertise which was properly supportive of what Mr Nassauer has done. This is a compromise to which the banks, the lawyers, the accountants, the notaries and the ordinary citizen can look with confidence. I hope this dossier will, therefore, be concluded at first reading. Terrorists cannot succeed unless they have the financial means with which to do so. We, however, need to measure our response to this unprecedented terrorism with the needs of the citizens’ own defences for the sake of civil liberties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I was responsible for drafting the opinion of the Legal Affairs Committee, which concentrated on two aspects: the position of lawyers and the process regarding, in particular, the review under the second directive. When I say the position of lawyers, I mean not just lawyers but also their clients and their clients’ access to justice. All of us know that Parliament has received a number of petitions from bar organisations around Europe. There have been legal challenges in Member States and, indeed, similar legislation had to be repealed in Canada because of a constitutional challenge. There are therefore concerns about the position of lawyers. It is with some sadness that we note that not all the amendments tabled by the Legal Affairs Committee in this regard were adopted. Having said that, we are happy to accept the compromises.</p>
<p class="contents">However, with regard to the review, I asked the Commissioner in a written question if the review could still go ahead. He assured me that it would be completed by 2006. I would ask him to reiterate that assurance tonight and, if possible, tomorrow morning before we vote, so that lawyers at least know their position will be subject to review. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Union, the Member States and the citizens must be protected by stepping up the fight against money laundering. The perpetrators of this crime must not be allowed to take advantage of the free movement of capital and the free provision of financial services.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also address the issue of terrorist financing. We are aware that these are two different crimes. Money laundering is the concealment of the proceeds of criminal activity and lies at the heart of organised crime. If we succeed in combating it, we will substantially weaken international organised crime networks. Terrorist financing can also involve the use of goods acquired legally to finance terrorism; in other words, it does not necessarily follow that a crime has been committed but the act of financing, in and of itself, constitutes a crime.</p>
<p class="contents">A further objective is to widen the scope of the directive to cover other categories of profession, whilst ensuring that measures remain proportionate. I welcome the fact that the compromise reached in the second directive, preserving the relationship of trust between lawyers and clients, has been retained. The principle of confidentiality between lawyer and client is fundamental to an effective legal defence.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to raise three key issues: firstly, coordination and cooperation between financial intelligence units, which must be provided with adequate resources to carry out their work; secondly, those Member States that have yet to transpose the second directive on money laundering must do so at the earliest opportunity; thirdly and lastly, current legislation on money laundering must, as a matter of urgency, be assessed to monitor its relevance and its practical impact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our work with the rapporteur was very constructive, for which I thank him quite particularly. Parliament’s positions have been heard by the Council, which has made it possible to reach a compromise, particularly with regard to three essential points that we support.</p>
<p class="contents">For the legal professions, we did not want to go back on the experience of the previous directive. That enables us to retain a balance between the obligations regarding verification and identification requirements and the preservation of the right to a fair hearing and of individual freedom. We very much regret, nevertheless, that the threshold for cash payments was not reduced to EUR 10 000 and that the threshold for percentage share holdings remains at 10%. Similarly, we think it would have been preferable for casino customers to be identified and their identity verified for a sum of EUR 1 000.</p>
<p class="contents">One problem remains, namely that of tax and banking havens, some of which are still active on European territory. In this respect, we find it regrettable that the amendment put forward in committee by Mr Costa and Mr Peillon was not retained. I would like to add that the issue of judicial and police cooperation remains central and decisive in the context of the fight against money laundering, even though it is not covered by this directive. Currently, the Member States still create too many obstacles for this cooperation to operate satisfactorily and to be effective. We find this regrettable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission adopted the proposal for the third directive only about a year ago and today it is before us for decision. We have cooperated closely with the other institutions to complete it all in one reading. I pay a very sincere tribute to the skill and cooperative attitude of Mr Nassauer as the rapporteur. He has done a very good job.</p>
<p class="contents">The third directive brings in limited but useful changes from the second directive. The great improvement – the theme of this directive – is the clear emphasis on a risk<span class="bold">–</span>sensitive approach, so that there is a ‘know<span class="bold">–</span>the<span class="bold">–</span>customer’ obligation, including identifying the true owners of companies – the beneficial owners – which is higher if there is a higher risk of tainted funds. Obviously, it is necessary to apply stricter money<span class="bold">–</span>laundering controls in situations of higher risk, but I hope this will also mean slimming down with a simplified due diligence, as it is called, when possible. At present, there are thousands – perhaps even hundreds of thousands – of alerts of suspicious transactions every year across the EU. However, I fear that watchdogs often lose sight of the wood for the trees, and there needs to be more concentration on the really serious, suspicious transactions and breaking the criminal and terrorist financing networks.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that in implementing the directive it will be possible for banks to be more proportionate and targeted in their checks so that individual honest citizens trying to open a bank account are not swamped in red tape, while the arms traffickers, criminal gangs and greedy dictators slip through the net.</p>
<p class="contents">The one, also useful, improvement is that this new directive will simplify the process, hopefully, for European citizens wanting to open a bank account in another EU country, as that bank will not have to carry out further identity checks. Therefore, it reduces bureaucratic burdens on EU citizens and marks a practical step in making a reality of living in Europe and crossing boundaries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we reached a satisfactory solution on trusts, making clear that the widespread and valuable use of this Anglo<span class="bold">–</span>Saxon vehicle in commercial and financial markets will not be prejudiced so that the City of London can sleep peacefully at night knowing that markets like the International Bond Market will continue to innovate and prosper for the benefit of the European Union as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like, however, to highlight certain aspects that give rise to further thought. We are debating the third directive without a clear insight into what have been the effects of the second directive. This excessive and erratic haste, which should have led us to assess money laundering also in terms of the fight against terrorism, has, in my opinion, led us to rush through the process, when further reflection was required.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I believe that excessive attention has been paid to the matter of suspicion, when perhaps we should concentrate more on certainties, by ensuring individual guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect, which, in my opinion, remains unresolved, concerns the thorny question of lawyers. On this matter, I believe that the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs forcefully lays down some points for reflection that Parliament must consider further. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Mr Nassauer says, we do not actually have any evidence that the existing legislation works, so making it tighter is hardly justifiable at this time. The European Union is going out of its way, as usual, to make life difficult for ordinary businesses and citizens, and hindering business activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Much more sinister, in my opinion, is the obligation on professional advisers not to inform their clients when they report suspicious transactions to the authorities. Turning professionals into secret informers erodes trust within society and marks the beginning of a police state. A better way to address terrorism is to know who is entering and leaving our countries. Alas, with the ongoing disagreements about how to police our borders and the drive for indefinite expansion of the Union, the prospect of reliable border controls is becoming ever more remote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was no mean feat to coordinate all these amendments and to conduct negotiations. The reason why this report is so important is that money laundering is not a trivial offence, and this is a point I should like to make to a number of previous speakers; it is a criminal act, and in fact one of the most serious, as it is both economically damaging and associated with extortion, drug trafficking and suchlike. These are all facts that must not be forgotten.</p>

It is for this reason that I regard it as so important that a report be tabled in this House in two years’ time to explain how effective these measures have in fact been.</p>

In the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on which I sit, we have agreed that it is not enough for us to work at combating terrorism as a crime, but that we must also look into the causes of the global spread of terrorism and into where the money comes from. To myself, as a former member of the Swedish parliament, it has long been clear that not only terrorism but also much of the criminal activity in our countries is financed on the basis of everything from the drug trade, legal and illicit gambling, prostitution and the trade in sex slaves to transfers of funds between banks and countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, we MEPs too have to be monitored like any other citizens. I hope that the directive will lead to wider discussion in our home countries of what is known as dirty money. The fact is that money laundering does not only finance terrorism. It also corrupts our societies and is thus a threat to democracy.

The Commission fully endorses the agreement and accepts all amendments that form part of the compromise package agreed with the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
