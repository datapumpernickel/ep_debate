The Union has a strategy for acidification, and this proposal relates to legislation to limit the sulphur content of liquid fuel oils. As we know, sulphur falls to the earth, acidifies the soil and does harm to nature. It also causes damage to buildings. It thus has many kinds of adverse effects.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at the common position of the Council of Ministers we could say the European Parliament has already in fact convinced the Council, in certain respects, of the justification for our views. The Council has acted as we hoped it would: the Council and the Commission have, for example, jointly decided to start fixing limits for the sulphur content of fuel oils used on ships. This is undoubtedly to be seen as a step forward. The Council has also approved in principle the view of Parliament that the sulphur content of light fuel oil should be limited far more drastically than was originally intended. This is also highly satisfactory. The problem remains, however, that the Council"s common position, which is a unanimous compromise, will mean this reduction in the sulphur content of light fuel oil will not take place until the start of 2008, and that can hardly be regarded at this stage as a hugely radical move. We really are talking about very long transition periods if we start to enact laws now that will not come into force until the year 2008. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection therefore proposes a compromise of sorts, which is that this stricter sulphur content limit for light fuel oil should come into force by the year 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the very important question of how the sulphur content of heavy fuel oil should be limited. The difference of opinion that still exists between the Council of Ministers and Parliament"s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, when the common position is examined, lies in the fact that the Council is only prepared to apply a limit to the sulphur content of heavy fuel oil as from the start of 2003. Now the Committee is suggesting that we should reach a reasonable compromise here too, with an amendment to come into force by the start of the year 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a certain aspect of this report that is perhaps sometimes forgotten: Finland, Sweden and Austria, when they joined the Union, gained the right to maintain tighter environmental requirements over a four‐year term, which ended at the end of last year. This proposal was originally intended to guarantee that the strict sulphur content limits for light fuel oil which apply in Austria would be adopted throughout the Union. This is not exactly what has happened. Member States have not had the courage to go as far as to introduce the sorts of provisions that currently apply in Austria. This is directly relevant to the view of the Council of Ministers, which is that we cannot achieve the Austrian levels until the year 2008. As I said, this really is a long transition period. On the other hand, it has to be said that the nightmare scenario of Austria giving up its stricter limit values is now not going to happen. Things have been organised in such a way that the legal basis of the proposal is Article 130s. It is thus a minimum requirement, which enables Austria to maintain its own stricter limit values. We could say that, at least as far as this is concerned, the worst has not happened.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lange </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, and I have been very firm in our dealings with the Council about the Auto‐Oil programme. We also went into battle over the reduction in the sulphur content of fuels and really thought that the fight was going to go to a second round. But it has now turned out that this is not really necessary. Which is just as well, as the problem of acidification is of course vital for the northern Member States, and we are therefore delighted that the Council has taken almost all Parliament's requests on board, which means that we finally have a really good piece of legislation. I cannot help thinking of the words of a German pop song called ‘Miracles keep on happening'. I must say that in this case the Council has shown that this is true, and that it can sometimes simply accept the proposals made to it by Parliament – well‐founded proposals of course.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight one particular point, and that is the inclusion of bunker oil for ships and the need to make progress with negotiations at international level to ensure that the fuel used in ships is as low in sulphur as possible. I say this because potential emissions from this source are now far greater than from power stations on dry land.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course there is also a little link with the Auto‐Oil programme here: if you demand that oil with a relatively low sulphur content should be supplied for use in cars, it is quite conceivable that the refining industry will hit upon the idea of offering the rest, the mucky stuff, to ships. In the interests of consistency, identical or at least similar legislation must also apply in this field. That is why I particularly welcome the inclusion of bunker oil in the directive and I recommend that we should press for regulation at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just one very small request relating to Amendment No 1, which is about the sulphur content of heavy oils. This is the only thing it will take to make me perfectly happy with this legislation. In this case the Environment Committee proposes bringing forward the relevant date by two years, from 2003 to 2001. This is not an unprincipled suggestion, but really just a reinstatement of your own proposal, Commissioner. I would therefore urge you to accept at least this one amendment and make my day!</p>
<p class="contents" align="center"><span class="bold">IN THE CHAIR: MR VERDE I ALDEA<br /></span><span class="italic">Vice‐President</span></p>
<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Grossetête </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we all agree on the objectives we are trying to achieve as regards acidification. We are all extremely aware of the problems this causes and we can be content with the common position that included most of the amendments that the European Parliament had adopted at first reading. As far as heavy fuel oils are concerned, some people are questioning the date set by the Council, which is 1 January 2003. I believe that this date is perhaps more sensible as, if we wish to achieve our environmental objectives, we must also take account of one another"s problems. Such problems are not always the same in northern Europe as they are in southern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards gas oil, the Council provides for two stages in reducing sulphur content. I am always in favour of a gradual reduction rather than setting objectives that, if achieved in a single stage, may sometimes be rather restrictive. The Council has set an initial deadline of the year 2000 – which is just around the corner – for limiting sulphur content to 0.20 %. It has then set a second deadline of 2008 for limiting this content to 0.10 %. It also provides for derogations but limits their duration to a five year period from 2008 onwards on the understanding that this derogation period is non‐renewable.</p>
<p class="contents">We can, I believe, be pleased with the fact that the Council, in its common position, has not covered bunker fuel as this accounts for only 2 % of total sulphur emissions. However, I believe it is important to remain extremely vigilant in the case of particularly sensitive areas that must be protected, such as the North Sea and the Baltic Sea in particular. Here, it would be appropriate to take action within the framework of the MARPOL Convention. I believe it is important to stress this and to be extremely vigilant. Therefore, we must insist that some areas that are particularly sensitive to sulphur emissions from bunker fuel, such as the areas I have just mentioned, be declared special protection areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I believe that it is good that aviation fuel, which only accounts for approximately 0.2 % of sulphur emissions, is not included and is not deemed a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, there were some difficult negotiations in the Council over this common position and I believe we should bear this in mind. On the whole, the content is along the lines of what we had hoped to see at first reading. I believe this is a balanced common position, as it lets us delay until 2003 the entry into force of the limit value for sulphur content in heavy fuels. It also gives stricter guidelines for the exceptions that can be made. In view of these conditions, the Group of the European People"s Party refuses to systematically try to outdo the Council. We will vote against the three amendments that have been tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">In effect, if the European Parliament adopts a single amendment at second reading, a unanimous or a qualified majority vote is required in the Council, depending on whether or not the Commission accepts the amendment. This will be impossible given the differences of opinion that exist between the northern and southern countries, and given that the oil coming from the Persian Gulf has a higher sulphur content.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Blokland </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, a dynamic approach to acidifying emissions is required if we are to protect human health, plants and sensitive ecosystems, as well as buildings. The proposal we have before us is just a part of this approach. The most effective way of combating acidification is through large furnaces, as these are responsible for 63 % of SO<span class="sub">2 </span> emissions in the European Union. Nevertheless, we are pleased with the Council"s common position on the reduction of the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels. Thanks to Mrs Hautala"s excellent proposals, the common position now looks a lot better than the original Commission proposal. I can also wholeheartedly support the few amendments the rapporteur proposes at second reading. The prospects of meeting the various demands are fair. The crude oil from Norway, Libya and Russia contains less than 0.5 % sulphur and there are good techniques for desulphurizing the crude oil from the Middle East with its high sulphur content. Another point is that the heavy fuel oil used by furnaces and cement factories should also contain less sulphur.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bjerregaard, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DA)</span> Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the Environment Committee and in particular the rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, for the valuable work that has been done on this proposal. I would also like to thank Mrs Hautala and Mr Lange for their comments on the progress that has been made.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal provides for a reduction in total emissions of sulphur dioxide of about 1 million tonnes, of the 3 million tonnes required by the acidification strategy. The average cost of EUR 700 per tonne of pollution reduction will be far outweighed by the benefits, in particular to public health, which are put – and we have figures for that too – at about EUR 4 000 per tonne. These figures for costs and effects say something about how important this proposal is.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the 27 amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading have already been incorporated into the common position. The aim of the common position was to perform the difficult act of striking a balance between what specifications for the sulphur content of a fuel will be necessary to reduce acidification damage and what we think European industry can achieve. The Commission therefore supported the common position in its communication to the European Parliament. I will now comment on the three new amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lange and Mrs Hautala asked directly about Amendment No 1, which brings the deadline for implementation of the new 1 % limit for sulphur in fuel oil forward from the year 2003 to 2001. As Mr Lange also noted, the Commission had originally proposed 2000, and we regretted in the communication on the common position that the Council had deferred that deadline. The Commission therefore considers that the Council should take up the matter again. Hence it follows that we can accept Amendment No 1 and, if that satisfies Mr Lange into the bargain, then that is another plus. However, as I said before, the common position sought to strike a very careful balance, and we may in the end have to accept that it is not possible to get the Council to change its mind. But at least we shall try.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 2 and 3. Amendment No 2 provides for a different upper limit for sulphur content in fuel oil in conjunction with a possible dispensation from the 1 % requirement. The Commission wishes to discuss dispensation applications individually on the basis of the criteria laid down in the directive, so in that context the precise upper limit is not so critical. It should be pointed out that in the common position, the Council has tightened up the conditions for the granting of dispensations by introducing the ‘critical load' concept, which I think we can all find acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 3 seeks to bring forward introduction of the 0.1 % limit for sulphur content in gas oil from the year 2008 to 2004. In its communication on the common position, the Commission was favourable towards a tightening‐up of the requirements for sulphur content in gas oil from the year 2008. The reason why the Commission did not originally propose that tougher standard, however, was that it is not cost‐effective throughout Europe. There is still no justification now for bringing forward the deadline for implementation throughout Europe. I would therefore emphasise – as the rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, also has – that we are talking about minimum requirements, which was also a key element in the Commission's original proposal. This means that the Member States are free to introduce the more stringent limit earlier than the year 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me end there, Mr President. The proposal as it stands will already improve the environment from next year. It is therefore a good start on the concrete implementation of the acidification strategy. Thank you for your time and your attention.</p>
