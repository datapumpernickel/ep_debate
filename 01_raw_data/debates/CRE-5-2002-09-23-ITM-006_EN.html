<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Angelilli (UEN), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, the report of which I am about to give a brief overview deals with the Commission Green Paper on compensation to crime victims. This is certainly an extremely complex issue in legal terms, but I am glad to say that a major debate is developing on the matter with endeavours being made, first and foremost, to define the appropriate legislative instruments and identify the appropriate financial resources to secure what should be the basic right of a crime victim: to receive proper compensation for suffering and damages inflicted, especially where there is no perpetrator of the crime in that the author is unknown or is not in a position to provide the victim with compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we know that the number of cross-border crime victims is increasing, firstly because of the increase in the movement of citizens within the Union but also, I regret to say, because of a general increase in crime, particularly in major, very serious criminal activities such as terrorism, child abuse and the trafficking of human beings. It should be emphasised, moreover, that many victims suffer injury twice, first as the victims of a crime and then as victims of an excessively bureaucratic system, and this system requires greater simplification in order to prevent situations where protection is unavailable or inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this, the need to set minimum standards on the protection of the victims of crimes, in particular on crime victims' access to justice and on their right to compensation, was explicitly established as early as Tampere when the principal guidelines to be followed with a view to creating a genuine area of freedom, security and justice were laid down. Regrettably, this strong political will has not yielded any significant legislative results at Community level in the time that has elapsed since 1999. The primary goal is, therefore, to create minimum common standards in as short a time as possible in order to make the right to compensation reality throughout European Union territory for both European citizens and those who are legally resident in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">These standards must contain a clear, precise definition which has been agreed upon by all the Member States of the types of crime and the damages that could be grounds for compensation. It will, moreover, be equally necessary to identify the parties who could legally be the recipients of compensation with similar precision and on the basis of similar assent, considering, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, that the families and dependents of people injured by crime can be considered to be the indirect victims of crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">It will certainly be no easy matter to identify minimum standards, for two reasons. The first relates to the practical problem posed by legal codification, for a complex process will have to be launched to approximate the – at present, extremely diverse – laws of the Member States. The second concerns the vital need to identify adequate resources. A number of different funding possibilities exist. We could consider, as the Commission suggests, setting up a special European Solidarity Fund, which could, moreover, contain the proceeds of the seizure and subsequent sale of the assets of criminal networks.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, the priority must be to define rules and procedures governing the treatment of victims which are as harmonised as possible. All this would help to remedy the – at times, extraordinary<span class="bold"> –</span> disparities which exist between the different legal systems of the Member States. Indeed, at present, there are differences linked to the place of residence of the victim or to the State in which the crime was committed, which means that discrimination is occurring which is unacceptable and prejudicial to the victims. In practice, a situation is created where there is real disparity between the treatment people receive, which varies according to the country in which the crime took place, and this is a blatant violation of the fundamental principle of non-discrimination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Santini (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, this proposal for a directive, with regard to which I am the rapporteur, seeks to establish minimum common rules to guarantee the provision of genuine financial assistance to citizens who are unable to bear the costs of legal proceedings in which they are involved. This initiative slots perfectly into the project of creating an area of freedom, security and justice within Union territory, within which all the citizens are guaranteed respect for their fundamental rights, irrespective of their financial situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The original legal basis is Title IV, Article 61 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which stipulates that the Council, in order to establish progressively an area of freedom, security and justice, shall adopt measures in the field of judicial cooperation in civil matters. The Tampere European Council responded to this call by establishing minimum standards for cross-border access to justice, and we would emphasise this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has taken a more courageous step, proposing to extend the provision of aid to internal cases as well. The Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has risen to the challenge, appropriating the Commission’s debate on the scope of the directive.<span class="bold"> </span>Therefore, other internal cases are to be covered by the directive as well as cross-border cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the legal basis must be extended and is no longer to be found solely in Article 61 of the Treaty but in Article 65 too. Moreover, the extension of the scope of the directive is also based on the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights, Article 47(3), to be specific, which provides that legal aid is to be made available to those who lack sufficient resources to secure equal access to justice. This is the first time we have pledged to provide this kind of aid at Community level. It also gives us a welcome opportunity to invite those Member States – and there are a considerable number of them – which already provide guaranteed, appropriate legal aid for their citizens internally, to start to harmonise their laws in the field.</p>
<p class="contents">The report, which was adopted unanimously by the Parliamentary committee responsible, goes even further. Indeed, it proposes to extend the aid provided during the actual legal proceedings to the pre-litigation stage too, given that effective mediation, an attempt to achieve reconciliation between the parties can often even obviate the need for actual legal proceedings, reducing, therefore, or eliminating all the inconvenience for the citizens concerned and, most importantly, reducing the costs involved.</p>
<p class="contents">This two-fold approach could – it is true – lead to an increase in the costs sustained by the Member States. However, the political and social importance of a directive of this nature would – and, indeed, does – justify Parliament’s appeal to the Council to take this step. Here, we have the primary task of identifying the political objectives which will further the genuine development of the Europe of the citizens, the Europe of equality of justice for all.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by focusing on a last minute and, therefore, somewhat disconcerting action of the Council, which has sent a new text – albeit only informally for our information – which clearly seeks to stress the contents of Article 1, which restricts the scope of the directive purely to cross-border cases. In other words, the Council is – or seems to be – attempting to cast doubt upon the entire process, to stop it in its tracks and to go back to the drawing board. Irrespective of the content of this proposal, which runs counter to the unanimous vote of the Parliamentary committee, this is a serious violation of form and procedure. The Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights has decided, on the basis of a specific vote, to complete the entire process up until the adoption or, at any rate, tabling in plenary of the report based on the text prepared by the Commission, in accordance with the most basic rules of the consultation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">If Parliament were to accept the Council’s termination of the process or a proposal for referral back to committee, this would have major consequences in terms of interinstitutional legal relations and also in terms of the consultation procedure, and would be a serious violation of the provisions of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The prerogatives of the European Parliament would be undermined and a highly disturbing precedent would be set for the future. Therefore, the process of examining this report must be brought to its normal conclusion; in other words, the report must be put to the vote in Parliament. That is the opinion of the Parliamentary committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by calling directly upon the Commission, if I may, in the person of Commissioner Vitorino, to give its opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We passed an initial milestone in March 2001, when the Council adopted a framework decision on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings. Soon afterwards, the Commission presented its Green Paper on compensation to crime victims.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this document was to launch a wide consultation with the Member States and all the interested parties on the possible objectives of a Commission initiative in this area. Amongst the suggestions made, I shall mention, in particular, the drawing up of a minimum criterion for compensating victims within the Union and the application of this scheme to cross-border disputes. I am therefore extremely grateful to the European Parliament for tabling a resolution on the Commission Green Paper and I should like to thank Mrs Angelilli in particular for the excellent quality and the pertinence of her report. I am very pleased to be able to note, in the report, the support given to our objectives as well as a detailed and constructive analysis of the various aspects covered by the Green Paper. I shall not make any detailed comments about the various points of the motion you have debated, but I can assure you that these will help the Commission to define future measures. As you will have probably noted, the latest version of the Commission scoreboard on the area of freedom, security and justice already indicated that a follow-up will be given this autumn with a proposal for a directive on compensation to victims. The position that you are adopting today on the Green Paper will be, in this connection, an extremely valuable contribution to the creation of our proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the proposal for a directive on legal aid is concerned, the Green Paper published by the Commission in February 2002 led to a proposal for a directive being presented in January 2002 that seeks to establish minimum standards in the area of legal aid. As you know, this proposal provoked, and, indeed, continues to provoke, a great deal of discussion within the various Council bodies. In particular, the debates focused on the scope of the directive. The Commission hopes that the directive will apply to all civil and commercial disputes, but the Council decided that its scope should be limited to cross-border disputes. As a result, the text of the proposal was substantially changed, on this issue at least. The new text, which is still far from being final, was forwarded by the Council to Parliament for information. Earlier today, Mr Santini emphasised the situation and the institutional challenge that such an approach presents for Parliament, and that is why I fully understand that the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs hopes that it will be the original text of the Commission proposal that is submitted to the House for a decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Santini and Mrs Wallis, for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, for the quality of their work. In addition, several changes suggested in the amendments were taken up in the text which is currently being debated in the Council. Above all, I must point out that Amendment No 6, which concerns the first paragraph of Article 1 of the proposal, is very clear on this point, since it goes as far as deleting the reference to cross-border disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission essentially remains of the opinion that the proposal for a directive must be applied to all civil disputes. This solution supports the extension of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, Article 47 of which lays down that ‘legal aid shall be made available to those who lack sufficient resources insofar as such aid is necessary to ensure effective access to justice’. It is also part of our work to promote access to justice for all. Unfortunately, I must say that there is very little chance that the Council will change its mind on this matter. On the other hand, the debate continues on the definition of ‘cross-border impact’, which can be interpreted in either a broad or restricted manner. The Commission would like to support a broad interpretation so as to avoid undermining the principle of legality. The issue will be tackled at the meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council in October. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will deprive you of a much more complete explanation, but please allow me nevertheless to thank Mrs Wallis on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for her magnificent work and her willingness to take up all the suggestions of that committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market had to involve itself above all with the technical aspects of this directive, and has tried to introduce certain improvements: firstly, contrary to the line taken by the Council, extending its scope to those civil actions resulting from criminal acts, since we felt that there absolutely no reason to exclude them; secondly, trying to determine more precisely what is meant by judicial costs, what items should be included and also making it possible to maintain free justice in the event of appeal, insisting on the need for requests to be examined in good time and, to this end, laying down that the Member States should designate the competent authorities; and finally, providing for reimbursement, where there are private law mechanisms in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The news given us today by Commissioner Vitorino – and which the Commission communicated in good time – does not exactly give us hope, but our Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market must remember – and the draftsperson who I am replacing insisted on this – that, in the event that the Council introduces these substantial modifications, the Treaties lay down that Parliament should be consulted again, and Parliament is not prepared to give up this right, but rather is prepared to defend it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, the Committee on Legal Affairs has expressed some considerations – and I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Angelilli, for having included in the body of the text all the amendments contained in the Committee on Legal Affairs’ opinion – to the effect that compensation should cover both material and non-material damage caused to the victim. Generous time limits should be set for the submission of claims for state compensation; similar provisions must apply concerning the <span class="italic">dies a quo</span> (the date from which the time limit is calculated) in order to avoid disparities in the way cases are treated. Moreover, it is crucial that harmonised compensation claims forms are drawn up in all the Community languages and that the minimum procedural guarantees include, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, the right to impartial judgment, the right to be represented by a lawyer, the right of access to the procedure and easier access for cross-border victims to State compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Community initiative on compensation to victims would indeed be a major contribution to the creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Klamt (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, victim protection has already long been a topic of political discussion even at European level. Parliament has regularly called, ever since the 1980s, for an improvement in the position of victims of crime. That victims of criminal offences have to be supported and protected is not a matter of dispute; the only question is how this is to be done, and to what extent. With the Vienna Action Plan, Europe took up the issue of care and compensation for victims. In 1999, Parliament's agenda included an item on the improvement of the position of crime victims in the EU, and at Tampere there was a call for the establishment of minimum standards for the protection of crime victims.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we in Europe's Parliament are giving our opinion on the Commission Green Paper on compensation to crime victims. We are doing this out of the conviction that the rules of nation states on the compensation of victims are inadequate. It is unacceptable that victims should be compensated differently within the European Union, simply because, over and above the misfortune of falling victim of a crime, they were unlucky enough to be victims in the wrong country. To take one example, one Member State may take over the costs of psychiatric treatment of victims of sexual violence, whilst in others, the costs of all medical treatment needed as a result of other offences are covered.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at another area, the burden of proof in all Member States rests with the applicant for compensation, but there are great variations in the degree of proof, and another example is that, in certain Member States, it is required that an offence shall have been reported to the police before any compensation can be paid out, whilst in others that is not the case. I adduce these examples in an attempt to show the quite different assumptions on the basis of which the fifteen Member States work.</p>
<p class="contents">Critics of the Commission and of Parliament charge that we are too slow to pass and implement resolutions on the protection and compensation of victims, and the criticism is also levelled that this Green Paper is aiming at a Community initiative in the form of minimum standards. What is sought by many victim-support organisations is harmonisation. I can well understand why it is victim-support organisations in particular that seek speedy solutions, but many small steps and comprehensive educational work are needed if we are to achieve the objective of Europe-wide victim protection. That means finding and deciding on common rules for all, in all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, then, all the more important to take the first step of laying down minimum standards for State compensation for those victims of criminal offences who get no compensation from their assailant or by other means. All this is covered by this Green Paper. This is a good approach, and, on behalf of the PPE Group, I welcome it as being the right way towards Community rules for victim support in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by expressing my thanks to Mrs Angelilli, firstly for her excellent report, but also for her willingness to support the many compromise amendments which crossed group boundaries.</p>

<p class="contents">You know – and I would like to give you an example – that more and more people within the European Union are crossing the borders of their States. In 1999, 250 million people did so. This situation means that citizens who are moving around run the risk of becoming victims of crime both inside and outside the territory of their States of residence, and this may be anything from robbery to, on occasions, terrorist crimes, a scourge which still strikes cruelly within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that this Green Paper and the reports we are approving today represent progress in terms of removing the physical national borders in relation to the victims of crime. We must ensure that within the Union’s area of freedom, security and justice the citizens are given genuine access to justice so that they may benefit from adequate legal protection in any part of the Union’s territory. For this reason, the Europe of the citizens does not make sense unless we first adopt, amongst others, the necessary measures to improve and take account of the rights of the victims of crime as well, seen from a global perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Any person, including third-country nationals, who has been a direct or indirect victim of a crime in the territory of any Member State of the Union must receive the same minimum level of treatment. The European Union cannot accept that a person may receive different treatment depending on the Member State within which they have been a victim of crime or depending on their nationality. My group believes that compensating victims is a fundamental aspect which must be at the heart of European cooperation in the fight against crime.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the Commission’s report and also the report by Mrs Angelilli, whom I congratulate on her attitude and availability. I believe that all the groups will be more or less in agreement with this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to mention a few of the points which we believe to be fundamental and which we would like to express our support for: the principle of non-discrimination included in paragraph 13; support for non-governmental organisations which work with victims on a daily basis; the conditions for dealing with and attending to victims, as I said earlier; the harmonisation of systems for compensating victims, established by the Member States, taking account of levels of income; the guarantee that all citizens and legal residents can receive compensation when they have been victims of crime, according to Community criteria. We therefore support the creation of a European body for victims, the creation of a European fund to guarantee the corresponding compensation of the victims of crimes and, of course, the establishment of harmonised forms in all the languages of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we will thereby have a proposal which represents a genuine step forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Industrial disasters, such as those which occurred at the AZF factory at Toulouse in France, at Lanhelas in Portugal and at Enschede in the Netherlands, to mention but a few, have all had tragic consequences in terms of human life and in material terms.

It is often some of the richest and most powerful companies that are involved, therefore those responsible are solvent. In this case, it is obviously not the tax payer who must pay but the employers concerned who must foot the full bill for the damage they have caused. We must, above all, force them to take the necessary measures in terms of security and control in order to prevent this type of accident. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In France, for example, Jean-Marie Le Pen had proposed to place, from the outset, the scheme for victims of terrorism in the same category as the long-established scheme for victims of war.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mrs Angelilli mentions cases for damages filed by nationals of one Member State in the territory of another; cases for losses, the causes of which are found in events that occurred in a State other than the State of residence, as well as disparities between Member State legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this type of dispute, we are in favour of defining a minimum standard, or in favour of speeding up the ratification of the Strasbourg Convention of 24 November 1983. On the other hand, we have reservations regarding the creation of a new European body which is mentioned in Article 16(d) and Article 28. In addition to the problem of funding this body, it would not put an end to the disparities which could in future arise between the victims of cross-border crime – and who therefore benefit from the European funding – and those who continue to fall under a national scheme. The solution is to be found in adopting a single and simple European rule which could be, with regard to legal competence or applicable law, the law on the location of the crime, the <span class="italic">lex loci delicti</span>. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I congratulate Roberta Angelilli and Giacomo Santini, because both reports make it clear that the enormous challenge we face consists of creating a genuine area of justice, in which European citizens can see their integrity protected, enjoy access to justice and have their rights guaranteed regardless of the place in which they live and as easily as if they were in their own country.</p>
<p class="contents">The Angelilli report is concerned with citizens who have been victims of crime. It is crucial that we devote all our efforts to preventing secondary victimisation. It is unacceptable that someone who has been the victim of a crime should be victimised once again because the system provides them with inadequate or non-existent protection. Mrs Klamt has already given paradigmatic examples of some such situations. Compensation must be awarded for losses and damage sustained in a way that is immediate, full and effective. The Member States must, to this end, promote the appropriate harmonisation of their legal and regulatory provisions, because it is unfair that, as a result of the profound disparities that exist, there should be unjustifiable differences in the compensation to which European citizens are entitled merely because they have been crime victims in one particular part of the European Union rather than another. The citizens must also have accessible and full information on these rights, provided in the various Community languages. Often rights are not exercised not because they are not in place or are not regulated, but because the citizens are not able to access this information.</p>
<p class="contents">The Santini report is based on the observation that the exercise of the freedom of movement will lead to a huge increase in cross-border cases involving individuals with such modest incomes that they might not be able to access justice or benefit from adequate legal aid. The Charter of Fundamental Rights, specifically Article 47, provides that legal aid is to be made available to those who lack sufficient resources in so far as such aid is necessary to ensure effective access to justice. We therefore agree that, as already laid down in the Tampere conclusions, minimum rules that guarantee an adequate level of legal aid for cross-border legal disputes throughout the Union must be established, whilst emphasising, nevertheless, that the Member States always have the option of laying down more favourable provisions in line with their own traditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a very good report. However, we have done ourselves some damage. As has been referred to, this will not be viewed easily or lightly accepted by the Council because we have wrongly broadened the scope. I agree absolutely with the principles within Mr Santini's report, but we have to be realistic on a consultation process on how to achieve those principles.</p>
<p class="contents">This is particularly about cross-border disputes. If we make it include internal disputes, we create a great deal of problems not only for the Community but also for those Member States that will have to face the potentially huge legal bills that will follow. That is why I will recommend to the Socialist Group that we support the amendment by Baroness Ludford which reintroduces the notion that this refers specifically to cross-border disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that the Brussels 1 Regulation will apply to these disputes on the mutual enforcement of civil law decisions. Equally, I accept that it should not cover proceedings relating to tax, customs or administrative matters. However, I should introduce one correction. It may have been a linguistic matter, but Mr Santini said that citizens will be judged irrespective of their financial positions. This is not true because there is an upper limit set within the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome that the victims of crime will be guaranteed legal aid in order to get compensation. We agree that legal aid should cover both pre-litigation advice and representation in court. We also back the proposal to include within the scheme mechanisms for resolving disputes outside the courts.</p>
<p class="contents">I will finish as I began by congratulating Mr Santini but by expressing regret that, by broadening the scope and going far beyond that which we can achieve in the House, we are actually urging the Council not to accept our recommendations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Here and there, alas, this freedom of movement brings with it adverse consequences, and both reports deal with this. The first report – Mrs Angelilli's, which has to do with the compensation of victims of crime – addresses a mechanism that would help to alleviate to some extent the effects of these unwelcome emergencies, which arise from freedom of movement itself. With that in mind, the attempt is made to lay down minimum standards across Europe, so that a citizen travelling from one State to another and sustaining some detriment, shall receive appropriate compensation under the same conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the way that this, in view of post-11 September discussions, is not being focussed only on the victims of specific offences, but that the range is being extended<span class="italic"> </span>and the victims in question are being granted aid to minimum standards. It is also noticeable from the second report that the increase in cross-border disputes and offences is actually a consequence of freedom of movement and of the Common Market. That is why it is so important that we should see the EU as being also a social community, one that does not deny access to the law to people who have been affected by such offences but have fewer resources at their disposal. This step can, then, only be welcomed and supported.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I welcome the way in which Mr Santini has put these into more concrete terms and enlarged upon them, stating for example, that the states should bear court costs or that the application for legal aid should be submitted to national authorities designated for that purpose. Alongside these, there are a plethora of other items that effect very real help for victims and for those with a claim on aid. Both reports help us as EU citizens to have a positive experience of life in the EU, with all the principles associated with freedom of movement, which we can and must make a reality. I congratulate both rapporteurs on these excellent reports. Many thanks!</p>

(PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I would like to refer to Mrs Angelilli's remarks at the beginning of the debate, when she spoke of this issue as being very complicated from a legal point of view. I have no legal training whatsoever but I have no doubt, as the Commissioner mentioned in his comments on forging together the chemistry of 15 countries, that mutual cooperation across the legal systems and judicial processes of 15 countries is very difficult to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of the ordinary citizens of Europe, however, I would suggest that the notion of the victim of a crime is a very simple one. Whether while abroad on holiday, for business purposes or perhaps as a student, the victim of a burglary, a violent personal crime, or a terrorist attack takes that crime very personally and expects something to be done about it. We all suffer, indeed the whole idea of Europe suffers, if nothing is done. Victims become disenchanted and frustrated, and to them the whole idea of Europe seems to have failed.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, then, absolutely right to do all we can to press forward in the ways outlined in these two reports. We need to look for common rules and common understandings and agreements on legal aid so that, as far as possible, people can receive the sort of support that they would expect in their own country. The Commissioner spoke about the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. This is a step forward, but people expect, since this Charter exists, that they are entitled to rights in other countries. We have established a common market for goods and capital and made it work as a kind of rich playground. So, just as the previous report called for common European standards on asylum, we are absolutely right to be calling for common European standards for the victims of crime and access to legal aid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You see, Commissioner Vitorino, that I am being very even-handed with praise and blame today.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start with victim support. Past decades saw well-known worldwide NGOs concerning themselves time and again with offenders in every corner of the globe, with the conditions under which they were detained and with their rehabilitation into society. Often, unfortunately, their victims were forgotten and left alone. Even today, far from all our Member States guarantee comprehensive victim support, particularly not to nationals of third States. In many States, as little account is taken of victims of offences of negligence as of victims who are unable to prove lasting or grave detriment. To date, only the victim compensation rules in the Scandinavian States – Denmark, Sweden and Finland – can be described as exemplary.</p>
<p class="contents">Time and again, in my capacity as a member of the Committee on Petitions, I come up against cases in which compensation was either not paid out to victims, or it was at any rate unreasonably delayed, where even EU citizens in other EU States had applied for it. In the past year alone, a dozen petitions from victims of violent crime within the EU have been passed on to us. Admittedly, there has hitherto been no legal basis on which we would have been entitled to intervene. It is to be hoped that this will now change, particularly if the Commission allows its Green Paper to be followed up by definite legal acts.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one thing we should not do at this juncture. We should not set up another EU fund, as it is intolerable that the Member States should evade their own financial responsibility in this matter. If the USA can manage to lift the financial burden from dependents of the victims of 11 September, wherever in the world and irrespective of their nationality, then it can also be expected of the Member States of the EU within their own territory.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Santini's proposal on legal aid is also a significant step towards the creation of this legal area. The regulation on cooperation and enforcement in civil and commercial cases is already in place, as is judicial assistance between the Member States of the European Union in criminal cases. This has enabled us to get quicker and simple cross-border justice for Europe's citizens, which means that time is pressing upon us when it comes to creating a European form of access to legal aid, by which means alone we will contribute to the fair application of existing European regulations to those who would otherwise be unable to take a case to trial.</p>
<p class="contents">And, Mr Cashman, you are quite deluded if you believe that this can only apply to cross-border trials, for if you were to establish a higher standard for the whole of Europe, your own people would blow up a storm, and if you were to create a lower standard across Europe, you would have to answer the question as to why you were treating the EU's citizens worse than your own. That makes the approximation of laws absolutely necessary, and I do not know any reason why we should not go ahead with it on a Europe-wide basis.</p>
