<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Oostlander (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Mr President, since my previous report, the Turkish Government has not been idle and has, with some determination, adopted a number of reforms in legislation. These mainly relate to human rights, freedoms in the areas of culture and media, and the curbing of the army's political role. We have been following the negotiations about Cyprus' future with much interest as they play a considerable part in Turkey’s progress towards the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Initially, we imagined that it would be Turkish involvement in these negotiations that would cause difficulties, due to the army's opposition to a compromise and due to established administrators in the Turkish Government. Unfortunately, we have to note that Greek-Cypriot cooperation in finding a solution to the Cyprus issue is not optimal either, to put it mildly.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, this is not the last we have heard on the matter. Negotiations are set to continue, because I cannot imagine the Greek-Cypriot Government risking joining the European Union on such extremely bad terms as these. I think it would not live this down for many years.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite all the changes on paper in Turkey and the decision in favour of departments to set civil society free, it appears that implementation of the reforms has been extremely difficult. The Government realises this too and has, by introducing a monitoring system, demonstrated that it means business. I see this as an important move on its part, because to us, it is mainly the implementation of all those changes that is essential. Paper can wait; the future will tell whether they will be realised.</p>
<p class="contents">The obstacles on the road to the European Union can hardly come as a surprise to us. The structure and philosophy of the state are reflected in the mentality of the population and government officials. If that is the reason why they are on a track that is not reconcilable with the European Union, they cannot expect this to change in the short term. The changes we want are revolutionary.</p>
<p class="contents">These observations bear out the report's basic idea. The European Union has to be strict in respect of all candidates, or states that want to become candidates, where the rule of law and democracy are concerned. That is, primarily, a matter of principle, but it is also about the EU's ability to function as such and about our ability to persuade our own people, whose acceptance of this enlargement will be dependent on our finding a basis for it.</p>
<p class="contents">What matters is that the candidates should fit in with the European Union in terms of the political values they uphold. Until such time as they do, they should not consider membership. This is not simply about correcting a number of specific abuses, but also about the legal and social basis from which abuses arise. For example, it is not simply about the release of Leyla Zana, who has been sentenced to many years' imprisonment for conduct for which she received the Sakharov Prize from this Parliament. What is important is that in future, such sentences should be unthinkable. If you question the highest courts in Turkey about this, to my astonishment, they are still unable to provide you with any answers.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to the cultural rights of minorities. It should be unthinkable that these should be obstructed in such a way that they cannot be exercised. A real separation of church and state should not give cause to panic, and neither should the freedom of religion for groups who are not specifically mentioned in the Treaty of Lausanne. Apparently, this is a very difficult area for Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Another complex issue is the position of the army. Historically, one can appreciate that the army has enjoyed great trust among a large proportion of the population, but politics will need to regain its self-assurance. Although the government is working on changes, it cannot do much more than what circumstances permit. Nevertheless, the European Union should stick to the requirement that the army should have no more political influence than is customary in the EU Member States. In this light, I would discourage any amendments tending to water down what the European Union requires of Turkey. The Copenhagen political criteria must be fulfilled before we can move on to the usual support we offer with regard to the adoption of the <span class="italic">acquis</span>. That is a lesson we have learnt from previous enlargement processes and the experience we have had with Romania, for example. Moreover, it should also send a message to countries that are considering membership. I also think that the Turkish Government needs our pressure as back-up against the opposing forces in society and in parts of the corridors of power.</p>
<p class="contents">Elements of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> are non-negotiable. This also applies to the values and the application thereof in the European Union. There is no room for negotiation. They must be embraced; if countries are really intent on becoming Member States, they must simply be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">I do take the view, though, that the EU must hold on to the prospect of fully-fledged membership for Turkey once the political, economic and other criteria have actually been met. While it is understandable that some amendments should call for the close involvement of Parliament, it is just as necessary for us to do our homework in order to be able to assimilate the accession of countries to the European Union. That means that the results of the Convention will need to be accepted unreservedly; if they are not, we cannot function. The concept of deepening before enlarging still holds good.</p>
<p class="contents">The option of taking part in the Policy of Good Neighbourliness, as worded in Mr Napolitano's report, can also remain in place, but amendments affording Turkey a place outside of the European Union on its own, are not in keeping with the gist of my report. The categorical emphasis on the fulfilment of the political criteria is also tied in with the wish to find sufficient support among the people.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that by accepting the outlines of this report, we will send a clear message to both the Turkish Government and society and to the citizens of the EU. This is very much a matter of principle, and no uncertainty can be tolerated. I suggest we continue the dialogue with Turkey with the open mind to which the Turkish Government has by now grown accustomed.</p>

I would like to begin with very warm thanks to Mr Oostlander for a balanced and expert report, with the conclusions of which I can largely agree.</p>
<p class="contents">We can see that the Turkish Government has, in recent years, been very determined in setting in motion changes intended to make Turkey a full democracy under the rule of law, in which human and minority rights are respected. I think we may conclude, on the basis of the results from Turkey’s latest elections last Sunday, that this drive towards reform has put down deep roots in Turkish society. This is something in which we should rejoice, for without the European Union, this process would not have got off the ground. The Helsinki strategy gave Turkey definite prospects. The conditions under which it can exercise its membership option are defined in clear and unambiguous terms. The Copenhagen criteria apply, unchanged and in full, to Turkey as they do to all the other candidate countries. That has made for a lack of ambiguity in our relations with Turkey, and the accession partnerships that we have developed as instruments of cooperation have proved their worth remarkably well in the endeavour to advance the reform process.</p>
<p class="contents">In the progress reports, we have paid tribute to the extent and importance of what has been achieved, but we have also consistently addressed deficiencies and weakness in clear and unmistakeable terms. As part of its reform process, Turkey has brought in new legislation to improve the human rights situation, to provide increased protection from torture and mistreatment, to extend freedom of expression and of the press, to reinforce the freedoms of association and of assembly, as well as the right to demonstrate, to extend cultural rights, to underpin the equality of the sexes, entrench democracy and change the relationship between the armed forces and civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey has also signed several core international conventions, and this clearly indicates that the country is on course for change, as is also shown, above all, by the change in its political climate. Turkey’s civil society is gaining in strength and becoming better-organised; non-governmental organisations are consulted when legislation is prepared, one example being the new code of criminal law. The reform process has given public debate in Turkey a new mood of openness and freedom. Issues such as the role of the armed forces in politics, the use of the Kurdish language, the use of torture and mistreatment, or the role of women in society are now talked about openly. When, four years ago, I started working with Turkey, I could not even use the word ‘Kurdish’ in my dialogues with the Turkish Government. I mention that as just one small example.</p>
<p class="contents">A public debate is underway on whether or not to endow the country with a modern constitution containing the fundamental values on which the European Union is founded. This repositioning of Turkey represents a triumph for our ‘zero tolerance’ policy on matters of democracy, the rule of law and human and minority rights, and it is for that very reason that we have to remind ourselves where we have found deficiencies and weaknesses. Let me briefly list the areas to which the Commission referred: the need to strengthen the independence of the judiciary and improve their working practices, the need for an overall framework for the exercise of fundamental rights, which must be clarified in such a way that every relic of the authoritarianism inherited from the past is done away with. There is, furthermore, the need to correct relations between the civil and armed forces, and there is concern about the position of the internal exiles in the south-east of the country, and about how they can return to their villages. Another very important issue, I think, is that of freedom of religion.</p>
<p class="contents">Amending laws and changing the legal system, though, is not enough. We want these changes to be implemented in practice – not merely on an <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> basis, but systematically and effectively. Although there has been noticeable progress recently, I have to say that we are constantly receiving reports that demonstrate that the reform process is being only reluctantly accepted in the Turkish corridors of power, and so I urgently appeal to the Turkish Government to do everything possible to get these reforms implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me to mention the case of Leyla Zana, which is an example of how the spirit of reform has not yet been internalised by all the country’s executive and legislative institutions. The case against her does not appear to be in accord with the principles of the presumption of innocence and the right to defence counsel.</p>
<p class="contents">I came here straight from Switzerland, where the negotiations on a final solution to the Cyprus problem came to an end early this morning, and I would like to use this opportunity to bring Parliament, before any other institution, up to date on how things stand. As you are aware, we would prefer – as we always have done – to welcome a united Cyprus into membership on 1 May. During our time in Switzerland, we have come very, very close to achieving this, and the process has been far from being a failure. Two options were provided for from the very outset: either an agreement would be signed right there in Switzerland or, alternatively, the Secretary-General of the United Nations would present a final plan, the decision on which would be taken by both communities in Cyprus in a democratic referendum on 24 April.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the second option that has been chosen, it having emerged that not all the parties were able to sign an agreement. I must make it clear, though, that the sides drew together in remarkable ways, and I believe that we have now reached a point at which strong political leadership is called for. Here and now, I appeal to the leadership of the Greek and Turkish Cypriots to do all they can to persuade the people on the island that the plan we have now represents the best and fairest solution that can be achieved. The choice is not between one plan and another; it is between this plan and no solution at all. I do not believe, either, that any new opportunity to address the issue will present itself in the near future. One cannot fail to note, with the utmost admiration, the efforts made by the UN Secretary-General, whose proposal takes full account of the European Union’s demands. The new state, the new Cyprus, that this is intended to bring to birth, will be a country capable of speaking with one voice and of playing its proper part on the international stage without being obstructive. It will be a country with structures strong enough to implement Community law, and one founded upon the same principles as the European Union. As regards the need to adapt Kofi Annan’s proposal in line with Community law, it has been agreed that these adjustments are to be made without recourse to permanent derogations from the <span class="italic">acquis</span>. All institutions are united in the common desire that there should no longer be any permanent derogations from the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, and that we have achieved. I therefore believe it would be a good thing if the European Parliament, too, were to make its will perfectly clear, so that the political parties and forces involved might realise that they have a responsibility to accept the offer that is now on the table, that has been the product of very careful, very laborious and very sympathetic discussions. Let me again stress that it would be wrong to describe the process as having failed. What has in fact happened is that a second option, envisaged from the very start, has been shown to be feasible and preferable. We will now get working on making it a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me return to the subject of Turkey. It has played a very constructive and cooperative role in the negotiations in Switzerland, one to which I very much want to pay tribute. Let me just add that, at the end of this year, a decision will have to be taken as to whether Turkey fulfils the Copenhagen criteria, which are decisive. If it is decided that it does, then – as was unanimously decided at the European Council in Copenhagen in December 2002 – negotiations on its accession are to be commenced without delay. On this, the Commission will present its report in the autumn, and, like all its predecessors, this report will be fair and objective.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Oostlander’s report shows, the process of modernising Turkey’s political system and of bringing it in line with the EU’s standards is far advanced. The European Parliament has always played an important part in reminding Turkey of its commitments, as a democratic state, to safeguard fundamental rights and freedoms. In the stage that now lies ahead of us, much will depend on Turkey’s own ability to show that it fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria not only in law, but also in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">These criteria, far from being devised for Turkey, apply generally and in the same way to all the candidates there have been to date, and to all that there will be. I can assure you that the Commission will, in its autumn report, and just as we have done in past years, put forward a thorough, objective and fair analysis.</p>

We should recognise this and congratulate the Turkish authorities. In a very difficult international situation and in spite of terrorist atrocities in Istanbul, there has been a firm commitment to domestic change.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet some might think that every time Turkey makes progress in a particular direction, the goalposts for European Union membership are moved. In its report a year ago, Parliament sent out an unduly negative message to Turkey and failed to recognise the scale of positive developments that had taken place in the preceding 12 months. This year's report is more balanced, but it still sends a lukewarm message.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of the amendments tabled seek to reverse the decisions firstly of the 1997 Luxembourg European Council confirming that Turkey will be judged on the basis of the same criteria as the other applicant states, and secondly of the Helsinki European Council in 1999, which recognised Turkey's status as a fully-fledged candidate country.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no longer right to speak of Turkey's possible accession to the European Union. Turkey's destiny is clear: in due course it will be a member. I hope, however, that by that time and by the time many of the young people in the public gallery here – including young people from St Martin's School in Brentwood, in my constituency – are firmly established in their professions, the European Union itself will have moved away from its obsession with political integration, into a somewhat looser community of nation states. Many of us are working with that in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cyprus question has been quite correctly mentioned. This was made a factor in Turkey's own EU candidacy – some might think wrongly so. However, all being well, what was a negative factor will soon have the reverse effect. Last night the Secretary-General of the United Nations put forward his final plan for overcoming the divisions of Cyprus. For too long international opinion has been distorted on this issue and the Turkish Cypriots have not had a fair hearing. The Turkish authorities in particular have worked hard to obtain a just settlement that offers the prospect of peace and security. I believe that what is now on the table will be welcomed by the people of Cyprus and I hope that they will give a positive vote in the referendum on 24 April.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is much to be done to bring about reform in Turkey, in particular in terms of human rights. However, much of what is being achieved could be thrown into reverse if a negative decision is taken in December. Mr Oostlander's message is still profoundly negative. I want to send a signal of positive encouragement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has suffered a financial crisis, earthquakes, drought and a terrorist attack. This has obviously had a knock-on effect on the people's social situation and their prosperity. The general level of prosperity in Turkey, expressed in purchasing power, is under 23% of the EU's level. Compared to five years ago, the gap has widened, because in 1997, that level was just over 30%. Unemployment has increased and fluctuates between 9% and 10%. The level of employment is lower than 50%, while this is above 60% in the European Union, although we endeavour to achieve 70%.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two explanations for this drop in employment. Women do not work; only one in four women has a job and many semi- and unskilled rural women opt to stay at home given the lack of opportunities to work. There is also growing informal employment, partly the result – however paradoxical this may sound – of rigid labour legislation. The laws on dismissal are very strict, with the result that employers try to bypass these laws by recruiting illegal workers. Child labour also remains high. It is estimated that there are still 750 000 working children. According to Eurostat, a quarter of the Turkish population has an income below 60% of the average. The level of poverty therefore remains high and the indices for the social situation are thus not terrific.</p>
<p class="contents">That does not detract from the fact that Turkey has made huge efforts. It has developed labour legislation and has made provision for the unemployed. Efforts are thus being made, but it should be noted that these, as a result of the crisis and the lack of investments, have had little impact on the social situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I support Turkey's application to join the European Union on the conditions that were agreed in Copenhagen. I therefore hope that we can all help Turkey take that step. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There has indeed been great progress in legislative terms, including in the areas of labour law, equality, health care and other important social protection systems, but I have to say that there are developments in quite the opposite direction that stand in an unfortunate contrast to this. Lamentably, nothing good can come of the increase in unemployment, the sharp increase in poverty, particularly in rural areas, the increasing tendency of firms to circumvent rules on health and safety at work by illegally employing short-term workers, the failure to combat the use of child labour, and other things besides. Labour law also lacks rules outlawing discrimination, with the consequence that legal action cannot be taken in respect of such things as the violation of the right to respect for human dignity. That can be sorted out, but there is still a need for great effort in order to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Pressure of time will not get these issues dealt with more quickly. With these reasons in mind, and nonetheless wanting to smooth the path towards the approval of Turkey’s accession to the EU, I think that, from a democratic point of view, there is no getting away from the need for the EU of 25 to consider this issue again and for Parliament to give its prior consent before negotiations with Turkey on that country’s accession are embarked on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are almost twice the number of farmers in Turkey as there are in all the 15 Member States. Almost half of Turkey’s workforce is involved in agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">When Turkey becomes a member of the EU, it will be a very big task for the EU to contribute to the development of Turkish agriculture. The most difficult task will probably be to bring about agricultural development that does not involve creating social problems that might become very great when it becomes necessary for people to leave agriculture and find alternative employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Many positive things have taken place in Turkey in recent years. In 2000, for example, a new agricultural policy was introduced, making it easier for Turkey to move closer to the European Union in this area. At the same time, we are at an early stage of our discussions regarding EU membership, and it is difficult to make an accurate assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say that agriculture is probably not the greatest problem where Turkey is concerned. We have similar problems in countries like Romania and Bulgaria. There are other issues that constitute greater problems, such as human rights, democracy and the rule of law. It is important that we are all agreed that, once the Copenhagen criteria have been met, everything will be in place. We shall then start negotiations, and it will be possible for Turkey to become a member.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I think it would be useful for a Muslim, but secularised, country to become a member of the Union, as a bridge between the cultures of Europe and the Arab world. I realise that there are parties and groups in this Parliament which do not think that Turkey should become a member. I think it important that a majority of Parliament states that we welcome Turkey, but we must put pressure on the country so that it carries out the reforms that are necessary before it can become a member. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I find this a valuable observation.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of regional and transport policy, Turkey cannot, in fact, be said to have made any progress whatever. What is particularly deserving of criticism in terms of regional policy is that decentralised structures have still not yet been set up. We, however, regard such structures as indispensable; we need them in order to be able to ensure the proper and comprehensible distribution of EU funds for regional support or cohesion policy. The Turks cannot be serious in constantly asking for more money when the administration is not in a position to disburse these funds in a proper and transparent manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Where everything really is wrong in Turkey is in transport policy. In none of the transport sectors is anything being done towards alignment on the EU’s law and standards. Everywhere, there are still shocking deficiencies: in safety and air traffic control, on the railways, in the maritime sector, and in road transport. One particular deficiency in the road transport sector is in social regulations, one good example being those on driving and rest times, in the training of drivers, and especially, again, in safety. That is a pretty critical point; there are, for example, a lot of dangerous goods transported by road, and such deficits in road transport present dangers to transport not only within Turkey, but also, and to an increasing extent, across the European Union. There is an urgent need for action here.</p>
<p class="contents">The biggest scandal, though – and it really is one – is the fact that Turkey is on the black list of states lacking any genuine port state control, in other words, that many of the ships that are death-traps and thus a ticking time bomb in our waters, sail under the Turkish flag. That is as unworthy of a candidate for accession as it is of any other country in the world, but the situation is particularly intolerable in the case of a candidate for accession to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Until such time as Turkey has in place a national programme to remedy all these defects, we have to have serious doubts about its willingness to start accepting our rules. None of these things are, of course, pre-accession criteria, but not one single point of these has been complied with either. All these things take time. This makes all the more incomprehensible the Turkish insistence, dating back years, on a date for the opening of accession negotiations. This does nobody any favours – whether the European Union or Turkey itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we note that creating specialist mechanisms at state level is not enough and that, at the same time, they need to be reinforced with a strong legal status and generous funding, so that equal treatment of men and women can be promoted in practice and in daily life. All forms of violence, especially domestic violence, and the lack of legal and psychological support mechanisms for victims are still a specific problem. It is also abhorrent to note that deeds of violence are committed by the state security services against women, mainly from minority groups such as Kurds.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the penal code is concerned, Turkey is called upon to abolish the practice of reduced sentences in the case of so-called honour crimes and to abolish the reference in the penal code to women's virginity. Customs and tradition cannot take precedence over the rule of law. At the same time, a direct increase is needed in spending on health care, which is at unacceptably low levels, thereby obstructing the right of women to access health services.</p>
<p class="contents">I also note that the participation and representation of women in democratic institutions is at unacceptably low levels, as is the participation of women in vocational training and employment. Mrs Smet spoke about this at length.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we call for the immediate release of the former member of parliament and Sakharov prizewinner, Leyla Zana, who has been in prison together with three other members of parliament since 1994 on purely political grounds. The thirteenth hearing, a procedure which started approximately one year ago under pressure from the European Union, will be held in Ankara tomorrow. Today, we need to take advantage of today's debate to send a very strong message to Turkey and to call for the immediate release of Leyla Zana as a tiny sign that Turkey is at last moving towards Europe.</p>

Arie Oostlander’s excellent report underlines this in a neutral way. It is, I think, an impartial appraisal, neither negative nor positive with regard to Turkey’s possible accession. It depends on Turkey itself whether it meets the political criteria for candidate countries, and how quickly. Whereas, the European Union has to decide if it can absorb a possible enlargement, which is to say if the Union’s economy and own structures will tolerate it. Both points of view have to be taken fully into consideration, and no external pressure can or should be allowed to change them.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe I at least speak on behalf of my group’s Finnish delegation when I say that many factors indicate that Turkey may now be on the right path, with accession dimly visible at its end. Membership was not promised in Helsinki in 1999, but Turkey was granted candidate status, which obviously raises expectations in that country considerably. Today we had better leave any closer assessment of the Union’s capacity for absorption: ten new countries will stretch the Union’s finances to the limit for years to come. While at the same time most net contributor countries wish to reduce the budget framework in the Union, Turkey itself has a long way to go to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria. I will mention just two points. Before we can be absolutely sure that representative democracy commands the armed forces in Turkey in all situations, and not the other way round, one cannot even think of full membership. Secondly, it is a fundamental requirement of accession that freedom of religion be established, so that all religions, which only function as religious communities, have the freedom and genuine right to found and build proper churches, just as the EU countries gladly allow non-European religions to do by way of tradition.</p>
<p class="contents">We should congratulate Commissioner Verheugen here, as well as Kofi Annan and the other negotiators, on the fact that the Cyprus problem, which now is even a legal barrier to Turkish accession at present, is being solved. We all hope it will now quickly end with the referendum that has been decided on.</p>
<p class="contents">In the long term, however, I believe that if the barriers to Turkey’s accession went away or were removed, it would be in the interests of the Union. My Amendment No 1 and Mr Elles’s Amendment No 16 are, to my mind, fully in compliance with the criteria and are not in any way an attempt to thwart Turkey’s aspiration to accession. I do, however, think that Amendment No 41 will mean Turkey will be pushed out of accession negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a fact that there are those in this House who believe that Turkey should not be a candidate country. It is unfortunate that there is no clear and unambiguous motion to this effect that would enable us to definitely determine what the majority in this House thinks about that. I take the view that Turkey should remain the candidate country that it already is. It has to be conceded that it is not a candidate country like many others, in which the process can be completed relatively easily and in relatively few years. Turkey is in a particular situation. I admit that those of its governments that made a clear commitment to the secular state would also concede that. Turkey has, unfortunately, done little over past years to take the progressive actions – including in terms of their practical implementation – that we are again, and quite rightly, calling for today. The previous government, however – that formed by the AKP – did show very marked desire for reform and did take definite action to implement it. There may be some in this House who, precisely because it is an AKP government that is making progress, believe that Turkey should no longer be a candidate. I, though, believe that there are very good reasons why it should remain one, and there are very many good reasons for Europe to insist on the reforms not only being continued but also implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">That is certainly one of the crucial difficulties. I ask that the Commission, in its report to the Council – which will take the decision and with which the power to do so must remain – should not limit itself to merely assessing what has been decided, but should also consider what has been implemented. I know that Commissioner Verheugen will do that. I, personally, would see it as a very great achievement if visible progress were to be made by the end of this year in implementing the measures that Turkey has adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may turn to the role of the armed forces, then something equally significant has taken place, in that it has clearly been diminished. If what Commissioner Verheugen has said is the case, and the Turkish Government takes a positive line on the Cyprus issue, then that has to do with the diminished role of the military, for if there was one decisive point on which the military had previously stonewalled, it was of course the negotiations on Cyprus. For the Turks, this is of course about the evidence – or lack of it – of a real reduction in the role of the military.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to respect for human rights, it is quite apparent that progress has been made, but that there is a need for much more of it. I refer here also to the Kurdish issue, which is, I know, still a very thorny one for the Turks, including as it does the issue of respect for the borders of neighbouring countries with a Kurdish population. However, this is of course, on the assumption that such Kurdish regions are not used as bases for military or terrorist attacks on Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">So let me reiterate my belief that we should hold fast to our position and rigorously scrutinise compliance with the criteria, just as we do with all the other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me close by saying something about Cyprus. While I hope that a solution will be found, and am very grateful to Commissioner Verheugen for his efforts, it must be clear to us that it must be a solution that does justice to both Cyprus and Europe, so that the European Union will be joined by a country that is capable of participating actively in its decision-making. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I congratulate Commissioner Verheugen and his team because they have played a key part in brokering the package. It is right and proper that the Commission and the Council have been proactive in seeking to apply the membership terms across the complete island of Cyprus. It is not too late for this Parliament to become more supportive of a settlement of the dispute than it has been in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask all the political forces represented in this Parliament to campaign for a positive vote in the referendum. Many Cypriots require support to catch the spirit of Europe and to look forward with more self-assurance to being a reunited community.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey deserves our thanks for making such a vital contribution to the settlement. These events and our gratitude are not fully reflected in the Oostlander report, but it will certainly inform Parliament's decision, as we move towards December and the critical decision to open accession negotiations. Rightly we are resisting the pre-emption of that decision today. Many things will change between now and December: inside the Union we will have reached an IGC settlement that will fully prepare us for further accessions; in Turkey the AKP administration will have consolidated its legitimacy and a new reform package will have progressed through Parliament; social and economic circumstances will have improved and advances will hopefully have been made in the practical implementation of reforms; and Turkey will have continued improving its relations with its neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">The quiet Turkish revolution will persist, and we in the Liberal family will see the bigger picture and treat Turkey fairly and recognise what a contribution Turkey can make to the future of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ainardi (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, it is indeed the case that, in December 2004, the European Union will have to set a date for the opening of negotiations with Turkey on its future accession. This is certainly a highly significant step. I must say, on behalf of the majority of my group, that Turkey should take its place as a full member of the European Union. It is a country whose history and geography make it part of Europe. Contrary to what some people have claimed, either openly or behind a veil of spurious pretexts, the problem with Turkey is not its religious identity. Certain political elements, moreover, are still trying to exert pressure to have the so-called Judaeo-Christian foundations of Europe enshrined in the draft Constitution in order to make it difficult or even impossible for Turkey to accede to the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Be that as it may, the problem with Turkey is its political system, dominated by the armed forces and by the national laws and constitution, which are still far from compatible with democratic principles; the problem also lies in its unacceptable treatment of the Kurdish minority, even though that minority accounts for a quarter of the entire population. Admittedly, since 2001 Turkey has been pursuing a reform process based on the Copenhagen criteria. As this House has observed on several occasions, however, these reforms leave a number of significant restrictions on the full enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedoms. The report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy also endorses this analysis, having incorporated amendments tabled by our group, particularly those concerning Leyla Zana, the Kurdish question and the recognition of the genocide committed against the Armenians.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that Turkey has not always had a coherent framework enabling it to guarantee political, civil, economic, social and cultural rights. Its current constitution was adopted in 1982, under the military regime, and still bears the seal of authoritarianism. The armed forces continue to play a predominant role in political, economic and cultural life and in the education system. They are the very cornerstone of the state and society and are therefore one of the main obstacles to the development of Turkey towards a democratic and pluralist system of government. Change is slow, involving homeopathic remedies and often designed to bring about superficial improvements, and we cannot fail to recognise that there remain some very serious problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Leyla Zana, who won the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament, and three other former Members of the Chamber of Deputies of Kurdish origin who were convicted in 1994, remain in prison. The appeal process that we helped to initiate is being conducted in appalling conditions, as the European Parliament delegation, on which Feleknas Uca and Luigi Vinci represent my group, has observed at every hearing. Leyla Zana and her colleagues even refused to take part in the twelfth hearing in protest against these new proceedings in which their fate is a foregone conclusion. The Kurdish HADEP party has been banned, and the DEHAP party is under similar threat. Numerous judgments of the European Court of Human Rights are still being disregarded. Proceedings have been initiated against people for nothing more than a peaceful expression of their opinion. Human-rights activists are subjected by the authorities to harassment and intimidation or criminal investigation. The rights of trade unions are not guaranteed. Torture and maltreatment are still rife, particularly in police stations and prisons. Minorities are victims of discrimination, one example being the Kurds, whose economic, social and cultural rights have yet to be fully recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened carefully, Commissioner, to everything you said, but some questions remain unanswered with regard to Cyprus, particularly in relation to the continuing military occupation of the northern part of the island.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, all of these factors prompted our colleague from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to write in his report, and I quote: ‘Meeting the political criteria of Copenhagen is a precondition for opening accession negotiations’. For the majority of my group, the democratisation of the Turkish institutions, genuine respect for fundamental rights, recognition of the rights of the Kurdish people, the release of Leyla Zana and the resolution of the Cypriot question are fundamental criteria which must be met if we are to approve the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lagendijk (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Mr President, we have now reached the point in the debate on Turkey on which there is, fortunately, general unanimity about the remaining issues. These issues need to be tackled firmly, and implementation – the word has been dropped repeatedly – is necessary more than ever. Despite this, the current Oostlander report contains three weaknesses, and I believe that these ought to be eliminated first.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, let us consider paragraph 8, according to which Turkey's current position in relation to the Cyprus conflict reflects the political power of the army. We surely cannot take this seriously. What has just happened in Cyprus now is that the army has endorsed the course of events according to the government. That is an example of reform and not of stagnation. We ought to remove this section from the report, something that Amendment No 10 makes possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, again in the light of recent events, surely Mr Oostlander cannot be serious when he states that the Greek Cypriots have demonstrated their firm commitment to the Annan plan? They will need to prove this in the next few weeks. I believe, then, that a change is needed on that score too.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the third weakness; I would be strongly in favour of lowering the voting threshold during the elections and have tabled an amendment to that effect. This is something Parliament wants, and we need to convey it to the Turks, because, as I see it, it would be preferable for the Turkish parliament to have a higher level of multiformity than it does at present, where a voting threshold of 10% is possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The main problem of the Oostlander report, however, lies in paragraph 7. The rapporteur has recognised, or perhaps had to recognise, that, if the current reforms take place, the Member States will inevitably decide in December to start the negotiations. What does paragraph 7 say on this? According to Mr Oostlander's interpretation, negotiations are inevitable, but we will not enter into real negotiations. In particular, the 31 chapters of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> will not form the subject of negotiations, although these negotiations have taken place with all other candidate Member States. What is being proposed in paragraph 7 is that we complete all the political criteria first. That sounds good, but what does it mean in practice?</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give an example; the same paragraph states that the programme should contain the drafting of a new Constitution. Mr Oostlander is in favour of this, and so am I. If this is done in a proper manner, it will, I think, take between two and three years; we need only look at how long the European Union is taking. To take another example, Mr Oostlander has repeatedly stated that the change in mentality that we want is a lengthy process. Does he really believe that this should all be completed before we can discuss the chapters? Surely not. Does Parliament think, and does, for example, the Group of the Party of the European Socialists really believe, that we should enter negotiations with Turkey with one arm tied behind our backs, because there are 31 chapters of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> that we are not allowed to discuss? My view, expressed in Amendment No 9, is different. I am in favour of doing two things after December.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we ought to continue to underline the importance of the political criteria, if necessary by means of a special monitoring system, because that is important, now and in future, but at the same time, we should start the so-called normal negotiations. In my opinion, we cannot say to Turkey in December that we will start negotiations and follow Mr Oostlander's interpretation in this. This interpretation is now enshrined in paragraph 7 and it allows us only to do the groundwork for many years before we can enter the actual negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 7 is now an imprecise – I would almost say diplomatic – compromise that covers a multitude of sins. The alternative is a clear, but balanced, position by Parliament, and to that Turkey is entitled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Queiró (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, I congratulate Mr Oostlander on the work he has done in this report, in which he raises several politically important questions regarding Turkey’s accession to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall highlight two: the first concerns the extent to which the European Union itself is prepared for the future integration of this large Euro-Asian country. What impact will its accession have, if it joins? What geopolitical state of affairs will result from the adoption of new external borders for the EU, which will lie not only outside Europe but also on the doorstep of armed conflicts? How should we face the issue of population size that Turkey’s application raises, and the effects that this will have on the existing institutional balances? Will Turkey’s entry strengthen the security of the European Union and make its foreign policy more credible and effective in the region? Will it be possible to maintain the common agricultural policy? If so, in what form? What about the structural funds? These observations do not imply that we have any less regard for the great Turkish nation; far from it. They merely mean that, in our view, there has yet to be a public, open, objective debate across Europe on this question, which we believe is absolutely essential. That is why we support the rapporteur’s proposal to call on the Commission to produce an exhaustive study on the impact of Turkey’s accession to the EU, which will inform Parliament and the Council of the internal changes that will have to be introduced into the EU, and the need to reform current policy in the various key areas I have mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question is, in some respects, the converse of the first, and concerns Turkey’s political will to press forward whole-heartedly with the necessary reforms of its structures and its institutional and legal framework in order to comply with the Copenhagen political criteria, much as has occurred in the other candidate countries. The rapporteur quite rightly considers that it is now up to Turkey to decide for itself if it is willing or able, as a precondition for opening negotiations, to adopt the political principles and values of the EU as being suited to the Turkish state and Turkish society.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect we have to recognise that the current government has shown strong political motivation and will to carry out major reforms, which have proved difficult and which are, in many cases, still unfinished, especially in the field of human rights, since they clash with traditions and practices of civil, judicial and military administration that have been consolidated over decades.</p>
<p class="contents">Opting for the so-called ‘legislative harmonisation packages’ has enabled Turkey to bring its legislation into line with EU standards more quickly than would have been the case if it had conducted an across-the-board review of the basic legal codes on which its political, judicial and legislative system is founded. This is a positive step. We are aware of the difficulties and the special conditions involved in this kind of process and can conclude that things are taking their course. Turkey may in future see the start of its negotiation process with the EU, provided that it keeps to the path of choosing the European values that it has been adopting of its own free and sovereign will.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the stage we have now reached should thus be understood as one of mutual preparation for the possible accession of Turkey to the European Union; preparation by the Union, which has to adapt at all levels in order to welcome in the great Turkish nation; and preparation by Turkey, which must continue its efforts to effectively implement the necessary reforms in accordance with the Copenhagen criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the outcome of this process must be the natural result of these efforts of mutual preparation and adaptation, and not the result of any subjective desire that does not take account of the realities that we are faced with on both sides. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rapporteur is right to state, in paragraph 32, that Turkey still has a different concept of the secular state from that which is usual in the European Union. Mr Oostlander also mentions state control over the main religion and discrimination against others. I should like to substitute the word state control for promotion, because under the wings of the Presidium for Religious Matters, which falls directly within Prime Minister Erdogan’s remit, the Turkish Republic provides the main religion – Sunni Islam – with generous social development opportunities. You only need to visit the Christian churches in Turkey. To this day, although they fall within the provisions of the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923, they have to do without the status of legal personality. To put it succinctly, Commissioner, there is a great deal to be done, but I do not need to tell you that.</p>
<p class="contents">I also endorse paragraph 10 in the report, in which Mr Oostlander stands up for the independence and the quality of higher education and scientific institutions in Turkey. A very topical request, given Mr Erdogan’s continuous attempts at reform, no less, to make the country's academic level subordinate to, and I quote 'the Cabinet's Islamist, conservative, political concepts’. This urgent warning, issued by a member of the Turkish Academy of Sciences a month or so ago, was published in the <span class="italic">Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</span>. This is another tell-tale sign for Brussels with regard to the actual state of affairs in Ankara. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Just as well! However, the point is not whether candidate Member States make progress, but whether they meet the criteria in order to be able to join. That is clearly not the case. Time permitting, I could list here a whole ream of fundamental problems that Turkey is still facing.</p>
<p class="contents">The human rights situation remains precarious, despite the reforms, which are mostly in place only on paper and are not being put into practice. On a socio-economic level too, the gap between Turkey and the European Union is so wide that it would be totally irresponsible even to consider Turkey's accession. I therefore fail to understand why some speakers state that Turkey will become a Member of the European Union, come what may. This attitude sums up perfectly all the things that are going wrong with the European Union. An appeal is made for including a non-European and Islamic country in the European Union, without holding a fundamental discussion on this. We want to include a country that, in 15 years' time, will be the largest Member State in terms of population and in terms of surface area. Moreover, that country will become the largest net recipient by far, but the population in Europe has not been consulted on this at any time; there will be no referendum in the Member States. We are even being warned against discussing the Turkey issue during the election campaign. In other words, fundamental decisions are being taken without reference to Europe’s citizens. That is the democratic deficit all over.</p>
<p class="contents">What it comes down to is that Turkey is not a European country and, as such, does not belong in the European Union. Nobody has ever had the courage to say this to the Turks, but one day we will have to. Turkey can, and has to, be helped as a friendly country, but that can be done perfectly well with an association agreement and in the framework of the Policy of Good Neighbourliness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is very much in our own strategic interests. It is, secondly, very much in our own interests that Turkey should become democratic and be under the rule of law, and that we should support developments towards this end. I do, though, have a number of unanswered questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at the region as a whole, Turkey is the country with the most highly developed democracy and rule of law. At the same time, Kemalism is, for a variety of reasons, an obstacle to membership of the European Union. Is it not perhaps the case, though, that Kemalism and the influence of the army are the reasons why Turkey manifests some degree of democracy and the rule of law? This is an inherent contradiction and a difficult issue, one that needs to be examined, and one of which we must not lose sight at the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing I want to say is that I, unlike Mr Lagendijk, take the view that negotiations are indeed dependent on fulfilment of the political criteria. That was the line we took with Slovakia; that is why Slovakia was not on board as long ago as 1997, and that is the line we should be taking now. If we do, we are not discriminating against Turkey; we are applying the normal rules as we have always done. Where fulfilment of the political criteria is concerned, it is not enough for legislators to pass the relevant resolutions; these must be put into practice. The rule of law and human rights must not just be decided on in the Grand National Assembly, but must also be accepted and put into practice by district court judges in Eastern Anatolia, and this is where I have my doubts as to whether it will be possible for this to happen by November. I have no doubt whatever that the present government wants this, but I do doubt whether it will be possible. It is something we will have to examine in the autumn, in exactly the same way, for example, as we will have to examine – as the German Foreign Minister has said – whether Turkey can be regarded as a safe third country for the purposes of the asylum procedure, as Germany accepts more asylum seekers from Turkey than from any other country. If, though, someone is recognised as an asylum seeker, then the country from which they come cannot be said to be under the rule of law. This issue will have to be addressed, and an answer given.</p>
<p class="contents">It must remain clear to us that the European Union’s integrative capacity has to be reviewed, that we have to consider whether its bonds are strong enough to prevent the occurrence of what Mr Van Orden has just described. We must be clear in our own minds about the fact that there are those in this House who seek to use enlargement to wreck the European Union. Let me add, though, that there are only a few of them; they are not all those who are in favour of Turkey’s accession, and I do believe that it is not only because of Turkey, but also because of other countries in Europe, that we need options for our relationships with countries that are not full Member States, including a new European Economic Area. While these countries, at any rate, should not be full members, at least at first, the option of full membership for Turkey, for the Ukraine, for the countries of the Western Balkans, will create serious problems for us in the coming years, and that is why we should come up with some new ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude, Mr President, by saying what I would like to see done about the Cyprus question. I would like to see this House delay taking up a definite position until such time as we have had sight of the documents we need in order to do so, as we did, for example, with regard to the reunification of Germany, when we went as far as to set up a special committee to consider the issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I find it difficult to be in the plenary and with the Conference of Presidents simultaneously. I hope you will understand that this must be my last contribution, and that I must then comply with your President’s request.</p>
<p class="contents">I have four brief comments to make. The first is that the adoption of Community law is what accession negotiations are about; it is not a precondition for them taking place. That is why many of the rapporteurs were quite right in what they said, and, indeed, our progress reports say the same thing, but that cannot now be used to justify our saying that we cannot start negotiating with Turkey because they have not yet done those things about which we are going to be negotiating. That is, unfortunately, an inherent contradiction.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have to point out to Mrs Sommer that it is simply not true to say, as she does, that the Turks are asking for more and more money whilst not taking any action. I surely ought to know if Turkey were asking for more money; it is not. On the contrary the truth – shameful as it is – is that the European Union was unable to deliver on its financial commitments to Turkey. That is the truth of the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the issue of the possible effects of Turkish accession on the Community system, which is, I would like to say, one of the most important issues of all. The idea of conducting a specific study into this is one that I regard as particularly important and interesting. I, too, am persuaded that this should be done, and we have already started to give some thought to the possible scope for such a project. It is also important, though, that we should know what accession would ultimately mean for the EU by the time any decision is taken on whether or not to start negotiating.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot do other than agree with all those who have made it abundantly clear that changes have to be reflected in reality. I have said the same thing over and over again to the Turkish Prime Minister during the long breaks in negotiations at Bürgenstock in Switzerland over the past few days. He is familiar with the problem, and I told him that the implementation of reforms must have reached such a critical mass by the end of this year that we can regard the process of implementation as credible and sustainable. If it is not, then we will hardly be able to come to the conclusion that the political criteria have been fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to highlight what Mr Brok said about perseverance in the reform process, which is the most important thing of all. As you will be aware, I favour a debate on the fundamental question of whether or not Turkey’s accession should happen at all – one that, although contentious, would be conducted frankly and without any prejudice whatever. All I ask, as I always do, is that, in all that we say and in the way we conduct our debate, we should not undermine what the reformers in Turkey are doing. Whatever we think about Turkey, there is one thing on which we must agree, and that is that it is in our fundamental interests that Turkey should become democratic, subject to the rule of law and stable, that it should become a steadfast and reliable partner for the European Union. That is true in any case, and that is why the reform process must continue.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by returning, briefly, to Cyprus: all the issues raised in the Oostlander Report concerning Turkish responsibility for Cyprus will be resolved as soon as the Annan plan is accepted. There will then be a solution, and so all the issues will no longer be relevant and will pass away. I get the impression that what now counts most of all, in fact, is to persuade the Greek Cypriot community that the plan that has been devised, the latest plan to be on the table – and there will not be another – is in their interests too. To do so demands a really high degree of leadership and strength of political will. While I am perfectly willing to make available to your House and to its committees all the information that we have, I have to point out that no changes can be made to the plan; all that we can do now is to consider it very carefully and evaluate it for ourselves, but nothing more can be changed. That is the answer I wanted to give you. I really do apologise for being unable, for once, to be present for the whole debate, but I have told you the reason why, and I ask for your understanding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, fictitious reality may suffice for Mr Van Orden, just as it suffices for him for the European Union to be a fictitious reality, from what I have understood, because he is aiming for a relaxed European Union. That is not our idea.</p>
<p class="contents">There are those who maintain that a Muslim Turkey cannot be accepted into the European Union. We do not agree with this; we want a Turkey which can of course be Muslim and will be, but it must be democratic and pacifist, at least towards its partners in the European Union. If Turkey thinks that we shall accept it as a military power and that we shall ratify the militaristic attitude of the leaders of its armed forces within the European Union, it is making a serious mistake. Nor is Turkey's stance in Cyprus encouraging and I greatly fear that neither the Secretary General's plan nor the stance of the European Commission are encouraging, because they cannot accept a massive military presence, which is equivalent to the military occupation of part of Cyprus, 18 years after the entry of Cyprus to the European Union, and probably even after the admittance of Turkey to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">These are absurd things and may explain the impatience of the Greek side towards the Annan plan. I hope and I am in favour of the Greek side's accepting the plan in question, but we must realise that we are asking the Greek side to build a democracy on something which is fundamentally anti-democratic, as the Annan plan is in its present state. I hope that we manage this for the good of Cyprus and the European Union, but we need to know what we are asking for.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Turkey's progress towards satisfying the Copenhagen criteria is concerned, on paper, yes! In reality, it is far from it. For example, the Minister for Education is asking for fanatical essays from pupils against other nationalities. It is not a question of the reform reaching the depths of the Orient. The reform needs to reach the depths of the Ministry of Education first. The rector of the University of Istanbul is standing up and talking about 135 000 dead in order to occupy both Cyprus and Greece. I am not saying that he is representative of all of public opinion or of the government; but this shows that there is resistance by one part of public opinion at least to certain fundamental changes and they must be taken into account, because the integration of Turkey into the European Union can only come about as and when the attitude within Turkey changes.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we have the case of Leyla Zana, who is a constant slap in the face of the European Parliament and I wonder how we still suffer this situation to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">It was posited by the president of Turkish industry two years ago that Turkey will either become Europe or will become Pakistan. We want Turkey to become Europe and, in order to achieve this, we must strengthen every progressive trend within Turkey, so that this is achieved from internal procedures, not from being led by the hand from outside because, if it is led by the hand from outside, we cannot hope that there will be change where change is needed in Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is how it describes certain individual amendments to the legislative framework, which are not even applied in practice, despite the intentions expressed from time to time by those in government.</p>
<p class="contents">The report even finds that the present government is acutely keen to make revolutionary reforms in all sectors. However, these findings are a surprise, given that it is not the first time that the Turkish government of the day has expressed such intentions, which are blatantly refuted in daily practice. Indeed, persecutions, arbitrary arrests and torture to the death for political reasons continue. The gaols are full of thousands of political prisoners, including Leyla Zana and three members of parliament of Kurdish extraction who, after ten years in prison, are to undergo another fixed trial.</p>
<p class="contents">The Constitutional Court has upheld the ban on the communist party. The Dehap is threatened with a new ban, while its leaders are being tried and defenders of human rights are being persecuted and murdered. Grass-roots movements campaigning for peace, democracy and workers' rights are being hounded and the army continues to rule in the political and social life of the country. As if that were not enough, the report calls for Turkey to receive greater backing in its fight against terrorism, ignoring the fact that it is the prime terrorist in its area.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Cyprus problem is concerned, the report considers it constructive that Turkey aims to safeguard as <span class="italic">acquis </span>the results of the barbaric invasion and occupation, about which the report says not a word. On the contrary, it supports the Annan plan which, in essence, tramples over the UN resolutions and international law in general, legalising the results of the invasion and occupation. The report calls coercively on the Cyprus Government to accept it, as did Messrs Oostlander, Verheugen and others today, proving how hypocritical their proclamations are about respect for international law. The report is driven by a spirit of imposing the sovereignty of the European Union in all sectors and a spirit of serving its big business.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece shall be voting against the report, taking account of the experience of the Greek people, with feelings of solidarity with the people of Turkey, and considering that the negative elements of the integration procedure and integration itself will far outweigh any individual benefits to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It contains a number of valuable recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">On Monday I returned from Turkey, where, with other politicians and trade unionists, I had the opportunity to observe the local elections. Paragraph 1 of the recommendations of this report refers to the 'oft-stated commitment' by the Turkish authorities 'to democracy and Europe'. I cannot share the same confidence. Whilst seeking to observe elections in the primary school of Vali Unal Erkan in Diyarbakir, we were shouted at, threateningly, by the local chief of police and prevented from entering the polling station. This was not an isolated incident. In polling stations in other parts of the country, members of the governing Turkish party were standing by, watching ballot papers being filled in by Kurdish electors. The military were present outside many polling stations within the Kurdish area.</p>
<p class="contents">Speakers of the Kurdish language – spoken by 20 million people in Turkey – continue to face persecution. Kurdish-medium schools are banned, the only concession being the belated effort now to allow a few schoolrooms to be open to teach Kurdish as a foreign language for a few hours a week.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we then say, in paragraph 8, that we have confidence that the AKP government will safeguard democratic values? As the report emphasises, the prohibition of political parties such as Hadep/Dehap continues, which is why I would urge colleagues to support Amendment No 11 by Mr Lagendijk on the crucial issue of abolishing the 10% threshold for political parties. Until these fundamental matters are addressed and the Turkish Government respects our own Charter of Fundamental Rights, many of us will have grave misgivings before supporting their accession to the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report states that the basic view is that, insofar as it wishes to do so, Turkey is in a position to transform itself into a first-class EU Member State. This seems to me rather like begging the question. If Turkey transforms itself, the country will become other than it is, but the question is of course one of whether such a transformation is at all possible.</p>
<p class="contents">If, firstly, we take it for granted that the EU consists of European states, Turkey can never become a member, for the country cannot transform itself into a European state, no matter how much it wishes to do so. The admission of countries outside Europe has never seriously been debated, and it is hardly possible or desirable to create such extensive cooperation within the framework of the treaties that constitute the basis of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the whole issue of complying with the Copenhagen criteria or Balladur principles, which are especially relevant here in relation to the occupation of parts of Cyprus. I must say, moreover, that I do not believe in the value of the Annan plan. I think Mr Verheugen is mistaken if he thinks that the Greek Cypriots are adherents of this plan. I do not believe that the Greek Cypriots will be able to accept a plan that gives Turkey a foothold on the island.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is the Treaty of Lausanne. This implies a total change to the Turkish constitution, its penal law, its legislation on marriage, its religious legislation, and so forth.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is a sharp difference between Turkey's economic structure and development and those of the EU. Change cannot be brought about merely through economic aid. It is a matter of creating a completely different society.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the admission of Turkey would lead to massive immigration of Turks into the EU, and even bigger parallel Islamic societies would take shape. There has recently been a series of very unsettling reports of threatening, anti-Western attitudes in extensive sections of the Islamic societies within the EU, and unfortunately this applies particularly to young, second-generation Turks. Europe simply cannot live with large population groups in the EU rejecting our culture.</p>
<p class="contents">What the adherents of Turkish membership are really requesting is for Turkey to jettison its entire Islamic culture, and I do not see this as realistic. It is important not to confuse the attitudes represented by Turkish diplomats and certain intellectuals and politicians with those found in the rest of Turkey’s very class-divided society. Turkey is basically an Islamic society, regardless of the formal separation of church and state imposed from above. If Turkey were thoroughly democratised, as the EU wishes, the people would, unfortunately, without doubt take a democratic decision to introduce an Islamic state without democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">There is not an Islamic country in the world that meets the Copenhagen criteria, and Turkey is hardly likely to do so either, even if the EU asks it to. We should honestly say to Turkey that there can be no question of membership of the EU, and we should not hold out empty promises to the country. On that basis, I should like to support the amendments, tabled by Mr Ferber and others, to integrate Turkey into the EU's new neighbour policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not that we are opposed in principle to these countries’ accession, but my group and I, the French delegation to the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, have been expressing our opposition to an unrealistic integration timetable and to the immediate accession of countries which, like ourselves, are not ready for such a leap into the unknown. Our position on Turkish accession is quite different. In this case, we are opposed in principle to Turkish accession. As General de Gaulle remarked, there is no getting away from the facts. Geographically historically and culturally, Turkey is not a European country. The fact is that, under Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union, any applicant for membership of the European Union must be a European State. I should just like to raise two further points, in addition to the many that have already been made.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, in the multipolar world in which we live, Turkey is an Eastern power; it plays a dominant role among the Turkish-speaking peoples of Central Asia and shares lengthy borders with Iran, Iraq and Syria. Such an unstable region, in our view, is no place for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the political representation of the countries in the European Union is linked to their relative demographic weight. In due course, Turkey will be more populous than any European country. We do not want a country whose accession arouses such controversy to become a political heavyweight in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">After years of procrastination on the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey, the vote on this report is an opportunity to send out a strong political signal. Even though we subscribe to the numerous criticisms in the report relating to the country’s lack of preparedness for accession, the report focuses on Turkey’s progression towards accession, and we shall therefore oppose it, because, like a great number of our fellow citizens, we are against Turkish membership of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, let me leave you with one final question: where is the expansion of this Union, this so-called European Union, going to stop? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do think, though, that the time is coming when Europe will have to answer the question of how we want, in the long term, to organise relations between the European Union and Turkey, and I would like to say that I am greatly saddened by the prevalent opinion that, where Turkey’s relationship with the European Union is concerned, there are only two options, one being that it becomes a Member State and the other that it does not. This belief completely disregards the variegated and diverse individual ways in which the European Union and other countries can cooperate. I am from a region bordering on Switzerland, a country with which we have concluded a privileged partnership, which has enabled us to join together in resolving problems while each developing in our own way. That is precisely what we are thinking of when we talk about Turkey. Commissioner Verheugen is of course right to say that we need to stabilise the forces that are working for reform, but is full Member State status the only means of doing so? Is there not another option when it comes to ensuring that Turkey develops economically and as a stable democracy, which is in our interests as Europeans, without accession to the European Union being a necessary consequence of that? That, precisely, is what we should be discussing among ourselves, with great frankness and great honesty.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge the Commission – or the remnant of it that is still there, as it is currently breaking up – when it puts together its report for presentation to the Heads of State or Government in the autumn, to give in-depth attention to the question of whether or not the political criteria have been fulfilled. My own country is still granting asylum to people from Turkey, because they are persecuted by the State there. Can we carry on accession negotiations with such a country? I do not believe that we can. I would also ask the Council to give this question very serious consideration, because, ultimately, Parliament’s consent will be needed. If the Heads of State or Government think they can take fundamental decisions of this kind without reference to the European people, then they deceive themselves. They are deluded if they think it would end up all happening automatically, that Parliament and the people would go along with it – for some Member States will hold referendums on whether or not to ratify it. What this House has, here and now, is, I think, a great opportunity to give thought to this, and to send the peoples of the European Union the message that, while we are very serious about the concerns and expectations of people in Turkey and in our other neighbouring countries where this European Union of ours is concerned, we do have options open to us other than merely discussing full membership, and we should now explore them together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After numerous discussion sessions and amendments in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, the resolution proposed by the rapporteur, Mr Oostlander, seems to me to be well enough balanced to be voted through. I shall vote in favour of it – provided, of course, that this balance is not upset by the adoption in plenary of new amendments that are unduly harsh on Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Not that we need to be soft on Turkey in any way. Indeed, it is imperative that we insist on the radical reforms that the Turkish Government must implement if it is eventually to meet the Copenhagen criteria. This insistence and these demands, reaffirmed on countless occasions by the European Parliament and the Commission, have actually begun to bear fruit. Mr Erdogan’s Government, strengthened by the outcome of the last elections, and the Turkish Grand National Assembly have already adopted laws that move in the right direction. It is essential, of course, that these new laws are properly implemented in practice, and there is certainly a need for other laws and a new constitution. People’s mindsets, of course, have to be changed too, and that is never easy; in fact, it is the most difficult task of all. Progress has already been made, however, and we in Parliament, far from breaking this momentum, must encourage it to grow.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the great merits of this process preparing the way for future Turkish accession to the European Union is that it encourages reforms leading to pluralist democracy, a modern economy and respect for individual rights. The last of these calls to mind the case of Leyla Zana, and it is my fervent wish that the reform process will lead quickly to the long-awaited just and equitable resolution of this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, the ongoing reform process has already been of great value in drawing us closer to Turkey and in forging increasingly firm bonds of mutual trust between Turkey and ourselves. The fact is that we are in greater need of these bonds. Our future, and particularly our security in the wider sense of the term, depends to a great extent on good relations with the great country of Turkey. We must therefore continue to cultivate these relations with vigour and conviction against a background of hope in the opening of accession negotiations at the beginning of next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Council decided in Helsinki in 1999 that Turkey is a candidate country. That decision is still in force and, therefore, Turkey is to be treated as a candidate country in line with all the other candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The biggest requirement of a candidate country is, as Mr Oostlander said, that it fulfil the Copenhagen Criteria. It is to be a society based on the rule of law with democratic stability and respect for human rights and for minorities, it is to have a well-functioning market economy, and so on. Turkey does not at present meet all these conditions, but it is on the way to doing so. We have seen much progress, and we must not, therefore, here and now reject the possibility of Turkey's becoming a member of the EU. There is no doubt that it is precisely the EU's demands that have contributed significantly to the democratic progress that has taken place in Turkey, and a signal from the European Parliament that Turkey cannot become a member of the EU, or that Turkey must be given special status would undoubtedly put a stop to this positive development.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the Commission's papers, the Heads of Government are now, in December, to take a decision on accession negotiations with Turkey within a more precise time-scale and on more precise conditions. With Mr Oostlander’s thorough, balanced and comprehensive report, the European Parliament must, however, here and now send a signal to the European Council that Turkey is to be treated like all previous candidate countries. This is something we owe to our Turkish neighbours, and we must tell the Turks that they are well on the way and that they should continue along the path upon which they have embarked, for the benefit of Turkey, the EU and stability and growth in our part of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last weekend, the president of the HRFT, Yavuz Önen, received an award at the national congress of the June Movement for his and the organisation's courageous struggle for human rights in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">The HRFT is threatened with closure as a result of several court cases against members of its leadership, including Yavuz Önen. The HRFT has five centres for the rehabilitation of torture victims, and a thousand active volunteers. Its closure might have serious consequences for the treatment of torture victims in Turkey, since no one else can take up the HRFT’s work. The many victims of torture would be left in the lurch. Torture takes place routinely in Turkish prisons and at Turkish police stations. The state and the authorities constantly try to harass the centres in their work on court cases, and doctors are threatened with losing their jobs at the public hospitals if they work for the centres. Yes, the centres have, in fact, by no means been made legal, but they have so far won all their cases against the state.</p>
<p class="contents">I call upon Parliament and the Commission carefully to monitor the ability of the Turkish human rights organisation to carry out its very necessary work for human rights in Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To tell the truth, when we read the report in detail, it contains precious few points that might honestly be regarded as arguments in favour of accession other than references to the meritorious efforts of the Turkish Government, and even these are by no means sure to have any genuinely profound social impact. The values of Turkish society are still far removed from those of the European Union in numerous fundamental areas, such as relations between the state and religious communities, as detailed in paragraphs 32 and 33 of the Oostlander report, which I would urge everyone to think about.</p>
<p class="contents">We can always hope, of course, for more rapid constitutional development in Turkey towards democracy, pluralism, public freedoms and the dismantling of the parallel military state. These objectives, however, have yet to be achieved. Even if they were achieved, how long would it then take for Turkish society to fall into line? Besides, do we not have reason to fear adverse reactions on the part of certain social groups and undesirable effects which, as Europeans, we would be powerless to control?</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, ladies and gentlemen, it would be irresponsible of us to offer Turkey anything but a privileged partnership designed to support its development without leading the EU down a dangerous path. It would be better to say this clearly, and we should have done so long ago. My main criticism of the Oostlander report is that it does not convey this message. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank Commissioner Verheugen for having come from Switzerland late yesterday evening to inform us of the situation regarding the talks with Cyprus, which is intimately linked with our debate this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">Two weeks ago I attended the EU-Cyprus Joint Parliamentary Committee, and while there was little optimism, there was a real desire for the two communities to be united on 1 May. We hope very much that this will take place.</p>
<p class="contents">On Turkish accession to the Union, Mr Verheugen gave us a very detailed analysis of the political and economic reforms that have been made. I welcome, as others have, his belief that a clear objective assessment should be made on the basis of the Copenhagen criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a copy of the Copenhagen criteria of 21-22 June 1993 in front of me. It states that: 'Membership requires that the candidate country has achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities, the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union.' However, then it states: 'The Union's capacity to absorb new members, while maintaining the momentum of European integration, is also an important consideration in the general interest of both the Union and the candidate countries.'</p>
<p class="contents">Much has been said in this debate about the great progress Turkey is making, but very little has been said about the Union's capacity to absorb a country of the size and nature of Turkey. Therefore, we need now to look not only at Turkey's ability to join the Union, but also at our ability to absorb it.</p>
<p class="contents">When coming to the question of the big picture – which Mr Duff mentioned – many in my political group believe that this involves the ability of the Union to absorb Turkey on the one side and the Turkish ability to meet those criteria on the other. We believe, therefore, that there should be a fundamental assessment of the institutional capacity of the Union to absorb Turkey and that this should be part of the Commission's report in October. So we should have the courage to look at the situation in a very clear and reasonable manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, with 25 Member States from 1 May, 21 languages, no post-2006 financial perspective in view until 2005 at the earliest, and doubts about whether a Constitutional Treaty will be agreed and ratified, the most sensible thing would be to say that there is real uncertainty in the Union's current political situation, and to be extremely cautious before giving Turkey the green light at this stage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His answer made reference to the Copenhagen criteria. Even after the reporter put many more questions to him, he did not say ‘no’ to Turkish accession. I think he was right. As Turkey has been promised accession for 40 years, anything else would only unsettle the people on the Bosphorus and the overall political climate in Europe as well. Parliament should therefore not adopt anything that would constitute an obstacle to the accession option; it follows that several motions that have been tabled should not be allowed to pass.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite clearly, the ball is in the Turkish court. The Turks must demonstrate compliance with the Copenhagen criteria. We can see that much has been done, but not yet enough. There is still a long way to go on the road to democracy, to the rule of law, to freedom, and, as regards the last of these, our express concern has been for Turkey’s minorities, especially the Kurds. Much has been set down in black and white, but it is not yet working in practice – in schools, in television, or when it comes to the use of their language. I get letters from members of the public, complaining about the arbitrary treatment they receive from the police and the justice system – a grim business to which Turkey must put an end! Their police and justice systems are not democratic; there is much still to be done here.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that all power must be in the hands of the civil institutions, and that the armed forces must go where they belong – to their barracks. It cannot be acceptable that the armed forces, the National Security Council, should have the upper hand when decisions are taken in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Commissioner Verheugen’s assessment that Turkey has made a start on a major project of reform. For an Islamic country, a constitution based on democratic and liberal principles is also a major experiment, and something that we should support. So, instead of saying ‘no’, we should leave the door of opportunity open to further reforms and vote accordingly later on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many, if not all, speeches have underlined the fundamental problem, which is that of the respect for human rights and principles of freedom on which our Union is founded. The question is, does Turkey fulfil the requirements from this point of view? We would answer in the negative.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I would like to report that yesterday something very serious happened in the chamber of the Italian Parliament. The leader of the Lega Nord-Padania, Mr Cè, was prevented from speaking because he dared to utter a phrase – ‘<span class="italic">Roma ladrona’ </span>(thieving Rome) – which was censored. This is a very serious precedent. I therefore call on the European Parliament, as the guardian of the freedom of all European peoples, to show solidarity concerning the violated right of the legitimate representatives of the citizens of Padania – who have no fewer rights than the Kurds – to be able to speak freely, in particular in the parliamentary chambers of a founding member of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would reiterate that this is an extremely serious precedent concerning censorship of a political party that wants independence and federalism and is, therefore, against statism. This seems more typical of Turkish style democracy than that of a country that is undoubtedly democratic and was a founding member of the European Union. The phrase does not indicate racism against anyone, least of all the Roman people. Being against ‘thieving Rome’ means being against centralism and being against those who oppress our freedom. We are against thieving Rome for the same reasons that we say ‘no’ to the accession of Turkey to Europe. Down with thieving Rome, down with thieving Rome! Here I can say it freely and no one, thank God, will silence me: down with thieving Rome! Let them hear it in Rome: Padania is against thieving Rome, it is in favour of freedom. Long live freedom! Long live the European Union! Long live the principle of the right of peoples to self-determination! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There can be no doubt about the fact that the enlarged EU will need time to consolidate. The public can scarcely understand that an event of this magnitude does not happen all at once, and that we need, at the same time, to set in motion a process to speed enlargement up. It is with these things in mind that the debate on Turkish accession must be conducted.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not suppose that anyone in this House is unaware of Turkey’s geopolitical significance, or does not welcome its steps towards democracy and human rights. Nor, though, can there be anyone who would deny that there is a gulf between what legislation presumes and what has actually been implemented with regard to all these issues. Reference has already been made to the fact that Turkey is one of the countries producing the most asylum seekers, and Austria, for example, grants asylum to more Turks than to anyone else. I nevertheless believe, as does the delegation to which I belong, that, in concentrating on purely political criteria, the report on Turkey takes too narrow a view. That is why my delegation and I endorse all the motions aimed at securing a broader basis for this debate. There is no reason why the Commission should not produce a study on the effects of Turkish accession on the European Union, whether as part of the report that is due in October or as a separate study. Consideration must be given to the repercussions on structural policy, on the common agricultural policy, and on the institutions of the European Union. When the report is produced, in October, the options for Turkey should also be set out, and these should not focus solely on accession; we have to offer them alternatives in good time. That we owe to ourselves and to them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by extending warm thanks to Mr Oostlander, who has, as rapporteur, been magnanimous enough not to inhibit discussion, and has remained sensitive enough to keep faith with himself. What this report on Turkey now presents us with, though, is the opportunity to send an important political signal and to put the debate on a broader basis. It is not acceptable that we should limit ourselves to political criteria in the narrowest sense of the word. It must also be possible to examine and assess the likely effects on the European Union. If that is not done, the voters will never forgive us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fundamental problem with enlargement is that we will see a large expansion of the Union from 1 May, and that will be much more problematic than earlier rounds of enlargement, while at the same time the Union’s ability to receive new members is not as great as it was before. The EU is now more demanding and involved, and enlargement is not a machine or an animal: it is the most complex human creation of all – the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, however, treat Turkey just as fairly as all the other countries seeking accession to the EU despite the fact that our ability to receive them has weakened. A lot of progress has been made in Turkey in a short time. There are new laws representing civil society and there is democracy. The status of women and the Kurds is now being openly debated, although I have no conclusive knowledge of where military power ends and civil power begins. The significance of the status of the military is a very big problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The Copenhagen criteria have not been fulfilled, by which I mean the establishment of the rule of law and human rights. There is still work to do regarding this. The judiciary is not independent and Turkey should sign the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. We face a familiar problem: just laws are passed, and a lot of decisions are taken, but whether or not they are implemented in practice and this implementation is monitored remains a big, murky problem that we have been unable to solve, and this is in the hands of the Turks themselves. Can they do it? That is the question this time round, and we will only answer it afterwards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is no mean feat and is due to the very reasonable and balanced line of argument he follows from beginning to end – well, almost from beginning to end, but more of that in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say that Mrs Stenzel speaks with the voice of wisdom when she points out that we are not seeing the whole picture if we only assess Turkey’s progress but do not examine the state of readiness of the European Union, in its various fields of political activity, to receive Turkey, and this is no trifling matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The point I should like to pick up, Mr Oostlander, is that of secularism. Paragraph 32 of your report seems to me to proceed from a slightly jaundiced view of the secularism which is perhaps the most valuable part of the legacy of Kemal Atatürk. The separation of church and state is not an archaic formula but a recipe for the future of our Union. The fact that the government of a country whose people are mainly Muslim is trying to put this separation into practice is, I believe, an asset for which Turkey deserves credit, not an obstacle to progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is absolutely no doubt in this House that Turkey is an important partner and that it will remain one. Partnership, however, does not automatically mean full membership of the European Union. Mr Leinen mentioned the 1963 Association Agreement. This puts it in explicitly negative terms, stating that: ‘the possibility of accession to the European Economic Community at a later date is not excluded’. Those – no more and no less – are the words used.</p>
<p class="contents">After two decades of absolute standstill, Turkey has at last got down to the task of changing its laws. As it progresses towards more democracy and more human rights, that can surely be seen in a positive light. Even though the Turkish Prime Minister has announced his intention of amending another 15 to 20 paragraphs of the constitution in April and May, these changes take no account as yet of important demands made by the European Parliament, for such things as freedom of religion and the repeal of the 10% clause in order to protect political minorities. We have therefore tabled motions highlighting the possibility of an alternative to deciding in favour of or against full membership, that alternative being a privileged partnership. Let nobody assume that the decision on this will be for the Council alone. The next Parliament to be elected – which will sit from 2004 and 2009 – must possess in full the prerogative of saying ‘yes’ or ‘no’ and of devising alternatives. I therefore ask the Members of this House to treat the amendments we have introduced on this subject as the dignity of this Parliament and of our position require.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say one last thing about the Copenhagen criteria: important though they are, they are not enough. The Turks must bear in mind that the criteria cover not only the Cyprus issue, but also the question of whether the European Union is itself in a position to welcome their country into membership. We cannot allow ourselves to get involved in a risky undertaking that would test to the utmost the EU’s political and economic capacity to act. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am grateful for five years of cooperation and for your having tolerated me, a Turk, in this House. I really am very, very grateful. Thank you: your great achievement does credit to this House!</p>
<p class="contents">I came to this Parliament as a German, have worked very hard as a German MEP for five years, but it is as a Turk that I leave it. Many of you have made me into a Turk, for I am ashamed of the speeches that really can only be described as hypocritical, of these speeches that really have nothing honest about them. Others may take pride in bravely defending the Christian EU against the Turks, and may perhaps find some voters to support them, but I am ashamed; such is not my European Union.</p>

That country has made enormous progress over the past years. By way of example, I would mention the abolition of the death penalty and the change in attitude towards the Kurdish minority. This is all happening under a Turkish Government of which it was feared at the time that it would turn Turkey into an Islamic state.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, reality is different. Without hesitation, the Turkish Government calls for good governance, more transparency and equality between men and women. The experiment which the AKP Party is conducting is unique and of worldwide significance. As the European Union should not leave these signals without a response, it should offer a concrete prospect of joining as soon as possible; otherwise, we would soon run the risk of having to face the threat of an Islamic-fundamentalist state, no longer open to dialogue, by the back door. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am thinking here of the Kurds, but also of the religious minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Ceyhun, who spoke earlier, I would say that there was much in his speech that I did not understand. I am sure that he was not merely tolerated; we enjoyed very good neighbourly relations, being immediate neighbours here in Strasbourg. Such neighbourliness can be built on, and I believe that a privileged partnership constitutes a third way between members and non-members of the European Union and those who have a privileged relationship with the European Union and must also have a space for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We have different conceptions of the future of the European Union; ours is that this Europe, this European Union of ours, must have borders, and that is why we conclude special agreements with our immediate neighbours. With this in mind, I believe that Turkey, be it for reasons of history, geography or culture, would not fit in as a direct member of the European Union, and I hope that we will go on along this third way with the courage it deserves. Here too, the Commission and the Council should exercise greater imagination, rather than simply pointing out that the way is, in any case, already mapped out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Progress, of course, but at the present time it is easier to list the points of divergence than the advances that have been made. The constitution, adopted under a military regime, is not a basis on which the rule of law and fundamental rights and freedoms can be guaranteed. Another matter that needs to be raised is the recognition of the genocide perpetrated against the Armenian population. Let us not forget that the European Parliament affirmed this in a resolution adopted on 18 June 1987 and has subsequently repeated it on several occasions. Turkey continues to deny the atrocities committed by the authorities of that time, and the European Parliament has already voiced its concern about the circulars from the Turkish Ministry of National Education enjoining primary and secondary schools to take part in a revisionist campaign to deny the oppression of minorities in the course of Turkish history, especially with regard to the Armenian community. It is hard to see how a country that will not face up to its history and its errors can join the European Union. We therefore expect Turkey to exercise its memory, and we shall reiterate this at every opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, let me thank Mr Oostlander for his report, which was a very fair one, and also for the way in which he handles Turkey’s problems with its neighbours, particularly with Armenia.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two pre-eminent problems, and the first of them is Turkey’s economic boycott of Armenia. The closure of the Turkish-Armenian border has meant that the transport of goods to Armenia is more expensive, and this frustrates the European Union’s economic aid to that country. This also constitutes a grave breach of the Balladur Principles, which apply to all present and future candidates for accession, and according to which EU Member States must not be engaged in border disputes with neighbouring states, but must, on the contrary, maintain good relations with them.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem is that what has historically transpired between Turkey and Armenia has still not been worked through, and this hampers mutual understanding and prevents the development of mutual trust. Most recently, and unfortunately, Turkey has ensured that Armenia has had no part in the negotiations on energy transport and on the construction of pipelines from the region around the Caspian Sea, which is rich in natural gas and oil, and that these will not go through Armenia. All these things are justified causes for complaint by the Armenian people. It has not, so far, been possible to resolve these conflicts, which are obstacles not only to Turkey’s goal of joining the European Union, but also to that of the European Union itself, of stabilising the South Caucasus region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Erdogan’s government is doing its utmost. That is positive, but a great deal has yet to be done before the negotiations can be opened after December. Torture and the curbing of various civil freedoms remain a problem and the gap between theory and practice remains too wide.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not only we, in the ivory towers of Brussels and Strasbourg, who are concerned about this problem; the ordinary citizens in Europe are too, and we must therefore be absolutely certain that we will be taking the right decision when the time comes. I am therefore rather surprised at Mr Lagendijk's comment that he thinks that Turkey should negotiate with one arm tied behind its back if it does not need to meet the political criteria first, and that this can be done parallel to the negotiations about the <span class="italic">acquis</span>. That puts everything back to front, and seems to suggest that we are doing something unsavoury when we ask an accession country to meet our fundamental values first. In that respect too, we should adhere to what has been agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey will soon need to be judged fairly on the basis of the political Copenhagen criteria. I have heard Commissioner Verheugen use the term ‘zero tolerance’, and I find it an appealing one. The Turks deserve this, and so does the population in the European Union.

We are looking at the issue of Turkey from the point of view of fear, the extraordinary fear of a partner coming closer to us, one with a large population, which at the same time is rather different from us. Nevertheless, the reality is that, over the last two and a half years, nobody could have imagined the changes Turkey is implementing in order to come closer to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from the first revolution in the thirties, which changed the language and created a secular country – if only all the Arab countries had this view of a State in which civil power is separated from religious power – in the face of the increasingly powerful theocracies we have in the Islamic world, it seems incredible that we do not understand that this is a great experiment in democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, we are in the habit of looking at others arrogantly and we do not realise how small we are. And why are we small? Because, if we look at the international context and what is going to happen in the future, the great China, the great India, the United States ... all of these will be great powers and Europe will have a very minor role to play; it will be one of the world's small provinces.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not, therefore, see any problem with a country which has a structure of government, a degree of capacity building, which must be developed, but which is greater than other European countries, which has State structures and is therefore capable of doing its duties, as it is doing, progressing under a moderate government which is striving to establish democracy and implement political reforms, I do not see why we cannot give it the opportunity to be a partner which is close to us and which can set an example for the Arab countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us look at demography. The demography of the Mediterranean, of Turkey, of Azerbaijan and of other countries, stands in contrast to our own. Let us think of the future and develop the approaches and analyses we need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
