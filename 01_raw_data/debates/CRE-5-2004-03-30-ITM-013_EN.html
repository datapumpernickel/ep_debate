<p class="contents">Waste from extraction can be of such a composition and volume as to pose a serious threat to the environment and human health if it is not managed correctly. This has of course been seen in the major accidents in Aznalcóllar in Spain, in 1998, and also in Baia Mare in Romania, in 2000, when tailings ponds burst, releasing large quantities of toxic substances. This had an extensive environmental, economic and social impact.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this proposal is to introduce EU-wide rules to prevent water and soil pollution from long-term storage of waste in tailings ponds or heaps. The stability of disposal facilities must also be ensured in order to prevent the occurrence, or reduce the impact, of accidents. Combined with the amended Seveso II Directive on the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances, and a document on the best available techniques for the management of ponds for tailings and waste rocks, this proposed Directive will guarantee the appropriate management of waste from extraction throughout the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the views of those who have said that the proposal must have a sufficiently broad scope, and that some exemptions, for example concerning waste from prospecting, should therefore be removed. In this context, the exemption for inert waste should not be extended to cover all non-hazardous waste, as that would weaken the proposal. Contamination from mines can indeed pose a problem, but it cannot be regulated by this proposal, which concerns waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding historical waste, the Commission supports the amendments containing requirements for the most contaminated sites to be inventoried. In our opinion, however, it should be the Member States which make the decisions on the rehabilitation of these sites.</p>
<p class="contents">We also support the amendments emphasising the need to make appropriate plans for the closure of disposal facilities as early as the design phase.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by pointing out that the Commission is striving for a directive that is sufficiently comprehensive to enable the achievement of these important environmental objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sjöstedt (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, before I go into detail on this proposal and Parliament’s suggested changes and improvements, I should like to recapitulate on the background to this Directive. It was prompted by the serious environmental disasters in Spain and Romania that the Commissioner also mentioned. We should be aware that the problem of collapsing mine dams is something that recurs almost yearly in different parts of the world, including in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it can be said that an environmental disaster is lurking, in the form of the leakage into the environment of old mining waste, about which we often know very little, chiefly heavy metals. All things considered, this could be said to constitute a considerably greater environmental problem than the mining currently in operation. At the same time, EU legislation in this field has been inefficient, as the existing directives on waste, some of which currently apply to mining waste, are ineffective and ill-suited to this type of industrial production. This makes it perfectly clear that a new directive is needed in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence, we should like to thank the Commission for its proposal. This has many good points, for example regarding the safety of ponds and the effective prohibition of the method involving a high cyanide content, which had been used in Romania. This Directive will make that method inadmissible in future. As a Member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and as rapporteur, I should also like to see further improvements. Firstly, it is important that this cover all relevant types of waste. For that reason, we have chosen to remove a number of exemptions, for example concerning waste from prospecting. I also think that it is important that it cover waste that is removed from the nearest production site. I am especially grateful that we have been able to agree on a definition that I think works well, because the definitions issue was rather complicated in this case. There is now agreement on this within the political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to mention inert non-hazardous waste. It is important to realise that even waste that is not intrinsically or chemically hazardous can cause major environmental problems. This can happen if it is incorrectly stored, if it is allowed to contaminate water resources, or in the case of soil acidification. It is important that this waste, too, be covered by rules requiring that it be restored and managed properly. I do not think that the decision taken by the Committee on the Environment goes far enough in this regard, and have therefore tabled Amendment No 98, which would put this right, in my view.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the key points in this report concerns historical waste, which is perhaps the greatest environmental problem of all. It is not sufficient to just make an inventory. We must also ensure that we really do address this issue, otherwise we are only going halfway towards tackling environmental problems. In my opinion, it is important to include this in the suggestions made in the report, so that we are also able to use Structural Funds to really address this. This will represent an opportunity for the new Member States, in particular, to address these quite significant environmental problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that this should be seen as an opportunity for new technology and for that research and development currently taking place in the EU that to some extent already leads the world in this field and, above all, can do so in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of financial guarantees from companies, too, we opted for a compromise among the political groups even before first reading. This involved our allowing Member States considerable freedom to give shape to these financial guarantees. This is a good thing, as many countries already have effective systems in place. At the same time, Commission approval will be required so that the guarantees meet requirements, which is only reasonable.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding technical solutions to the various provisions of the proposal, my aim as rapporteur was that we avoid going into technical detail and shackling these proposals to various technical solutions: that would hinder adaptation to technological developments. I believe that we have indeed achieved this result.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point that I should like to mention is that, from a global perspective, a large proportion of the least responsible mining takes place in the very poorest countries. We have inserted into the report words to the effect that, where EU funding is granted for mining projects, for instance from the European Investment Bank, compliance with the requirements laid down in the Directive will be a prerequisite for this aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point that I have chosen to emphasise concerns the monitoring of dams. Despite construction requirements, there are often shortcomings in that dams are not adapted later, nor are they monitored as required if the production conditions change. We have also seen this in these accidents. Another important point is that we want planning to take place right at the beginning, before the closure phase.</p>
<p class="contents">Taken as a whole, I think that the Committee on the Environment’s draft strengthens the Commission’s work significantly, whilst still being fully in line with it. I hope that these proposals will enable us to address the fundamental problems that I mentioned at the beginning: preventing major dam collapses, making leakage of pollutants into the environment a thing of the past, and establishing legislation in this field that is effective in practice and comprehensive. The framework for doing so is now in place.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take a couple of seconds to thank the shadow rapporteurs and the representatives of the Commission for their constructive cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The way some of the amendments have been worded with regard to inert waste only serves to confuse the whole situation, resulting in a sea of endless questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Non-hazardous waste, which is the kind of waste associated with extractive industries, is indeed non-hazardous, because it is material that has its origin in nature. Nature’s own environmentally non-hazardous material, waste rock, cannot be waste, especially if it is still being used as filler material in mines and quarries, for soil improvement or road construction. Making waste rock subject to a waste tax in Finland could only cost the jobs of hundreds, if not thousands, of people.</p>
<p class="contents">European extractive industries will bring remarkable added value for the European Union. The socio-economic impact of the new extractive industry will be of crucial importance, especially for sparsely populated and peripheral regions. It is by no means a matter of insignificance how this branch of industry should be handled. Telephones, windows, glasses, crockery, cutlery, transport and building, to name just some goods and sectors of industry, are all based on this industry. Now it is a question of whether we want to keep this industry in Europe under our own supervision and in compliance with the principle of sustainable development, or drive it outside the Union, where its environmental implications are beyond our control, through legislation that is too constraining and unfamiliar to the sector. It is crucial that an explicit Minerals Policy for the European Union is drawn up, taking into account environmental and economic factors. Once again this would be a task for the Commissioner responsible for competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Needing as we do the riches of the earth in order to live, we seek them out, process them and use them. They are of differing value, and it is their utility value that is decisive. The question arises of whether all of what we do not at present use or process is to be categorised as waste. I do not believe that it is.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to get at the material deeper below the surface, good soil, earth and overburden are removed, transported away and later tipped back onto the excavated sites, thus guaranteeing the return of fertile fields and meadows, in other words, that the earth will be as good as it was before.</p>
<p class="contents">What made discussions in Committee so difficult was the definition of waste, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, in its report, the Sjöstedt report, has opted very firmly for the definition that is already in the Waste Framework Directive. We are in favour of real waste – polluted material or stones – being properly removed and disposed of. Overburden and topsoil – at least as the terms are used in German – constitute reusable materials that are vitally important elsewhere, in that, without them, opencast mines could not be properly filled in, and recultivation would be impossible without topsoil.</p>
<p class="contents">All those who engage in extractive work, or who make incisions in nature, are also under an obligation to leave behind them tidy, orderly and, above all, hazard-free land when their work is done, so it is right that the plans should include a contractual provision for renaturation and recultivation with effect from the commencement of work. We lay down sureties for this; these must, however, be both secure and flexible. This is where the Member States are under an obligation to lay down criteria, which must then be approved by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, above all, concerned about the misdeeds of the past, the incorrectly decommissioned mines, the tailings that were piled up; this is what we term historical waste. It is right and proper that we should speak up in favour of making an inventory of the one and removing the other, but this requires more time. There is a need for criteria that are capable of being met and put into practice. In Amendments Nos 71 and 72, the rapporteur does not go far enough. A directive on mining waste does not have to repeat and recapitulate everything that is already regulated in other European Union directives, such as the Landfill Directive, the Water Framework Directive and the Waste Framework Directive.</p>

I have just been spending the evening with BASF, a major chemicals business, and have had to leave them in a rush in order to get here.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Party of European Socialists is very happy with the legislation we now have on waste from the mineral-extracting industry. What we in Europe need is unified standards for the management of this waste, which will not only lead to greater similarity between the conditions under which companies compete in the Member States, but will also, at the same time, improve the public’s living conditions and their environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee’s deliberations generally focussed on the definition of what is meant by waste and on the financial guarantees to be provided by the industry, but a broad majority backed what we agreed on, and there was general agreement on it; we hope that the plenary will tomorrow follow us in that agreement. We want every company to be obliged to ensure that it is able to repair any damage to the environment for which it is responsible. We do not insist that only one form of financial surety should be possible. Although we have left a great deal of leeway and many options, the Member States and the Commission must guarantee to us that this will work.</p>
<p class="contents">When it came to defining mining waste, we took on board everything from everyone who engaged in the discussion process – the industry, the environmental NGOs, the Court of Justice, and, not least, the Commission. There is no question of us in the Committee having voted to reinvent existing legislation; quite the contrary, that is precisely what we have avoided. We have made a number of improvements to the Commission proposal with environmental considerations in mind. We have made the connection between ecology and economy, something that Social Democrats have always been keen to do. The fact that the plenary has only 20 amendments from the groups to vote on testifies to the good work we have done in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I found working on this dossier with my fellow Members of the Committee a very pleasant experience; the Commission, too, was very helpful on many occasions, and so let me now express my warm thanks for that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We feel it is an extremely important area. Mining and quarrying waste accounts for nearly 30% of the annual EU waste, which equals hundreds of millions of tons of waste. I come from a country which encouraged mining activities without looking at the long-term consequences of these activities, and some of the mines have left a history of major problems which will reach far into the future; for example, Tynagh Mines in Ireland is one of the most obvious cases. There has to be accountability here. Because of the lack of proper control, mining companies have been able to get away with leaving behind, when they have finished their operations, a legacy which continues to pollute our environment and our water. This directive goes a long way towards ensuring that this does not happen.</p>
<p class="contents">All extractive waste has to include inert waste. That is extremely important. In relation to historical waste, that is particularly important in countries like my own where mining activities are not as prolific as they have been in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">I support everything that the rapporteur has said. It is a very important report, and a very important position has been adopted by the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. I hope that the Commission can accept the rapporteur's amendments, which improve the Commission's proposal. It is also in line with many of the environmental groups around Europe who feel that this is crucial, as well as the rapporteur's recommendations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has done a good job over a relatively short period of time. This is a much-needed report and, for obvious reasons, the accidents in Romania and Spain, but also other incidents that have taken place around the Union over time, have demonstrated quite clearly that this kind of material poses a real danger to human health and to the environment if it is mismanaged. This proposal deals with those environmental industrial problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of us were somewhat surprised by the number of amendments initially tabled on the proposal, but in many ways that simply reflects the importance and the seriousness of the nature of this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, we in the UK have long been aware of the dangers of mining waste since the terrible disaster of Aberfan in 1966 and the terrible deaths that occurred there. Consequently, our national legislation has been particularly strict and strong with regard to mining waste.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there were parts of this new legislation that were new, innovative and worthy of adoption. There were some, though – particularly the extension of the scope to inert waste – which I felt were misguided. Nevertheless, I felt that the need for a registry of closed sites and previously occupied new sites was particularly important if we were really to establish the full extent of the problem across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In the end, we have a good result. I commend the proposal to the House. It will fit neatly alongside the complementary legislation – IPPC, Seveso, and landfill – and make a positive contribution to the protection of the environment, human health and sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This proposal does not contain a specific definition of waste from the extractive industries, but instead reproduces the general definition of waste from the Waste Framework Directive, 75/442/EEC. This does not prevent such waste being reused for a beneficial purpose, for instance in construction materials. It is important to make this clear.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to give the Commission’s reaction to important amendments. The Commission can accept Amendment No 32 fully, and Amendment No 26 in part or in principle. The amendments concerning the scope of the proposal are of course of particular importance. Amendment No 15 concerning Article 2.3 proposes that material such as unpolluted topsoil and waste from prospecting be covered by the limited requirements pursuant to this Article. The Commission can support this course of action, as it increases legal certainty and also improves environmental safeguards. We also support the amendment to the effect that disposal facilities for inert waste should also be covered by the provisions on serious accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 15 proposes that the limited requirements of Article 2.3 should include non-hazardous waste. That part of Amendment No 15 would have a significant impact on the overall effectiveness of the proposal, and the Commission cannot accept that. For different reasons, the Commission cannot support the amendments that introduce certain measures for exhausted mine voids that have been allowed to fill up with water. We think that this issue should be resolved under the Water Framework Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">It is necessary to manage the great burden from the past presented by closed and abandoned disposal facilities. The Commission has proposed an exchange of information on methods for charting and rehabilitating these facilities. Amendment No 71 would make this information obligatory at EU level. Drawing up inventories to identify the worst sources of pollution is a major step on the way to solving this problem. The Commission can support this strategy. Decisions on the rehabilitation itself should, however, rest with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue is the requirement for financial guarantees to cover the costs if operators can no longer be held responsible. The Commission can support the clarifications in Amendments Nos 66 and 67, but cannot accept the part of Amendment No 66 that stipulates that these procedures be approved by the Commission, as this falls within the Member States’ competence. Nor can we accept amendments concerning the form of these guarantees, as the text should retain its present flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">A transitional period has been granted for disposal facilities granted a permit before the entry into force of this Directive. Amendment No 74 contains an attempt to introduce certain requirements during that period, including by referring to the Water Framework Directive. The Commission thinks this unnecessary, as the provisions of EU water legislation and also the general requirements of the Waste Framework Directive apply. In addition, the rationale behind the transitional period should not be undermined.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 29 and 35 underline the need for appropriate management of the closure and after-closure of disposal facilities. A number of amendments also propose making reference to EU standards for evaluating environmentally friendly management. Amendments Nos 32 and 57 establish a direct link to the objectives of the Water Framework Directive, and Amendment No 46 establishes a direct link to<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>protected areas. Finally, Amendment No 7 also explains the role of this Directive in EU<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>development aid. The Commission supports these amendments, which have the same objectives as the Commission proposal and which increase consistency with other important EU legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am going to leave a complete list, giving the Commission’s opinions on the amendments, with the Secretariat<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, and I should like to express my thanks for this initial debate on this important proposal, which will raise the profile of both these problems and our proposed solutions. As many Members have said, action is needed, as these problems are much more common than we think, as are the recurrent accidents in Europe and around the world. The problem must be tackled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
