<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kyprianou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, it truly is an honour for me to stand for the first time before plenary, although I would be even happier were I here on a more pleasant subject. Unfortunately, I am appearing here for the first time so that we can debate and I can speak to you on a very important and worrying subject, by which I mean the continuing threat to our society from the scourge of HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">Today in particular, on 1 December, which has been designated 'World AIDS Day', I think it is important that we exchange views and a few thoughts as to how this scourge can be combated. Today has been designated 'World AIDS Day' in order to mark, on the one hand, the progress which has been made in combating this scourge. However, more specifically, it gives us the opportunity to focus on the challenges we face and to intensify our collective efforts and consider and ask ourselves if we are doing enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Over recent years, most of our attention has focused on the tragic situation in sub-Saharan Africa and in developing countries in general. However, HIV/AIDS is causing very deep and constantly increasing concern here in Europe and our neighbouring countries. It is something which affects us all, here and now.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject of this year's global campaign against AIDS was women, girls, HIV and AIDS. This was also the subject of the annual AIDS campaign coordinated by UNAIDS. This subject is exceptionally topical. Recent epidemiological data show that, over the last two years, the number of women affected by the HIV virus increased throughout the world. While the largest increase, in the order of 58%, was in the area of eastern Asia, it is worth noting that the second largest increase was in Eastern Europe and central Asia, where it reached 48%.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to give you some statistics which were published just last week and which are particularly worrying: approximately 40 million people throughout the world are carriers of the HIV virus and almost half of them are women. In the European Union, the number of cases of HIV increased by 75% between 1996 and 2003, with the largest increase in the Baltic States. In Europe, the country which has been hardest hit by the epidemic is the Russian Federation, where it is calculated that over 800 000 people are HIV positive, 80% of whom are young people under 30 years of age. According to UNAIDS estimates, over 500 000 people in the European Union are carriers of the virus. It is clear without any doubt from these statistics that the tragic problem of HIV/AIDS is spreading more and more quickly and now has not only arrived at our door, but has also entered our house.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission is addressing the matter both inside and outside the European Union. Together with the Member States, we are the biggest donor to the Global Fund which is the main financing mechanism for combating the epidemic throughout the world. Similarly, we are intensifying our cooperation with neighbouring countries, in full recognition of the fact that they are in a particularly difficult situation. In September, the European Commission issued a paper entitled ‘Co-ordinated and integrated approach to combat HIV/AIDS within the European Union and its neighbourhoods’. Τhis paper summarises the current evaluation of the situation and the problem. It also offers a compendium of best practices for combating the recent wave of the epidemic and highlights the Commission's short-term proposals for addressing the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's main commitments are to the prevention of new cases of contamination with HIV, the reduction of repercussions from the epidemic, access to antiretroviral treatment at more affordable prices, the inclusion of young people, the development of epidemiological monitoring of HIV/AIDS, more intensive research and the participation of civil society. However, I should also like to draw your attention to certain basic aspects of efforts to combat HIV/AIDS. Prevention is still the main weapon in the fight against the spread of the virus. We badly need an information campaign throughout Europe. It is important for us to bear in mind that the information campaigns of the 1980s did not address today's young people and, consequently, there is an acute need today to implement new efforts, so that we can send the message to precisely these people. Planning has already started and a conference is due to be held next week with the Member States, the international organisations and representatives of civil society on this subject. As the target of a general campaign will be the general public and young people, there is a clear need for other partners to plan and implement specialised campaigns targeted at vulnerable groups, in keeping always with the particular requirements of each group.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to stress that the impression that the transmission of HIV is limited to these vulnerable groups is totally unfounded. On the contrary, HIV/AIDS is a subject which concerns us all: women, men, girls and boys, and it is a subject which concerns us here and now. It is calculated that a large percentage of people with the HIV virus living in the European Union do not know they have it. As a result, the risk of the virus spreading is increasing and, naturally, these people cannot benefit from the treatment available. Generally speaking, access to antiretroviral treatment at affordable prices would appear to be fairly good within the European Union. Nonetheless, certain Member States have expressed their concern about the future: if, or rather when, the number of cases of HIV spirals and the cost of treatment remains high. This is one of the main issues being addressed by the European Commission and it has raised it – and continues to discuss it with the Member States and the pharmaceutical industry – in the aim of finding effective ways of overcoming these problems. However, we must not underestimate the economic consequences of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which are huge. The cost of antiretroviral treatment is just one aspect of these economic consequences. At macro-economic level, HIV/AIDS results in increased health care and social security costs. It causes a drop in manpower numbers and a fall in productivity, which increase labour costs. The cumulative result is an adverse impact on investments, production and per capita income. In brief, the HIV/AIDS epidemic represents a very serious threat to global health, development and security.</p>
<p class="contents">However, over and above the economic aspect, HIV/AIDS is also a problem with respect to human rights. The stigma and adverse discrimination are subjects which concern Europe, as much as any other part of the planet, and they cannot be overlooked. The psychological aspect of HIV/AIDS and the isolation which it causes must be addressed with the same decisiveness. If these aspects are disregarded, the effectiveness of the aforementioned efforts of prevention and medical care will be jeopardised. The subject of HIV/AIDS can no longer be a taboo subject. It is of the utmost importance that the subject be discussed openly and that the social stigma cease at long last. Only thus will it be addressed effectively. Open discussion is an integral part of the information campaign which, in turn, will contribute most towards prevention. All of us, especially the institutions of the European Union, the European Parliament, the European Commission and, above all, the Member States, need to recognise and accept the new worrying increase in the HIV/AIDS problem. Let us stop deluding ourselves, believing that it is under control or at least contained; on the contrary, we need to step up our efforts to combat it, to the extent required for them to be effective. I am optimistic that, together, we can achieve this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ten years ago, 183 people were registered as having HIV/AIDS there, today, in 2004, it is 68 000. That is the scale of this problem within our own continent. Across the world nearly 40 million people have HIV and, as the Commissioner said, we must take action to prevent and solve these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The focus this year has been very much on women and children. As the Commissioner said, women account for some 57% of those who are HIV positive in sub-Saharan Africa, and over 60% of those with HIV aged between 15 and 24. Finding vaccines appropriate to them before the onset of sexual activity is fundamental.</p>
<p class="contents">The figures are appalling for orphans too. There are 15 million orphans in the world, 12.3 million of them are in sub-Saharan Africa. There are 1.8 million already in Nigeria, and there will be 1.5 million in South Africa by 2010. And so it goes on.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to take action along the lines of our resolution; we have to take action on HIV/AIDS and on conditions, disorders and diseases such as tuberculosis, hepatitis C, mental illness and depression. We have to find more palliative care for those dying of AIDS, in particular in the developing countries. We have to protect our health workers from the dangers of AIDS from needlestick injuries – witness the exhibition in this Parliament today.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the Commissioner’s statement. I also welcome the work done in this field by Pavel Telicka during his time as a Commissioner. We urge Commissioner Kyprianou and his colleague Commissioner Michel to put shoulders to the wheel and to close the door on the epidemic faced by Europe and the rest of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should, above all, like to thank Human Aids for the fact that during this year’s World AIDS Day, it will be focusing on women and girls and HIV/AIDS. There are sound reasons for doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">The figures speak for themselves. AIDS is increasingly taking on a feminine face; the number of women infected with HIV/AIDS is rising at a terrifying rate. So who are those women? Are they women displaying serious risk behaviour, or are they women who have been sexually active with too many partners? Not at all. In most cases, they are ordinary, often young, women who are very vulnerable on account of their sex. They are often married, they are very often faithful to their partners and are mothers of children. It may be useful to inform the Vatican of the fact that 88% of the Ugandan girls and women who are HIV positive are married and have not had partners other than the man with whom they share their lives. These women are vulnerable on account of the social inequality and the lack of access to education and healthcare, as well as on account of the fact that they do not have their own incomes and are often incapable of negotiating about their own sexuality.</p>
<p class="contents">For those women, the ABC prevention method – Abstinence, Being faithful and Condoms<span class="italic"> </span>– is anything but sufficient. In order to combat AIDS effectively, we need more than simply ABC. We need the whole alphabet. To begin with, I should like to add the letter M for microbicides and the letter V for vaccines, because these open up promising prospects for women who may finally gain control over their own prevention methods. In my view, it is crucial for the European Union to invest more in research and development into those new products. I should also like to add the letter E for empowerment, because the fight against AIDS is simply impossible without reinforcing the rights of women and without combating violence against them.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I am therefore very much looking forward to the global action plan which the Commission will be presenting to us in the spring of 2005, because a global approach is indeed what we need. It is, of course, not enough that well-meaning Commissioners such as yourself or Commissioner Michel should be committed to the fight against AIDS. This issue must also be dealt with by the Commissioners for Equal Opportunities, External Trade, Justice and also naturally by the Commissioner for the Budget. I hope that the European Union will continue to take the lead in order to mobilise more financial resources for the fight against HIV/AIDS, but also to improve cooperation among the Member States on the basis of a coherent multiannual plan. I regret that the Dutch Presidency is not present here today, because I would like to pay tribute to the courage with which it has put this matter on the agenda. I also think that Europe should do more to increase the financial commitments. By 2008, we should be able to treble our financial commitments, in my view.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it appears to me essential that women be personally involved in drawing up a global plan of this kind – especially women and girls who live with HIV/AIDS, for they are not only its victims, but also vital partners in working out a sound policy. I therefore hope that the Commission will include them in its stakeholders’ platform for the compilation of this global plan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For several years, the number of new infections has again been increasing at an alarming rate. This rise also includes Europe, with particularly Eastern Europe affected, both the new Member States and Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of new infections involve young people aged between 15 and 25, and in particular women. A new carelessness has crept into their dealings with HIV and Aids. New medicines and therapies have improved the situation of HIV patients, so that the virus is losing its horror and thoughtlessness has become a way of life for many. Such thoughtlessness is lethal! The best protection against HIV is the use of condoms; this is a fact, and it should be supported and promoted by all sections of society. Abstinence is of course also a form of protection against Aids, but it should be left to individuals to decide whether they wish to practice abstinence or use condoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Moral appeals are of no use in stopping the spread of the virus. Instead, we need encouragement for each person to act responsibly, both for themselves and for others. It is the job of politicians to create the conditions that enable as many men and women as possible to make this decision freely for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important pillars of prevention are sex education without taboos and access to condoms, above all in schools and for young people. I am delighted that Commissioner Kyprianou placed particular emphasis on this.</p>
<p class="contents">In many African and Asian countries, Aids is depopulating entire regions, for example South Africa, where over half of the population is infected with the virus. This is no longer merely a disaster in human terms, but also in economic terms. I should like to appeal to the EU Member States’ sense of responsibility and the commitments they have already entered into. We welcome the fact that some Member States, for example the United Kingdom, Sweden and the Netherlands, have provided financial support for the international fund over and above what they committed themselves to. Unfortunately, some of the other Member States have either not met their commitments at all, or only in part. Aids is one of the twenty-first century’s global challenges. Above all, it is the task of the Western societies to put up a fight against this epidemic. We need discussions without taboos in Western societies on new methods of prevention, as especially African and Asian societies are dependent on help from outside, or, to put it another way, from us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Millions of people in the South suffer from HIV/AIDS and, weakened by HIV, they often fall victim to other diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. Millions of children with no parents wear themselves out cultivating the food they need. Many of them have no access to medicines, and almost none of them have medicines adapted for children.</p>
<p class="contents">Exemptions from the TRIPS agreement permit the export of generic medicines, but the EU countries have been slow in implementing such exemptions, a dilatoriness that leads to suffering and that, each day that passes, increases the suffering and the number of deaths.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, the Commission and the Council have the opportunity to show that this wait is to be brought to an end. Better access to medicines must, however, be combined with increased knowledge of HIV and increased provision of information about the disease, together with an ambitious aid policy and fair trade so that the countries concerned can afford economic development that increases trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">While 95% of HIV-positive people in the world already have no access to treatment today, the situation is bound to get even worse after 1 January 2005, when the derogation from Article 31 of the TRIPS agreement expires. India, with a billion inhabitants, and other developing countries will then no longer be able to produce the drugs. Even now, those who produce them cannot sell them to other developing countries or to African countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union therefore needs to go beyond all the talking and the statements of principle and make every effort above all to obtain a further derogation from the TRIPS agreement, pending a complete change to it. Not only that: the European Union must also oppose the US practice of holding developing countries to ransom in their bilateral agreements, with the aim of preventing them from exercising their right, laid down in the Doha declarations, to use or import generic drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Global Fund to Fight AIDS must be supported with an increase in the funds allocated to it. I propose that, on the part of the European Union at least, they should reach EUR 1 billion and that everyone, including Italy, should abide by the commitments that have been made. According to Fortune, the average salary of the top nine pharmaceutical company directors in the world is USD 42 million a year. At the same time, tens of millions of people die without being able to receive treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of such injustice, any kind of moralistic argument should be thrown out. We should remember that a condom is something very useful: a health aid that should be distributed absolutely free of charge. It is part of the toolkit needed to defeat the virus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that it will be followed by practical measures on your part that will help to alleviate the situation. Today’s AIDS Day calls on us to be aware of the kind of decisions that we have to take as politicians. AIDS is a disease that spreads regardless of borders and therefore today’s decision that health should be a matter for individual states is not a good one. AIDS cannot be seen, it cannot be noticed, it cannot be felt. It is a disease that crosses borders and pays no attention to customs officials. A disease that began amongst risk groups – among homosexuals and then haemophiliacs, then blood donors and drug addicts. Now we also see that a large number of women are infected. What was not said, however, is that 5 to 5.5 million of the 40 million are children and young people. These are alarming figures. It has been said today that it is transmitted through sex. I am talking about love. Perhaps this is why women so often become victims. On this occasion I would also like to mention some people who have not been mentioned today. These are the health workers, people who are ready and willing to risk their lives. They are volunteers. Are we aware, however, that these health workers are likely to be the first victims of the health reforms being prepared in the European Union? This is a poor way of thanking them for their work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU is the second largest donor to the global Aids fund, provided around 18% of the total funds. Yet we are faced with the fact that new infections are rising dramatically, both within the EU and in other countries. Commissioner Kyprianou said in a press release that many young people who are currently becoming infected were too young to understand the first Aids campaign. This is undoubtedly correct. Yet it is also necessary to remember that many young people are quite simply given false information, with, above all, Aids being depicted today as a treatable disease. The pharmaceutical industry is also doing its bit by presenting it as a conquered epidemic. The fact is, however, that even the anti-retroviral medicines which are available have major side effects, and that being able to lead a normal life is of course out of the question.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the high costs of therapy, which range from EUR 7 000 to 12 000 per annum, must also be taken into account, as they are a major burden on a country’s health budget. I should therefore like to call for research and development to be carried out into better and, above all, cheaper medication, possibly by means of generic medicines, so that these can be made available to wide sections of the population. Something I find particularly worrying is the lack of awareness of the problem among young people, who, when asked in interviews why they have such a lax attitude to the disease, reply, ‘which life should I protect myself for?’</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the plan drawn up by the Commission must also include this holistic approach, and, above all, combine education and possibly also giving meaning to life with the whole field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe spends too little of its development cooperation budget on basic health care, which should be linked to good nutrition, access to clean drinking water and basic education. Commissioner Michel has stated that he will make a new announcement in which Europe’s priorities in terms of development cooperation will be specified. Commissioner, I do hope that the words you spoke a moment ago will also find expression in this new announcement.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the UN, of the 45 million people at risk of infection, 27 million would, if we had a specific campaign, be preventable cases. We have a great deal of experience in campaigns of that kind globally. It does, however, require an enormous effort and we should therefore focus our minds in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been stated before that we here in Europe can encourage our Member States to say to the pharmaceutical industry that it can make cheaper products. To the developing countries, we could say that we will provide them with a waiver, as a result of which the TRIPS agreements will not prevent them from manufacturing within the cheap market.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Vatican spoke a few days ago through Javier Cardinal Lozano Barragán, President of the Pontifical Council for Health Pastoral Care, about immunity, moral deficit and pathology of the mind as causes of AIDS that have to be combated with correct sexual practices. I regard this as a discriminating and stigmatising remark and believe that Commissioner Kyprianou was right to say that we should not stigmatise AIDS patients in that way.

This is one more tragedy to add to other, equally serious human tragedies, such as the exploitation of adult and child prostitution, drug addiction, the lack of minimum standards of hygiene, the break-up of families and the growing numbers of little orphans, as well as infant mortality, which has reached appalling levels: throughout the world, 500 000 children die every year – which means 1 300 children a day – from AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why today it is important that the European Parliament should stand united, with no distinction on the basis of party or nationality, and send out a strong appeal to all the European Union Member States – starting with my country, Italy – not to throw away all the efforts that have been made so far and to continue to support the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us avoid adopting a reductionist view of the fight against AIDS and not forget that this virus is not only transmitted by sexual means but that there are many other reasons for its spread: infected syringes, breast-feeding and the lack of adequate medical checks.

Firstly, our attention should not solely be focused on the important question of medicine or some future vaccine. It should also be focused on restoring or setting up proximity-based health services, in other words those located as close as possible to communities. Those services have, unfortunately, been badly affected in recent years by structural adjustment plans undertaken in those countries, especially in Africa. We must also offer all our support to local initiatives launched by civil society and to networks, on the ground, of local representatives and authorities, associations, carers and mediators from the societies in question, who have been working together to combat AIDS, with some success.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the growing rate of infection among women is not simply down to their fragile nature or to bad luck. It is also the result of violence of all kinds – particularly sexual – against women in various regions of the world, and of the blatant discrimination to which they are subjected. Such violence has nothing to do with cultural characteristics, which is the erroneous explanation that is sometimes given. It must be referred to by name and combated as such. These two aspects show, therefore, that AIDS is as much a social problem as it is a medical problem. Let us not forget that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even then, there were prognoses that the spread of the epidemic could be as serious as the situation is today in parts of the world, especially in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Such prognoses were, however, dismissed at that time as mere prophesies of doom. As a result, the world closed its eyes for a long time – in fact, for too long – to the seriousness of the epidemic and did too little in terms of developing effective programmes of prevention, including contraceptive advice, of developing health care for the sick and of supporting research into more effective medicines and an effective vaccine.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, the world has finally woken up, but efforts at prevention are still insufficient. If we do not do more than we are doing at present to prevent the spread of the epidemic, it will, according to experts, not reach its biological culmination until 2060. I dare not think of what the consequences would be in terms of human suffering and economic and social crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us consider this resolution as a powerful exhortation to decision-makers the world over, and especially to the European Commission and to the governments of the Member States, to give still greater priority to continuing to combat this epidemic in the future. This will require us to set aside considerably more resources, both for our own HIV programme and for the global fund. If we do not do so, the consequences will be disastrous from humanitarian, economic and social points of view and also from the perspective of security and stability.</p>

By doing so, as well as acting in accordance with my personal political commitment to women, I am stressing the enormity of the problem in human terms, in terms of development and in terms of the future of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Half of the 40 million people infected with the virus are women and girls, and this proportion is increasing in almost every region, reaching 57% in Sub-Saharan Africa. With regard to the industrialised world, I will give just one example: Hispanic and African-American women make up a quarter of the women in the United States and account for 80% of AIDS cases.</p>
<p class="contents">The feminisation of AIDS is one further form, the ultimate form, of violence against women, and we have not provided them with the resources to defend themselves against the disease, the fundamental resources, such as sexual education, protection of reproductive health rights or information on measures to prevent infection. The social norms which keep young women and girls ignorant about sexuality and do not criminalise sexual violence inside and outside marriage increase the danger of the infection spreading.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group would like to congratulate the Commission on treating education as a priority in its political framework for combating diseases relating to poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like secondly, Mr President, to express a complaint. I would like to say that the Catholic hierarchy is guilty of negligence in the fight against AIDS. Today the Vatican is marking World AIDS Day by condemning the disease as a spiritual illness, which it calls ‘moral immunodeficiency syndrome’, which demonstrates the ethical and technical shortcomings of the Catholic Church. Via the Secretary of the Spanish Episcopal Conference – Spain being the European country in which the number of infections is increasing most – the Catholic Church intends to politically undermine the world campaign for combating AIDS by warning that contraceptives are unsafe and advocating chastity and fidelity as a method of prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">That statement would not warrant any further comment were it not for the fact that AIDS is killing millions of people, including children; if sexual violence, which leaves no chance of chastity, were not a daily reality in many African and Asian societies; if there were not 15 million orphaned children; if it were not an attack on the sexual and reproductive freedom of men; if it were not, therefore, an attack on human rights and a veritable genocide.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about life or death; we do not know whether the Episcopal Conference has understood this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that today’s debate makes it clear once again that our analyses are right, that the figures are dramatic and that there is support for the declarations of intent, but that the measures taken are insufficient, that there has been no about-turn in opinions, and that the situation is losing none of its drama.</p>
<p class="contents">I can do no other than underline everything that has been said. Aids is a disease of our times and a mirror of what has gone wrong in our society. Where Aids is concerned, we cannot merely tell people to live differently, to avoid doing certain things, and to be more responsible. It is clear that Aids is closely linked to poverty. Those affected by Aids are mostly those who live on less than one dollar a day and suffer from hunger. Aids today is a disease which affects above all the weak, children, young people and women. Aids is also an expression of a lack of prevention, education, sex education, employment and of inequality in the world. There is therefore no one solution and no one treatment. We must continue the prevention measures already taken, and it is therefore important that we regard Aids as forming part of our health and development policy, our education, family and employment policy and the overall view we take of our responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I call upon this House to not shirk this global responsibility and to ensure that we are number one in the world in the research against Aids. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important for us to give those affected our full support and for us to take extremely seriously our share of responsibility for public health.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time since HIV/AIDS was discovered, more women than men are now infected. In certain areas, young women are up to two and a half times more vulnerable to infection than young men of the same age. In certain countries, nearly 60% of the people infected are women. Many women and girls are especially vulnerable to infection because of other people’s – that is to say, men’s – behaviour in terms of risk and because of the discrimination widely practised in the world between men and women when it comes to views of sexuality and sexual rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The consequences of the HIV/AIDS epidemic are far greater for women and children than for men and boys. This year, the UN body, UNAIDS has therefore selected its theme, ‘Women, Girls, HIV and AIDS’. When relatives become sick or die, it is mainly women and girls who have to take care of their own families. When the health care systems are over-stretched or when they collapse as a result of HIV/AIDS, it is women and girls who have to compensate for the fact by providing increased care and attention in the home. Nor are women given the same access as men to health care and to medicines that retard the progress of the disease. Old, traditional views, such as the view that men have a right to sex, also mean that many married women cannot protect themselves against infection introduced by their husbands after they have been unfaithful.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore outrageous that, in today’s edition of the newspaper <span class="italic">El País</span>, the Vatican calls AIDS a moral disease of the immune system. I think that laying the blame on those who are ill is both inhumane and unchristian. Gender equality, together with sexual and reproductive health and rights, need to be common objectives for every country in the world and, above all, a responsibility for all men. Women must be strengthened in their negotiating position when it comes to condom use and, without exception, given increased rights and better conditions of life.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all losers now, but tests are now beginning in Sweden on a new medicine to combat HIV. If this works, it will create a sensation throughout the world. A preventive vaccine is no doubt what we all dream of, so let us hope for a positive result.</p>

I must say that it truly satisfies and heartens me to hear that the honourable Members not only share my acute concern on the subject of HIV/AIDS, but also my firm conviction that we need to make a full and effective contribution towards relieving the terrible hardship which is causing this epidemic, both in the rest of the world and in the European Union. We need in particular to understand the gravity of this problem today.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, however, to comment on certain issues raised by the honourable Members. First of all, I wish to emphasise and recapitulate that this is an issue which concerns us all. As the honourable Members have already mentioned, it is no longer an issue which only concerns vulnerable groups. On the contrary, it is something which concerns each and every one of us, witness the way in which it has now spread within families, affecting whole families and underage children, not only in the developing world but also within the European Union itself. I wish to assure you that the entire European Commission, all my colleagues and I are aware of this issue. We share the same concerns and we have set the same targets and I wish to assure you that there will be full coordination between me and all my colleagues in combating this problem, in drafting and implementing programmes in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the question of research is concerned, may I remind you that, for the vaccine in particular, research into an HIV vaccine is a priority under the sixth framework programme for research and development and we expect up to EUR 130 million to be earmarked for research into an HIV vaccine. As far as drugs are concerned, may I remind you that I absolutely agree that there must be access to cheap drugs for everyone who has a problem with this disease, especially of course for poor countries and poor sections of the population who cannot meet these high treatment costs. May I also remind you that recently – and this is also mentioned in your resolution – the Commission adopted a proposal for the mandatory licensing of drugs for export to countries in need. This point is currently at the codecision stage and I trust that, judging from other cases in the past on highly sensitive issues, a study will be expedited rapidly so that this proposal can be completed as quickly as possible, and that this proposal will provide the possibility of access precisely to cheap drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a huge need – and I repeat this – for the social stigma to be lifted. One of the serious problems which we face today with regard to the spread of this disease is that, because of this pressure, many people are suffering from or have been affected by the virus and not even they themselves know it. They do not undergo the necessary tests in fear of the stigma which there may be and, thus, they pass it on to their families. Special emphasis needs to be placed on enlightening people and on the fact that it must be understood that no social stigma should attach to a disease; on the contrary, it should be addressed in the same way as every other serious epidemic disease.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to assure you once again that the European Commission is truly dedicated to these efforts to combat this scourge. I welcome and I wish to express my thanks to Parliament, on behalf also of the European Commission, for the active interest which we see. We trust that we shall be close and effective allies in this fight, so that this problem really is addressed efficiently. There is no room for complacency; we need to continue with the same intense effort, to show the same zeal in preventing and stopping the spread of this illness. At the same time, however, we need to contribute towards the relief of those who are already affected and to their treatment. I await and look forward with interest to a future constructive dialogue between the Commission and Parliament so that we can achieve our joint objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the strategy for this fight proposed in the joint motion for a resolution, a strategy based on the promotion of ‘reproductive and sexual rights’, excludes millions of people in Europe and the world. The reason for this is that millions of people throughout the world do not believe that any benefit can result from the promotion of abortion and contraception and from the provision of sex education to ever-younger children in violation of the rights of parents and without their knowledge or consent.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people in Europe are morally opposed to such things, and justifiably so. Furthermore, there is no proven link between the promotion of such ‘reproductive rights’ and a fall in the number of those infected with Aids. Quite the contrary is the case. Some African countries, such as Uganda, have significantly reduced the number of infections, not by promoting the use of condoms, but by encouraging a move towards abstinence and more responsible sexual behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">Such brazen promotion of ‘reproductive rights’ makes it impossible for me to vote in favour of this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
