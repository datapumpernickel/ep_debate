In the sad days following the loss of the first democratic Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, it is especially important for all those who have been rooting for democracy in Russia and for whom a democratic Russia ought to be an important partner for Europe, to now acknowledge that the Russia of today has not fulfilled all the dreams which we shared when Boris Yeltsin appeared on the political stage in that country. Unfortunately, these hopes have remained unfulfilled. We have to acknowledge this fact and that is what our resolution expresses. I would like to once again point out that I am pleased that the resolution is the result of a compromise between many, diverse political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that, for me, the images shown on television of how the demonstrations held by human rights campaigners in Russia were repressed, were indeed traumatic, as they also reminded me of the worst times in my country when street protests were brutally crushed by the police. I would like to point out that, surprisingly, the Russian Human Rights Ombudsman shares this assessment of the brutality of the Russian police. That is why our declaration contains an appeal to the Russian Duma and to our colleagues, namely Russian Members of Parliament, to set up a special committee to deal with this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In appealing to you, Members of this House, to adopt this resolution, I would like to also appeal to the Russian citizens, who sadly currently do not have access to real information, to be aware that our actions are not a sign of Russophobia, as the Kremlin's propaganda often claims. In fact, quite the opposite is the case. Our actions, our struggle to defend human rights in Russia, to bring democracy back to Russia stem from our deep feelings of friendship towards this country and our deep respect for great Russian literature and for Russia as a great nation. We want that nation to enjoy the same freedoms that we enjoy in the European Union and I would like the European Parliament to be an institution that is like a beacon of light for Russians, illuminating the path to democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have observed the massive human rights violations in Moscow and St. Petersburg with dismay, where peaceful demonstrations against the authoritarian bias of the system were suppressed by violent intervention by the police, with attacks made against passers-by who were not involved and western journalists.</p>
<p class="contents">The intimidation and suppression of the freedom of speech, the freedom of assembly and the freedom of the press in Russia has become systematic. We are familiar with this type of disinformation and lies from the war in Chechnya. Many media are under government control or operate self-censorship. Independent journalists such as Anna Politkovskaya were murdered. With 13 journalist murders during Putin’s time in office alone, Russia occupies third place after Iraq and Algeria – an alarming result.</p>
<p class="contents">The political opposition cannot find any mouthpiece. The freedom of the press and freedom of speech are under immense threat. Potential political opponents of Putin, such as Chodorkovsky and Lebedev are sitting in prison without a fair trial and Gary Kasparov was arrested repeatedly. Non-governmental organisations are harassed by means of laws which curtail the rights of civil society. The Russian leadership is not only using its courts but the entire security apparatus as well in the meantime in order to intimidate political opponents. The powers that be in the Kremlin are hitting out. As a result, progress towards the rule of law and an independent justice system are also under threat. It is a perfidious strategy to brand people who are calling for genuine democracy in the country as extremists so as to take away their credibility. Putin is not a flawless democrat. He comes from the KGB and his origins leave their mark.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia is a member of the Council of Europe, the OSCE and the United Nations, yet it violates basic fundamental and human rights. The EU is negotiating a new partnership agreement. This agreement must contain a section on human rights which is also a constituent part of all agreements and treaties. We are showing our solidarity with our friends in Russia who are fighting for a peaceful and democratic future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Russian Government committed itself to guaranteeing these freedoms as a condition for being admitted to the Council of Europe in 1996. Today, 11 years later, the majority of people in Russia feel insecure and have no trust in law and justice. Sixty-five per cent claim to be unhappy, and more than half disapprove of the Government, which is already heading beyond mere authoritarianism, as one opposition leader put it.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect the Russian Government to react to this resolution, which is a unanimous expression of serious but friendly concern. We also expect the European Council and Commission to make it absolutely clear at the forthcoming EU-Russia Summit that restoration of these basic freedoms will be a crucial test of Russia’s ability and willingness to be a credible international partner.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, Russia has become essentially an authoritarian state. EU leaders will share responsibility for the further worsening of the situation there if they are not willing or able to face these new realities with determination and clarity. Speaking with one voice, on the basis of European values, is the only way to help Russia back to the road of democracy. It is vital that Russian citizens should enjoy the same freedoms – including freedom from fear and police violence – that we have been enjoying. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I remember that the German radical student leader Rudi Dutschke, who has been dead for a long time now and was nick-named the <span class="italic">Bürgerschreck,</span> warned the Left in Western Europe against this position. In his view, what happened in Russia at the time was completely unrelated to Socialism or Communism, but very much related to what he referred to as an ‘Asian’ tradition. This is a tradition in which a small group, using the toughest measures, manages to remain in charge in a large and sparsely populated country.</p>
<p class="contents">Every time someone in Russia is put in power who wishes to resolve this unsatisfactory situation, there has, to date, been every chance that his successor would have resorted to the old abuses. Khrushchev in the 50s and 60s, and Gorbachev in the 80s and 90s failed to change Russia from the top down.</p>
<p class="contents">The current President, Putin, like the tsars and Stalin previously, seamlessly fits into this old Russian mould. He managed to gain power when his chaotic predecessor, Yeltsin, was no longer able to run the country, and, having gained popularity among the Russians by destroying Chechnya, is now in the process of taking away their democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunate is the country that owns oil or natural gas, because the possession of them, and of the wealth that exports bring in, puts the leaders in a stronger position of power and makes domestic change virtually impossible. Moreover, the criticism levelled by most of the outside world that wants to buy energy will quickly subside. Russia now finds itself in the same position as Saudi Arabia or Iran. Even in the two largest cities, which, so far, offered the most scope for criticism and diversity, demonstrations by opponents are made impossible. The European countries and their residents should not accept this lying down, but should act in solidarity with those who want to turn Russia into a decent democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I understand and comprehend the European Union's 'Realpolitik' vis-à-vis Russia; at the same time, however, we also need to defend the basic principles of our collective European democratic civilisation. From this point of view, I consider it necessary for the question of human rights to be placed high on the European Union's agenda and within the framework of reinforced political dialogue with Russia and its political leadership. A first opportunity will be the summit on 17 May and the meeting with President Putin.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should like to comment on something else. It would be a serious political mistake for the European Union to equate human rights in Russia and the situation that prevails there with just certain circles which are openly funded by specific Russian political refugees within the known clique of oligarchs. The recent statements by Mr Berezovsky in London are typical of the intentions of certain circles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Attempts to bring democracy to Russia are being suppressed, as are demonstrations and freedom of speech. However, we must be aware of the fact that Russia does not have a tradition of democracy and that those, such as Alexander I, who wanted to bring democracy to Russia in the past, have had to give up or have been widely criticised, as was the case with Boris Yeltsin, as he passed away. We have to be aware of the fact that, according to surveys, more Russians want order than democracy. This is why, when we support everything that is positive in Russia and which brings hope, we have to be aware that, in dealing with the Russian Government, we are drawing up agreements with a government which has a different set of values to Europe. Russia does not have, and has no experience of democracy at home. Neither does it have any experience of normal, civilised behaviour in terms of external relations. This should serve as a warning to all those who want to build a future for Europe on the hope that Russia will show solidarity and be a good partner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We all watched the events of 14 and 15 April in Moscow and St. Petersburg with a great deal of anxiety. Quite a few of us wonder whether, in view of these developments, the freedom of assembly in Russia is in jeopardy. The Russian Constitution guarantees Russian citizens the right to assemble peacefully, without bearing arms, in order to hold rallies and demonstrations, parades and pickets.</p>
<p class="contents">This is obviously contrary to the manner in which the Russian authorities acted recently against demonstrators in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod. Gary Kasparov reported these actions to me in a personal telephone call. It also needs to be borne in mind that the demonstrations of 14 and 15 April differed from previous marches in that the militia acted in a more hard-line manner and that, on this occasion, accredited journalists were detained temporarily as well as attacked.</p>
<p class="contents">The reporting carried out by several newspapers after the incidents was thoroughly critical. <span class="italic">Kommersant</span> talked about ‘Making mincemeat of those who disagreed’ and <span class="italic">Moskovskiy Komsomolets</span> about ‘All power to OMON’, while <span class="italic">Novaya Izvestiya</span> talked about ‘A besieged fortress and unprecedented toughness’.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there were also reports in which events were played down. A similar picture could be seen in the reaction of the Russian Government. While some government offices defended the action, the spokesperson on human rights, for example, Mr Lukin, conceded that the police had substantially exceeded their authority. The Governor of St. Petersburg, Mr Matvienko, ordered all complaints regarding attacks by Russian police units to be investigated. Sergei Yastrzhembsky, adviser to the Russian President on EU issues, made the same demand, while Ella Pamfilova, Chair of the commission, pointed out that the actions of the militia had damaged Russia’s standing worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">The Federal German Government also reacted to these events and, on 16 April, publicly expressed its anxiety in a statement given by the EU Council Presidency. In addition, Germany’s Deputy Government spokesperson, Mr Thomas Steg, declared in Berlin on 16 April that the excessive use of force at the weekend was cause for concern. The action taken against journalists was also unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The Federal German Government is awaiting a full account of events from the Russian authorities. Following the incidents in Moscow and St. Petersburg, the German embassy in Moscow immediately lodged a complaint at a high level and requested an immediate and full explanation. We will naturally also speak to the Russian authorities with a certain degree of vigour concerning the situation regarding the freedom of speech and the freedom of assembly at the forthcoming human rights consultations between the EU and Russia which are scheduled for 3 May.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of the human rights situation in Russia must continue to be followed very attentively. This especially applies to the freedom of speech and assembly and free and fair access to the media. As a member of the United Nations, including its role as a member of the new Human Rights Council, the Council of Europe and the OSCE, Russia is obligated to respect fundamental rights. Respect for these fundamental rights is also of the utmost importance in view of the forthcoming elections in Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">We will make it clear to Russia that it is in the country’s own interests to do everything possible to ensure that the freedom of speech and the freedom of assembly are strengthened and not weakened further.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that a substantial part of the values and human rights on which Europe is founded have been established by Russian intellectuals and artists. We should remind ourselves of this fact and ensure that we continue to tread along this path and not a different one.</p>

<p class="contents">Freedom of expression and freedom of assembly – including the holding of demonstrations – are fundamental human rights. They are the cornerstones of pluralistic democracy. Russia has committed itself to respecting those freedoms through its membership of the UN, the OSCE and the Council of Europe. In the period leading up to the Russian parliamentary and presidential elections, that respect is all the more crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU raised the above-mentioned concerns in a Presidency statement on 16 April. We note that the Deputy Presidential Spokesman publicly stated that some over-reaction by riot police had taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to follow developments in the pre-election period in Russia closely. We will also continue to raise these issues in our bilateral talks with the Russian authorities, for example in the forthcoming regular EU-Russia Human Rights Consultations on 2 and 3 May. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
