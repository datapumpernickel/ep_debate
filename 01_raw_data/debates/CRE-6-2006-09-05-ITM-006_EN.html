I have to tell you that I was very happy to fulfil the request of my fellow Commissioner, Mr Frattini, to replace him, at least at the beginning of the debate, because this is a very important subject and one which is close to my heart.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to tell you that the Commission is firmly committed to the Daphne programme, which sets out to prevent and combat all forms of violence against women, children and young people. We know that Parliament also values it very highly. Daphne will be ten years old, but what the Commission is proposing is already the third version of the programme. During that period its success has been widely acknowledged. It has served to finance a great many projects which have helped to achieve progress in the fight against violence.</p>
<p class="contents">The attachment to Daphne felt by Parliament and many sections of civil society is reflected in their suggestion that the Commission should stop presenting Daphne measures and action to prevent drug abuse under the same programme heading. As you know, the Commission has taken Parliament’s wishes on board and on 24 May it put forward two separate programme proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Although Daphne II runs to the end of 2008, it is essential that Daphne III be adopted by the end of the year so that the new forms of action provided for by the proposal for a decision, as well as the budget appropriations, which are much higher than in the past, can be used right from the beginning of next year.</p>

Getting it to withdraw this proposal took a determined campaign, with joint statements by the Committee for Women's Rights and Gender Equality and women’s organisations, and I really am relieved that they have avoided the issues of drugs and violence being confused and enabled us to press on with what is one of the EU’s most successful programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">To date, however, it has been possible to use Daphne I and II to fund only some 17% of the good proposals that have been submitted, which is a demonstration of how enormous demand is, and it is for that reason that the Committee for Women's Rights and Gender Equality is calling for additional resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Today sees us sending out two very clear messages. The first is that Europe will attach greater weight to the campaign against violence and refrain from conflating it with other aspects. The second is that we acknowledge and support the valuable work done on the ground by organisations such as women’s organisations, numerous self-help and human rights organisations, youth associations and their networks.</p>
<p class="contents">Violence is on the increase in daily life, particularly those aspects of it that cross borders, and it is this that the Daphne programme addresses first, having come into being in response to it. The women’s movement made a priority of such matters as domestic violence, child abuse, and the trafficking of women for their sexual exploitation, and we have been able to develop many good projects to deal with these things, while also raising public awareness of them – and not just since the World Cup.</p>
<p class="contents">Daphne I and Daphne II have yielded valuable knowledge, one result of which has been that all the projects have been summarised in a user-friendly ‘tool kit’, which it has now been possible to pass on to the various professional organisations; studies have also been made available to a wide professional public, along with contacts far beyond Europe’s borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, though, we have new tasks to which to address ourselves. Daphne III makes cross-border ‘networking’ much more important. New things are happening in the migration field, and there is much important work to be done on the people-trafficking front. We have proposed financial support for a network of ombudspersons for children, and a single number for children's emergency telephones throughout Europe. We also want to reinforce the networks of organisations dealing with violence on the Internet. The various activities make up a long list, and so it is not unreasonable to do as the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left has done and demand EUR 120 or 125 million for them, and I hope that this House will help to meet the need that this demand reflects.</p>
<p class="contents">This House, during the last stage of Daphne, managed to secure the establishment of a helpdesk, and we have had a very positive experience of this. It has helped organisations to establish contact with one another across borders and to find the right people to talk to. When considering the establishment of a ‘think tank’, we should also have recourse to the immense reserve of knowledge to be found in the organisations, drawing on this knowledge and deepening it.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not, however, wish too great a burden to be placed on Daphne, and so I would ask you to be careful with Amendment 56. It is intended that it should clearly define Daphne’s main target group as being children, women, and young people, and should make clear that such categories as social workers, frontier personnel, and the police are not included. My message to you is that there must be no doubt about the fact that Daphne is mainly targeted at women, children and young people, although the others can be involved, as is made clear in Amendment 57 and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">We continue to demand a European Year against violence against women; it is something that has been being called for for a long time, not least in Daphne I and II, and we are being persistent and consistent in continuing to do so. I will take this opportunity to ask that all forms of violence, without equivocation or exception, be targeted. This is something that the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality has worked through with the Commission, and I hope that we will be able to come to a final agreement on it with the Finnish Presidency of the Council by the end of the year, as we are indeed willing and ready to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also thank the Commissioner for his support and his words this morning. I am convinced that important results can be achieved when everyone collaborates, and they have been achieved in this case. Above all, the continuity of the Daphne programme has been guaranteed; this is an important, valuable programme for preventing and fighting violence towards women and children, which has already in the past obtained significant and to some extent unexpected results. In addition, the programme has been guaranteed an <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> budget line that is rightly separate, as the rapporteur also said, from the drugs prevention programme.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth mentioning that, out of all the possible aims of Daphne, a number of important priorities have also been set, including the fight against domestic violence – worryingly, a problem that is constantly on the increase – and the scourge of genital mutilation. Another important point has been to specify that the term ‘child’ or ‘young person’ covers the age range from newborn to 18 years, although the measures may of course target young people up to the age of 25.</p>
<p class="contents">There has also been a concern to specify that violence prevention should be aimed not only at young people, women and groups at risk, but also at newborn babies: cases in which babies are mistreated or actually abandoned are growing exponentially and are often associated with situations of psychological and social deprivation. Such occurrences could be prevented by providing mothers and families in extreme difficulties with assistance and support.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, these are ambitious aims for which, unfortunately, there is inadequate financial provision. In conclusion, I hope that Daphne may be allocated greater resources than at present in the mid-term budget review; we are counting on your efforts as well, Commissioner, to achieve that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rapporteur, Mrs Gröner, the chairman of the committee, Mrs Záborská, and all the members determined with sensitivity and almost unanimously the target of protection from violence, namely the most vulnerable groups of our fellow Members. However, this does not mean that every category of persons wronged and subject to violence will not be protected without discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why our group, the Group of the European People's Party (European Democrats) and Christian Democrats, does not agree with the amendments which contain lists of instances and categories of victims. The majority of the committee's amendments develop the conclusions of the evaluation of the two generally successful previous programmes, namely Daphne Ι and ΙΙ.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that funding of Daphne ΙΙΙ is, in our opinion, satisfactory within the framework of the agreement on the financial perspective, we must expect the results of actions to be spectacular and to eradicate violence from civilised European society, not only by 50%, as the rapporteur proposes, but if possible in its entirety, with systematic work and cooperation on the part of the authorities, local agencies, organisations and civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">The overall action is expected to be based on three principles: prevention with constantly updated information, addressing the root of the evil, remedy/care for victims and reintegration/rehabilitation of perpetrators.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, however, to observe that the success of the programme also depends on avoiding breaking the issue down into too many focal points and avoiding getting involved in the field of criminality in general. That is why the European People's Party did not vote for Amendment 69.</p>
<p class="contents">The positive results are also expected through transparency in connection with the involvement of non-governmental organisations, which must take valued action and guarantee their positive contribution to healing the wounds of violence. These agencies are the European Federation for Missing Children, which includes 19 organisations, and the European Children's Network, which is valued in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that the success of the new programme will safeguard the viability of the programmes once their funding ends and that we shall thus be able to ...</p>

As we all know, if this programme is not applied as broadly as proposed in Mrs Gröner's report, we shall not be able to limit either superficially or materially the phenomenon of violence that is present at all social levels, violence which is spreading its social fabric and constantly extending to the large social groups now facing it and that is why I think that the European Union should step up its efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to stress that the Commission was right not to merge the Daphne ΙΙΙ programme with the drugs programme, a position that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and Mrs Gröner have firmly stood by.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should also like to point out that, on reading the 2007 budget, we were surprised by the Council's position, which reduced Community resources for Daphne ΙΙΙ, compared with the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are not to be hypocrites towards the victims of the violence spreading to immigrants and refugees, children and infants, we should invigorate and strengthen the budget for Daphne ΙΙΙ, because this policy of cutbacks runs completely counter to commitments to further strengthen and upgrade the programme and guarantee the efficacy of its actions.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for a policy of combating violence against women, children and young people to be effective and to constitute a priority for the ΕU, it must be accompanied, over and above the suitable planning and organisation of actions, by adequate resources to implement them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His intention was to rape her, but he failed. The moment Apollo touched her, Daphne was transformed into a laurel tree and she was saved from being raped.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Parliament, the name Daphne stands for an important initiative. Ten years ago, in the late summer of 1996, Europe exploded with the knowledge of what came to be known as the Dutroux affair. The discovery of the bodies of a number of missing girls in a town in Belgium raised serious questions about what we do to protect women and children from those who abuse or exploit them for profit.</p>
<p class="contents">In April 1997, a large number of representatives from NGOs, the European Parliament, the European Commission, law enforcement agencies and other experts, gathered in Brussels for a hearing on these subjects. Maybe the most important result of that hearing was a commitment from the Commission to launch the Daphne initiative. What it amounts to is to put force behind the words; to give the campaign against violence a substantial budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea behind it was simple enough: to provide financial support for projects which would bring together NGOs from at least two Member States to cooperate in research, data collection and analysis, good practice identification and sharing, training exchange and networking, awareness-raising and information campaigns, but also direct action to support victims of violence and produce guidelines and protocols. It seems simple enough, and who could possibly be against it? But, as we all know, our society is characterised by a systematic devaluation of the things women say, do and decide. That gender power structure affects everything and is at its most visible in the phenomenon of men’s violence against women. Because of that, the Daphne initiative has been under constant threat ever since it started. It should be obvious that we should not mix the fight against violence with the fight against drugs; they are simply two different areas.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the Commission that runs the Daphne project, but in this House it is Lissy Gröner who should receive praise and support when we discuss the ‘reborn’ Daphne initiative. She is one of the pioneers. Of course, there is still a long way to go before we reach the necessary zero tolerance towards violence against women and children. The long-term importance of the Daphne initiative is the way it can affect grassroots organisations, deeply embedded in all Member States of the Union. Zero tolerance is the goal and Daphne is one of the means of achieving it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I see the prevention of Daphne and the anti-drug campaign being merged together as a tremendous success for women throughout Europe. In bringing this about, this House has sent out a signal and re-emphasised the need for the programme to combat violence against women, children and young people to remain independent.</p>
<p class="contents">Daphne is a small, but very successful, programme, which has already enabled important progress to be made in combating violence against women. Violence against women is not a private matter, but rather an issue of internal security. The most dangerous place for women is the home in which they live. ‘Family’ and ‘home’ may epitomise peace and security for many, but for millions of women, it is within the family and at home that they suffer, are abused, are tortured and even killed.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights are an entitlement for all human beings of whatever gender, and neither culture nor tradition can excuse the violation of women’s fundamental rights. It follows that violence against women is not just a women’s issue; it also affects men, who need to face up to their responsibilities and take action to deal with, and put a stop to, violence against women, not only in war zones but also in the bedroom.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking Daphne further cannot be the only thing we do to combat violence against women. We would like to see the Commission produce a free-standing directive and thereby demonstrating that it attaches the highest political priority to the campaign against violence. A proposal along these lines has been overdue for many years. It is positively scandalous that the Commission should shut its eyes to the demand for one and should disregard the need for European legislation to be harmonised. It really is quite essential that a free-standing directive be put in place, and, while I am on that subject, let me say that I would like to hear the Commission say something today about something concerning which we, in this House, have passed numerous resolutions, whether on International Women’s Day or on other occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">We also hope that the Commission and the Council will be able to wrap up negotiations on Daphne as soon as possible, so that the programme can be refinanced in good time for 2007. It is important to us, too, particularly at a time like this, when the women’s rights campaigner Seyran Ateş has been forced by vicious threats to give up her lawyer’s practice in Germany, that we should put the spotlight on the violations of migrant women's human rights, and affirm that there will be, for them, ‘zero tolerance’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality for their committed approach when it comes to the fight against violence against women.</p>
<p class="contents">Those women and children who are subject to violence need the Daphne III programme. Violence against women by men occurs in all social groups. One cannot merely single out particular groups or particular factors such as drug and alcohol abuse – there is violence against women and children across the whole of society. Despite the fact that study after study confirms that violence occurs in all social groups, many people still refuse to see the truth, which is that violence occurs right across the spectrum. Myths about the involvement of alcohol or drugs continue to flourish. If we are to fight violence against women, we have to banish these myths that it is ‘them’ or ‘others’ or ‘addicts’ that abuse women and children. It is just as likely to be our own neighbour, workmate or relative who perpetrates such acts of violence. </p>
<p class="contents">This is one of the reasons why the Daphne programme must be split into two separate programmes – one programme especially for the prevention of, and fight against, violence against women and children and another for the prevention of narcotics abuse and for providing information in that regard. Having a joint programme for these two different social problems would be to perpetuate the myths that there is a connection between drug and alcohol abuse and violence against women by men. This then leads to the belief that if we solve the drug and alcohol problems we also solve the violence problem, but this is not the case. These are both social problems that need to be solved, but they require different measures if they are to be so. I am therefore pleased to see that the Commission has accepted division into separate programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left gives its full support to this report. We believe that it is particularly important that the programme also tackles the trafficking of women and children for sexual purposes. This is important because we must do everything we can to fight this modern slave trade. It is also important in order to highlight the fact that this slave trade is another example of the violence to which women and children are subjected. </p>
<p class="contents">There are two terms in the report that I would like to see changed. The first of these terms is ‘domestic violence’, which I believe we should call ‘violence against women by men’, since that is exactly what it is. Violence against women does not only occur within the four walls of a domestic household. Women who live in abusive relationships live with this physical and psychological torture 24 hours a day. The other term I would question is ‘private life’. There is no reason to make a distinction between public and private life. The perpetration of violence against women is a criminal act, whether in public or in private. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This would be a positive step if the intention were to carry out a genuine investigation into the problem of drug addiction and violence, as well as their prevention, instead of a self-centered perception of the problem and the failure to perceive the real causes for these social ills.</p>
<p class="contents">Violence is a serious problem and, as with other disorders, the most effective means of combating it is to eliminate the causes and risk factors. These include neurobiological indicators as well as traits such as selfishness, hostility, impulsiveness, irritability, anhedonia, low intelligence, poor responsiveness of the brain to stimuli, as well as a lack of respect for values and antisocial behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to be aware that the growing plague of aggression, mental disorders, underdeveloped personalities and addictions is a result not only of a hedonistic lifestyle but also stems from the dominance of a materialistic world view which does not appreciate the role of spiritual development in the individual. The vast amount of knowledge gathered to date correlates poorly with the primary environmental factors influencing the development of a well-balanced personality. One of these factors is a healthy and loving family, preferably a complete one with many children, where the children are wanted, loved and learn to live together with, and for, others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the EU, one in five women suffers what is referred to as domestic abuse, that is, violence perpetrated by her husband or partner. Let us not forget, however, that these figures only take account of reported violence. Indeed, fear, shame and the limited access to public services explain all too often why some violence goes unreported. What is more, some types of violence are not counted because they do not fit in with established definitions and are not considered as crimes because they are seen as taboo subjects.</p>
<p class="contents">The Daphne Programme to fight against violence against women proposed by Parliament and the Council more than six years ago covers all forms of abuse, other than domestic violence, suffered by women around the world. In this regard, the emphasis should be placed on the fact that the large majority of such abuse is related to particular cultures and societies, in particular Islam and countries where Islamic law is in force, and in which stoning, genital mutilation, immolation and forced marriage are part of the culture, the religion and the customs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Daphne Programme should channel its efforts into the fight for the woman’s right to information, protection and punishment for the perpetrators of the abuse, and should help to change certain mentalities and barbaric customs that sadly still exist in many countries governed by Islamic law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been a genuine success on the part of the rapporteur to achieve this separation; it has increased the strength and visibility of the Daphne programme, which is an essential instrument for supporting women’s organisations combating gender violence.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as the budgetary increase already mentioned, I would like to stress certain important contributions made by Mrs Gröner’s report: firstly, the specific inclusion of people trafficking and forced prostitution as forms of violence, and the absolutely clear reference to genital mutilation and honour crimes as forms of gender violence that have a serious impact on health. Under no circumstances can violence against women be justified on the grounds of tradition or cultural practice, and I also believe that it is very important that children who see their mothers being abused should be included as victims of gender violence.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also very appropriate that the report asks that the programme pay particular attention to certain groups of women, such as refugees, emigrants, women living in poverty, disabled women and elderly women, as groups exposed to a greater risk of violence. It is also very important that the report proposes including the definition of the legal basis for combating violence against women amongst the sections providing European added value. At the same time, concrete objectives must be set, such as reducing the number of victims of violence and people trafficking by half over the next ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the European Year against violence against women can undoubtedly help to promote awareness raising and the sharing of good practices, and it is therefore very important that this Year should also be supported within this Daphne programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This should help to ensure that both programmes are more focused and that each gets the level of visibility and funding it deserves.</p>
<p class="contents">The Daphne programme has been an important instrument in helping to raise awareness of and to combat violence against women, children and young people. In Ireland, as elsewhere, violence against women is a very significant problem, with statistics from different reports indicating that one in four women have experienced some form of sexual violence in their lifetime. Funding from Daphne has had a positive impact on the work of many Irish women’s groups. However, unfortunately, national funding for frontline services to assist women and children is still not adequate, with insufficient shelter accommodation for those at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention some of the proposed amendments and my particular support for them. I am pleased to see that in Amendment 14, along with other vulnerable groups, women with disabilities were specifically mentioned as being particularly vulnerable to violence. It is therefore crucial to ensure that measures are put in place to protect those suffering multiple discriminations.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 14 also mentions women living in poverty in rural or remote communities. Outreach services need to be put in place so that these women and children can access the necessary services and be protected from violence.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased to see references in this report to trafficking and enforced prostitution, to children who witness violence, and to action specifically designed to prevent newborn children from being abused.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the final analysis, whether you are new born or elderly, citizen or migrant, rural or urban, nobody should be at risk of violence. Indeed, the fight against violence should be placed within the context of the protection of fundamental rights as guaranteed by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to give my full support to the promotion of the European Year Against Violence Against Women: awareness-raising is crucial. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, so far this year 51 people have been killed as a result of this scourge, of this kind of violence. We cannot therefore feel satisfied, naturally.</p>
<p class="contents">The law was necessary, and that is what we said, but, as we can see, unfortunately a law is not enough. The essence of this kind of violence is deeply rooted in people’s mindsets and in the cultures that suffer from those mindsets, and one year, or one piece of paper, will not be enough to change that.</p>
<p class="contents">Daphne, the objective of which is to combat violence of all kinds, is therefore a fundamental instrument, and we cannot and must not give up on it. Many forms of violence against women need to be combated: people trafficking, physical and psychological abuse, practices such as clitoral circumcision or the feminisation of poverty, and many others. All of them require urgent action and resources. They will never be sufficient, however, regardless of how many of them there are or appear to be.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore once again call upon the governments to emerge from their European lethargy and to understand that it is not possible to do more things with less money and that, with regard to violence in general and male violence against women in particular, we cannot demand great actions unless we also provide the means and resources needed to carry them out.</p>
<p class="contents">To provide Daphne with resources and with political importance is not a purely bureaucratic process. Let us not forget that its ultimate objective is to save lives. Though, like the Spanish law against gender violence, it is not sufficient, it is nevertheless essential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Daphne Programme can help prevent and combat violence against children, young people and women and protect the victims, an area that must be strengthened. In so doing, continuity will be provided for previous Daphne programmes and the scope of those programmes extended.</p>
<p class="contents">Violence against women, and the suffering, and in many cases the death, that it leads to, cannot be tolerated any more. This is a fight that requires constant effort and action, and must not be confused with other actions. For women’s rights to be resolutely defended, the Daphne III programme must, as suggested in the proposal before us, remain separate, and increased funding is required if we are to counter physical, sexual and psychological violence more effectively, including the violence associated with the trafficking of human beings for the purposes of sexual exploitation, and domestic violence, and threats of such acts, of which women, young people and children are the main victims.</p>
<p class="contents">Preventative action must be taken in the form of awareness-raising campaigns, for example the European Year against violence against women. Moreover, action must be taken in support of the victims. In order to establish clear, credible targets for effectively reducing violence, public policy needs to be more proactive and greater financial support is required for the organisations involved in this fight. Hence the reinforcement that we have proposed and that we hope will be adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am mainly referring to the removal of all drugs-related topics. Drug use and violence have, despite a certain overlap, been kept apart, with good reason. The emphasis on the fight against human trafficking within this programme is, in my view, the other main gain. I would, however, like to take this opportunity to underline the importance of real action.</p>
<p class="contents">The efforts many have made to take action against forced prostitution and human trafficking at the time of the World Cup have not been rewarded with constructive action by the parties involved. It is hoped that this House and the Commission, in coalition, can persuade, and possibly compel, Member States, NGOs and citizens to respect the rights of fellow human beings in order to reduce exploitation of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">I am less positive about the views on the distribution of responsibilities. It is my deep conviction that it is no business of government to encroach upon the personal privacy of individual people without good reason. There is only cause for this once the boundaries of criminal law have been crossed. Since these boundaries vary from one Member State to another, it is up to them to guarantee enforcement in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Since it is impossible to find justification for an active role for Europe in this area, my group has applied for separate votes for a number of those amendments, which I will be in favour of once those elements have been removed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In view of the violence committed by young people, it is intolerable that young people should be allowed to carry weapons, that they should use them to inflict wounds and worse, and that party drugs and other intoxicants should circulate among them; our teachers therefore need to be trained in the prevention of violence, theft, vandalism and drug-dealing.</p>
<p class="contents">Another promoter of violence is the Internet, which not only enables perverts to establish contact with their potential victims, but also offers, at various sites on it, detailed tips on the committing of violent acts. This, I believe, is where criminal prosecutions need to be stepped up.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I cannot do other than address the violence that is current within immigrant communities. People who come from cultural environments with a quite different attitude towards violence – by which I mean an archaic one – believe that they can retain their greater propensity for violence even within the EU; it follows that potentially violent elements must be prevented from entering it, and that the abandonment of violence must be made priority in integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To begin with, I would like to recall the success we have jointly achieved. Thanks to the close and good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, what was originally a two-part Community programme – combating violence against women and fighting against drugs – has now been divided. In this way, we have emphasised how very important each of the two struggles really is. I wish to express my gratitude to Commissioner Frattini and his team, and particularly to our rapporteur Mrs Gröner for her excellent work, as well as to all my colleagues from the committee for their cooperation. I am proud of this achievement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Daphne programme, however, will not be effective as long as men – both those in the home and those engaged in politics and public life – do not actively participate in the process. In this respect, I appreciate the actions taken by the Austrian and Finnish presidencies in support of the involvement of men in promoting gender equality.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1946, dozens of regulations have been passed, and yet there is still growing violence. I hope that this will not prove to be just one more regulation, since we all know that the problem will not be solved solely by administrative actions and the funding of short-term, one-off campaigns targeting violence against women and children. It is not enough to deal only with the consequences. We must focus on prevention and on systemic education and the promotion of respect and the dignity of the human being. This and only this will be fruitful. We must focus on the treatment of violent individuals as soon as they manifest inclinations to violence. Otherwise, the use of the Daphne funds will be ineffective, if not totally worthless.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by mentioning violence against children, which is also addressed by the Daphne programme. As we speak, a paedophile party in the Netherlands is promoting its agenda with the aim of legalising paedophilia and sexual activity with children – as long as children give their consent. Almost everyone is silent on this matter. I wonder why …</p>
<p class="contents">Unless we are able to apply our legal tools and use the support of politicians to stop the abuse of minors, we will never win the battle against violence against women and children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This agreement was actually brokered by the Commission, and for that I thank Commissioner Frattini.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I should like to express my support, my full support, for the report by Mrs Gröner, whom I congratulate, and in doing so I shall highlight an amendment that I consider particularly important, which is the one that specifically mentions national, regional and local authorities as targets of awareness-raising actions. I shall also explain why: a few days ago in Milan there were some cases of violence against young women; naturally, these episodes of violence caused outrage, but some comments were also made that once again confirm an attitude that is quite widespread among the authorities, that the victims are also somehow partly to blame for violent acts.</p>
<p class="contents">You will all remember, I am sure, the so-called ‘jeans’ ruling; well, among the comments I shall quote the one made by the Prefect of Rome, who stated that the latest episode, when two French girls were raped after accepting a lift from two strangers, was due to imprudence more than anything else.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though the prefect’s intentions were undoubtedly good, this statement reveals a way of thinking according to which, if a woman is raped, it is at least partly her own fault. Is being imprudent, however, a crime? I do not think so, and I should not like to go back to the times when women were asked to stay at home in the evenings so as not to be imprudent.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, then, I should like to point out that we are talking about programmes to ensure that the European Union develops as an area of freedom, and I emphasise ‘freedom’, as well as security and justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That this is the case shows that such behaviour is, in fact, still in some way accepted within society and something that we have not yet overcome. For as long as we do not agree that abuse, both physical and psychological, is also a violation of human rights for women and children, millions of women and children will be subjected to exactly that.</p>
<p class="contents">One way of showing that we are agreed to signpost this as unacceptable behaviour is to approve and highlight such international agreements as exist – the UN Convention on Women’s Rights, the UN Convention on Children’s Rights, the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights and the tool that the Daphne programme represents. I am appalled to hear that the Independence and Democracy Group will be voting against parts of this programme. </p>
<p class="contents">Threats, violence and other outrages involving horrific activities such as genital mutilation all get explained away or justified at times on the grounds of tradition or culture. This means that we need to stir up a debate in workplaces, in schools, at the dinner table and even amongst the peace-keeping soldiers we send abroad in the name of the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">Those countries with which we have agreements need support. I was speaking about this very subject with women in Kyiv in Ukraine just last Saturday. I have also discussed this a great deal with women’s groups from Turkey. There is much to do in this field. Many of the proposals in this report today are very constructive.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to review the scale of punishments. In Sweden, for example, the maximum punishment for grievous sexual attacks on children is the same as that for serious fraud. There is room for thought on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">In New York they have successfully reduced crime perpetrated against women and violence against women. I see this as a first step towards being able to achieve the same in Europe, but to do so requires us to agree on just how unacceptable and heinous this situation is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two and a half thousand years ago, in the Republic of Athens, in the time of Socrates, there was no crime, there was no violence against women. It was considered unacceptable while, two and a half thousand years later, we have this violence, this unchecked violence, against women.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore take measures. I do not know if the Daphne programme suffices or if something more is required. Penalties must suddenly get stricter. Penalties against someone who rapes a woman are not strict. Today, in 2006, we have more prostitution of women than we did 50 years ago, after the war.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, of all the women who come to our country, to Greece – which is not a rich country – from the former east bloc countries, half are extradited. This is a crime. In order for us to fight violence against women, therefore, we need first of all to fight the poverty that leads to violence.</p>

Putting the two together in this way would certainly have resulted in even more misunderstandings and in incomprehension of what the European Union was up to, particularly among the persons affected by them, and I am glad that this is not going to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">This programme is a successful one, and must be continued, as visibly and comprehensibly as possible, as a response to increasing violence, and this separation is helpful to this end. I am sure, too, that the doubling of its budget is not only encouraging but also necessary, constituting as it does a broadening of the range of goals and actions. I would particularly like to highlight the campaign against people-trafficking, in particular against the trafficking of women and children, which calls for a high degree of vigilance and a great deal of work in view of the need for extended networks and for the financial resources required to that end.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, then, to give my forthright support to Mrs Gröner’s proposal that cooperation projects to combat people-trafficking be extended to include third countries, since cooperation with countries of origin is vital.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite all this, Daphne is no more than a drop in the ocean. It is particularly in the Member States that the campaign against violence must be continued with greater vigour, and must also be enshrined in law. I would refer in this regard to the eviction law, which has been implemented for some considerable time in Austria, and also in many other countries, the effect of which is that those who commit acts of violence are required to leave the home. I would also like to mention the anti-stalking law that is now in place in Austria, the object of which is to address the issue of psychological violence, something that is not yet taken seriously.</p>

It may seem unnecessary to discuss this issue again. However, nothing could be further from the truth. Every year, thousands of women and children are trafficked within the borders of the European Union to become the objects of sexual exploitation. There is much talk of prevention and of providing support for the victims. However, where are the actions of the services responsible for dealing with this phenomenon?</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there is action taken simply for show. It yields little in the way of results other than generating media hype. What about the fact that there are labour camps in a large European Union Member State on the Mediterranean coast where, according to the press, 20 000 people from other Member States worked? They worked fifteen hours a day. The barracks in which they lived were surrounded by barbed wire and patrolled by guards armed with firearms. People who did not want to work were even murdered. Rape, in full view of spouses, was a common occurrence.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of intervention by diplomatic services and pleas from escapees, the police only intervened after a few months. Yet the enlightened citizens of the European Union benefited from this slave labour. Is it possible that the local authorities did not know about it? After all, the matter affected thousands of people. These events took place a few weeks ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, we are debating important matters which should have been resolved long ago. Some people, like the leader of the Socialists, create international uproar about controversial demonstrations not being permitted, yet we are turning a blind eye to the emergence of a new form ...</p>

Such violence causes great suffering and destroys the lives of millions of women and thereby of entire families. In Europe alone, every fifth woman is a victim of violence, the consequences of which can be measured in the damage done to their physical and mental health and to that of their children and family members. For violence may lurk in seemingly peaceful family homes as well as in intimacy in the workplace, in the increasingly harsh modes of behaviour between the sexes, in sexual harassment, and in its harshest form it manifests itself in enforced prostitution, which is the contemporary world’s version of slavery.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot ignore the fact that the countless forms of violent and sexually degrading behaviour arise from certain social customs and traditions that are unacceptable to Europeans. These include enforced genital mutilation and the institution of forced marriage. Sadly, these unacceptable forms of behaviour have also made their appearance within the EU. All of these phenomena fundamentally violate human rights, which constitute one of the cornerstones of the European Communities and of the Union. The defence of these rights require the cooperation of law enforcement and judicial authorities as well as the joint action of Member States and of the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Daphne III Programme can count on widespread public support, for during the World Cup championships alone, our campaign against forced prostitution was able to garner 100 000 signatures and the assistance of Commissioner Frattini, as well as the voluntary collaboration of the police forces of the countries concerned. If we were able to keep sport clean, we should also strive to preserve the peace and cleanliness of family life and find the strength necessary for community action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Violence against women is a large and growing problem within the countries of the EU. Many women and their children have their lives ruined as a result of violence and, especially, threats of violence. Every year, hundreds of women die in Europe as a result of domestic violence, with a large number of attempted murder cases being reported on top of that. It is therefore of extraordinary significance that violence against women and children be made a distinct point on the EU agenda. Violence against women and children is a special problem that requires special initiatives and special solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s proposal focuses on the outrages that take place day in and day out in domestic settings and on changes that will force the national parliaments to take a stand on these serious issues. There is a need for a programme that focuses solely on violence and that can contribute to publicising this problem whilst at the same time helping to promote a public debate about violence. The taboo and silence around violence must be fought, and the Member States ought to be making a massive effort to inform people – both the victims and perpetrators of violence – of how to get help. The taboo is also a great obstacle in the way of preventative work, and we need to open the eyes of EU citizens to the many victims who live in daily fear of attack. Violence is not a private matter, irrespective of the area of life in which it occurs and of who perpetrates it and regardless of whether it takes place within a family or in public life or whether it be a case of violence by the state.</p>
<p class="contents">Violence against women takes many forms – physical, psychological and sexual violence, enforced prostitution and the trafficking of women. The principal objective of the EU’s activities to counter violence is to prevent and combat all forms of violence in order to completely eliminate this form of crime that is also a serious violation of human rights. The fight against violence should be recognised as being part of the protection of our basic rights and freedoms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must provide women with the means and resources required to escape a reality which, year after year, kills hundreds of women from all countries of the Union. Violence against women and children is a violation of basic fundamental rights and, furthermore, we must not forget that this violation is all the more serious when it affects certain groups, such as minorities and people living in poverty or the disabled.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the alarming statistics on the victims of this violence, we must carry out a genuine social revolution, since we cannot forget that, behind the statistics and the numbers, there lies the history of thousands of women who every day have to suffer at the hands of those who abuse them merely because they are women. We must therefore strongly defend a specific programme which makes progress towards resolving a social problem with regard to which all public powers must act to promote a change that leads to a more egalitarian society.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish Government has implemented a law against gender violence, with a clear commitment to combat this social scourge. Though it is true that that law cannot put an end overnight to the reality suffered by women, it offers significant support.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the direction that the rest of the Union must take, making decisive commitments in the conviction that to do nothing at this point would mean turning our backs on thousands of women who are expecting us to respond. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In general, I sincerely appreciate the way in which Parliament and the Commission have worked on the Daphne programme in recent months. I also heartily thank the rapporteur and the chairman of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality. They are well aware that about a year ago I said right from the beginning that I supported the idea of separating the Daphne part dealing with violence towards women and children from the part dealing with drugs prevention, so as to avoid inappropriately confusing the issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that there is general agreement today in that respect and that it will be possible to focus more seriously and more emphatically, with about twice as much funding as was provided in the past, on the issue of preventing and reacting to all kinds of violence that affect children and women.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I believe that the Commission is not only ready, but also very happy to continue cooperating closely with Parliament on implementation measures, in the sense of keeping Parliament continually informed about how the Daphne programmes are being allocated and about the concrete results of the programmes and projects that are actually financed.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an important topic that I heard mentioned by a few Members during the latter part of the debate, which is the role of the Member States and the role of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this subject seems particularly important to me because we cannot just underline the role of the Member States, the police forces and the courts in pursuing and punishing acts of violence at a national level. There is a need for Europe to speak out loudly against any form of violence that increasingly affects women and children.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Daphne programme is necessary, and that is how it provides added value. It does not detract from the duty of the national police forces or courts to pursue and punish individual cases of violence at a national level. It is our duty, however, to make Europe speak out against crime, which is increasingly transnational and directed against women – for instance, all the kinds of traffic aimed at forced prostitution – and against children – as in everything concerning the horrendous crime of paedophilia, which is more and more becoming a transnational crime. Anyone who still has any doubts needs to be assured that the value added by European action in this area is quite obvious.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now make just a very few comments on certain amendments highlighting some particular kinds of violence. We must be careful not to exclude other kinds of violence, but in what sense? In the sense that, if the draft text makes reference just to certain kinds of actions for which Daphne may grant funding, we risk excluding other forms of violence for which Daphne should also provide funding. I would prefer a more general wording, which covers prevention and reaction to all kinds of violence, without specifying some and therefore without the risk of excluding others.</p>
<p class="contents">One particular amendment concerns the European Federation for Missing and Sexually Exploited Children. A proposed compromise amendment, Amendment 72, confirms the possibility of funding this federation, but it adds another organisation called ENOC. I support the compromise amendment in that, on the one hand, it enables us to grant funding to very specific organisations that are already operational, but with this second organisation, on the other hand, the range of potential funding beneficiaries is made a little broader.</p>
<p class="contents">Two final remarks: the first is that much has been said about a European telephone helpline to help children in difficulties. The initiative is extremely important, and I can tell you now that we are already preparing a draft framework decision. We were working on it – I was working on it – when I presented the communication on children’s rights to you in June. I can now tell you that preparations for the framework decision on the single European helpline are under way and we shall actually submit it very soon. It is an initiative that will really help a great deal, and so I also thank those who referred to it during the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The final issue has been touched upon by some Members: the idea of having a European directive against violence towards women. I very much like the idea and it is a very interesting one, but I have one concern: finding an appropriate legal basis. We should find one: I do not know whether there is a suitable legal basis in the Treaties for a directive against violence towards women, but if we succeed in resolving this aspect of the legal basis then I shall be politically very much in favour of the idea of harmonising at least the European guidelines for severely punishing cases of criminal violence against women.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the beginning of a thought process that we can take up again later. I am grateful to everyone who has taken part in this debate, and I am ready to continue to cooperate with you on these issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, there was support for this proposal from almost all the groups in this House. I ask you to take up this debate now in order that we may achieve a result without delay. You can rely on our cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A vital instrument for raising awareness and for introducing good practice, Daphne has made it possible to enlist the help of NGOs while raising public awareness of forms of violence long considered taboo.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite apart from these results, which must be consolidated and boosted by increased funding, this is concrete proof of the added value of action taken at European level, which reminds us that the original idea of Europe is that of a political group founded on fundamental values such as the protection of vulnerable people. This, rather than economic power, is the main thrust of European commitment today.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from the stated ‘objectives of ambitious results’, we wish to point out the need for clear, credible objectives to reduce violence still further, because much remains to be done. Accordingly, we can welcome the helpdesk services provided to the organisations involved, and the extension of aid to a broader range of NGOs, which has become necessary due to the international proliferation of organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">We should like to point out that the success of the Daphne-funded programmes is down to the involvement of the actors carrying out the vital outreach and follow-up work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
