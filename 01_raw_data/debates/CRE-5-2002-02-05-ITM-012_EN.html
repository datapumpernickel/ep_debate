However, I have just heard that I am permitted to speak for eight minutes, as my group is not especially interested in the subject. I see, though, that Mr Evans and Mrs Riis-Jørgensen are here, and so we can, anyway, give a repeat of our performance in committee, swapping our positions on this issue. But, joking aside …</p>
<p class="contents">We have jointly – and ambitiously – resolved that the European Union is to become the world's most competitive region within the next ten years. If the European Union wants to be the world's most competitive region, that means that its enterprises must be the most competitive enterprises in the world. It also means that we need the European Union's ambience to be both favourable to competition and capable of handling it. Thus far, it is right that our task should be to roll back state aid to enterprises as far as possible, and our task must also be – if we actually have to grant aid at all – to direct it increasingly towards horizontal goals.</p>
<p class="contents">To that extent, the perceptible decline in aid between 1997 and 1999 is to be welcomed – and that is the period under consideration, the period covered by the Commission's ninth aid report. We still, of course, call on the Commission to perform its role as a guard against aid that distorts competition.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we should desist from seeing aid policy only through lenses coloured by ideology, and from engaging in it from one ideological standpoint or another. Some of us do that from time to time in this House, and I will give an example of it later. Whether we like it or not, it is a matter of fact that aid is a tool of state policy, because it is used for incentives to facilitate control in line with the market and because it can be used to avoid the need for intervention in the form of instructions or prohibitions. That cannot always be done. It is sometimes more appropriate to achieve something by means of legal regulations, but also sometimes just as practical to do it by means of control in line with the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Aid has a vital place among the political instruments, as it can be used to correct failings in the market and reduce differences in standards of living between regions of the European Union. What we are doing with European regional and structural policy is, indeed, also aid, albeit not of the State variety that we want to discuss this evening, and those policies are political instruments in supporting SMEs, environmental protection, research and development.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say, Commissioner, that I welcome the fact that you, or the Commission, now have, in addition to the register of aid systems, which has now come into being, the State Aid Scoreboard. That was something called for by all groups in Parliament. This State Aid Scoreboard, which is in its earliest stages, can, in my view, be developed into an instrument which will make it possible to discern trends and assess aid by reference to qualitative criteria – the qualitative criteria to which I have just referred.</p>
<p class="contents">That, then, is something I value. It is not only the quantity of state aid that should be comprehensively assessed; we also need qualitative criteria and objectives that have to be taken equally into account. As I have said, I have named them. Sometimes they justify control measures with time limits, and even existing market distortions can be removed in the medium term by the use of aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Commission has a far more broad and open mind – with apologies to Mr Evans, and Mrs Riis-Jørgensen – than has the present conservative-liberal majority in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noted that, in general debates, there is always full-bodied rejection of aid as if it were quite simply a snare of the devil. The politicians in the field, should one ask them, take quite different views of certain points. In reality, they too want nothing to do with its general disparagement.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now give you the example I mentioned earlier. The Commission has, fortunately, been investigating for some time the extent to which sleights-of-hand in the taxation of businesses are being used to obtain illicit aid. The Commission is doing this on its own initiative and because it is right to do so, but it is also doing it because it was called upon to do it. In committee, I formulated a passage in my draft report which the Commission, remarkably, emphatically supports, and along the lines of which it intends to go forward. When a vote was taken, the majority in committee cut out this passage.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, I will be giving you the opportunity to make good this error tomorrow. My group will be reinserting this passage, and a couple of others as well, by means of an amendment. Do please remember that this is common policy on which we have agreed. So, tomorrow, you can make good the committee's error, or, alternatively, make it clear in public that that is not how you see the details of aid policy. You will have to do some thinking about that.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to wind up by saying that too much praise for the Commission is not such a good thing. Let us cut back on it a little. So I would like to refer, Commissioner, to something I touched on once or twice in committee. It also has to do with the subject of qualitative criteria, qualitative and quantitative assessment. That is the area, as you will rightly observe, of regional aid granted by the Member States, which makes up a very large part of the aid total, well above half, I think about 56% or more if I remember rightly. You will conclude that that is the area in which a reduction in aid can be best and most rapidly achieved. That is, though, rather a generalised way of looking at things, and I would again recommend that you think a bit about whether it is not perhaps the area of regional aid in which we have very definitely to be guided by qualitative criteria. If we were to have a debate on that next year, that would represent some small progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, there is very much more that unites us on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs than you would think from some of the assertions he has just made. We can see that from the report that we are considering. There are 22 paragraphs in this report. Mr Rapkay had only six areas where his report was significantly amended. We have six amendments to consider tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us look at the things that unite us. I certainly do not believe that state aid is the work of the devil. In a sense that was excessive rhetoric on the part of Mr Rapkay. We actually both believe in a competitive Europe. We are in favour of making our economy competition-friendly. Mr Rapkay's excellent report – which I will support in its current form tomorrow – is a consistent report building on the one produced by the committee last year. Of course there will be some differences of emphasis between us. We do not all share the same political outlook. But there is a trend in relation to the views that have been forward by the Economic Committee which are at the core of Mr Rapkay's report and for which I congratulate him.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, I certainly believe in the rigorous application of state aid. I congratulate Commissioner Monti for the stance that he has taken in this area. It is something that broadly reflects the position of our Economic Committee. Our committee is committed to taking forward the Lisbon process. Building a competitive Europe must be a part of that, so it is important that we have proper state aid control.</p>
<p class="contents">Part of that is through the transparency that comes from the State Aid Scoreboard, of which Mr Rapkay has been a keen exponent. He has raised the issue consistently. We are delighted that Commissioner Monti has made progress in this area. There is more work to be done in developing the scoreboard. I am not absolutely sure that the Competition DG competition is at the front of the queue in terms of the Internet-friendly nature of its particular website. I am absolutely confident that more progress will be made. I went on to the Internet the other day to find out about the Competition Day that is coming up. It was not a particularly friendly site to deal with.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention the Steel Aid Code. I have consistently said to Commissioner Monti that the industry is looking for guidance here. We want the current regime to stay in place in some format. I hope that Commissioner Monti will feel after mature reflection that, given the difficulties with the United States of America, that is something he could support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would first of all say thank you again to Mr Monti for the great efforts he has made in this area, and I would also thank Mr Rapkay very much. We do not always agree, but I am very pleased with the report, even if there are a number of things we have to discuss regarding how we are to vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also a couple of practical matters I should like to comment on, first of all a matter on which I myself have done some work, namely the Commission’s proposal concerning the shipyards package. We had a debate on this here in Parliament last autumn. I was very much against the proposed aid to shipyards, and I therefore want to ask the Commission how this matter is progressing. I was delighted to note that, at the Council meeting of Trade and Industry Ministers at the beginning of December, it was impossible to obtain the necessary majority for adopting the Commission’s proposal. The Commission was not immediately willing to alter its proposal, which was based upon the results worked out in what is known as the TBR report, drawn up by the Commission every six months. Naturally, I am concerned that the Commission’s next TBR report will conveniently demonstrate that we need aid for more types of ship than those cited in the Commission’s original proposal. I would therefore ask Commissioner Monti to answer the following question: is there a new TBR report on the way from the Commission and, if so, can the Commissioner then inform us as to what conclusions are to be drawn by it?</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, we in Parliament will vote on a proposal we did not have time to discuss before the vote. It is most certainly a proposal that does not fall within your area, Mr Monti, for it concerns the fact that, quite extraordinarily, the airlines have been allowed to retain airport arrival and departure times which, under normal rules, they have made too little use of to be permitted to retain. We are, then, preparing special legislation which we are now rushing through and which will, of course, mean that smaller airlines that wish to enter the market with competitive prices will not be allowed to offer this service to us as consumers, who shall instead have to put up with airlines which do not deliver the goods and which – when they do deliver them – only do so at unduly high prices. That is also the reality where state aid is concerned, for it largely favours the old national companies with their monopolies. For me, that is an example of the way in which our fine words about cutting back on state aid are all too infrequently followed up by firm and practical action. I would therefore also permit myself to ask you a question, Mr Monti. How does this proposal fit in with our general desire to cut back on state aid and create a situation in which we can all compete fairly and on an equal basis? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

State aid granted on a large scale, often for shortsighted reasons, has for a long time been a strain on the purse of the European taxpayer and has slowed down the reorganisation of the economic structures of our Member States. Although aid granted by Member States might be justified in particularly exceptional circumstances, large amounts of aid and various tax concessions distort competition and go against the principles of the single market. For that reason, reductions in state aid and effective monitoring strengthen the competitiveness of the European economy and thus boost economic growth and the creation of jobs. At the Stockholm European Council the Member States renewed their commitment to reduce state aid as a proportion of GNP. There was also a promise to redirect state aid to horizontal objectives that benefited the Union as a whole. This commitment must be kept to.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the general survey we are now dealing with, a decline in state aid was achieved in the period 1997 – 1999. We cannot, however, be satisfied with the progress made up to the present day. We in Parliament have time and time again called for action that would guarantee greater transparency in this area. The Member States still do not have any monitoring instrument that can be compared to the state agency monitoring that is conducted at Community level. Data on state aid is still provided only in the form of total sums. To make an accurate analysis possible we need more detailed information on the use aid is put to and the sectors and companies that receive aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Like many of my colleagues before me, I also take a very positive view of the Commission’s announcement that a state aid register and scoreboard is to be introduced. I also urge the Commission to continue with its earlier policy of reorganising the Union’s economic and production structures, especially with regard to sector- and case-specific state aid. In this respect I agree fully with what my colleague, Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, said about the shipbuilding industry, which is also a major sector from the point of view of Finland, my country. There has been good progress made recently in that area by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">If Europe is to become the world’s most competitive economic area, it will mean giving up the practices of old. It is clear, however, that new and permanent jobs will not be created by trying to maintain dilapidated structures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I greatly welcome the support pledged by the committee with this report for a rigorous state aid control policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Listening to this brief but interesting debate, I believe I can see a wide consensus, as, moreover, has been pointed out, between the different parties represented in Parliament. I believe I can also see a non-ideological approach, and I feel that the more we succeed in producing information tools, the more we will be able to move away from reasoning solely in terms of ideologies and place ourselves in a position to assess the qualitative as well as the quantitative aspects of state aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that the committee calls on Member States to live up to the commitment they entered into at the Stockholm European Council, which Mrs Kauppi has just mentioned, to reduce state aid as a proportion of GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the positive developments of recent years, I too feel that there is still room for further reduction of state aid in the Member States. I essentially agree that a careful reassessment of the relationship between regional policy and competition policy must be carried out for the period after 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">I also share the concern expressed in the motion for a resolution regarding returning regional policy to national control, given that some of the economically stronger Member States are arguing that a reduction in Structural Funds expenditure should be offset by greater tolerance with regard to national aid. I see this as an extremely worrying trend.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased with the positive reaction of the committee and the Rapkay report to two instruments which might not yet be as user-friendly as we would like. For our part, we will endeavour to constantly improve the State Aid Scoreboard and the state aid register now available on the Internet. There is no longer any need for me to describe these two instruments – you are quite familiar with them – and from now on the scoreboard, in particular, will make it possible to share useful information through Internet connections with the Member States and, with the introduction of the second edition, with the European Parliament as well.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, the state aid register supplements the scoreboard, providing more detailed information in a less aggregate form on each case of aid, specifying the sectors and businesses concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Concerning the steel industry, may I remind Parliament that the Commission has already expressed its intention that strict rules on state aids to this sector be maintained after the expiry of the ECSC Treaty. The European Parliament, Member States, the ECSC Consultative Committee, as well as steel companies and their associations, have also requested strict rules for state aids to the steel industry. The Commission considers that this objective may be attained by focusing on the types of state aid that, from the experience of the past and taking into account the features of the steel industry, have most distortive effects on competition in this sector. This is the case of investment aid and rescue and restructuring aid.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the Commission's intention to continue the current prohibition of these types of aid after the expiry of the Treaty on 23 July 2002 and this point is planned for discussion in the Commission very soon.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Riis-Jørgensen mentioned shipbuilding, and your interest in this does not surprise me entirely. You are well aware what the conclusions or the non-conclusions were in the Industry Council in December. Indeed, a report is being produced concerning the situation of another market segment, for which a procedure has been started. I have nothing new to report on this.</p>
<p class="contents">On airlines, I would just like to point out that the Commission has decided, concerning the events of 11 September, that indeed they were of an exceptional nature in the sense of Article 87(2)(b) of the Treaty. This means that state aid to make good damage caused can be accepted – though as you know, this has been applied by the Commission in a very stringent and cautious and restrictive manner – concerning the four days following 11 September, as a result of the closure of US air space, and measures to cover the excess costs of insurance in air transport for one month or if needed to the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me once again stress how grateful the Commission is for the interest of Parliament in the state aid policy. This encourages us to act more and more effectively in this delicate and important area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
