<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Theorin (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – All the European Member States adopted the Beijing Platform for Action. We committed ourselves to 12 areas. They are all indispensable for women's full enjoyment of their human rights. Five years later it is time for an evaluation.</p>
<p class="contents">The first area is poverty. We pledged to adopt macro-economic policies for the needs of women in poverty and to ensure women's equal access to economic resources. But single mothers and older women remain the main victims of poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area is education. We promised to ensure women's equal access to science and technology and life-long education. Unfortunately, education of women and men still follows a stereotyped pattern.</p>
<p class="contents">The third area is health. We agreed to increase resources for women's health. Yet middle-aged and elderly women remain beset, more than men, with health problems. Maternity and child mortality are still too high.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth area is violence. We promised to eliminate gender-based violence, yet violence against women remains the single largest injury to European women. Between 15% and 25% of women are battered during pregnancy and sexual trafficking is increasing, while only 2% to 3% of those men who commit rape go to prison.</p>
<p class="contents">The fifth area is armed conflict. We promised to increase women's participation in conflict resolution and protect women in armed conflicts, yet women still make up the overwhelming majority of those affected by armed conflict but are absent from peace negotiations and peace transition initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The sixth area is women and the economy. We pledged to promote women's access to employment and control over economic resources. Women remain virtually absent from or are poorly represented in economic decision making. Women earn, on average, 75% of the hourly wages of men and their employment rate is about 20% lower.</p>
<p class="contents">Decision making is the seventh area. We promised to ensure women's equal access to, and full participation in, power structures and decision making, yet nowhere is the gap between de jure and de facto gender equality greater than in the area of decision making.</p>
<p class="contents">The eighth area is institutional mechanisms for the advancement of women. We agreed to mainstream gender in legislation, public policies and programmes. Unfortunately, the political will has been absent. Gender mainstreaming and gender impact assessment are far from a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Women's human rights is the ninth area. We promised to fully implement the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Today there is still insufficient recognition of the principle that human rights apply equally to women and men.</p>
<p class="contents">The tenth area is media. We pledged to promote a non-stereotyped portrayal of women in the media yet, as a result of massive male domination of media power, the media continue to project negative and degrading images of women.</p>
<p class="contents">The eleventh area is environment. The European Members pledged to involve women actively in environmental decision making. Women's experience and skill remain insufficiently used in environmental policy actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The twelfth and last area is the girl child. We promised to eliminate all forms of discrimination against the girl child, yet statistics show that a girl child is discriminated against from the earliest stages of life, through her childhood and into adulthood.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the discouraging result five years after Beijing and after 25 years of effort since the United Nations incurred the responsibility for promoting women's rights at national, regional and international levels. It is high time for the UN "Beijing plus five" special session in June next year to take concrete action to implement the Beijing platform. An action-oriented plan for advancing the Beijing goals is necessary if all governments are to implement strategies for gender equality in all 12 critical areas of concern.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must play a truly active role. The preparatory work at European level is already far advanced. The European Union work must be speeded up so it can have a real influence before positions are fixed at international level. Our question is: how will the Commission and the Council ensure that Parliament becomes a real partner, both in the preparatory work on the European Union input to "Beijing plus five", and in the European Union's official delegation to the New York Conference? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you, in any case, for having taken up this very important question. </p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Theorin<span class="italic"> </span>is certainly aware, the European Union’s preparatory conference, which was planned for December of this year within the framework of the European Commission, will now take place in February of next year. The intention is that the applicant countries, non-governmental organisations and, of course, Members of the European Parliament who have already been invited as lecturers and mediators should also take part in this conference. Since this falls within the sphere of the Commission’s activities, it is only appropriate to turn to the Commission for more information. To confine ourselves to the latest development within the Council, the Finnish Presidency has prepared a questionnaire addressed to all the Member States and to all the European institutions on the subject of “Women in the Decision-making Process”. Their answer has made it possible for the Finnish Presidency to prepare a report containing nine indicators, together with recommendations. This report was debated in the Council (Employment and Social Affairs) on 22 October of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Parallel to the debates based on the Presidency’s above-mentioned report, the Council has adopted a number of conclusions in which account is taken of the Finnish Presidency’s report. The nine indicators it is proposed should be used when next monitoring implementation of the Beijing Action Platform are included in these conclusions, and a reminder is provided of the Member States’ commitment, in accordance with the Beijing Action Platform, to achieve the equal participation of women and men at all levels where power is exercised and decisions taken. The Member States are urged to take any necessary measures. Furthermore, the Council is following with interest the debates which are taking place in Parliament, particularly in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities in which the honourable Member is chairperson </p>
<p class="contents">My personal comment is that I agree with Mrs Theorin that violence against women is the greatest individual violation of women’s rights. When it comes to the conference in New York, it ought to be pointed out that this is an Intergovernmental Conference and that there is therefore no official delegation as such from the European Union but, instead, delegations from the Member States. Moreover, the Commission has observer status.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I agree with Mrs Theorin that the situation is particularly dramatic for women in many places on the planet and is becoming critical. Unfortunately, globalisation, development, technologies, the free movement of capital, goods and, above all, people often have negative rather than positive implications for women and children in the Third World.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to refer to some of the action taken by the Commission; however, I would stress that there is, I believe, a great deal of room for further mobilisation by both the Commission and the Member States and, of course, a special policy to support these issues is needed, both in the run up to the conference and afterwards, within the fifth women’s action plan. As you know, the European Commission drafted an announcement in 1995, in parallel to the Beijing Conference, in which it adopted gender mainstreaming in all development policies.</p>
<p class="contents">A vote on gender mainstreaming in all individual policies was held in 1995 and guidelines were drafted for the Commission services to follow. A budget line was allocated to increasing awareness and supporting action for women in developing countries. It was agreed to create indicators and, in April 1999, the first announcement was made of the results of these joint indicators, which take account of the place of women in the economy, in politics and in society in relation to the development programmes approved. The first two-year report evaluating the results of these policies will be presented in 2000. I repeat that some action has been taken since Beijing, but this needs to be stepped up and consolidated with much more specific measures. As far as the participation of the European Parliament is concerned, we must acknowledge that, for years now, the European Parliament has been instrumental in raising public awareness both in Europe and throughout the world and in the decision-making process; i.e. it has affected the decisions taken by the Council and the Commission. The European Parliament therefore has an exceptionally important role and it will have a great deal of input into this procedure up to June. As you know, a committee in which the European Parliament is involved is responsible for pre-conference planning. The Member States are helping to organise the United Nations Conference. As the Presidency has stressed, we shall be taking part as observers. We have the previous experience of Beijing but that will not prevent continuous and fundamental cooperation throughout this period so that we can arrive at common positions in the fifteen Member States. This will be particularly important for the positions which we will put forward and in giving us the strength to put these positions forward in June. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If we examine the results after almost five years and with a view to the June meeting in New York, we should ask ourselves: What progress have we made? What has improved and what has got even worse?</p>
<p class="contents">We are witnessing many armed conflicts, violence against women and extreme poverty in many cases. On the borders of the European Union, we have endured the wars in Bosnia and in Kosovo, which have still not returned to an acceptable state of normality. There are currently conflicts in Chechnya, in other regions of the Caucasus, in Afghanistan, especially the Panjshir Valley, in Africa and other regions. Violence and terrorism have been present in Algeria and still no solution has been found to normalise life and allow progress in all areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In many parts of the world, women are victims of violence and traditional practices which do not take account of their personal dignity or their human rights. They are barred from professional life and even access to health care.</p>
<p class="contents">The trade in human beings particularly affects women, who are victims of organised mafias and prostitution. This particularly affects younger women and, unfortunately, does not only happen in the less developed countries, but also in the wealthy countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Women are reacting, however. They are reacting more and more and they are rebelling against those situations which degrade them and marginalise them. They want to participate in professional life, in political life, in the education of their children and in the training of young women. Numerous laws have been implemented to protect women and allow them to fight inequality, as well as allowing them to participate in political activity. Women are reacting: they make use of the laws in their favour, they organise themselves into cooperatives and manage to bring about a form of development which allows them to improve their quality of life. They want to participate more and more in technological innovations; they have discovered the opportunities offered by organising themselves and establishing associations in their places of residence, in their work-places and in their regions. They are getting better and better at fighting the old problems and achieving better lives.</p>
<p class="contents">However, despite the progress made, we have to continue working so that many women may have more dignified and fair lives. The meeting in New York, following on from the conference in Beijing, will be a good opportunity to continue working along this line. I therefore ask for more participation by the Parliament and support from the European institutions so that our presence there may be effective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We considered the fourth action programme on equal opportunities to be the consequence of it. We have tried to include the gender mainstreaming policy in all policy areas. We have launched specific measures such as those to combat violence against women.</p>
<p class="contents">I was present as rapporteur for the European Parliament at both the NGO Conference in Beijing and at the Intergovernmental Conference of the 189 countries and I have, of course, followed developments over the last five years very closely, both in the European Union and in the developing countries. I recall that the EU spoke out for women with one voice under the Spanish Presidency of the Council and was able during negotiations to argue important points and include them in the Action Platform from this position of strength. That was the happy experience.</p>
<p class="contents">That the Members of the European Parliament had an undetermined status and were not fully integrated in the European delegation was the less happy experience. The situation was different at subsequent negotiations, for example, at the WTO in Seattle. We should therefore continue to follow this new practice at future international conferences. This brings me to my specific question, which is directed mainly at the Council, and we expect an equally specific answer: what status will MEPs have at the next conference, the Beijing plus 5 Conference in New York? We are already involved with the Commission in preparing the content for the conference in February but we are still waiting for a clear message from the Council, since the question of if and how many members are to represent the European Parliament in New York has not yet been clarified. Time is running out. The ECE Conference, i.e. the UN Commission on Europe, is being held in Geneva in January and it is not clear whether we have been included in the delegation to it.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a straight answer here today. Preparation of the content by the Commission, in which we have been included, is well under way. Firstly, the content of the twelve crucial areas defined in the Action Platform is being dealt with. Secondly, strategies are being clearly discussed. We do not want to formulate new objectives; what we want is a clear analysis and evaluation of where progress has been made in our Member States, where we should concentrate and where we should step up efforts so that the European Union can achieve progress in New York for the women of Europe and throughout the world?</p>
