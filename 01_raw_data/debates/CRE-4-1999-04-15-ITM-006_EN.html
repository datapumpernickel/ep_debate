All countries are faced with the problems of nuisance, pollution or even congestion in city centres, so the desire to internalise the external costs incurred by the various forms of transport is perfectly justified. That is why we support the Commission"s document. However, since it deals with a key issue that has potentially far‐reaching consequences, it needs to be approached carefully and pragmatically. We are all aware of the importance of transport, particularly in terms of economic development. Yet we must also guard against any excesses in this area. I would like to state that we disagree with two points in Mrs Schmidbauer"s report, namely, the proposal to include car traffic in the charging system and the taxation of kerosene.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the first point, I am not convinced of the relevance of this proposal, at least in terms of the charging system that is suggested in the Commission document. I do not believe that the problems caused by car traffic relate to the White Paper, as it focuses more specifically on public transport, be it passenger or goods transport. I also think that it would be better to deal with car traffic in a specific context.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as my second point is concerned, I believe that we should not be too hasty in legislating on the taxation of kerosene. Instead, we should wait until the international agreement on air transport has been concluded so that it can be taken into consideration in all future legislation. I feel that it would be best to leave things at that for now and to keep to the Commission"s proposals.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lagendijk </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I generally refrain from using my precious time to congratulate the rapporteur because this has really just become a habit, but I should like to do so on this occasion, despite the fact that she has unfortunately left the Chamber, because I am extremely pleased with her report. In my view this is an extremely important proposal from the Commission, and Mrs Schmidbauer has written a very good report on it.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two important points here as far as my group is concerned. First, the principle. As everyone knows, the Greens have for many years been strongly in favour of passing on the costs of using infrastructure to the consumers, because transport is currently too cheap and places too great a burden on the environment. There are also practical reasons why I am pleased to see this proposal, despite the fact that, as Mrs Schmidbauer"s report points out, there is clearly too little money being invested in infrastructure. Overall spending is falling precisely when more money is needed, particularly in our view for investment in rail infrastructure. This is why it is only right and proper that the users of the existing infrastructure should help to pay for extending it. Of course, there are all sorts of practical problems involved and there is naturally opposition to the idea, as we have seen in the Netherlands, especially if it is not made clear that the investment and charges are needed to keep densely populated areas livable and accessible.</p>
<p class="contents">We have two other minor comments on this report. The first concerns paragraph 15, which states that private car traffic must be involved in the proposals as far as possible. In my view this is too weak, since it is actually absolutely necessary. Private car traffic is responsible for a good deal of the marginal costs involved, and I think it is unfair that goods transport alone should be made to pay the price.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, paragraph 10 of the report proposes to offset the costs involved by reducing other taxes on transport. I do not think this is the right approach. I still think that transport is too cheap and that hauling goods backwards and forwards across Europe is still made too attractive. We should be trying to make a fresh start here by doing more than just passing on the capital costs of infrastructure, for example, even in the future.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van Dam </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, in economic dealings, the customer usually has to pay a price for the goods or services he obtains. There is nothing wrong with this, and it is a rule that I think the whole of society accepts. But when it comes to using infrastructure, the link is often not obvious enough. The total costs of transport and the prices charged in many cases bear no relation to each other, and the Commission proposal is a laudable attempt to improve this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is very questionable whether the proposed method of charging – the marginal social costs – will cover all the costs involved. The Commission is obviously trying to be fairly straightforward here. A number of Members have stressed that the introduction of a system of charges must not be allowed to lead to higher costs for the transport user. I would not go as far as this. The ‘user pays" principle must come first, even if this means increasing prices. We must ensure that the costs are borne by the transport end‐users, not just by the operators.</p>
<p class="contents">If certain users are excluded from the system of charges, this will inevitably mean that the total costs cannot be completely covered. I therefore entirely agree with Amendment No 7 by Mr Lagendijk.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed charging method must produce a situation where the forms of transport that are least harmful to the environment have a greater share of the whole transport market, and it must therefore be possible to apply an amended version of the ‘user pays" principle.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Stenmarck </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV) </span> Mr President, it is an acknowledged fact that external costs are increasing dramatically in the transport sector. Apportioning these costs to the respective transport modes therefore makes good sense. Most relevant in this regard are the costs of accidents, where we have seen steep rises within the different modes over recent decades. A variety of costs can be identified when considering the causes of environmental deterioration. We need to assess the impact of noise, for example, and of ground, air and water pollution. The problems are growing in these areas. Difficulties begin in earnest when it comes to evaluating such costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Major differences exist at present between the EU Member States; both the White Paper and the report highlight this. Vehicle tax can be as high as EUR 3 000 per annum, for example. There are nine different charging systems for rail transport, with the level of cost coverage ranging from zero to 100 %. Not least for reasons of competition, it would be desirable for the Union to have a common approach to cost coverage for all the different modes of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone would surely agree on the need to seek a fair basis for calculating Eurovignette charges, motorway tolls and so on. What is more, in the light of developments over recent years, we now have greater scope to introduce uniform technical systems – applicable in all the Member States – for example using telematics. Such possibilities were simply not available on the same scale in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">This all sounds very positive, of course. And there is undoubtedly good reason to try to harmonise rules and provisions within the transport sector, not least in order to ensure that the single market operates better in future than it does today. We need to strive for fair competition between all modes of transport, with a level playing field in terms of competition between the Member States. The EU can see to some of this, but a great deal – possibly the major part – lies in the hands of the Member States themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Some countries – my own included – levy considerably higher taxes and charges than others in several areas. Until people take this fact on board, we are never going to have fair conditions of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal endorsed by a majority of the Committee on Transport and Tourism could well trigger a further increase in the costs affecting the transport sector. Private cars could lose out badly, and certainly will do if the rapporteur"s line is followed. This is quite unacceptable. The PPE Group has tabled a number of amendments to counter such effects, but so far we have received no support. Unless such support is forthcoming today, I can see no way of backing the committee"s proposal as it has been presented.</p>

We welcome this further initiative by the Commission and Barbara Schmidbauer"s report on sharing the costs of transport infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a field where there is clearly no doubt about the jurisdiction of the European Union, particularly in relation to the distortions that occur when different criteria are applied from one country to another, no matter whether this happens close to or far from borders, as in some countries users pay for infrastructure through fuel taxes and tolls, and in others it is financed from the public purse.</p>
<p class="contents">It is hard to find fault with the philosophy of also recovering external transport costs. As these are very high for road transport, including noise, atmospheric pollution and accidents, as demonstrated in the diagrams presented by the rapporteur, there is every justification for making users pay more. In fact this amounts to extending existing practice, whereby road users – via fuel and vehicle taxes and tolls – pay twice the amount spent on roads, whereas railway users pay 56 % and users of inland waterways pay 18 % of the relevant expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from this being fair, it also meets the desirable objective of providing an incentive for shifting demand towards modes of transport with lower external cost factors. However, to avoid the risk of the public being unfairly penalised, it is essential to encourage immediate improvements in such types of transport. In my country, for example, this applies to tracks for high‐speed trains within the country and links to other European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is important to ensure proper distribution of the costs of each mode of transport and route, in a way that is fair and does not distort competition. So we totally support the rapporteur"s call for private car use to be properly taken into account when distributing the costs of road transport. It is also important not to end up with the same situation as in my country, where virtually identical motorways and bridges are subject to widely varying tolls – or none at all – depending on the political clout of the region they serve.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context it is particularly shocking that as a result tolls are being scrapped in metropolitan areas populated by people with higher incomes and where it should be important to discourage the use of private vehicles, whilst they are being maintained in less privileged areas, where there are no demonstrations or electoral backlash, and are raised every year.</p>
<p class="contents">Automatic charging systems like the one on the ‘<span class="italic">Via Verde</span> ' in Portugal avoid potential problems with tailbacks. Another point is that for perfectly understandable social reasons, it would be possible to set an upper limit on monthly payments for anyone who needs to use this infrastructure on a daily basis.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van den Broek, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. ‐</span> Mr President, on behalf of Mr Neil Kinnock I am pleased to react to this report and start by welcoming the support offered in the report and also acknowledging the concerns expressed. I feel certain that we will be able to address these concerns as we implement the principles and develop concrete proposals. On behalf of Mr Kinnock I should like to thank wholeheartedly Mrs Schmidbauer for her very constructive report and her support for the Commission's approach in the White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make a few comments about the points of concern. Firstly, yes, the timetable for implementation is ambitious but we are well on the way, with the Eurovignette agreement near conclusion, railway directives before the Council, the port‐cost survey with Member States, airport‐charging proposals, aviation charges under review, the Committee of Government Experts having met and commissioned the high‐level group to report on cost‐estimation methods. Indeed, we are almost ahead of schedule!</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst we are still using more specific directives, the Commission will, of course, ensure that no inconsistencies or perverse effects result from this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper also stresses the need for balanced implementation, in particular between road and rail sectors. It is for this reason that the railway package provides explicitly for subsidies to railways where there are unpaid external costs in competing modes, such as roads. It is a good example of how the Commission is avoiding inconsistencies in the implementation process by clearly identifying a problem and offering a practical solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper addressed equity and distributional issues as well as the problems faced in peripheral areas. Much of this discussion applies equally to enlargement issues and candidate countries, and I feel sure that we will be able to consider these aspects when we further develop our proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States are encouraged to incorporate the principles of the White Paper within their own charging schemes for private car transport in harmony with any EU‐wide developments. Whilst some Community legislation applies to private car users – such as fuel duties, excise duties, VAT – our current approach to charging is focused on commercial traffic, because that is a problem which can be addressed successfully only by a Community regulatory framework, safeguarding the functioning of the internal transport market while, at the same time, fully integrating environmental objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Private car use raises a host of regional and local issues which, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, call for a somewhat different type of approach, which we have been developing primarily through the action programme for the citizens' network.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that at this stage of Community policy‐making the differentiated approach will be both the most effective and will rightly respect the legitimate roles of transport policy‐makers at other political levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to thank you for the support the report offers. We all know that this area, pricing issues – be they in road, rail, aviation or maritime sectors – is fraught with obstacles and progress, especially at the political level, can be painfully slow. To have the support of Parliament on such subjects is therefore particularly welcome.</p>
