<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hyland </span> <span class="bold">(UPE), </span><span class="italic"> deputising for the rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, I should firstly like to apologise on behalf of my colleague Mr Fitzsimons who is unavoidably absent and has asked me to present this report in his place. In 1993 a decision was adopted establishing a monitoring mechanism for the Community's anthropogenic CO<span class="sub">2</span> and other greenhouse gas emissions. Having a monitoring mechanism for greenhouse gas emissions in place has always made sense as part of an overall coherent strategy to limit greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">This monitoring mechanism serves a double purpose. It could monitor progress towards the stabilisation of CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000 in the Community and it could monitor the fulfilment of the Community's commitments under the United Nations framework convention on climate change which entered into force in 1994. The Kyoto Protocol adopted in December 1997 established principles and introduced legally‐binding targets and timetables for Annex 1 countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">At COP IV in Buenos Aires in November last year some further progress was made. For the first time parties agreed to the adoption of a single plan of action. The Buenos Aires plan of action contains an important list of commitments with timetables on a range of key issues which will help to achieve the Kyoto objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">A monitoring mechanism is all the more necessary now. Many assessments would indicate that CO<span class="sub">2</span> and other greenhouse gas emissions are likely to increase significantly. At the same time the Community has signed up to the Kyoto Protocol and has committed itself to a reduction in its emissions of carbon dioxide and a group of other gases of 8 % below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012, that is 5.2 % in the case of Kyoto Protocol parties as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">It is as simple as this. We need a reliable efficient system for measuring and monitoring our emissions. This draft recommendation is the outcome of Parliament's and Council's consideration of the Commission's updating proposal of 1996. Parliament held its first reading of this proposal in September 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council's common position was received by Parliament in October 1998. In the meantime, of course, the 1996/97 proposal and report have been largely superseded by the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position has done a workman‐like job of updating the mechanism to make it consistent with the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol. It has also incorporated several of Parliament's amendments. However, while the rapporteur is on the whole satisfied with these aspects of the common position, he has retabled some of Parliament's amendments from the first reading which he feels will strengthen the text. Other amendments have been added to lend further coherence to the new elements introduced into the common position by the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the amendments are self‐explanatory, but Mr Fitzsimons would like to draw your attention to two compromise amendments that he has tabled. One of the amendments is a compromise reached between Mr Fitzsimons and Mrs Pollack: it strengthens the text and is in line with two requirements of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. The second amendment is a compromise between the rapporteur, Mr Fitzsimons, and the Commission: it deals with the evaluation of progress and draws attention to the absence or incompleteness of newly reported data from Member States. If the proposal does not provide for sanctions, the compromise text on Article 6 by Mr Fitzsimons and the Commission is, in his view, the best way forward. Mr Fitzsimons hopes that Members will be able to support these compromise amendments.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lange </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, any agreement on CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions is of course meaningless without a sensible monitoring mechanism. We have to be able to check compliance with what has been agreed. Otherwise, we can agree or negotiate whatever we like, but without a monitoring mechanism it means nothing. That is why we need to get to work as quickly as possible on creating a consistent monitoring mechanism for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission submitted its proposal on 4 September 1996, so we have been discussing this for nearly three years. I think this is disgraceful when you think of all the developments since then and the urgent need to make progress on climate protection. That is why I am anxious that there should not be any further delay, and that we should be in a position to implement this directive as quickly as possible. Nevertheless, I do have a few reservations, especially because subsequent developments have meant that some aspects of the international negotiations on CO<span class="sub">2</span> reduction have not been taken into account yet. Nowadays, we are no longer negotiating about whether and by how many percent CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions should be reduced. No‐one is disputing that any more. The negotiations are now about whether emissions can be traded and in what framework. That has not been included here yet, so to that extent this legislation needs to be developed further. And of course to do that we also need a framework guaranteeing the democratic rights of Parliament. The Council's amendment of Article 8 is arguably so substantial that we ought to consider, in accordance with Rule 62 of our Rules of Procedure, whether this debate should continue at all.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we should finally get this sorted out here and now, so that we at least have an instrument that would enable us to make progress and set up a monitoring system. So I do not advocate going down that particular road. However, in view of developments in the CO<span class="sub">2</span> debate, and given the issue of Parliament's democratic participation, I would like to put two questions to you here in the House, Commissioner, and I would also ask you to reply to these two questions in the House.</p>
<p class="contents">The first question is about comitology. Article 8 provides for a specific regulatory committee. However, even if our amendment is accepted, the Commission alone will bear responsibility for further development. So my first question is whether the Commission can assure us that Parliament will be kept informed about agreements reached in this committee and about further development, both promptly and in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in view of the need for further development of monitoring systems, can the Commission assure us that a new amendment to this directive will be brought forward, and that in particular flexible mechanisms for emissions trading will be covered in this new version?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schleicher </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Lange has just mentioned that if we want to achieve objectives, we also need to produce proof. It is intended that in order to counteract the greenhouse effect the level of emissions recorded in 1990 should not be exceeded. It is of course because of carbon dioxide, that is CO<span class="sub">2</span> , and other greenhouse gases that, as the experts have it, warming is occurring. Admittedly, looking outside, it does not seem to be getting warmer, quite the opposite. Nevertheless, you know that the seasons vary quite dramatically and that overall there will probably be a warming effect here. That is why there has been a call at global level for each region to make its own contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only say that this version of the directive as it stands in the common position also fully reflects the wishes of my group. Various amendments proposed by Parliament have already been accepted, but now there are more. I would like to ask Commissioner Bjerregaard if she is able to accept the committee's amendments. This is important for us, because we believe that our amendments make for greater precision.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to repeat that we believe this system gives us a reliable basis for preparing further legislative action, as without this overview we are really fishing in the dark. We will only be able to ensure that we have reliable data once effective measuring and monitoring systems come into force.</p>
<p class="contents">Important decisions have been taken at international level since the first reading, and these have been picked up in the common position. For example, the European Union's greenhouse gas monitoring system has been adapted to the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol. This legislation therefore has an important part to play in implementing European climate protection policy. I believe that Europe is really well ahead of other parts of the world in this field. This also applies to the reporting requirements of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which stipulate that a body of data is required and that we cannot examine results until we have this data.</p>
<p class="contents">So I must say that the work done by Parliament in conjunction with the Commission and the Council has been a success. I hope that we will be able to complete it as soon as possible, and that there will be no more delays, as it is important for Europe to set a good example.</p>

Monitoring CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions is very important in ensuring that the commitments given in the Kyoto Protocol are met. It serves a dual purpose, evaluating progress made in reducing greenhouse gases and also in fulfilling commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the European Commission"s proposal to extend the monitoring of emissions beyond the year 2000. It is also useful to extend the monitoring system to include anthropogenic emissions and reductions. Nevertheless, it will remain very difficult to monitor greenhouse gases, where a staggering number of factors are involved in determining emissions and concentrations. This system for monitoring CO<span class="sub">2 </span> emissions is therefore very much a first attempt and we should have no illusions about this.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much support the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Kronberger </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the debate on reducing greenhouse gases is like a never‐ending story. Everyone talks about it, and everyone is convinced that it must happen, but when it comes to actually implementing it the picture is not so rosy. Both reports are helpful steps in the right direction, but we need to be clear about what is fundamentally at stake here. The amount of CO<span class="sub">2</span> emitted every day world‐wide is equivalent to the total amount for the 3 000 years before the industrial revolution. If we extrapolate this figure to a whole year, we find that this corresponds to a period of 1 million years for every year. In other words, every year we are releasing as much CO<span class="sub">2</span> as was previously released in a million years of the world's history. And these are scientific results.</p>
<p class="contents">No one can predict precisely how long the earth's atmosphere can sustain this, or what the long‐term consequences will be. No one disputes that the effects are already perceptible now. The important thing is for the reduction targets to be met as quickly as possible. In this context, the amendments to the Hautala report tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection are crucial. Technically speaking, it is certainly quite feasible to bring the measures forward by two to four years.</p>
<p class="contents">People often recommend switching from oil and coal to natural gas as a way of achieving the Kyoto objectives, but this is not a real solution. It is true that compared with oil and coal, less CO<span class="sub">2</span> is released during direct combustion of natural gas, but large quantities of methane escape at the exploration stage. At the same time, an enormous amount of power is consumed in transporting energy from Siberia or Algeria to Europe. The former Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs and current President of Georgia, Edvard Shevardnadze, has admitted that up to 50 % of methane gas transported escapes into the atmosphere. These considerations also need to be taken into account if total greenhouse gases are to be correctly calculated.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4 in the Fitzsimons report, which delete the words ‘as far as possible', are particularly important. Those Member States with no particular interest in reducing greenhouse gases could use these three words to avoid meeting their obligations in full.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Graenitz </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I do not have very much to add to the previous speakers' remarks. I would like to ask Mr Hyland to convey my congratulations to Mr Fitzsimons on his report, particularly because of the way he has highlighted essential points and cut out irrelevant detail.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to add one further point about measurement being necessary if we are to establish precisely where reductions in emissions need to be made first and in what way, and how we can then check whether objectives are being achieved. Once we have adopted this legislation, applicant countries will have to adopt it as common legislation during their preparations for accession, enabling them to bring their strategy more into line with EU strategy at an early stage and to use the same measurement techniques as the existing Member States. This means that on accession they can be assimilated seamlessly into the European emission reduction strategy for achieving the Kyoto objectives. This is something I attach great importance to.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that we cannot achieve everything we are now discussing about flexible mechanisms without precise measurement both within the European Union and world‐wide. In this context I would like to remind you that the flexible mechanism most successfully implemented so far, both for the environment and for industry, namely the reduction in CO<span class="sub">2 </span> emissions by US industry, has worked because penalties applied if obligations entered into were not met within the relevant time frame. I wonder if we should not consider something like this in the European Union, especially given that Member States do not always report their figures, data and reductions to the Commission on time, so that the Commission's reports to the Parliament are delayed and it is not clear why this is happening. I think we would all very much welcome it if it were possible to monitor from the outset what measurements are being taken, what efforts Member States are making and what needs to be done to coordinate those efforts in order to achieve the Kyoto objectives.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bjerregaard, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DA)</span> Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the Environment Committee and Mr Hyland, who spoke on behalf of the rapporteur, Mr Fitzsimons. I would like to thank Parliament for the work that has been done, and for the attention that has been devoted to this proposal. We all know that, after the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol, it is extremely important to have a clear and effective monitoring mechanism for CO<span class="sub">2</span> and other greenhouse gases. There is an obvious link between such a mechanism and the Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">Compliance with the Kyoto obligations is of course the most important aspect, if we want to show that our action has a real effect in moderating climate change. Having said that, I recognise that the present proposal for an amendment to Decision No 389/93 on a monitoring mechanism does not cover all the elements in the Kyoto Protocol. Several speakers have drawn attention to this. There are for example no provisions on how the mechanisms are to be monitored. There are good reasons for that. To begin with, it must be remembered that the Commission presented its original proposal to the Council in September 1996, in other words a long time before the Kyoto summit, and it is true, as Mr Lange said, that much has happened since then.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly – and this is perhaps more important – the principles, rules and guidelines that govern these mechanisms have not yet been laid down at international level. If we look at the Buenos Aires Plan of Action, they must be laid down within two years from now at COP VI. The Commission's stance has always been clear in this respect. As soon as we have greater clarity on how these flexible arrangements are to operate, we will present a new decision on monitoring which will cover this key aspect of the Protocol, and it is clear that we will continue to be active in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the amendments are concerned, let me say that the Commission can support all those which have been tabled. Mr Lange put one or two specific questions to me. One was about further proposals. Certainly there will be some. I expect to have a new communication ready in the spring, which was also mentioned at the recent part‐session in Brussels. And as regards contact with Parliament, quite clearly that is important. It was important in connection with the progress which we made in Kyoto and Buenos Aires. In Brussels we spoke about the need to improve cooperation with the European Parliament, not least in connection with the forthcoming COP negotiations. Whatever happens, I will certainly play my part in ensuring that Parliament is actively involved in our continued work.</p>
