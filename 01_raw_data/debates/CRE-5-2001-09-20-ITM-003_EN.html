<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Coelho (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, cooperation under Schengen started in 1985 between five Member States. The idea was to abolish internal borders so as to allow the free movement of persons and to adopt compensatory measures, including measures concerning police cooperation, the fight against drugs, extradition and the creation of the Schengen Information System. All the Member States now belong to Schengen, although the United Kingdom and Ireland only partially participate. In addition, two non-member countries also participate, namely Iceland and Norway, which belong to the Nordic Passport Union. With the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Schengen acquis has been integrated into the treaties and there has been a communitarisation of certain third pillar issues, which have been transferred to the Community pillar. This applies, for example, to visas, asylum, immigration and judicial cooperation on civil matters.</p>
<p class="contents">In the process of preparing this report, I had to deal with a number of issues which I would like to see resolved as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these is extension to include the remaining Member States. Whilst welcoming the extension of the Schengen area, the European Parliament regrets the fact that it has not been sufficiently well informed or even formally consulted on the changes that have taken place in this area. We see the partial participation of the United Kingdom and Ireland, which we regard as a positive development, as being a provisional situation and a step towards full participation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is a lack of transparency. Everyone hoped that the integration of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> would lead to a considerable improvement in transparency. However, the results have been disappointing. To be precise, the <span class="italic">acquis</span> was published late and not in full, and, paradoxically, the European Parliament now receives less information on Schengen than it used to receive when Schengen was of a clearly intergovernmental nature.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is the issue of the integration of the <span class="italic">acquis </span>in the treaties. This could have facilitated significant progress, but it has had a chaotic and incoherent impact, partly due perhaps to the power of initiative conferred on the Member States. On the other hand, due to the restrictive interpretation of the treaty provisions by the Council, Parliament has been unable, under the third pillar, to participate more fully in the legislative process.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, there is what I might call the ‘perversion of Schengen’. Article 2(2) allows any Member State to unilaterally re-impose internal border controls for reasons of public order or national security. This has already been put into practice by France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, and most recently by Italy. We are not opposed to what might be called ‘safety valves’. We are all aware, especially at present, that greater freedom has to be matched by greater security. However, it has to be said that the absence of a legal framework making clear under what conditions and in what terms this article can be invoked makes this a real blank cheque. Accordingly, bearing in mind the scoreboard, I urge the Commission to bring forward a formal proposal including legislative provisions relating to prior agreement by the Council, approval for a limited period, a requirement for proportionality, and conditions for extending the period.</p>
<p class="contents">My fifth point concerns Schengen cooperation and police cooperation. Schengen cooperation is distinct from police cooperation, with the development of Europol being a separate matter. However, these two sets of legislative provisions, which are considered in isolation and which lend greater weight to the issue of the confidentiality of documents, mean that the area of criminal matters and security has become even less transparent and more confusing for the public. As part of the third pillar, parliamentary and judicial checks on increased cooperation between the Member States are still inadequate and need to be reinforced.</p>
<p class="contents">My sixth point is the extension of the Schengen area to the candidate countries. This extension will significantly change the shape of Europe and the new Member States will become responsible for controlling the thousands of kilometres of new external borders of the European Union. The process of checking compliance with Schengen has taken a considerable amount of time for the existing Member States. I therefore believe that a two-phase approach is required: the first stage being the acceptance of the <span class="italic">acquis </span>upon joining the Union, and the second stage being full implementation of the <span class="italic">acquis</span>, with borders being lifted as soon as circumstances allow.</p>
<p class="contents">The seventh point is the Schengen Information System, the SIS. The SIS is the biggest database in Europe and the first experiment in terms of a large-scale exchange of sensitive data at international level. In practice, it is hoped that in the long term it will become a European information system. The SIS cannot continue to be managed secretly on a purely intergovernmental basis. Instead it should be managed on a Community basis, with the task of managing it being entrusted to an independent agency over which this Parliament should have a control function; it should be financed from the EU budget and provision should be made for a Community information system, which by keeping the data separate, could contain data collected under various agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to conclude by thanking all those fellow Members who have assisted with the preparation of this report, and in particular Mrs Van Lancker for her help with the various compromise amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hannan (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, the United Kingdom is largely outside the provisions of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span>. The policy of the British Conservatives towards Schengen is therefore rather like our policy towards the euro. We wish our neighbours and allies well, but it is not our businesses to tell them how to run initiatives which we have no intention of joining ourselves. Accordingly, as is becoming traditional on these occasions, my party will be abstaining.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another matter which is becoming traditional on these occasions. No report on Schengen is complete without a ritual complaint about the failure of the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic to take part. Thus, in Mr Coelho's otherwise admirable report, we have paragraph 2, which in a somewhat brusque tone calls on those two states to abolish their border controls.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament has repeatedly expressed the viewed, echoed by Commissioner Vitorino, that the UK opt-out is illegal under the terms of the Single European Act. I believe that this is legally flawed, but that is not my point today. My point rather, is that by persistently seeking to challenge a derogation which was clearly understood by all sides at the time, this Parliament is acting in bad faith. It is worth recalling the circumstances in which the Schengen Accord was built into the treaties. That decision, like all treaty changes, required unanimity. Without the consent of the United Kingdom, Schengen would have had to continue to exist within a separate legal framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The British government took the view that if other states wished to go ahead on their own using the institutions and mechanisms of the European Communities then it was not Britain's place to hinder them. Accordingly, it allowed the other states to push ahead within the treaties, but only subject to a clear guarantee that the UK's own border controls would not be affected. That guarantee was written in black and white into the Amsterdam Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">No sooner had Amsterdam come into force however, than the European Commission and Parliament began to question the opt-out. Not for the first time, the UK had allowed other states to use the common procedures of the European treaties only for those states promptly to start clamouring for Britain's inclusion. As with Schengen, so with the social chapter and so with economic and monetary union – in all three cases Britain consented to a new EU initiative on the clear understanding that it would not be affected, only for its derogation later to be disputed. This surely is no way for the Union to proceed. After all if opt-outs are no longer legally reliable, the only alternative is a rather more promiscuous use of the national veto and that I submit would be even more objectionable to the integrationist majority in this House than it is to me. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Lancker (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to congratulate Mr Coelho warmly on his sterling report and thank him in turn, on behalf of my group, for the sound cooperation. What should really have been an annual debate on the implementation of the Schengen cooperation is today being afforded added topical value in the light of the Council of Ministers for Justice and for the Interior debating European measures to combat international terrorism. Nobody will deny that Schengen could play a role in this.</p>
<p class="contents">I shudder at the thought that appeals such as those during yesterday’s sitting could be made by the Right, to put a definitive stop to the free movement of people and to put Big Brother-like mechanisms into place. The Schengen discussion in my group has always sought to strike the necessary but difficult balance between the right to free movement of people, respect for the principles of the rule of law and human rights and the right to safety via police and judicial cooperation, and I should like to keep it that way.</p>
<p class="contents">However, despite the fact that Schengen has now been in existence for six years as a predecessor to the area of freedom, security and justice, we have to observe on the basis of Mr Coelho’s report that many aspects leave a great deal to be desired. I should like to list three.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, although Schengen exists, we have to observe that there is still no effective police cooperation and no effective exchange of intelligence which could yield major results in the fight against organised crime. In fact, the annual report states that there is a marked improvement, but the question is whether the right areas are being prioritised. To put it bluntly, is the Schengen intelligence system being put to actual use in the fight against international crime and terrorism, as defined in the UN Convention? Does it not mainly serve as an intelligence system to combat unwanted migration? Please allow me to put this question to you again in today’s climate.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Schengen does, however, appear to be used in the framework of demonstrations on the occasion of European and international summits. No Democrat will object to the fact that trouble-makers who come to cause havoc are arrested. But the way in which peaceful protesters are being arrested via internal border controls and the exchange of intelligence on the basis of the Schengen Information System is really a bridge too far for anyone who is in favour of freedom of expression.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, police cooperation and the exchange of intelligence require proper monitoring by the legal systems and parliaments. That is where Schengen really takes things too far. It even goes so far that the Council has decided not to publish any more reports, since Schengen now supposedly forms part of the European <span class="italic">acquis</span>, as if Schengen ceases to exist as a result. In any event, my group would like to see Schengen in fact replaced by transparent, democratically controlled European rules but, in anticipation of this, we want the European Parliament, in tandem with national parliaments, to monitor Schengen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, for over 20 years now, association activists and many elected representatives have been advocating a citizens’ Europe that demonstrates solidarity and is open not only to goods and capital but also and above all to persons.</p>
<p class="contents">For one brief moment, we had faith in the hope that was born in Schengen, a hope that was virtually suffocated at birth by intolerance, a failure of courage and a lack of calm political analysis. If Schengen represents a considerable step forward for Europe because of the progress made in certain areas, including police and judicial cooperation, it has to be said now that this step forward is a halting and discriminatory one. Although the Schengen Convention has come into force in its entirety in several Member States, there are still inequalities that affect persons who do not hold a European nationality or have the necessary papers, although certain persons or members of their family may have lived in Europe for very many years. Some Member States do not grant the same rights to everyone resident in their country, even if they all accept the same responsibilities. On top of this, we have an immigration and asylum policy that varies from one country to another, differing procedures and controls and repressive police practices leading to dramatic situations in human terms such as those we are now witnessing at Sangatte in the north of France. At the very heart of Europe, in the Channel Tunnel, thousands of men, women and children are risking their lives every day in an attempt to enter the United Kingdom. These people, while awaiting their journey, are concentrated in a reception centre in humanely unacceptable conditions supported only by humanitarian organisations without any power or means at their disposal, such as the Red Cross. These practices bring back some bitter memories. The political authorities still treat refugees and asylum-seekers with coldness, hypocrisy and intolerance. This is unacceptable in the wake of the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Just imagine that police officers have even dared to fire real bullets at asylum seekers! In fact you do not have to imagine it, because other police forces in Europe have already done it. These facts are continuing to discredit our parliaments in the eyes of thousands of members of the public who are calling for a halt to inequality, to injustice and to a Fortress Europe policy.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, we will be voting against this report, which overlooks all these facts and fails to offer any alternative. Instead, we should act together, as a matter of urgency, to find concrete and equitable solutions to all these dramatic situations, and in particular to the sufferings of the refugees at Sangatte, and to the cries of distress from all those who come to Europe seeking asylum and help. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today’s report on crossing external borders and the development of Schengen cooperation and yesterday’s proposal from the Commission are really two sides of the same coin. As a Danish professor of criminal law expressed it very clearly yesterday, the alarming thing is that ‘the EU Commission and other institutions are merely using the attacks in the United States as an opportunity to promote far-reaching harmonisation, and harmonisation means that the national traditions of criminal law, criminal procedure and police investigation are eliminated in favour of arrangements adopted in more or less of a panic that make controls more stringent and damage civic rights’. He also says: ‘Politicians feel they must demonstrate their power to take action, but there is no point at all in harmonising criminal legislation in the EU. That will not, in any case, reduce the number of terrorist acts by so much as one.’ That was the message.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s report will quickly be overtaken by events which take place long after the report has seen the light of day. The question underlying every political decision is that of whether we are thereby advancing our aims and, secondly, that of whether the means employed will compromise these aims. I am afraid that the answer to the first question is: ‘No, we shall not achieve the declared aims’, and that all experience goes to show that the answer to the second question, of whether the means will compromise the ends, is unfortunately ‘yes’. The controls will be harmful, and anyone who cares to read the Supervisory Board’s report for 1998-99 and subsequent statements on the lack of supervision of the Schengen authorities will acknowledge that I am right. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Please allow me to focus on those border regions of the Union which, like Andalusia, most vividly experience the arrival of dozens of people each day.</p>
<p class="contents">Andalusia, owing to its geographical proximity to the Maghreb, is enduring great migratory pressure without having the appropriate instruments for confronting it. The Spanish administration has publicly acknowledged that the situation is unsustainable and, furthermore, bilateral relations with the Maghreb and the Kingdom of Morocco are difficult at the moment due to problems related to fishing, drug-trafficking and illegal immigration itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of us have been arguing for years that, within the framework of the Schengen Agreement, the special status of border regions such as Andalusia should be recognised and that these areas of the European Union should be provided with instruments which would allow them to deal with the arrival of these immigrants more effectively. They should also be given the power to propose measures to the central government and to the European Union relating to work, residence and the necessary social integration of people who are forced to emigrate across the Straits of Gibraltar to reception regions such as Andalusia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report on crossing external borders and the development of Schengen cooperation touches on a subject at the very heart of the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice. In fact Schengen is a rather special animal. On the one hand it guarantees freedom of movement, which is a key part of the Treaty, and on the other hand it responds to the need to encompass this freedom within a solid and coherent policy of external border controls and other compensatory measures. However, the integration of Schengen into the EU framework in practice marked the end of that agreement, although it lives on as a symbol. Schengen was created as a kind of test laboratory for the implementation of the absolute obligation laid down in the Single European Act. Schengen has subsequently been divided up and integrated into the framework of the Union, and the legislative provisions of the Community and of the Union are gradually replacing and developing the Schengen Convention and other decisions relating to it.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of example, the joint manual and joint consular instructions have become regulations, and new proposals under the third pillar complement or replace the equivalent provisions of the Schengen Convention, which have been assigned to this pillar. Furthermore, in July the Commission submitted to the Council and Parliament a proposal bringing together in a single legal instrument the five categories of persons who can move freely within an uncontrolled area, thus following up the wish expressed by the European Parliament to bring together the various disparate provisions governing the movement of persons. The Commission accordingly intends to bring forward a proposal relating to Article 2 of the Schengen Protocol, so as to better encompass the safeguard clause on the reintroduction of internal border controls. This work has not been completed, but the objective is to ‘Amsterdamise’ Schengen in the near future. Mr President, that is why I think it would be difficult to embark upon an exercise which would involve regular reports on Schengen, because these would end up being reports on the various instruments that have replaced or are in the process of replacing Schengen. But I can commit the Commission to continuing to keep Parliament regularly informed of developments in this field, which for the sake of semantic convenience we will call Schengen.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, Parliament is kept informed of overall legislative and practical activity by means of the scoreboard created following the Tampere Council, which is regularly updated. The Commission considered that the conversion of the Schengen acquis should be based on priority needs depending on the development of the situation and political guidance from the Council and Parliament. One of these priorities is of course the development of the Schengen Information System, and of course also, and this will be of great interest to you, issues relating to the candidate countries. The rapporteur has taken these concerns on board and the Commission certainly shares them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to give you some information on the most recent developments concerning the Schengen Information System, SIS II. As you know, the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 28 and 29 May did not reach unanimous agreement on intergovernmental finance. It was therefore agreed to provide financing from the Community budget. Furthermore, the Belgian Presidency and Sweden presented two initiatives, one on the first pillar and the other on the third pillar, with a view to giving the Commission, assisted by a committee, responsibility for developing SIS II between 2002 and 2006. The key objective of these two proposals, which are currently being considered by the Council, is first of all to provide a legal basis for the financing of this stage of development. Secondly, legislative proposals are to be presented on the various key aspects of SIS II, in particular the issue of management and functionality. In the context of its responsibility for financing, the Commission will also present a communication covering the various aspects of SIS II, that is to say legal, technical and financial issues, but also the various preparatory stages needed, and also the general method to be adopted until SIS II is finally established.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Mr Coelho, I wish to conclude by assuring you that your resolution will be taken into account by the Commission in assessing the efforts already made and those that remain to be made and in defining its priorities for action in the Schengen field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
