<p class="contents">I should like to inform colleagues in the House that over the past several weeks I have been making intensive political visits to a number of the capital cities of the countries whose Finance Ministers, at Ecofin, had sought to enter through the back door and remove from Parliament the delicate balance we had negotiated through the Convention. This is an area where we, as an institution, need – to borrow a phrase – to 'put down some red lines'.</p>
<p class="contents">This is important for this Parliament, not for corporate reasons. It goes to the very heart of the role of parliamentary democracy, of representative democracy and of public accountability. The power of the purse has been a key defining issue in the history of parliamentarianism as it has evolved and we cannot countenance in this Parliament any institution by going backwards in the name of European progress for tomorrow.</p>

<p class="contents">I feel I must begin by reiterating that the overall approach of the Italian Presidency remains that which my government has expressed many times in this House and in the context of the IGC itself. We remain convinced that an ambitious agreement which meets the needs and expectations of an enlarged Europe can only be achieved by a text which strays as little as possible from the Convention's draft.</p>
<p class="contents">Periodic meetings with Parliament and with representatives of the national parliaments, as well as requests arriving from various European civil society structures, are confirmation of this conviction. Some Member States within the Intergovernmental Conference seem, at times, to want to take a different direction and to be seeking to reopen the debate on many aspects of the Convention’s draft. I would, however, like to express a tentatively positive view in this regard. For the legitimate purposes of negotiation tactics, some countries are maintaining reserved positions and insist on requesting changes – some of them substantial – to the balance achieved by the Convention. Nevertheless, no Member State has called into question the objective – which is also an imperative political need – of bringing the Intergovernmental Conference to a successful conclusion within the timeframe suggested at Thessaloniki and confirmed at Brussels in October by our Heads of State and Government. The very way the IGC is progressing is confirmation, moreover, of the intrinsic value of the Convention’s draft: we have observed, on almost all the points discussed thus far, that a revisionist approach seeking to amend the Convention’s draft text does not lead to consensus on alternative solutions but just widens the gaps between opposing positions. It is my opinion, therefore, that, as we enter the final straits of the negotiations, each country will recognise the common benefits of an ambitious constitutionalisation of the integration process, despite the minor, specific sacrifices that some provisions may involve.</p>
<p class="contents">During yesterday's meeting, we debated, in particular, the role of the Union Foreign Minister and the issue of the revision of the Constitutional Treaty, taking note as well of a number of recommendations from the Danish government concerning the protocol relating to the opt-out clauses by which that country benefits with regard to Justice and Home Affairs. The first point had already been addressed in previous meetings of the IGC. The Presidency decided, therefore, to present a number of specific proposals based on the following principles: preserving the ‘double-hat’ formula devised by the Convention, with the clarification that the independence of the Commission Vice-President/Foreign Minister concerns the aspects associated with their Commission responsibilities and does not concern Council activities (for example, implementation of the common foreign and security policy and the Presidency of the General Affairs and External Relations Council); specifying the implications for the Foreign Minister in the event that the European Parliament were to adopt a motion of censure against the Commission; laying down explicitly that the President of the Commission cannot call for the resignation of the Vice-President/Foreign Minister without the agreement of the European Council; strengthening the provision giving the Vice-President/Foreign Minister the responsibility of ensuring consistency between the CFSP and the Union's external relations.</p>
<p class="contents">The presentation<span class="bold"> </span>of these points – fully in keeping with the approach defined by the Convention – was welcomed by many Member States. Of significance is the fact that the Presidency's proposals are headed in the right direction, including for those delegations hostile to the Convention’s text. Clearly, a definitive agreement on the duties of the future Foreign Minister cannot be taken out of the context of the agreement on the overall future institutional framework of the Union. This is a matter to which we will return in the context of the Ministerial Conclave of 28-29 November and, subsequently, in the concluding session of the IGC at the level of Heads of State and Government.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution envisaged by the Convention for future revision of the Constitutional Treaty is based on two fundamental principles: the need for unanimous adoption and ratification for the formal revision of all the constitutional provisions, and the existence of <span class="italic">passerelles</span>, both general and specific, that, in clearly defined sectors, allow voting rules to be changed, to make the transition from unanimous to qualified majority voting, or the legislative procedure to be changed, moving from special to ordinary, which ensures absolute parity between the Council and the European Parliament, subject to the common agreement of all Member States in the European Council, consultation of the European Parliament and prior notification of the national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency has proposed some adjustments to these mechanisms defined by the Convention, in order both to increase the involvement of the national parliaments in the process of activating the escalator clauses and to confirm the option of making the procedure for revising the Constitutional text less unwieldy with regard to a limited number of specific sections of the third part of the Constitutional Treaty. Indeed, as Parliament has rightly pointed out, the procedure laid down by the Convention seems excessively rigid and is in danger of making the enlarged Union incapable of updating its own constitutional regulations even where minor provisions are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday's exchange of views confirmed that positions remain divergent on this point. Nevertheless, we must persevere in our efforts to find common ground for an agreement which, taking the Convention <span class="italic">acquis</span> as a starting point, reconciles the need for timely, effective involvement of the parliaments, essential for democratic legitimacy in a Union of States and citizens governed by the rule of the law, with the need to prevent rigidity in revision procedures that could impede the future development of a Union which now has a large number of Members.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of yesterday's meeting, the Danish Foreign Minister drew the Conference's attention to the question of the Protocol governing the participation of Denmark in the Union's Justice and Home Affairs activities. Indeed, the new structure of the Constitutional Treaty – which leaves behind the dysfunctional, outdated pillar structure – requires the revision of this Protocol, which was drawn up when judicial cooperation in criminal and police matters was still subject to intergovernmental procedures. On the basis of the recommendations of the Danish government, in the next few days, we will draft an updated version of the Protocol that will have to fulfil a number of key requirements: adequate adaptation of the present ‘opt-out’ system to the legal framework that emerges from the Constitutional Treaty; the option for the Danish government to adopt an ‘opt-in’ formula in future on the basis of its own constitutional rules; compatibility of the Protocol with the pursuit of effective Union action in the field of justice and home affairs, to which the Convention text rightly attributed central importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are on the eve of the decisive phase of the negotiations underway in the Intergovernmental Conference. In the forthcoming Naples Conclave, the Presidency will be presenting the text of the draft Constitutional Treaty reviewed by the group led by the Council’s Legal Service with the input of all the Member States, the European Parliament and the Commission. This impressive legal fine-tuning operation has produced an excellent result, improving the overall editorial quality of the Constitutional text as compared with the content approved by the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Again in Naples, the Presidency will submit a comprehensive proposal on the points which are still causing dispute in the constitutional negotiations in an effort to bring the positions of the Member States closer together. The basis for this action will, in any case, remain adherence to the Convention’s draft, which may be adapted, supplemented, clarified and elucidated, where necessary, but which can on no account be rewritten. I would like to stress here, on behalf of my government, our determination to avoid watered-down compromises and to seek high-minded, noble solutions which are worthy of the democratic, open and transparent dialogue which took place in the Convention. We are aware that the task we will have to carry out between now and the deadline of 12-13 December is sensitive and complex. However, we have faith in the ability of Member States’ governments to meet the European citizens’ expectations of a more cohesive, authoritative and inclusive Europe: the expectations that Parliament has succeeded in interpreting so effectively, first in the Convention and then in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference, in which it has been fully involved.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>.<span class="italic"> </span><span class="italic"></span><span class="italic"> (DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission views the progress of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference with a feeling of growing concern and disquiet. It is, of course, normal for the shape of a genuine compromise not to emerge until fairly late on in an intergovernmental conference, but what is not normal is for us to have an Intergovernmental Conference at which every meeting throws up more questions than it answers. The Commission totally shares the view often heard in public debate that the very success of the Intergovernmental Conference is now at stake. I support the observations of the Italian Presidency. The IGC is now moving into a crucial phase, and one thing is quite clear: we need to prevent the overall compromise worked out by the Convention from being damaged in a tug of war between the interests of individual Member States, and we need to protect the institutional balance arrived at over 16 months of debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you that there was a good reason why this draft Constitutional Treaty was worked out by a Convention, and not, as is usually the way, by a conference of diplomats and officials. It was the result of the shock caused by the Nice process. We need to be fully aware that we cannot steer a course towards a summit at which the Heads of State and Government once again sit together night after night nitpicking over the figures, only to achieve a result that they themselves find shocking.</p>
<p class="contents">We accepted the Treaty of Nice – and both Parliament and the Commission had reservations about it – because we needed it. We needed that treaty in order to bring the massive historical project of enlargement to a conclusion on time. I believe, however, that no one in this Chamber believes that the Treaty of Nice would be adequate to really make a European Union of 25 or 27 Member States genuinely viable. We all know that we need a better treaty, and that time is pressing. That is why the Commission is anxious for the work to be brought to a conclusion on time. The enlargement process will be completed by 1 May 2004, and by then we need to have reached political agreement on how we are to work together.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the work now ahead of us, as the Commission sees it the main issue is to maintain and defend the considerable progress represented by the draft Constitutional Treaty. In our view, the key progress made relates to the double majority, the introduction of the 50/60 rule, the extension of the use of majority voting, and giving the European Parliament a stronger role in the legislative process.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that overall the Constitutional Treaty represents a very carefully balanced compromise, each of the various sections in it must also be seen as striking a balance with its own internal logic, the details of which cannot be put at risk. With reference to the discussion at yesterday's meeting of Foreign Ministers and to the statement we have just heard from the Italian Presidency, I would like to make the dual role of the future EU Foreign Minister very clear. If we want to guarantee that the Union's foreign policy actions and its internal policies are coherent, it is essential for the EU Foreign Minister not only to have a mandate from the Council, but also, as Vice-President of the Commission, to be an integral part of the Commission, with full voting rights. A Foreign Minister with, as it were, guest status within the Commission cannot play the required role here. Any sort of special status for the Foreign Minister within the Commission would not sit well alongside his double legitimacy.</p>
<p class="contents">The finely balanced outcome of the Convention is also reflected in the three components of the Union's finances: own resources, multiannual financial framework, and the annual budget process. Anyone concerned about a successful outcome from the Intergovernmental Conference should be careful not to unpick these agreements again. In this area the Commission totally supports the idea that the Convention's draft also needs to be protected against the interests of those who see their national responsibilities as being pre-eminent, to put it very delicately.</p>
<p class="contents">The Italian Presidency referred to a very important point that I would like to specifically support, namely the simplified treaty amendment procedure. The Commission sees this as being essential.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union should not let itself be forced into a constitutional corset that could become too tight for it in just a few years' time. I believe that the Italian Presidency's proposals point in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to make one more comment about the political difficulties we will face if the Intergovernmental Conference reaches a successful conclusion, something we all hope for and support. We will then find ourselves in a situation in which a very far-reaching, very complicated and very fundamental treaty will have to be ratified in 25 Member States, and will have to overcome the hurdle of a referendum in a good many Member States. No one would be surprised if it proved quite difficult to clear this hurdle, particularly in the new Member States. We need to be aware of that.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to ask honourable Members to have some sympathy for the position of the new Member States in the Intergovernmental Conference, a position that sometimes attracts criticism. I hope you will understand that it has not been all that easy for the governments and parliaments of the new Member States, just a few weeks after successful referenda on membership of the European Union, with referendum campaigns based on the Treaty of Nice, to have to explain to their electorate now that the basic principles of their accession to the European Union are about to change again.</p>
<p class="contents">In saying that, I have the interests of my Polish friends in particular at heart, as they are adopting a very robust position on majority voting. It seems to me that there has been a misunderstanding during the public debate in Poland, to the effect that what is at stake is the relative importance of the individual Member States. That is not the case. The new arrangements are based on the principle that all the Member States are equal in status. A decision is only valid if it is supported by a majority of the Member States, which means that each and every Member State has the same rights, and that Poland has the same rights as all the others.</p>
<p class="contents">The second factor – the concept that this majority must also represent a majority of the population of the Union – provides the democratic legitimacy needed for such a process. The larger we become, the greater our responsibility will be, and the more important the substance of the decisions we have to take, the more necessary democratic legitimacy will be. That is the heart of the matter here. I hope that in the time remaining this point will influence the debate in Poland.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that in reaching a compromise it will ultimately have to be taken into account that this draft Constitutional Treaty has to be ratified in 25 countries. I am mentioning that with particular reference to the debate about the size and composition of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reassure this House that the Commission backs Parliament when it comes to translating the essential architecture and balance of the draft Constitutional Treaty into reality, and to achieving the correct relationship between the Community method and the sovereignty of the Member States, and between action at national level and the democratic legitimacy of the Community institutions.

I thank him for the leadership he has shown on behalf of the European Parliament through the work of the Convention and as our representative on the IGC. We deeply appreciate that work.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Second, Mr Méndez de Vigo recently tendered his resignation as Parliament's representative on the IGC. I was informed of that and I believe I did my duty correctly. I took that information to the Conference of Presidents. There, we exchanged views on what the response should be, and the Conference of Presidents – with an accord short of unanimity but nonetheless an accord – decided to appoint Mr Brok as Parliament's representative.</p>
<p class="contents">This was done transparently, in accordance with the procedures. Views not far removed from those you raised in your point of order, Mrs Berès, were expressed; there was a plurality of views at that Conference, and a plurality of positions as regards the different group leaders. Nonetheless, there was sufficient momentum to confirm the appointment of our colleague, Mr Brok, to that position on behalf of Parliament. I underline 'on behalf of Parliament'. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Brok (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="italic">– (DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that yesterday's meeting made it clear that agreement by December is achievable. I say that because ultimately there are only a few issues that are really controversial, and they are unlikely to be resolved next year either. We should therefore encourage the Italian Presidency to maintain its present course and to stick as closely as possible to the text produced by the Convention, because that text represents a balance that would be hard to replicate. The same also very much applies to the document to be presented in the ministerial conclave next week. I believe that subject to that condition there is a chance of bringing the IGC to a successful conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we need to recognise that opposing forces are still at work attempting to prevent this. That is something that we have already discussed here in connection with the Legislative Council. However, this House, too, has quite rightly taken a number of decisions this week about European budgetary rights, as you have pointed out, Mr President. In both cases – as regards the Legislative Council, which is to prevent any transparency and allow the national bureaucrats to carry on working as before, and as regards undermining Parliament's rights in relation to the budget – I am reminded of a series of films, the second of which is called "The Empire Strikes Back". The empire I am thinking of is the empire of national ministerial bureaucracies. In the third film in the series, good triumphs over evil, so there is a good chance that we can avert this danger. At the last but one meeting the Italian Presidency took the appropriate steps to safeguard our budgetary rights, and I hope that position will survive through to the end.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, one thing needs to be made very clear: both legislative bodies must meet in public; we owe that to Europe's citizens in the name of transparency. And it also has to be accepted that budgetary rights are the key rights of any parliament, and war will undoubtedly be declared if changes are made to those budgetary rights that are unacceptable to Parliament. I am sure that will also be borne in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are the so-called questions of power: voting rights in the Council, the composition of, and voting rights in, the Commission, and associated issues around the composition of the European Parliament. I am very conscious that this is probably something that the Heads of State and Government will be unable to sort out until the last night. However, there are a few issues we need to keep in mind, such as whether the threshold should be raised from 60 to 66, and other issues relating to the Commission. When it comes to overall willingness to compromise, there is one thing that should not be overlooked, and that is efficiency. It must be evident that the Council's ability to reach decisions in an enlarged Union must be guaranteed, and that is why the Convention proposed what it did, a fact that we must not lose sight of. We criticised the Treaty of Nice because we considered that the voting procedure in the Council was not adequate for an enlarged Union, and that must have been clear to our Polish friends from the outset, Mr Verheugen. People in the accession countries cannot now say that the details and mechanisms of the Treaty of Nice were presented in their referenda, and cite those as a source of legitimacy in the context of the discussions in the Intergovernmental Conference. If this is to succeed, efficiency must always be a priority, combined, of course, at all times with the required degree of democratic legitimacy. I sometimes worry deeply that many governments do not think, "How can the European Union achieve a majority for a required decision?" but rather "How easily can I block a decision?" That kind of thinking is a cause for concern, and we should try to resolve this.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the office of Foreign Minister, which was mentioned at our last sitting, I would like to point out that we are talking about a triple role, and not just a double one. The Foreign Minister would wear three hats: Member of the Commission, High Representative of the Council and President of the Council. All three need to be combined if this is to work. This House would not be happy about an arrangement whereby he was not a full Member of the Commission. It is extraordinarily important for him to be a full Member of the Commission, because only in that way is it possible to achieve true democratic control and a democratic appointment procedure, and the legitimacy which this House confers. Nor do we wish to see the Commission losing any of its foreign policy influence, if full responsibility is not given here for the area for which it is currently responsible, which would also mean Parliament indirectly losing responsibility in this area. For that reason we shall be lobbying hard for these three aspects to be interlinked. The Foreign Minister must also preside over the Council of Foreign Ministers, because only in that way can we simultaneously achieve coherence and continuity, and because only then will it really make sense to create this position in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to make a comment about the review clause. I would like to remind you that the proposal put forward in the letter from Mr Amato, Mr Duff and myself should in fact be addressed again. There should be an opening, with the exception of the "Changes in Competence" and "Charter of Fundamental Rights" areas, which must, of course, continue to be covered by the existing procedure. However, we should remember something that was considered in the Convention: a review clause with opening and at the same time a secession clause. The only thing now outstanding is the secession clause, and I think that something is amiss here, and that we still need to consider that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To put it clearly, what you want is for the text not to be touched. Amongst other things, it cannot be touched: if 80% are in agreement and then there are 150 amendments which are not supported by a sufficient majority, your duty is to maintain it. Furthermore, we must remember the governments that were present and participated in the Convention. The problem is that they have now locked the doors and left Parliament and the Commission outside.</p>
<p class="contents">The members of the Convention from the Socialist family met last week and we reached the conclusion that we do not want any backtracking in relation to the Convention. We expect there to be progress and improvements – we agree on that – and our priorities are: firstly, that the binding nature of the Charter of Fundamental Rights should not be called into question; that the secular nature of European integration is a founding principle, and, in this regard, we believe that the text of the Constitution is absolutely correct and must not be modified.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that the legislative powers, not only of Parliament but also of the Council, must not be weakened in the legislative field or in the budgetary field, and we believe that the legislative Council must be maintained. We also believe that the economic and social governance of the Union should be turned into a reality, which means that the progress made in the first part of the Constitution should be reflected in the third part, dedicated to the Union’s policies, and furthermore that the legal basis for the protection and development of public services must be maintained, and then it will be able to be enshrined in a framework law.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issues which you have pointed out and which were dealt with yesterday, the Foreign Minister must be a member and Vice-President of the Commission. With regard to the review, you yourself have said that the Danish Government – and Denmark was the home of Hamlet – after opting-out, wants to opt-in. We must not close doors; we must provide the possibility of review.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to an issue which was raised yesterday by President Prodi, which is highly topical, we believe, specifically with regard to the budgetary powers – and we address this to Ecofin – that it is time for Ecofin to have a Community culture. Perhaps we should give the Finance and Economics Ministers a copy of the Treaties. We cannot systematically act on an intergovernmental basis.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore I would like to stress that Parliament, with regard to the budget, is as responsible, or even more so, as the Council, and we have demonstrated this repeatedly. It is unacceptable to try to modify the Treaties by this means. I believe we should protest and demonstrate our indignation very clearly to Ecofin, which has taken ten years to accept the Delors plan for infrastructures. Why has this been paralysed for ten years? Why does Ecofin have power over the European Council? I believe that this issue is absolutely fundamental for all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will end by mentioning a topical issue, the issue of enlargement. I would agree with the comments of Commissioner Verheugen: I would say to our current members, because they are already here, that we voted for the Treaty of Nice in Parliament because we wanted enlargement, not because we liked the Treaty. We never liked the Treaty of Nice. But what we cannot now say is that France and Germany understand each other, after centuries of concern for Europeans because France and Germany were enemies. I believe that we should show the minimum of coherence.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commission to maintain its approach in order to demonstrate that nobody is privileged with regard to pacts, and I am referring to the Stability and Growth Pact. I believe, Mr President, that that message should be made absolutely clear to the Conference. Maintain your position so that we may have a Constitution for all Europeans.</p>

I thank you for your fight to save parliamentary prerogatives in the matter of the financial system.</p>
<p class="contents">On a personal note, I am most grateful for Mrs Berès' moral support. However, the Conference of Presidents has made a decision, which I accept, and I offer my full support to Mr Brok, whose work and qualities we know.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council presidency has confirmed its intention of presenting a global compromise before the 'conclave' meeting in Naples. One hopes that this is a wise decision. Experience would suggest that it is not at the level of foreign ministers, still less officials, that the final deal will be cut. The great patriotic questions that so obsess some of our Member States, such as a percentage point here or there on their voting weights in the Council, can only be resolved at 4 a.m. on Sunday, 14 December, by the top guys.</p>
<p class="contents">What the foreign ministers appear to be clever at is unpicking the essential ingredients of the Convention's proposals. Yesterday several of them challenged the famous <span class="italic">passerelle</span> clause, which permits the steady development of the Constitution and of a decrease in the number of exceptional, non-normal decision-making procedures. But there have been many previous examples of this <span class="italic">passerelle</span> approach in previous and existing Treaties. Therefore, their consolidation into a single general clause is clear, simple and straightforward. The presidency is quite right in standing firm on this issue and the issue of the Foreign Minister and defending the proposals from the Convention. It knows that the European Parliament is right behind it.</p>
<p class="contents">We also support the efforts of the presidency to open up the issue of the future revision clause. However, there can be no trade-off between the two, the <span class="italic">passerelle</span> clause and the softer revision procedures needed for a Constitution to work well and fluently in practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Presidency-in-Office of the Council has just reminded us of the main sticking points still remaining: the membership of the Commission, the duties of the Foreign Minister, the definition of the qualified majority in the Council, the role of the European Parliament in the budgetary procedure and the procedure for reviewing the Constitution. These are not minor issues. Some of them involve the distribution of powers between institutions and Member States, others involve the highly sensitive issue of national identities and others are aimed at not locking ourselves within almost unchangeable institutional structures.</p>
<p class="contents">Anybody who imagined that this type of friction would not arise in my opinion was guilty of a lack of realism. For my part, I am in no way surprised nor disturbed by these conflicts. If they were the only obstacles to be overcome in order to be able to celebrate the success of the Conference, then I would say, as the Italian Foreign Minister, Mr Frattini, has done in other places, that today we have a solution to 95% of the problems. Alas, that is not the case. Because there is clearly a dimension of this draft Constitution which appears to be as taboo for the Heads of State and Government as it was for the President of the Convention. They are the Union’s policies and, in particular, what I called on 3 September, on talking with Mr Giscard d'Estaing, the constitutionalisation of the liberal model or, to use another register, the establishment, in a fundamental law for the future Europe, of a genuine act of allegiance with NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union only has significance for the citizens by means of the implementation of its policies. It is not me who says this; it is the Commission, in its communication of 17 September on the Constitution. However there is never any questioning of the Union’s policies, which represent three quarters of the draft Treaty. Do you believe therefore that there is unanimity on this point within public opinion? That would clearly be foolish. I will perhaps make some of you laugh by referring, to this end, to the European social forum which has just taken place in the region of Paris. It would be a great mistake, therefore, to take an ironic or indifferent view of the appeal that has just been addressed to the Union. Hundreds of debates involving 50 000 young people from every part of Europe has demonstrated their thirst for knowledge, for understanding, for change and for concrete action, expressing, at the same time as totally rejecting the liberal model, a profound desire for Europe. How should we respond to this? In view of the continuation of all the Community acquis on the single market and of the Treaty of Maastricht, they will not be satisfied with a subparagraph 2 of Article 3 which promises paradise on earth. They call for genuine changes, and it is on this basis that large numbers of the public demonstrate their sympathy.</p>
<p class="contents">In certain countries, such as France, the debate, which did not exist until 3 September, when we raised right here the problem of the hidden face of the draft Constitution – which you have mentioned, Mr President – has continued to spread and deepen ever since. To the extent that there are numerous observers in these countries who do not rule out the possibility of a victory for the ‘no’ in the event of the ratification of the Treaty by means of a referendum. As a general rule, you will tell me, we have not reached that point. For the moment calm still reigns within public opinion in numerous countries. Well! Should we rejoice at this? We should not trust still waters. The silent unease of today risks creating landslides in the elections of tomorrow. I much prefer a rather disordered response, though showing generosity and solidarity, and without any chance of things become worse.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I would like, on behalf of my group, to appeal to those of you who shared this approach. Europe has for too long been built from the top. That is no longer the case today. We must demand vigorously that the calls from our societies be heard and taken seriously. We have little time left to react and give sense to the European project in the eyes of our citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

National governments took part in the Convention’s public discussions and have rubberstamped the end result. Now, however, safely behind the IGC’s closed doors, they feel free again to modify the outcome. For example, there is an amendment that aims to change the annual budget procedure so that the lowest amount will automatically apply in respect of budget items on which the Council and Parliament have failed to reach agreement. The Dutch Government is justifying this by stating that in so doing, the Council and Parliament become equal, for indeed, whoever suggests the lowest amount, then that amount is final. At the same time, the Dutch Government claims, with a straight face, that it is fighting for Parliament’s full budgetary rights. One of two things could be at work here. Either the ministers do not understand the implications of their proposal and are therefore not that intelligent, or else they are trying to fog this issue to such an extent that they need not give public account for destroying Parliament’s democratic right to reject the budget, a right that has obtained for almost thirty years. In which case they are leading everybody up the garden path.</p>
<p class="contents">Another painful area is the financial perspectives for the multiannual budget. They have been in place since 1988, but in the form of interinstitutional agreements. Parliament can breach such an agreement at any time, and thus has an important means of power at its disposal. The financial perspectives will now be included in the Treaty. As a consequence, this means of power will be taken away. What is worse is that some governments, in imitation of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council, would like Parliament, from now on, to have only an advisory right when the multiannual budget is laid down, even though we are now equal partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only Parliament, but also our own ministers competent in all the different fields are at risk of falling victim to the undisguised takeover attempt on the part of the Finance Ministers. I find it bizarre that these national ministers still have not caught on to this. Let me give you an example. If the European Parliament and the Culture Ministers have an agreement on a European multiannual cultural programme, then the Finance Ministers can ultimately wipe this off the table simply by suggesting a lower amount and demanding that legislation be adapted to the budget instead of the other way round. Who exactly is calling the tune in Europe? The legislative authority that Parliament has acquired could become an empty shell when it has little power to ensure that sufficient funds are available to implement legislation. The Heads of State and Government are threatening to replace thirty years of budgetary right by the omnipotence of the Finance Ministers behind closed doors, and this shows little evidence of democracy or transparency.</p>

<p class="contents">We all recognise that this is an ambitious timeframe, but it is one that can be met. The draft Treaty by Mr Giscard d'Estaing and the Convention lays the groundwork for the enactment of the new European Union Treaty. Needless to say the EU governments negotiating this new Treaty have individual concerns and reservations relating to certain aspects of that Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations focus on two central elements. The first relates to institutional reform and the second to policy matters. From an institutional viewpoint, it is important that there is equality for smaller Member States with regard to representation on the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">There is broad agreement on extending qualified-majority voting and codecision powers to a range of different policy matters in the domain of both the European Council and the European Parliament. However, the European Union must be sensitive to the needs of individual Member States when it comes to foreign policy matters.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should not have overriding power in the area of dictating taxation policy across the territories of the European Union. Decisions on taxation policy are best left to individual Member States. That is a view shared by many in this House and also one shared by many European Union governments.</p>
<p class="contents">There are serious challenges facing the European Union in the field of justice and home affairs. We need to cooperate more closely to combat organised crime and international terrorism. We need to work more closely together to combat the scourge of human trafficking. However, I do not believe it correct for all decisions concerning justice and home affairs matters to be taken by qualified majority voting. This is because of the sensitive issue of differences between legal systems within the European Union at this particular time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I confess that I do not know how the Conference of Presidents takes its decisions, but the fact that this point, which does not seem to be secondary, had not been mentioned, seems to me to be regrettable in terms of the image of Parliament and of Europe in the years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is difficult at this stage to pass judgment on the IGC, I nevertheless believe that we should share the Commission's concern, since it seems to me that we are moving from Charybdis to Scylla. The Convention tried hard initially to study the content of European policies – economic, social, monetary, foreign – and then finally settled, it is true, for a modest institutional compromise. Having said that, I believe that in comparison, the Intergovernmental Conference is moving even further away from the concerns of the European citizens and becoming a kind of free-for-all on quotas of votes and seats, at the very same time that the European citizens are in the process – and this has not escaped you, Mr Wurtz mentioned it – of turning more directly against Europe and contesting the very foundations of European integration, as we have seen with this European social forum which I would personally have re-named ‘European Sovereigntist Forum’, given the debates which took place there.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we talk a lot about the <span class="italic">passerelles</span>, which are in fact dark tunnels, in which the last prerogatives of the national democracies are going to get lost. I would, though, like to return to an incident which took place yesterday in order to demonstrate a little to this Parliament the extent to which it can appear schizophrenic from time to time. One group, the largest in our institution, has reprimanded Mr Prodi for his involvement in Italian politics, despite the fact that all the representatives of this Parliament have argued, during the Convention, for the President of the Commission to be elected by Parliament and that consequently it should be possible to campaign. I remember that this issue was mentioned several times. In fact, it would be interesting to be able to campaign for Prodi or for Aznar during the European elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, Mr Prodi simply anticipated a decision which I believe to be regrettable, which consists of politicising the role of President of the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some people have proposed a move towards reducing the obligation for unanimity in the case of certain revisions, in particular that relating to the third part of the draft, which relates to the Union’s policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Those revisions are unacceptable to the majority because they would impose changes to the constitutional act on minority peoples. Unanimity must be conserved and differentiated cooperation must respond to any possible situations of deadlock. I would stress also that this third part contains essential provisions; that it has hardly been looked at by the Convention and that the Intergovernmental Conference looks likely to take the same route. All of this demonstrates well that this huge ambition to rewrite all the Treaties in one go risks leading to the endorsement of contested policies without real democratic debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The meeting of Foreign Ministers has also examined the numerous <span class="italic">passerelle</span> clauses, specific or general, of which there are many in the draft. We reject these <span class="italic">passerelle </span>clauses that seek to bypass the official review procedure, which will rule the national parliaments out of the procedure and will make it even less transparent in the eyes of the citizens. Clearly, things would be different if each national parliament considered separately, or each population by means of a referendum, had the formal right to opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this new revision of the Treaties should have been aimed at resolving the democratic deficit, at bringing Europe closer to the citizens and re-evaluating the role of the national parliaments. The Intergovernmental Conference is taking this approach, since it is likely to accept the Convention’s draft in its entirety, which does not deal with the real problem of democracy and which moves Europe further away from its people. We would appeal to it to put this right: there is still time before the compromise of 28 November. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Frattini’s statements on the speech you made in this House give us great hopes, as stressed by Mr Brok, of the final outcome of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference: I remain, therefore, one of those who are passionately optimistic. I am sure that we will achieve the goal towards which we are all working; I am absolutely convinced that no one will have the courage, no-one will want to risk being held politically accountable for giving Europe a heart attack and shattering a long-held dream.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Antonione, I believe, however, that it is right to bring to the Presidency’s attention a number of issues, which really do require some thought. Firstly, the role of the European Parliament. It would be a serious mistake to limit the role of the House which represents the peoples of the Union; I believe that the provisions of the text adopted by the Convention are appropriate and should not be altered. Secondly, the composition of the Commission: the accession countries – representatives of which are in this Chamber – have great hopes of the Europe of the tomorrow. We must not let them down by keeping them out of the Executive. That is why it is right for there to be a Commissioner with full rights for each country, at least during the initial phase of tomorrow’s Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, Mr Antonione, for a matter which has been the subject of much debate, and I feel that its importance must not be underestimated by the House. I feel – I am absolutely convinced of this, and not because I am a strong supporter of the Church – that the preamble to the Constitution should include an explicit reference to Europe’s Judeao-Christian roots. We must not deny a fundamental part of our history, we must not deny our deepest roots, we must not renounce the Europe of principles, we must not renounce this explicit reference, precisely because we want – and many countries understand this – secular institutions. This has been taken on board, Mr Barón Crespo, by the German Chancellor, the Social Democrat, Mr Schröder, who has decided not to block a proposal which seeks to make the individual, the central importance of the individual, the central importance of the citizen, the focus of tomorrow’s Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can certainly confirm that my own group feels that way, particularly as regards the impact on one of the fundamental rights of a parliament in a democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussions are taking place on budgetary rights, the essential right of any parliament, which represent the origins and the starting point of any process of democratisation: the right of Parliament, the directly elected representatives of the people, to make decisions on financial resources. The very foundations of this right are being attacked. I admit that we were not all happy about the outcome of the Convention, because we had, of course, expected more. We had hoped for more democratisation, so as to provide greater transparency for Europe's citizens about who is responsible for what, where the money comes from and how it is spent. More transparency is needed here, and the public have a right to expect it.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the outcome of the Convention, we have a financial framework that sets an upper limit and therefore puts a cap on expenditure. This framework will in future be set by the Council, subject to the approval of Parliament. That means that there is a predetermined planning procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to income, the Council has the last word. Nothing has changed there. We have criticised that, but that is how it is. As regards expenditure, and this is the small step forward that we have identified, in accordance with the Convention's draft the final decision is to be taken by Parliament. This is now being attacked by some Member States and also by the Finance Ministers. What is this all about? The message that gives is that this House is not able to make objective decisions on behalf of the public. What impression do these governments' representatives expect to create in six months' time at the next European elections, if they do not trust their own candidates to vote responsibly on expenditure at European level?</p>
<p class="contents">We have already heard the criticism that parliaments do not know how to deal with money. That has always been the case down the centuries. But we have never heard it before from a democratically elected government referring to a democratically elected parliament. This is something new, and it really is intolerable if you take a look at the facts. The rate of budgetary increases approved in some areas – well over 8% in one area decided by the Council, agricultural expenditure, compared with the maximum increase of 2.5% envisaged for the overall budget – do not suggest that the Council, which up to now has been able to decide on its own, is particularly thrifty.</p>
<p class="contents">Just look at the Council's administrative budget for next year. The Council is claiming an increase of 20.8% for itself, more than any other institution, in order to build up and enlarge its administration. We, on the other hand, have always kept within our upper limits. We do not need any coaching on how to manage the funds that Europe's citizens entrusted to us properly. We will hold our ground across the board if anyone tries to undermine Parliament's fundamental democratic right to set the budget. They will soon find out that no parliamentarian who takes his job seriously will go along with that. As Mr Brok put it, that really would be a declaration of war on this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the presidency for saying that it wishes to respect the outcome of the Convention and to fight for its implementation. I would like to thank all those national governments that are supporting that. But I warn all those who are toying with the idea of attacking this right that they are opening themselves up to accusations that they do not want to use the Constitution to extend democracy in Europe, that they do not want to strengthen or further democracy, but that they want to bypass it and undermine it, by depriving Parliament of one of its central rights.</p>

Decisions are taken behind closed doors by a circle of ministers, without ourselves, as citizens, being guaranteed political influence via an open debate and without ministers being held directly responsible to the voters for the decisions they make. That is the deficit that we in Parliament must make up, and Parliament’s influence on the budget and budget control are crucial in this area. It is, of course, not the governments that we see taking the lead in demanding reforms and better management of EU finances. It is Parliament that does this.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal by the finance ministers, whatever status it may have, involving a desire to uncouple Parliament from the budget process, is therefore a very embarrassing attack on democracy, and I hope that the EU Heads of State and Government will acknowledge this and reject the proposals. I hope that they accept the Convention’s proposal concerning the budget procedure, for it is balanced in a way with which they can be satisfied. At present, Parliament has, of course, real influence, both upon the annual budget and the financial estimates. Under the Convention’s proposal, we should be surrendering a little of the latter form of influence, for we can, at present, say at any time that we do not accept the multiannual budget framework but are returning to annual budgeting, for that is what is specified in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has voluntarily entered into multiannual agreements, and we can accept these agreements in future becoming law, but on condition that we are given influence over the financial estimates and, of course, on condition too that we are given influence over the agricultural budget. That is the balance in the Convention’s proposal. Parliament gives something and receives something in return.</p>
<p class="contents">I also look forward to the Danish Government’s denying press reports that it would support one of the finance ministers’ proposals, namely the proposal to introduce unanimity in the European Council when the financial estimates are adopted, for that cannot be right. We are in danger of deadlock in which the work of reform, including the reform of agricultural policy, is blocked. Denmark’s point of departure is that the European Parliament must have greater, not less, influence over the budget. This is something on which we must stand firm. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That debate has now faded and we have, in fact, all become enthusiastic about this enlargement. However, if the IGC debates go the same way, and if people really want to undermine the power of the European Parliament, which is very limited as it is, the question will once again be raised of whether Europe is not being hindered by this enlargement. In the past, the IGC has not managed to establish efficient, transparent and democratic structures, and at this rate, if the results of the Convention are now being brushed aside, we are at risk of ending up in a debate that is altogether different. It is a disgrace that people should want to undermine the power of the European Parliament in the budgetary field.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of questions remain. Mr Verheugen, the protection of minorities was a condition for accession, but how will we protect the minorities once they form part of the European Union? This question remains unanswered because this issue has not been solved for current EU Member States either. How will the European Union deal with the regions that have legislative powers but cannot intervene in matters that are regulated at European level and are nonetheless of vital importance to them? Scotland and the fisheries issue spring to mind. How can this be referred to the Committee of the Regions, given that that Committee is totally inadequate in terms of composition, power and functioning? Consider, too, the activities of Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control. The Committee of the Regions is not the answer to the regions’ laments. It should be reformed or else abolished.</p>

<p class="contents">In this context, I am also extremely curious to see how difficulties in guaranteeing the principle that all Member States are equal will be overcome, especially as regards the composition and workings of the Commission, how the primacy of national constitutional law will be ensured and, to be specific, the fact that no Community law must provide a derogation from the constitutional law of the Member States. I would furthermore be curious to see how we would overcome the understandable obstacle that raised its head recently in the <span class="italic">passerelle </span>clauses, as I had predicted it would and which comes as a breath of fresh air in terms of a general clause and, above all, when it also affects essential core issues of sovereignty.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this conceptualising is productive and above all that, ultimately, we do not stray from the agenda that has been announced. There are now areas of considerable concern, for example, it has been said that the aim of this reform is to bring Europe closer to the peoples and the citizens but the outcome that has been announced means the end of the rotating presidencies, without providing any satisfactory alternative. It has also been said that the purpose of the reform is to enhance democracy, transparency and awareness of the legislative process – aims with which I agree – and yet what we now have before us is the ‘requiem’ announced by the legislative Council, which would represent a return to a totally secretive legislative process, hampering public and parliamentary control. as well as constituting a regrettable further attack on the budgetary process.</p>

This morning, both the Council Presidency and the Commission’s speeches were more specific and took a harder line: could it be that they are indicative of what will happen in Naples? A Europe with clam sauce or a more-or-less Neapolitan pizza which will be served up to the European public for next year? At this juncture, taking into account the hourly developments like the finance ministers’ initiative, maybe the Council Presidency should review things in Italy with some urgency, if these are Mr Tremonti’s contributions, and also, moreover – and nobody has mentioned this, not even the general affairs ministers – the Italian and European shift of position on Israel just a few hours ago. I suppose we will take note of it but only in a few hours’ time, I fear.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, we would like to give two pieces of advice or express two hopes. For the forthcoming European elections, why should we not devise a political – I repeat, political – initiative and hold a European consultative referendum? You will win it and you will also be able to raise awareness about the subsequent institutional referenda that will be held. On the other hand, Mr President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner, are you, maybe, looking into the possibility of doing something new before 15 December? Are you trying to resolve the most serious problem which you seem to have, giving more power – with a US or UK flavour – to the Commission President? It is not a question of having 15 or 20 or 25; quite the opposite, it is a question of focusing less on ethnic representation and more on issues of programmatic, cultural and political representation. Have a little more confidence in yourselves rather than continuing to try and produce more rules, extensions and derogations, a strategy which is typical of canon law, not of secular law or the kind of law which creates rules which all can follow, including in the customs of society in general. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He very helpfully reminded us that we had the Convention because of the shock of Nice. I recall that earlier this week, Mr President, you and I were addressing a meeting of the CBI in the United Kingdom and I made the same point then. This whole process is one that goes back to the Nice Treaty and the shock of the outcome of the referendum in Ireland – I do not ask you to comment on that, Mr President.</p>
<p class="contents">What we talked about at Laeken was engaging with European citizens and explaining what Europe is about to citizens who are feeling remote from Europe. Yet the headline in the <span class="italic">EUobserver</span> last week was: 'Campaign launched to save Constitution'. MEPs are reported to be so concerned about the activities of national governments in the IGC that they felt it necessary to take to the streets in defence of the Convention's plans. We have heard in the debate today that the Convention must be defended against something wicked that is called national self-interest. Those who have launched this campaign will find it rather difficult to rally the electorate to their cause; according to a recent opinion poll, 61% of the European electorate have never heard of the Convention at all and in the UK 83% of people have never heard of it.</p>
<p class="contents">What people in my country and the rest of Europe want is a referendum on the Constitution. In a Eurobarometer poll published last week <span class="italic">84%</span> of the people polled in the 15 Member States and 10 accession countries wanted a referendum. In the UK that number is 86%. Mr Duff is amongst them: his party also wants a referendum. He and I might differ significantly about the implications of this Constitution, but as democrats we should be in a position to argue our case with the people and to see what the outcome of that debate should be. What message is being sent in my own country by the continued refusal to listen to the people whose interests we are elected to serve?</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to clarify a couple of points relating to the Convention. I would be grateful for clarification from the Council on the position outlined by the Maltese Prime Minster, who said recently that there had been some agreement from those countries that do not have to hold referenda that they will not allow referenda. That is not a democratic situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful to President Prodi, who has accepted that the Constitution amounts to a big change from the basic concept of nation states, a position confirmed by the German, Spanish and French Governments but denied by my own government.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Mr President, you and I heard a UK minister putting forward the view that there was nothing to worry about. A former UK minister said that in the United Kingdom the Charter of Fundamental Rights will have as much legal force as the <span class="italic">Beano</span>. The <span class="italic">Beano</span> is a comic for children in the United Kingdom. I rather think that this Constitution proposes something different. That is why I believe that the people should have a say in it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will have our support, and it will also have the support of some governments, but far too few up to now. We would like to see this group growing larger. Nevertheless I share the concern expressed here by Commissioner Verheugen and also by you yourself, Mr President-in-Office. I share your concern but I do not want to go into individual proposals. I am concerned about something more fundamental that is amiss in the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of ministers have not so far proved equal to the task before them. That is the simple truth. There is no will to shape things in the Intergovernmental Conference, but rather a blocking mentality, and that cannot continue if we are to achieve a good result in December. Almost without exception, the proposals being made represent steps backward as compared with the Convention's draft. Every time, during every discussion, the IGC does not build on the result of the Convention, it goes back on the Convention. The ministers are in the process of making things that have been dealt with simply in the draft Constitutional Treaty complicated again and detracting from their clarity and simplicity.</p>
<p class="contents">The rejection of the Legislative Council is just one example of this. They are refusing to give the Constitution the flexibility it needs. In fact they are going even further, by dismantling the small number of modest links that we incorporated and blocking them, so that unanimous agreement is to be required again for the medium-term financial perspective, and the European Parliament is being deprived of budgetary rights. In this way they are not just going back on the Convention's draft, they are even going back on the European Parliament's present rights. That is unacceptable. The majority of governments do not understand that a Union with over 25 Member States needs to have a new basis. They are not taking the result of the Convention seriously as a compromise that really is already a compromise and strikes a balance between North and South, large and small, and East and West in the European Union. We hope that the governments will abandon their blocking mentality and remember that they should be a force for shaping the future of Europe.</p>

On the one hand, that Ecofin’s proposals represent a step backwards with regard to the current situation in accordance with the Treaty of Nice. And on the other, that the financial perspectives must be accepted by the European Parliament and that Ecofin's proposals simply establish a consultation with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy is also a way to manage disagreements and today the European Parliament has the final word on more than 60% of the annual budget in the event that no agreement is reached with the Council. In Ecofin’s proposals a kind of automatic mechanism according to which the lowest quantity proposed is accepted replaces the political will of the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Ecofin’s proposals destroy the balance achieved in the Convention, and the European Parliament, knowing this, accepted a formalisation of the financial perspectives in the Constitution, restricting its own budgetary powers, because its power to reject the multiannual framework and to be able to decide against the Council's position by a very high majority of its Members, in the event of a disagreement in relation to the annual budgetary procedure, was recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">Ecofin's proposal to adopt the lowest quantity proposed in the event of there being no agreement removes any incentive to reach agreement. Whoever proposes the lowest quantity is bound to win. It is not that this limits the budgetary powers of Parliament, but that it turns the whole procedure into a mere Dutch auction.</p>
<p class="contents">My political group had great difficulties and held many discussions in relation to accepting the Convention's final proposal in the field of finances. All the eloquence of Mr Méndez de Vigo was required to convince us that this proposal represented a fair distribution of powers. It would not be advisable today to have to begin the whole process again. This would jeopardise the trust between institutions and would strip Parliament of its capacity to have a say in the drawing up of the Union’s budgetary policies.</p>
<p class="contents">My political group calls for the whole of the finance chapter of the draft Constitution to be taken as an indivisible and non-negotiable whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Antonione, I do not doubt the sincerity of your intentions but some of the expressions you used – I might almost way which slipped out – concerned me greatly. You said that some Member States, or government representatives, are standing firm on their requests for change for reasons of negotiating tactics. There is a fundamental misunderstanding here: the Intergovernmental Conference was not supposed to be a negotiating forum, governments should not have been allowed to adopt positions already presented in the Convention – as Mr Hänsch and Mr Brok pointed out – positions already rejected by the Convention because more convincing solutions with wider backing had been found. I am not saying that the Intergovernmental Conference should just have blindly approved the Convention’s draft, as, moreover, the Heads of State and Government were wise to do in the case of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights; I am saying that the Intergovernmental Conference should purely have checked for shortcomings and contradictions in the Convention’s draft, as it should be doing now, and discussed how to overcome them.</p>
<p class="contents">You also said that the Italian Presidency’s position is clear: it advocates a text which departs from the Convention’s draft as little as possible. However, that concept of ‘as little as possible’ is entirely open to interpretation and discretion. We need to be clear: woe betide the IGC if it meddles with the Convention’s most important innovations: the powers of the European Parliament, particularly in budgetary matters; the double majority system; the Legislative Council; the appointment of the Foreign Minister. Do not put the European Parliament in a position where it has to reject the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference and call upon the national parliaments not to ratify the Treaty.</p>

What is at stake here is not only effectiveness and transparency, but also greater parliamentarianism, accountability and accessibility for the public. In other words, not only the Union's future sustainability but also its ability to cope with enlargement is at issue.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point I would particularly like to emphasise once again that the overall outcome of the Convention was, from Parliament's viewpoint, of course painful in many respects, but ultimately it was a balanced compromise that we are willing to accept in the greater interest. Mr President-in-Office, if there is talk about doing away with the Legislative Council, then let me make a perfectly serious observation: if the accession countries had a legislative body that functions as the Council does at present, then those countries would have been refused membership of the EU, because they would quite simply have failed to meet the basic requirements for legislative process, transparency and parliamentarianism. That is why we are insisting on the Legislative Council.</p>
<p class="contents">A great deal has already been said about budgetary rights. On this issue, I also believe that the agreements whereby the final decision on own resources is taken by the Member States, whereby the Council decides on the multiannual budget framework after consulting and gaining the approval of Parliament, and this House has the final say on the annual budget plan, all that is ultimately a compromise. It is not acceptable for the informal Ecofin summit at Stresa to attempt to undermine long-standing parliamentary rights, to torpedo them in fact. Any attempt to restrict Parliament's rights in this area will come up against the combined and energetic resistance of a large majority of this House. That is why I am counting at this point on the presidency adopting a pro-European position, and to take on the faint hearts and the backward-looking members of the Council in order to achieve a satisfactory solution.</p>

<p class="contents">One of the major steps taken in the draft constitution drafted by the Convention on the future of Europe were the provisions on the social face of Europe, for social Europe. The Convention's preoccupation with this issue is particularly important because it emerged not from the Laeken agenda but from the initiative of the members of the Convention themselves, and rightly so. Because the peoples of Europe are much more interested, I believe, in the announcement of the objective of full employment, in strengthening social dialogue and in reinforcing the legal basis for public utility companies or for public health, than in whether there will be 13 or 23 Commissioners or if Europe will have 1 or 2 ministers for foreign affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Intergovernmental Conference will need to respect the Convention's text. It will need to intervene to improve one thing. To harmonise the wording between the first and third part of the draft, because we cannot talk of full employment in article 3 and of a high level of employment in part three.

<p class="contents">As regards the specific issues, quite frankly, I believe that today's speeches have retraced our debate of last week, so there have been no new developments and I can only reiterate in exactly the same way some points upon which I have already given my response. The Italian Presidency does not accept any intervention from Ecofin – to be quite clear and specific on an issue that you have raised – since it believes that no Council, not even Ecofin, is entitled to present amendments. If a representative of the Intergovernmental Conference wishes to table proposals which might also emerge from the Ecofin debate, it will do so on behalf of the government that it represents but not on behalf of Ecofin. I believe, therefore, that, from this point of view, my answer must be the same as that I gave in the past meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards our commitment to safeguarding the fundamental role of the European Parliament, and of parliaments in general, I continue to stress that we believe this to be an essential point. On a more general note, as regards the issue of whether proposals made by governments can be discussed, I have to say that it is difficult to imagine the Presidency totally and absolutely refusing to consider proposals that governments may wish to present. Frankly, I do not believe that is possible. Moreover, it is not as if your representatives – the representatives of the European Parliament to the Intergovernmental Conference – acted any differently from the Presidency; it is not as if the two representatives had got up and walked out because some governments wanted to reopen the debate on issues already discussed in the Convention. This is a phase of negotiation – I reiterate to Mr Napolitano – that I frankly believe to be normal and natural. I cannot see how else we could proceed.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather, I want to stress that the work you are doing in support of our undertaking not to depart from the spirit and from the recommendations that emerged from the work of the Convention is fundamental. Surely, however, it cannot be imagined that the Intergovernmental Conference is meeting simply to ratify work that has already been completed, valuable and important though that work is, which some governments clearly feel could be improved upon. The IGC is proceeding in this direction and I genuinely hope that, with everyone's efforts, we will be able to achieve that important, valuable result which, I repeat, is a legacy we all share.</p>

First, I would like to respond to Mrs Maes. I believe that she made a very important point during the debate when she said that it is now also necessary to demonstrate that enlargement is not a problem for deepening. This is a very old issue and it has certainly not yet been resolved yet, and I would like to take this opportunity to say once again to our future Member States that it is now up to them to demonstrate that these fears are unfounded, and to show that enlargement and deepening can perfectly well go hand in hand.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say, however, Mrs Maes, that the example you chose was not a particularly apt one. The new Member States were not involved in the attempt by the Ecofin Council to limit Parliament's budgetary rights. They really did not play any part in that attack, but that does not affect the fundamental problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The second person I would like to respond to is Klaus Hänsch. I think he is quite right in his analysis that what we are presently dealing with is a question of political will. It is not as if the problems are insurmountable. It is not as if any major new issues have emerged in the debate over the last few months. Everything that we are now considering was discussed thoroughly and in detail by the Convention, and after an in-depth discussion a decision was taken which we are convinced everyone can live with.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to leave you with one final thought: we need to become aware what the alternative is. You always need to consider what would happen if we cannot achieve anything and the Constitutional Treaty fails. That would imply more than the failure of any other legislative project. It would mean the failure of something absolutely central to the integration project, and the consequences would not just be legal ones. It would be a fatal mistake to imagine that we could then just continue on the basis of the Treaty of Nice. If the Constitutional Treaty failed, it would create whole new political scenarios in the European Union, which could even have a disintegrating effect within the Union. That is why we bear such enormous responsibility, and that is why it is so important to bring this project to a conclusion.</p>

<p class="contents">However, the disagreements are about completely secondary issues which do not change the reactionary nature of the text. They are concerned about the role of the foreign minister, without any of them contesting the militarisation of the ΕU and its cohesion with ΝΑΤΟ. No-one is concerned about the further cession of national sovereignty, but they are concerned about exactly how the power is to be redistributed. Not a word against the deification of the 'market economy' or against the strengthening of repressive mechanisms, while the European Parliament is only worried about the role reserved for it. In other words, everyone is fighting their own corner.</p>
<p class="contents">In all events, some concern is being expressed about the outcome of the referenda (where they are being held), which shows they are worried about increased grass-roots dissatisfaction, despite the misleading propaganda and the results of the referenda so far.</p>
<p class="contents">The peoples do not need a 'Euro-Constitution'; they hardly even need a European Union. They must step up their fight to defend and broaden their rights and demolish the structure being constructed by the exploiters in order to finally change society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
