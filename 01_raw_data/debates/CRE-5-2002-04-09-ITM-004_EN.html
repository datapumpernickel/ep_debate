<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schmitt (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we find ourselves today at the second reading stage of a draft Regulation that I regard as being of great significance and which in particular makes one thing clear, namely that, particularly through the committed involvement of the responsible Commissioner, the lack of what should long ago have been a matter of fact in the field of air travel has, in recent months, at length been successfully made good. I refer to the fact that air travel should know no frontiers and regulations and safety measures affecting air travel should naturally, therefore, also be without borders, meaning, in this instance, that they should be organised, as is appropriate, on a uniform basis across Europe or at least throughout the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation we are reading for the second time establishes an agency for aviation safety and ensures that assessments will in future be made uniformly as to which aircraft are to be built in accordance with which criteria before being licensed to enter service.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that the uniform assessment of designs makes this step significant in terms of air safety, but it is in my view also self-evidently essential to the aircraft industry, which has hitherto had to apply for authorisation in each individual Member State, but will in future be in a position to sort these problems out with one authority and with one agency, and get the relevant certification from them.</p>
<p class="contents">The task of the Aviation Safety Agency will be to approve aircraft, certify them and oversee their operation. At the same time, supervision of the flight crew, as also maintenance and other measures, all of which are factors in aviation safety, are in future to be regulated by law, something for which we clearly expressed a desire during discussions in committee and during preparations for second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me repeat the clear message that this regulation's principal objective is the creation of a uniformly high standard for aviation safety in Europe. There are of course further objectives or knock-on effects associated with this, which can be described quite briefly. These are, on the one hand, greater cost-effectiveness for the aircraft industry, and on the other, which I consider equally important, the fact that it will be guaranteed that relevant standards will be interpreted in a uniform way, thus promoting and enhancing the Community's position in the world, that is, with especial reference to the American situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee's concern was that the Aviation Safety Agency's general political independence, for the issues involved are exclusively of a technical nature, in which decisions are to be taken by authoritative experts and specialists rather than by politicians in Parliament or the Council. It was also important to guarantee the Agency's autonomy, meaning that the Executive Director really is the head of the authority and, at the same time, that the Management Board is in a position to lay down appropriate guidelines for the Agency and influence the way in which it works.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that this puts us into a conflict situation with the Council and the Commission, but I believe that our numerous discussions have brought solutions which of course ensure that the Commission's responsibility is made clear, that it will continue, so to speak, to supervise the Aviation Safety Agency, but that it is clear at the same time that the Aviation Safety Agency must also take responsibility for itself in its area of expertise.</p>
<p class="contents">I am confident that a conciliation procedure will be avoided, that we will be able to activate this regulation with the Council's agreement, and that the Agency will indeed be able to start work twelve months after that. We have, in my judgment, taken a great step forward in the area of aviation safety. I will take this opportunity to thank all of those who set this legislative project in motion and supported it, especially my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Transport and Tourism. I also thank the Commission and the Council for their willingness to seek compromises, and now hope that today's vote will enable us to complete this report, and that we will then begin a new chapter in the history of aviation safety in Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">It is fair to say that all of us in this House would have fully supported the creation of a pan-European body dealing specifically with the certification of aeronautical products, which is eminently sensible and which I fully support. However, my own view was that the scope of the original Commission proposal was too broad and there were a considerable number of concerns regarding the issues of sovereignty, the regulatory framework and in particular the autonomy of the proposed agency.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be emphasised that, as with national civil aviation authorities which quite clearly deal solely with safety matters, this agency should not be drawn into dealing with other aspects, such as environmental and competition issues. In addition, I would expect it to work along similar lines to those of national civil aviation authorities whose responsibilities are as independent regulators.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I received a comprehensive response from the Commission regarding the future of the national CAAs, their role still needs to be further clarified in terms of their future scope and remit. It should also be emphasised that efforts should continue to be concentrated on achieving uniform applicability of ICAO, JAA and Eurocontrol standards that are already in existence. The safety agency should not seek to parallel and create unwilling distortions of the current ICAO-based safety framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as we would expect independent experts to run this agency, it would not be in anyone's interests should there be undue political or Commission interference, thereby potentially rendering the issue of safety a secondary factor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wiersma (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> My group believes that guaranteeing a high and uniform level of safety and environmental protection in civil aviation is the key objective in setting up the European Aviation Safety Agency and drafting attendant legislation. This is a major and logical step on the way to a comprehensive European aviation policy. Common rules create clarity and predictability, but can, at the same time, prevent duplication and thus save money.</p>
<p class="contents">Uniform European rules are in the interest of industry, but they must also enhance consumer safety, of course. As far as we are concerned, the scope of the Agency may be broad, starting with certifying aircraft types, then extending the scope to include other elements, such as training. Needless to say, we must make effective use of existing national capacities and build in a transitional period to move towards a fully-fledged Agency, although this period should remain limited. We are not keen on a dual-track policy involving competing bodies. So-called third countries must be persuaded to participate in improving safety agreements. For this purpose, the European Union must develop a pro-active policy. It should be reasonable, yet unyielding. We must avoid leaks in the safety system due to a lack of sound agreements with countries that fall outside the scope of the proposed legislation and of the Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, we adopted the rapporteur’s compromise amendments. We too would like to see this matter brought to a prompt conclusion. So we are calling on the Council and the Commission to respond in the same cooperative spirit.</p>
<p class="contents">The PSE Group praises the rapporteur’s determination where the Agency’s independence is concerned. This is a key point for us too. Safety, not the request for competences, must be top of the list. Independence does not mean that the Agency is not accountable for its actions, and the European Parliament wants to take an explicit part in this. We will assume our responsibility, even today, in setting up the Agency, but we should also be allowed to carry out our task as the European Parliament in a well-informed manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The formulation of common rules for civil aviation traffic and the establishment of an Aviation Safety Agency are important steps forward in the area of improved air safety. Other important goals are improved levels of environmental protection, and the promotion of fair competition and proper certification processes.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve these goals the Aviation Safety Agency must function as independently as possible. The necessary acts must be applied uniformly at both national and Agency level. Commonly applied rules will lead to greater cost-effectiveness and a reduction in superfluous administration. The longer transitional period contained in the common position is necessary to allow time for the Member States to replace the current complicated regulatory and certification procedures with certificates.</p>
<p class="contents">Most air traffic accidents are due to human factors. As aviation becomes ever more technically complex the compilation of data and information exchange are of paramount importance in the improvement of civil aviation safety. Although air traffic has always been a relatively safe form of transport, its growth, as well as airport and airspace congestion have increased the risk of accident. Close cooperation between Member States for the purpose of raising levels of civil aviation safety will be an important precaution as air traffic grows.</p>
<p class="contents">The safety of European airspace is in the interests of everybody. In my opinion we should move towards a compromise as quickly as possible and avoid conciliation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We do, of course, support this idea.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, in any event, to say that safety and the protection of the environment are closely connected to the distribution of airports, which is suffering, in practical and serious ways, as a result of the trend to centralise airports that is prevailing in most European States and which is being promoted by central governments, which, for political reasons and reasons of power, are concentrating investment in capital cities, and by the so-called flagship companies, which, for the same reasons are centralising their flights and sending them into the same airports.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, most of Europe, just like my own country, Galicia, is suffering considerable hardship through being deprived of decent lines of air communication, traffic is becoming concentrated to an extraordinary degree in the air corridors that link the capitals, and the communities that live near to these central airports suffer the consequences of the noise and the bottlenecks. All of this militates against the sustainable development that we must try to achieve from the points of view of both safety and economics and from the social and environmental angles. I would say that we are, therefore, facing a serious problem, which we must start to resolve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We in Europe enjoy high levels of air safety but the growth in traffic continually obliges us to take more effective action. I would however say, regarding this, that it is incomprehensible and even disgraceful that this proposal has not been made until now and was not put forward ten years ago. In fact nations have been going their own way and politicising at the expense of human life. National pride must make way for rational cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">An Aviation Safety Agency could also be an example of EU integration at its best, provided that the pitfalls of bureaucracy are avoided. In this we should learn from the United States of America, where they trust in people. The concentration of information and harmonisation of standards are essential for the prevention of accidents, but regulations should not normally be tightened up only after accidents have occurred; instead, there should be a systematic analysis of present and future risks. That, again, will not succeed unless all the Member States have the same tools at their disposal. Our world is expanding at an ever-increasing rate, although this Chamber might not always be willing to admit it. The Aviation Safety Agency should make decisions that apply to the world as a whole, whenever that is possible. We should also support Article 2E proposed by the Council, as nothing good ever comes from enforced decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, I think that Parma would be a suitable location for the Aviation Safety Agency. Parma’s excellent food, such as its ham, would guarantee the contentment of the authorities working there and, hopefully, some equally mature decisions for air safety and the private individual in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A lot is moving in the skies above Europe. The crisis in air transport following 11 September appears in the meantime to have been almost overcome. Movements of aircraft are expected to double again by 2015. The restructuring of air transport is in full swing.</p>
<p class="contents">The political response to these challenges is represented primarily by the Single European Sky and the optimisation of capacities at airports. The present time demands continuity in the midst of change. Safety in the air must be the highest priority in air transport. Previous strategies to harmonise technical regulations have not been able to keep up with the breakneck pace of developments in the air transport sector. This is another reason why we need the European Aviation Safety Agency, which is to be the heart of a future unitary safety framework. I am glad that we have found a European response in this sensitive area.</p>
<p class="contents">We can chalk it up as a success in our negotiations with the Council and the Commission that it will be only a year after the Regulation enters into force that requirements for the operation of aircraft and for the approval of aircrew are timetabled to be drawn up, and that these measures are also to be applied to aircraft from third countries. Safety aspects of airports are also to be included.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the agency's accountability, Parliament has succeeded in giving it greater independence, including from the Commission. It has also been laid down that Member States are to make an appropriate contribution when external delegations of the Agency are set up on their territory – a contribution which I think Parliament will take to be financial in nature.</p>
<p class="contents">As a whole, discussion of the EASA shows that what we actually needed from the Commission is a framework directive on European agencies that would respond to the horizontal issues concerning a unitary structure for agencies. It is still unsatisfactory that the problem of budgeting for agencies' income could not be resolved as the Committee on Budgetary Control would wish. The Aviation Safety Agency will be followed by others, dealing for example with the safety of railways and ships. I consider this overall strategy to be suited to advance the integration of European transport markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There must be safer air travel, at least within the EU, and its safety must know no frontiers. That is our objective.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the key elements in achieving this objective is an Aviation Safety Agency that is capable of guaranteeing a uniform and high level of safety in the air on its own responsibility and with good organisation. Well-organised, sole responsibility is the key word. Parliament must continue to insist, whatever the Commission's supervisory responsibilities might be, that they remain of a supervisory nature and that the Commission and others do not make themselves out to be co-designers of all the details. It is not only in the well-known proverb, but also in this present instance, that too many cooks spoil the broth.</p>
<p class="contents">We MEPs must therefore continue to insist, and do so over and over again, on the agencies being as independent as possible, and, for example, on the Agency's Executive Director having an important role internally and not just externally. So we want other directors of the Agency to be appointed on the proposal of the Executive Director and hence on his responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">There is something else that we want and need – legislation in force as soon as possible, so that the agency can take up its role in the service of greater safety in the skies of Europe with the minimum of delay. We therefore hope that we will quickly agree on a common document with the Commission, but above all with the Council as well.</p>
<p class="contents">In its amendments, then, Parliament has been quite deliberately restrained where we believed that this common ground might be endangered, and we hope that the others will now join in too in search of this unity.</p>

As a result, we have a balanced compromise text and one which gives us every opportunity to avoid conciliation. I would like to stress the quality of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur and the need to make up for lost time. We have already waited too long.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of transport, as in many other areas as well, it is our duty to ensure that a similar, high level of security is provided in the Member States. It is also high time that the aeronautics industry benefited from a single certification for placing its products onto the market.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the European Aviation Safety Agency will be able to start work in the very near future and it must be able to provide a single certification for the Airbus A 380. This will represent the completion of many years of work by engineers, staff and employees and it is evidence of what Europeans can do, what they can achieve when they work together. It is a powerful symbol. The first test flight of the A 380 is planned for 2004, the first commercial flight for 2006 – just around the corner, in other words.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to fulfil its tasks, the European Aviation Safety Agency must be independent and rely on skills and qualifications that can be found in the Member States. As we know, the European Agency must not be used to coordinate the work of the existing national agencies. We must firstly strive to be efficient, and, in this respect, it is easy to understand that for certification work, the European Agency must work in conjunction with the major European design and manufacturing companies. I think that the regional agencies would be a good way to enable this to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Europe must offer practical advantages to its citizens. To do this, we must provide the same level of security, for a single sky, and a single certification in a single market. The text before us today is an important step in this direction.</p>

This cooperation will allow us – we hope – to approve this text for the establishment of the Agency, foregoing the need to go to conciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">The main objective of the common rules in the field of civil aviation and the establishment of a European Aviation Safety Agency is to maintain a uniformly high level of safety throughout the European Union, and to better protect the environment, as mentioned by the last speaker a few moments ago. Using this system, we will also be able to simplify the current procedures for aircraft certification, which will stimulate the internal market and the competitiveness of European products, as several speakers have pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">The main instrument of the new system will be a common European certificate that will provide access to the whole European market and serve as a basis for recognition agreements. As you are well aware, as this point has been highlighted throughout this debate, European industry is hoping that this Agency will be able to issue a certificate for its next star product: the Airbus 380. The proposal therefore constitutes a considerable step forward, given the objectives it pursues. Furthermore, this is also a true innovation in the field of Community integration, if we take into account the fact that up until now the civil aviation sector has been principally characterised by State sovereignty and intergovernmental cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, you approved the Commission proposal at first reading with several amendments. Many of these amendments have been accepted by the Commission and integrated into the Council’s common position. At this second reading, the rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, wanted to insist on certain issues that had not been included in the common position. The contacts established between the three institutions, which all want the European Aviation Safety Agency to be successfully established as soon as possible, mean that we have now reached a solution which is acceptable to all. Therefore, I hope that today Parliament as a whole will be able to confirm its support for this text so that the approval of the Regulation can take place next June, with the establishment of the Agency from Summer 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendments, I would like to point out that the new amendment, Amendment No 29, could compromise the fragile balance we have been able to achieve, as well as the expected timetable. Consequently, the Commission cannot accept this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that Amendments Nos 1 and 4 have caused us many problems. These amendments are proof of the European Parliament’s will to rapidly extend the Agency’s areas of responsibility to all sectors relating to safety, particularly with regard to licences for personnel and air operations. With regard to the fundamental issue at hand, the Commission is of the same opinion as Parliament, but, on behalf of the College of Commissioners, I would like to say for the record that the Commission has several reservations with regard to any wording that could interfere with its right of initiative, as set out in the Treaty. Therefore, the acceptance of Amendment Nos 1 and 4 can in no event be taken to imply any restriction of this right of initiative, inasmuch as these measures were already set out in our own work programme. In the specific context of this issue, the Commission therefore accepts the amendments and confirms its will to put forward these proposals, whilst underlining the fact that this was already set out in our own timetable and pointing out that in no way can this be considered as any kind of restriction of our right of initiative, as set out in the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can fully support the other amendments. Many of these improve the text of the common position or clarify its content. The Commission can also unreservedly support those amendments which increase the powers of the executive director and the provisions that aim to facilitate his or her appointment.</p>
<p class="contents">We can accept the amendments that aim to strengthen the Agency’s autonomy, specifically Amendments Nos 9 and 11, and it seems completely reasonable that the Commission, not having the necessary technical knowledge, should not change the content of technical standards without the prior cooperation of the Agency. These amendments have been written in such a way that Commission’s right of initiative is preserved, for which I would like to thank Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament, exercising its role as the budgetary authority, wanted to introduce an amendment, No 2, in which it calls for the establishment of common rules with regard to financial or other contributions that States often contribute in order that agencies may be set up in their own territories. The Commission does not object to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Parliament also wanted to send a clear political signal by means of Amendment No 16, whose objective is to limit the period during which both Community and National certification systems can function. The Commission considers that Parliament’s arguments are justified, and for this reason, we can accept this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, with regard to Amendment No 15, Recital D, the Commission, like the Council and the rapporteur, understands – and I would like to stress this issue – that access to these locations must be strictly necessary and not indiscriminate. I believe that with this in mind this issue can be settled.</p>
<p class="contents">Developments on this issue mean that we can expect the Regulation to be quickly approved and I would once again like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work and Parliament as a whole for its approval, like the Council, foregoing the need to resort to conciliation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
