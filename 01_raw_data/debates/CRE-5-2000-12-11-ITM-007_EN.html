<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, we live in a society in which there are ever-greater cross-border movements. They are of truly massive proportions and have never been seen before in any era of history. In this matter, we simply have to remember, for example, that in 1997, within the European Union, more than 200 million people crossed the borders of their State of residence into the territory of other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and the creation of the single market in turn involve the creation of an internal area without borders in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital must be guaranteed within the territory of the Member States, as laid down in Article 14 of the European Community Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these factors, acting separately, but multiplying their effects when acting together, have meant that every day millions of people quite simply cross the borders of their State of residence into another State of the European Union, whether to live, to work or just to travel. This fact, whose economic and political consequences will be immeasurable in the medium and long term, nevertheless has certain negative implications for the citizens who make this move. One of these is the risk of becoming a victim of crime, both inside and outside the territory of their State of residence, ranging from personal robbery to, on occasions, terrorist crimes, which still cause cruel and inhuman damage in certain Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, incredibly, the European Union has so far been incapable of creating appropriate formulae for fighting, in a united fashion, this scourge which knows no national borders because in judicial terms, the Member States continue to be shut off behind 15 different national borders. In the European Union, there is currently the paradox that the abolition of internal borders for the free movement of goods, people, services and capital has to live side by side with the maintenance of 15 national borders in the fields of police and criminal justice, which the Member States are making difficult to remove.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation has unjustifiable consequences for those European citizens who move freely within the territory of the European Union. In the unfortunate circumstance that someone is a victim of a crime in a State other than their usual State of residence, that citizen has to suffer the bad experience of an unacceptable lack of protection, which is due to the inability of the States to build a genuine European judicial area.</p>
<p class="contents">All victims of crime, regardless of their place of residence or nationality, must therefore be guaranteed respect for their rights and the certainty that they will receive the same treatment and speedy and sure compensation that all human beings deserve by virtue of the simple fact that they are human beings. This treatment should be received in any Member State in which a person is a victim of a crime. It is therefore essential that we create a genuine statute for the victims of crime, a common statute for all the Member States. The main objective of this initiative is to guarantee a minimum of compensation for victims in all Member States, guaranteeing them at least a common minimum.</p>
<p class="contents">By the same token, the fact needs to be pointed out that European criminal legislation in the Member States has always concentrated its attention and efforts on the criminal, both in terms of the prevention of crime and in terms of programmes and measures for rehabilitation directed at criminals.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the first initiative that gives special attention and importance to the victim. This initiative could be called innovative and, up to a point, revolutionary in terms of the way in which victims are treated. It is, without doubt, a new element in the European judicial system, in which, for the first time, victims have their own recognised judicial status and not, as has been the case until now, one which is derived from the crime.</p>
<p class="contents">In many cases, the victim is the object of a crime in the territory of a Member State other than their usual State of residence, which means that their problems and suffering are exacerbated and complicated by a whole range of circumstances which are negative, but common and constant, in the treatment of victims: a lack of communication owing to ignorance of the language, a lack of information, loneliness, a lack of protection in certain areas in which each State has preserved its own legal system. Therefore, and with the aim of being able to respond adequately to the needs of this type of victim, international standards have also been created which take account of the defence of victims’ rights and interests.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to highlight just two aspects of this initiative at the moment: European Convention No 116 of the Council of Europe of 24 November 1983 on the compensation of victims of violent crimes. I would like to highlight that, despite its importance and the fact that it is a mandatory point of reference in Europe, the Convention has still not been ratified, as of 18 September 2000, by the following Member States of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">Another international initiative is the United Nations Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power adopted by General Assembly Resolution 40/34 on 29 November 1985.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, because of what I have said previously, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 2(4) of the European Union Treaty, which lays down that one of the objectives of the Union is to maintain and develop the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice in which the free movement of persons is guaranteed, we must ensure that this area of freedom, security and justice guarantees genuine access to justice so that the European public can benefit from suitable legal protection in any part of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, the Citizens’ Europe will not make sense unless we first adopt, amongst others, the necessary measures to improve and also take account of the rights of victims of crime, aimed in a global sense at safeguarding all their rights and interests, on the one hand, and, from a Community point of view, at harmonising the legislation of the 15 Member States on the other. Everybody, including the nationals of third countries who have been victims of a crime in any State of the European Union, must receive the same minimum level of treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union cannot accept the idea that people might receive different treatment depending on the State in which they have been a victim of crime or on their nationality. This discrimination is patently quite unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the initiative is an important step forward in the creation of a European legal area, albeit partial and limited, but it responds to the real needs of an enormous number of European citizens who, until now, have been largely unprotected on becoming victims of crime outside their usual country of residence.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the positive aspects of this initiative, I would like to highlight the definition of the concept of the victim and the adoption of measures which are intrinsically connected to the global attention which must be paid to them.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, the majority of the amendments which are included in this report have been produced with the aim of respecting and recognising the rights of people who have been victims of crime, and of taking account of their interests and particular circumstances. To sum up, anyone who has been the victim of a crime must be guaranteed the same minimum level of treatment, their dignity should be protected, they should be guaranteed their rights to give and receive information, they should have access to justice and they should be granted compensation for the damage suffered immediately, effectively and in full.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first question was to what extent there actually was a legal basis for this proposal. As rapporteur, I took the view that the undertaking proposed to us here was admittedly a laudable one, but that, unfortunately, it was simply the case that within the European Union and also in relation to the Member States there were relatively clear rules about who had which competences. As rapporteur, my opinion is that issues relating to organising criminal prosecution and procedural criminal law do not fall within the competence of the Treaty on European Union and that these matters should be dealt with by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Committee did not go along with my proposal in this specific case, but, as rapporteur, I should nevertheless like to make this opinion known.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect which played a certain part was the issue of evidence recorded on video. You may remember the debate on the so-called Di Pietro report, which was held here in this House some time ago. At the time, this was already a highly controversial matter. The Committee on Legal Affairs agreed with the rapporteur's view that this recorded evidence was not a suitable instrument in a State under the rule of law and therefore deleted video recordings from the relevant paragraph of the article concerned. I would ask that this also be taken into account here in further discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">Otherwise the proposal is very much to be welcomed. It would only have been better if it had been dealt with where it belongs, namely in the domain of the national legislator, who could decide all these matters in an exemplary fashion. Not everything needs to be regulated at European level; if it did an all-embracing competence would have been inserted in the Treaty. But this was not done. That is why we should perhaps consider once again whether it is right for us to vote in favour of this initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is what this report stands for.</p>
<p class="contents">We submitted an opinion to the committee responsible on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities. It was very important in our view for the report to reflect the specific situation of women, but also that of other vulnerable victims. When I say other vulnerable victims I am thinking, for example, of minors and children, but the list need not end there. There are other groups in our society that are very vulnerable when it comes to violence. I have in mind those of a different sexual orientation. I am also thinking of migrants and so on, who are, of course, particularly vulnerable victims. What did we request for this group of people?</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we said that people who are very vulnerable must be given absolute respect. I am thinking, for example, of the specific situation of women and children who fall victim to sexual violence or physical violence in the home. It is very important for them that if their case comes to court, this really must be able to take place behind closed doors, so that minimum publicity is given to the victims, who are usually ashamed of the fact that they are victims. Because of course, that is what it has come to in our society. I feel, for example, that it is very important for physically abused women to have access to information everywhere on where they can go, where they can find suitable accommodation and stay at a secret address.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also essential for the police and the magistrature to receive special training. I was very actively involved in this issue in my own country, when I was a member of the government. I noticed how ill-prepared and equipped people in these agencies are – i.e. both the police and the magistrature – when it comes to treating people who are victims of sexual violence, for example, with respect, to questioning them, or providing a separate room for them, for example for women who have been raped and need to be examined. They should not be cross-examining these people in a room which is a general thoroughfare.</p>
<p class="contents">It is absolutely imperative for certain measures to be put in place for this group of people, these specific victims. The report answers this need. I am extremely grateful that the Commission has adopted the amendments tabled by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities and we will therefore support the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Often, when we address issues of justice, we devote too much time to the penal system, to prisons, to crime-fighting forces, to criminal codes and even to the claims of those in the legal profession. It may be that we have devoted too little time to the victims, who are often the weakest members of society.</p>
<p class="contents">This initiative targets three basic aspects: the victim’s right to information, access to justice and their right to compensation for damages. The priority of this proposal for a framework decision is to promote the protection and effectiveness of victims’ rights in this process, specifically with regard to simplifying access to the law, to the courts and to legal information as well as to promote and protect victims’ rights in the field of compensation for loss and damages. It is crucial that there should be a legal instrument that enables national legislation in the various Member States on the victim’s status to be harmonised. There are certainly various aspects which need to be improved and even put right, but what is important is that we vote for this framework decision, which is quite well-balanced. Indeed, we cannot talk seriously about a Citizens’ Europe unless we take account of victims’ rights. Amongst these victims, special attention should be paid, as Mrs Smet has already pointed out, to certain categories of victims, such as minors, foreigners, victims of sexual attacks and victims of terrorist acts. At the same time, special training should be provided for the professionals whose task it is to come into direct contact with victims. The necessary measures to ensure that the victims can re-establish their normal lives should also be provided, not only in financial terms, but also so that they may benefit, should it prove necessary, from legal, psychological or medical assistance or help from the social services.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Cerdeira Morterero, on her work and on the numerous improvements that she implemented in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. I also wish to express my satisfaction at the improvements resulting from the reports by Mrs Smet and Mr Lehne. We were able to work together in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and I wish to emphasise this fact and express my gratitude for it. I only wish it had been possible to achieve the same consensus in Parliament. The few proposals for amendments that we tabled mainly concern issues of legal rigour and our understanding that victim support services do not have to be exclusively or even preferably run by the public sector. Often, in services that wish to have a human face, the best experiences are provided by institutions of social solidarity and other non-governmental organisations. Overall, the PPE-DE welcomes Mrs Cerdeira Morterero’s report, for which we have already voted in committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important for a number of reasons: firstly, because we are making headway in the construction of the area of freedom, security and justice, in accordance with the Tampere programme, a programme which is difficult to put into practice because of the clash with the numerous State regulations and the nations’ reluctance.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is important because this vote has filled a gap, a gap which means there is unacceptable prejudice against European citizens, who travel freely through Union territory but, when they become victims of a crime, come up against the barriers of different legal systems, difficult to penetrate from every viewpoint, which penalise them further while favouring the offenders.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this vote is important because Parliament has the opportunity to make significant improvements to the legislative proposal, precisely those suggested in Mrs Cerdeira Morterero’s excellent report and supported by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the most significant aspect, in my opinion, is that people are finally becoming aware, at Union and other levels, of the need to change opinion on State intervention with regard to crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">Until now, on the basis of the just principle according to which citizens should be prevented from administering justice themselves, we have restricted ourselves to giving the State the monopoly on punishing the guilty, but we have forgotten that this is not the only task of the State: wherever in the world victims call for justice, we all know what they are asking for, even when the legal systems are completely different: they are calling for amends for a wrong which would otherwise be unacceptable, and the State, which has the task of ensuring citizens’ safety, when it is has not been able to protect them, must give all the help possible to victims, thus also showing that the Community takes the side of the party who has suffered the wrong and that the Community therefore condemns the offence and the offender.</p>
<p class="contents">By adopting this report, the European Union is giving an initial response to a call for justice which has hitherto been disregarded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Liberal Group feels that a very good report has emerged from the debate in committee and we will be supporting the committee amendments when we vote. We will not be supporting subsequent amendments from either the European People's Party or the Party of European Socialists, with the exception of Amendment No 59. We feel that to call on Member States to sign the European Convention of 24 November 1983 on the compensation of victims of violent crime fits better in the legislative resolution than in the body of the report on the framework decision.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite clear that if we are to create and to realise the area of freedom, security and justice provided for at Tampere then we will need legal aid in cross-border cases. I know from my own constituency of a lorry driver who was assaulted by his employers in the Netherlands and found himself unable to take them to court to gain access to justice. Therefore, Amendment No 4 is essential. We know, too, that we need the assumption that a victim of any nationality will be treated in the same way as a victim of the nationality of the country in which the offence takes place. I have a constituent whose car was broken into in Brussels and who found that the Belgian police wanted to know nothing about it. This is why we will be supporting Amendment No 14. We clearly need civil liberties safeguards and the recognition of the special needs of minorities and these are covered by Amendment No 25 and others. I had in my own constituency a Swedish family attacked; it was a xenophobically-motivated attack, their attackers believed them to be German. I would be very interested to know whether they found it as easy to gain access to justice in Great Britain as they would have done in their own country. Somehow, I doubt it.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Mr President, Liberals support this report. We feel it is a major step towards the creation of a European legal area and will benefit millions of our citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Victims must not be victims twice over, first of crime, and subsequently of the system. The victim’s most important right in the course of legal proceedings is therefore the right to be heard during the session. This is also of fundamental importance. It is quoted in many international documents on victims of crimes and it is essential for the victim to be given access to their own lawsuit.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also in the interests of the victim for the case to be brought to a swift conclusion, since slow proceedings can lead to the person feeling an ever worse sense of victimisation a second time round. Also, victims of sex crimes should no longer be forced to repeatedly give evidence. I also think video links could prove very useful when dealing with children who have been the victim of sexual abuse. So the debate on this issue is set to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">It is extremely important for specialised assistance to be provided, as Mrs Smet indicated, irrespective of the nature of the crime. It is important, in this context, for a number of prejudices surrounding this issue to be dispelled; for example the amount of importance attached to certain forms of crime varies from country to country. In addition, it has been ascertained that when victims report crimes they are subjected to discriminatory behaviour. Member States should be compelled to set up special police units for victims of crime.</p>
<p class="contents">What we also need is a legal basis and harmonisation of measures for the protection of victims. The study carried out by An Weghers within the framework of the Grotius programme provides the necessary basic information to this end. The useful information available in certain Member States concerning existing measures could play an important part in the harmonisation of a common package of measures.</p>
<p class="contents">An initiative of this kind would also be a first step in the direction of crime prevention. But in view of the fact that organised cross-border crime is on the increase, the initiative would have to lead to a common prevention programme at European and international level.</p>
<p class="contents">Until such time as a harmonised instrument for cross-border protection of victims is in place, it is incumbent on the Member States and the candidate countries, in cooperation with the NGOs, to improve the level of protection for victims, and where appropriate, examine under what conditions the victim is entitled to support for their return to their country of origin, or temporary right of residence, in the way that Belgium accords a status to victims of trafficking in human beings, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Compensation for the victim must take precedence over the payment of the fine and legal costs to the State. The Member States must ensure that the mediators come from all walks of life, men as well as women, and that they have a thorough understanding of the local culture and communities. It is also important in this context, for the next of kin, i.e. the family of the victim, to be apprised of the facts in a discreet and professional manner, should they so wish, and for them to be able to rely on receiving the necessary support and not have to learn everything from the press. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur – whom I congratulate – did well to highlight the unacceptable paradox of, on the one hand, a Europe without borders where goods and people move freely, a Europe which is on the point of monetary union, a financial and economic union, and, on the other hand, a Europe of 15 criminal law systems, all completely different. On the one hand, there are a potential 350 million people who are encouraged to travel and work in the name of the united Europe, but if they fall victim to a crime, a wrong-doing, Europe vanishes, the much-lauded European citizenship vanishes, the citizen becomes a person without rights who has to reckon with a foreign, often hostile State which gives out no information, creates a multitude of problems and does not pay damages where they are due. How many of us Members of Parliament are requested to ask questions on cases of this kind? However, the Commission duly replies to us that it cannot go into the matter of national legal systems, even when obvious injustices occur.</p>
<p class="contents">Just in recent months two cases have been referred to me. The first is the case of two Italian Alitalia pilots, Alberto Nassetti and Pierpaolo Racchetti, who died in France following an accident, in unexplained circumstances, during a test flight of an aeroplane. Six years have gone by and, beset by hundreds of problems and prohibitive legal costs, their families are still waiting for justice, they are waiting to know the cause of these deaths and who, if any, the responsible parties are.</p>
<p class="contents">The second case involves a Greek student, Mikis Mantakas, killed around 25 years ago in Rome, following a terrorist attack carried out by the Red Brigades. The guilty party, Arturo Lojacono, was identified and sentenced, but sought refuge abroad. Italy has repeatedly requested the extradition of this multiple murderer from France, where Mr Lojacono lives freely, so that he can finally serve his time. Well, we are still waiting for a reply.</p>
<p class="contents">So, together with the euro, I also welcome the advent of the statute for the victims of crime, so that a genuine European area of justice can be built. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the beginning, most people were against it. Now, however, most of us agree, and that, I think, is a good thing. I welcome the proposal from Portugal for strengthening the standing of victims of crime in criminal procedure also, even though I have every respect for the views relating to legal aspects expressed by Mr Lehne earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">People who are subjected to crime while exercising their right to freedom of movement must not have to suffer twice, inasmuch as they are badly treated. This is the case irrespective of the type of crime committed. It is a question of strengthening the standing of the victims, but it cannot be done without also talking about crime prevention measures. The best way of all of helping victims of crime is to ensure that no crime is committed in the first place, and the most important way of preventing crime is probably to disseminate information. Crime prevention measures must also aim to combat organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Victims of crime must know their rights and what opportunities they actually have for receiving help. Most Member States provide some form of initial help for victims. Sometimes travellers need additional support and perhaps more support than the local population. It might be a matter of psychological support and help with the language as well as a whole number of other factors. It can be difficult for a foreign victim to follow the criminal procedures from a distance, and in this case it is clear that special measures are required.</p>
<p class="contents">The victim must always have priority. Since it is not the perpetrator we must give priority to, it is disturbing to see the tendency in a number of Member States to start introducing <span class="italic">nolle prosequi</span> simply because the perpetrator meets the victim. I cannot support this sort of trend. Crimes must be solved, and if this does not happen it will, in the long term, threaten the democratic system. Who will then go out and vote if their problems are completely disregarded?</p>
<p class="contents">In my country, the number of cases of assault is increasing, and barely 20 per cent of these cases are solved. This percentage is too low. Crime is no accident. A penalty also involves respect for the victim. We must never stray from the basic principle that individuals must always take responsibility for their own actions, either at the level of the Member State or at EU level. The State must ultimately take responsibility for its failure to protect the victim. Therefore, I am pleased that the rapporteur has drawn up this report, which I commend with enthusiasm. I would like to thank her for helping to strengthen the unified view of victims of crime in the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are often in a difficult situation because they are far away from home and do not know the system or the language of the country in which the offence took place.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft framework decision proposed by Portugal and supported by the French Presidency constitutes a first step in taking into account the situation of victims at the level of the European Union. The Commission welcomes this. The question of the situation of victims of criminal offences in Europe was first mentioned in the Vienna Action Plan and included in the conclusions of the European Council of Tampere. Further, it was the subject of a communication from the Commission on 14 July 1999. Part of the proposals made in this communication to improve the standards and the assumption of responsibility for victims were included in the draft framework decision presented by the Portuguese Presidency and which is submitted to you today.</p>
<p class="contents">I acknowledge the work carried out on this text by Mrs Cerdeira Morterero, your rapporteur. It was the subject of difficult discussions in the Council. As you noted, the draft framework decision contains three different types of measures: firstly, it enacts minimum rules with regard to the victim's rights; secondly, it enacts specific rules aiming to take into account the individual situation of those people who are victims of an offence in a Member State other than their State of origin and, thirdly, it encourages the States to develop measures for victim support.</p>
<p class="contents">One can be particularly pleased with certain provisions, for example the possibility for victims to lodge a complaint at the place of their residence when they are not in a position to do so in the State where the offence took place.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does not have any objection to the majority of the amendments proposed by the rapporteur. However, I would like to draw your attention to three points. Several amendments refer to the official languages of the European Union, foreseeing the right of victims to communicate in one of these languages. This mechanism does not, however, appear to be appropriate. It is important to make it possible for the victim to have information in a language they understand. In certain cases it might not be a language of the European Union. In other cases, it might be possible to get the information needed in a language of the Union which is not their own. It is, therefore, more relevant to refer not to a language of the Union but, in a more pragmatic way, to confer on the victim the right to have access to the necessary information in a language that they understand. This could involve in certain cases putting an interpreter at their disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Amendment No 49 stipulates that Member States guarantee to victims who so wish the right to remain in the State where the procedure takes place, where it is necessary for the procedure to run smoothly.</p>
<p class="contents">This provision is very interesting. It requires, however, a more detailed study in relation to European legislation as regards asylum and immigration for the natives of third countries to the Union. That is why this text was withdrawn from the version under discussion in the Council. The Commission is currently thinking about a specific text on this important subject in order to protect victims as well as – in a number of cases – to facilitate surveys.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the text invites the Member States to create a ‘green number’, functioning 24 hours a day in all the official languages of the Union, in order to make it possible for victims to contact the services for victim support. This is indeed a good idea as it would allow the European citizen who is a victim of a criminal offence, when travelling in the territory of the Union, to feel in concrete terms the added value at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">However, on the one hand the framework decision is not the appropriate instrument here and, on the other hand, its implementation involves a consideration that is rather complex. Does it involve having the same emergency number in all the Member States on the model of the fire service or the police force? Does it involve having a centre at European level available 24 hours a day to inform of the possibilities of victim support? Does it involve setting up a service in each Member State?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wishes to continue the feasibility study for such a project. It already works to support the networking at European level of the national services for victim support in order to ensure appropriate care of victims, particularly if they do not reside where the offence took place.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of a ‘green number’ will be examined within this context. At this stage, it is perhaps preferable to bring about a working relationship with the services for victim support, rather than putting in a text the principle of a ‘green number’, which would be likely to have no future.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft framework decision on which you come to a decision today constitutes a first step in taking into account the situation of victims at a European level. As I have just said, in order to go further within the framework of following up its communication of 14 July 1999, the Commission works on the adoption of concrete measures to support victims, in particular through the support envisaged for the European forum for victim services. In addition, with regard to victims' compensation, the Commission will submit a Green Paper next year.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted by the favourable response shown by Parliament to this first text on such an important subject, so that the area of freedom, security and justice which we are gradually building may offer our fellow citizens support in situations that are often difficult to live with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
