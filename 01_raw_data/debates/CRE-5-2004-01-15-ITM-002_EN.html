<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Madam President, with regard to these two subjects, I will speak first on the Kauppi Report and then on the Purvis Report.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Kauppi Report on mutual assistance, the Commission made this proposal in response to the report of the Council's Ad Hoc Group on Tax Fraud. The group had indicated that the base directive, which dates from 1977, was in need of modernisation in view of the increased tendency for businesses to be organised in several Member States and for individuals to exercise their Treaty rights of free movement. Nevertheless, any tax liabilities that arise as a consequence of those rights should be capable of enforcement by the tax authorities of the Member States concerned. Practices of tax evasion and tax avoidance across frontiers violate the principle of fair taxation, are likely to result in distortions in capital movements, adversely affect conditions of competition and affect the proper functioning of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal adds to the existing tools available to tax administrations. It accelerates the procedures involved in obtaining information from other states' tax administrations. It makes it possible to carry out simultaneous tax checks in a number of countries where a multinational business operates, and it allows decisions and instruments to be notified outside the country where the tax is owed, so that enforcement proceedings may be pursued. As a measure designed to combat tax fraud and tax avoidance, I am certain that Parliament will want to support it.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are my initial comments on the Kauppi Report. With regard to the Purvis Report, I should like to say the following.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the decision of the European Parliament to draw up a report on the future of hedge funds and derivatives. I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his initiative, which is very timely. These subjects, as we all know, are extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me first address the issue of hedge funds. As mentioned in Mr Purvis' report, various hedge fund products are already accessible to retail investors, either directly through stock exchange listings or indirectly through structured notes. Several Member States have already introduced a regulatory regime for hedge funds to encourage such undertakings to set themselves up under their jurisdiction. However, as Mr Purvis correctly mentions in his report, there is currently no European regulatory regime that is tailored to the particularities of hedge funds.</p>
<p class="contents">There are at least two key questions: first, how to attract on-shore investments that are mostly off-shore nowadays. Parmalat, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, has shown the importance of that. Secondly, what level of protection do investors need for this specific type of financial product? On this basis, it would seem appropriate to discuss the potential benefits of an EU-wide regulatory regime for hedge funds.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the second issue, derivatives, I agree that this is another crucial issue for at least three reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">First, this category of financial instruments is developing at an increasing rate with endless imagination in the form of new products. Secondly, most of them are traded on over-the-counter markets which, by their very nature, are less-well monitored than regulated markets by regulators and supervisors. Thirdly, the risks attached to such instruments are potentially large because of their leverage effects. However, in contrast to hedge funds, which are not covered by European legislation at the moment, derivatives are already dealt with in a number of texts in different contexts such as, for example, accounting, ICITS, market abuse, investment services or banking legislation. It would seem neither necessary nor desirable to build a specific piece of legislation for derivatives as it is a horizontal issue. The best way would be to consider updating the current different pieces of European legislation on a case-by-case basis. However, full tax consistency must be assured.</p>
<p class="contents">In the cases of both hedge funds and derivatives, Mr Purvis' final report is helpful guidance for the European Commission. The Commission committed itself in Oviedo in April 2002 to examine specifically the issues of derivatives and hedge funds after the Enron scandal. This commitment will be respected and Mr Purvis' report will be taken duly into account.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission will also have to take into consideration the conclusions to be drawn by the professional experts groups that we set up in late October 2003 to consider post-FSAP priorities – priorities after completion of the Financial Services Action Plan. Those experts groups may raise these two issues, among others, upon the first report scheduled for April 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">It is too early for the European Commission to take a final position on possible further legislative action regarding either hedge funds or derivatives.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall have to analyse whether the Parmalat affair resonates on these two subjects and we shall have to be attentive to the on-going debates in the United States on registration of hedge funds to ensure that there are no distortions to competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has asked me to present this report briefly for her today because a week ago she became a mother. On behalf of this House and on my own behalf I would like to offer her our warmest congratulations. She is the mother of a strapping boy, both are doing well and she would like to combine work and family as quickly as possible and resume her work in this House. Warm congratulations, Piia, and all the best!</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to her report on the Commission proposal, I can say that it does not criticise the Commission, neither does it raise any cause for concern as to how the Commission has proceeded, but rather as to how the Council has proceeded. Essentially, the Commission proposal seeks to achieve for direct taxation what has already been proposed elsewhere for indirect taxation. The main innovations are the introduction of the possibility for two or more Member States to carry out joint controls where a taxable person is active in more than one Member State, that is, it is a question of common sense and an orderly shaping of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point is the simplification of the procedure and a third the removal of ambiguities from the present text which, as we have heard, is already 25 years old and anyone with their eyes and ears open knows that a lot has been done and changed in that time.</p>
<p class="contents">The main problem is one of procedure. In keeping with its normal practice, the Commission has based its proposal on Article 95 of the Treaty, which means that the codecision procedure applies to this proposal. Parliament has always supported this choice of legal basis, for reasons that are easy to understand, and I would also like to say why, namely that we are of the opinion that administrative cooperation does not affect material tax law, but rather seeks to ensure that the single market works well. We therefore welcome the Commission’s legal stance and we would point out that the Council has already on several occasions decided unilaterally to change the legal basis to either Article 93 or Article 94 of the Treaty without giving any convincing reasons, in so doing removing Parliament’s right of codecision and understating the measure’s importance for the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">The most recent case concerned two Commission proposals on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT and an amendment to Directive 77/799/EEC, where the Council has recently re-consulted Parliament on the change in legal basis. Parliament rejected that request on 2 September 2003. Since we anticipate that the Council will also change the legal basis for the present proposal, the rapporteur sees no reason to change or re-evaluate her position at this juncture and we therefore propose that the Commission draft be approved in full as proposed on the basis of Article 95. By so doing, we will also be showing with a broad majority that we are ready, minded and determined to co-decide in this matter, because we believe it concerns the single market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Purvis (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his considered views and I hope, even if he defers to his expert panels, that he will take into account the fact that this area most probably deserves legislation in the future. I shall run through the main reasons for our view of this.</p>
<p class="contents">The first hedge fund was established back in 1949 and, as of now, assets under management globally are estimated at some EUR 600 billion. Of these, about 15%, or EUR 90 billion, are managed from Europe. Even if European investment managers manage them, most of them are still domiciled in offshore tax and regulatory havens. There has been a huge increase in interest in this type of investment in recent years, especially in the United States, where affluent and moderately affluent investors have discovered them. Many institutional investors now find it acceptable to invest in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">This interest has now spread to Europe, especially as many of these funds, because of their willingness to sell short and leverage their results, have performed well in absolute terms over the last three years of negative stock market performance. The media has picked up on this, and such performances are featured in the personal finance sections of the newspapers. As a result there is some concern that less and less sophisticated investors will be tempted to entrust their savings to risky offshore hedge funds by one means or another. Even if most of these are perfectly respectable, well-administered and managed, there is only very basic regulatory control. EU regulators are concerned about the risks that may be run, while the investment industry is attracted by the commercial opportunities of tapping into this trend. We consider that it is an opportune time to introduce an appropriately light-handed regime in the European Union that will attract those funds to set up within European jurisdictions. This view is further strengthened by the initiatives of certain Member States, which have introduced or are considering introducing such facilitating regimes at the national level. Ireland, Germany and Luxembourg are three such examples.</p>
<p class="contents">Another matter of concern in the context of our attempts to produce a single European capital and investment market, is that some Member States impose fiscal or regulatory conditions which discriminate against investment into such funds in other Member States. We therefore propose that a distinct light-handed regime be established which can accommodate the characteristics of hedge funds – and also, incidentally, other alternative investment vehicles which currently lack a suitable legal home at an EU level. We are looking for an arrangement which can provide these vehicles with an EU passport on the basis of mutual recognition. These funds invest in areas such as property, currencies and commodities. Clearly these investments are not appropriate for everyone, at least until their awareness of the risks they carry are fully understood and appreciated. For this reason, we stress the absolute necessity of education, of clear and straightforward information and of strict regulatory control of those who sell and distribute such products. There is no reason to deny European citizens access to these interesting investment opportunities, but we feel their interests will be better safeguarded if these are available within EU jurisdictions and are subject to appropriate regulation. They will also provide opportunities for our European investment professionals to enhance their skills and build high-value businesses and jobs. Capital will also be attracted to our businesses and industries here in Europe, rather than in America and other parts of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">A separate section of my report is devoted to derivatives. These are widely used in both mainstream business and industry and in the investment world. While they are often vilified as high-risk speculative instruments, in fact, they can just as readily be applied – and are – in order to limit and reduce risk. We have identified two main issues – Mr Bolkestein identified three – which deserve attention. Systemic risks to the world's financial system could possibly occur because we have little or no way of quantifying the full extent of exposure. This applies especially to specialised derivatives which are dealt over the counter and tend to be less liquid than more conventional derivatives. This also applies to credit derivatives, whose use has exploded, as banks offload – for capital adequacy reasons – their assets onto non-banks including, incidentally, hedge funds.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore call on the Commission, and the various international institutions, to develop appropriate means to measure, monitor and control such outstandings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Doyle (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Madam President, I shall start with the Kauppi report – and I join in the congratulations to Mrs Kauppi on the birth of her son this week. As has been noted, the title of this proposed directive, which will overhaul the existing mutual assistance directive, is slightly misleading, given that it will only, in effect, apply to direct taxation and insurance, indirect taxation in the form of VAT and excise duties being dealt with in separate instruments. That should be clarified.</p>
<p class="contents">The thrust of this proposal is to prevent tax evaders from hiding in other Member States by establishing, on a voluntary basis, provisions for cooperation and mutual agreement in conducting tax controls. This will be a welcome advance. The change of legal basis from one relying on QMV – Article 95 – to one providing for unanimous voting by the Council – Articles 93 and 94 of the Treaty – is very much in line with precedent and, fortunately, with my own government's position on tax legislation. It is not possible to separate the administrative element of taxation powers, including mutual assistance provisions, from the tax raising prerogative and this should remain subject to unanimous voting.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn to the report by Mr Purvis. I congratulate him on a very balanced and informative report, notwithstanding the slightly odd decision to link these two topics – hedge funds and derivatives – in a single report, as trade in derivatives is already far more regulated in the EU than the area of hedge funds. As mentioned in his report, Ireland has been extremely active and successful in broadening access to hedge funds. However, a clear regulatory framework must be put in place to secure minimum protection for investors while expanding Europe's paltry 15% share of total global hedge fund assets. SAIVs – sophisticated alternative investment vehicles, or hedge funds, as they are generally known – and derivatives have benefited over the last few years from the stock market downturn, as they did from the widening of the field of investors that the stock market experienced during the booming 1990s, when areas of investment that had previously been largely confined to experienced and qualified financial experts or fund managers were democratised as individuals and smaller groups new to the market put their money into shares at that time. I agree that we need an appropriate EU-wide regulatory regime for hedge funds which will prompt them to locate in the EU, rather than offshore, and provide the benefits of a common European passport through mutual recognition. However, we need to take a suitable light-touch approach to regulation in order to provide incentives that will encourage investment in funds based in the EU rather than continue to drive them offshore. Coordination of national regulators will provide for more flexibility within the single market, which is welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to derivatives, I support the timely call for the Commission to present a report on their role on the capital markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Socialist Group does not consider hedge funds in particular or derivatives in general to be particularly wonderful. These instruments are to some extent useful in covering certain investment risks or risks linked to international trade. Given, however, that all of these financial instruments are highly speculative – indeed with very limited leverage, phenomenal sums can be raised – one simply has to be careful. My Group supports the Commission’s prudent approach in this regard and we agree with the argument that Commissioner Bolkestein has just put forward. Enron, Parmalat and other scandals have reminded us that sophisticated products often conceal highly sophisticated financial wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="contents">The near-collapse of the Long Term Capital Management hedge fund revealed the scale of the risks involved. At the beginning of 1998, LTCM had USD 4.8 billion of its own funds to meet liabilities worth USD 120 billion, in other words, a leverage of 25. By 23 September 1998, LTCM’s net assets had fallen to USD 600 million, with liabilities of around USD 100 billion, or a leverage of 167. The rescue of LTCM, which entailed neither penalties nor consequences for the fund managers, avoided a chain reaction, but who can guarantee that similar events will not happen again, this time on a scale that will make any rescue impossible?</p>
<p class="contents">The capital with which LTCM started operating essentially came from banks which were, in theory, monitored. We must, therefore, toughen the prudential requirements set for banks when they underwrite speculative funds. Because many of these funds are domiciled in offshore centres that are unregulated or barely regulated, the simplest way of countering hedge funds that wish to remain opaque would be to make it more difficult and onerous for them to obtain refinancing from banks operating in countries covered by the Basle Accords. Bank loans could be strictly limited, in line with the amount of collateral provided by funds domiciled offshore. The Financial Stability Forum, the International Organization of Securities Commissions and the Basle Committee for Banking Supervision have all made important recommendations and suggestions on this matter, in particular in the Brok/Mayer report of January 2000. To date, none of these proposals has been translated into action.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Purvis’s report seeks to arrange a comeback for hedge funds in Europe and to gradually open their products to ‘moderately affluent investors’. Personally, I am not quite sure what a moderately affluent investor is, but my group is not opposed to such a move, on the condition that there is much more transparency as regards hedge funds and that national and, in future, even European regulators authorise and monitor this process. Indeed, we must not forget that in this murky area, significant gains necessarily entail substantial risks.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall finish, Madam President, by thanking Mr Purvis for this report which is, on the whole, extremely constructive. I thank him for his open-mindedness and for having accepted some compromises, which will allow my group to vote in favour of his report. I will also end by addressing my personal congratulations and those of my group to Mrs Kauppi, on her report, but especially on the happy event that has just been announced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He believes in the market. If you have such a belief the best option is light-handed regulation, and the lightest is obviously self-regulation. Mr Purvis justifies the existence of derivative markets with reference to olive production. In ancient times the price of olives was stabilised by means of agreements made beforehand. Olives in the European Union, however, are a good example of how the market functions if there is no control and only self-regulation. According to a report by the Court of Auditors, producers are falsifying production figures at their pressing plants, adding nut oil to olive oil or forwarding the same oil to the EU for payment on the basis of both the number of trees and the volume of oil.</p>
<p class="contents">The market functions on the terms of the greedy, as do investment and the derivative markets. The new instruments work in the way oil is pressed from olives. The stock markets are the oil pressing plants for the new market instruments, where new cash is pressed from old. The derivatives are the new lubricant greasing the wheels of the machinery in the speculators’ market.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial markets are supervised today in the same way as nuclear safety, something which was discussed this week in Parliament: only at national level. Those responsible for supervising nuclear plants are top-level technical specialists, whilst those responsible for the national supervision of hedge funds and derivatives are not. Accordingly, there is no stock market safety factor in the market. There should be a stock market safety authority just as there is a nuclear safety authority or, for example, a Maritime Safety Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish the report had examined more the role of the European Central Bank as a possible supervisory body. A lightly regulated regime and self-regulation rely on the morals of speculators, and, as we know, speculators do not have morals. Their incentive is merely a desire for money. As a result, the pensions of employees in companies in many countries are at great risk, as they are, for example, in Mr Purvis’s country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Dam (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, unlike the previous speaker, I will mainly be focusing on the directive for which Mrs Kauppi is the rapporteur. Tax avoidance and evasion is widely practised and there is a strong cross-border dimension to it. Cigarette smuggling, VAT carousels and undeclared bank accounts are only a few examples of the repertoire of those who do not want to give Caesar what belongs to him. In the European Union, but also, for example, in Switzerland and the Balkans, we have to look carefully for joint efforts to put effective monitoring in place particularly for taxpayers who are active in various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The options provided in this directive for joint monitoring by two or more Member States are therefore of major importance. We are particularly referring, therefore, to the improved cooperation between the fiscal authorities of each of the Member States. This is wholly in keeping with the national prerogative of legislating on tax and collecting it. Fiscal legislation is a national responsibility and should remain so, tax being more closely interrelated with social structure and culture within each of the Member States. Against this backdrop, it is extremely odd that the discussion should not revolve around an effective approach to tax fraud but around the question of what legal basis this directive should have. This Parliament has rightly accepted Article 95 as a basis in comparable cases in order for the codecision procedure to apply. This is not about the content of tax legislation but about an implementing provision with regard to administrative cooperation, which is necessary in the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">What Mrs Kauppi predicted in her explanatory statement to her report has meanwhile come to pass: the Council has recently submitted a formal proposal to amend the legal basis. I would call this a knee-jerk response; the Council has once again rejected codecision without any clear arguments. Now that Parliament's position was confirmed on 2 September, this proposal too risks ending up before the Court of Justice. This would lead to unnecessary effort and expense and, above all, possibly long delays for the improved cooperation between the fiscal authorities, which is so desperately needed. I challenge the Council to jump over its own shadow. Back to basics: more effective controls of taxpayers who are active across the border. Tax-evaders move on from one base to another very quickly. The traditional exchange of information cannot possibly keep up. If a joint team of control officials from the relevant countries can establish that tax legislation has been misused and abused, a tit-for-tat approach is possible. The accession of ten new Member States will undoubtedly increase the need for transnational control teams. The open borders to countries with a still vulnerable administrative apparatus will, unfortunately, attract bounty hunters who have as few scruples in tax matters as they do in anything else. The sooner the tax authorities can fight this as one, the better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the EU continues to be outsmarted by professional tax fraudsters because our systems are far too complex. We are flinging the doors open wide to such fraudsters and in so doing indirectly encouraging tax fraud. If we are to do anything effective against it, we need not only more effective controls and close cooperation, but also tax laws that are easy to understand. We urgently need a reform of our VAT system, for example. The highly complex dual VAT system where national sales are treated differently from EU sales is a major factor in billions being evaded relatively easily in the EU every year. That is why we need a simpler VAT system that is easier to understand and where all sales in Europe are treated in the same way and not differently, so that tax fraud can actually be combated effectively. Proposals have already been made to this effect; we only have to implement them. I therefore propose that we at last introduce the tax card into the VAT system and treat sales the same, not differently, so as to achieve the aims we have set by actually cutting tax fraud. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In so doing, the institutional balance enshrined in this Treaty will be maintained, as will, more importantly, Parliament’s own prerogatives. Consequently, administrative cooperation does not affect material tax law, which means that it will no longer be required to be subject to the legal bases of Articles 93 and 94. What is crucial, however, is the fight against tax evasion, essential if the single market is to work well, which brings this under the remit of Article 95. I therefore endorse the Commission’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Purvis report, which deals with defining EU rules for personal investments and covers an enormous range of financial products, it appears to be absolutely essential to plug the current gap in the legislation. Indeed, the absence of clear rules regarding such investments has led to their being domiciled off-shore. This clearly damages the EU as a whole and leads to greater risks for more vulnerable investors. Various Member States are preparing to draw up their own legal regimes for hosting this kind of investment. It is therefore absolutely essential to attempt to harmonise and coordinate such regimes forthwith, subordinating them to the greater European interest.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be remembered that we are speaking about innovative investment products offering highly attractive benefits, which means that they will be welcomed and encouraged by the market. Parliament has already looked into the problem of financial derivatives, highlighting the important role they currently play in capital markets, but, more importantly, spelling out the advantages and the risks involved. It therefore appears that the rapporteur is absolutely right that it is of crucial importance that we develop a regulatory regime that acts as an incentive to investors as regards hedge funds. He is also right to point out that legal uncertainty makes it very difficult to make use of derivatives markets in Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur also suggests that the lack of regulation of certain varieties of derivative, such as ‘over-the-counter’ derivatives, represents a serious threat to the markets and especially to finance companies that are increasingly using this type of investment. The amendments tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, addressing these very concerns, represent a significant improvement to the draft text, by guaranteeing greater insurance against the inherent risk in such investment practice, especially by making it compulsory to pass on more detailed and more accurate information to investors. For all of these reasons, the reports by Mrs Kauppi and Mr Purvis before us today, along with the amendments by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, must be approved by this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Before I do so, however, I should like to join Parliament in congratulating Mrs Kauppi on the birth of her son.</p>
<p class="contents">The legal base is an important point. The Commission has founded its proposal on Article 95 because it strongly believes that this measure ought to be adopted under the codecision procedure. However, as Mrs Kauppi predicted, the Council has changed the legal base to Articles 93 and 94. That is very regrettable. It is not the first occasion that the Council has acted in this way. It did so in relation to Directive 2001/44/EC, dealing with mutual assistance on the recovery of tax claims. The Commission and Parliament have challenged this before the Court of Justice, as they have done in other similar cases. The Advocate-General's opinion, however, supported the Council. The Commission nonetheless maintains its stand on the principle, although we shall have to look at the Court's final ruling on the tax recovery case to guide us in our concrete actions on the proposal we are debating today.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, I turn to the equally important Purvis report. The development of offshore funds – in particular but not only hedge funds – is a real concern because of the total lack of information for European markets and financial authorities. So we share the concern expressed by Mr Purvis and other Members of Parliament. We have to find a way to tackle that issue. As Mr Purvis said, in the short term it would be appropriate to find incentives to attract offshore funds onshore. But it remains to be seen whether that is necessary in the longer term. I am particularly unhappy that these enormous offshore funds escape our supervision and control.</p>
<p class="contents">While on the one hand it is important to have a liquid financial market so that the cost of money is not higher than it needs to be, on the other hand we should not allow this situation to continue unchecked for much longer.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, the manner in which we tackle that problem is not all that obvious. If Members – Mr Goebbels, Mr Purvis or others – have ideas on how to regulate these offshore funds, then I would be very happy to receive them and return to Parliament at a later stage to discuss them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
