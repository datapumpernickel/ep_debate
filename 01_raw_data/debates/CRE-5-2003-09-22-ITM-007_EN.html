<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schmidt, Olle (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to begin by thanking my colleagues in the committee for their helpful cooperation. The committee as good as unanimously rejects the Austrian initiative to set up a list of what are known as safe third states.</p>
<p class="contents">All of us want European asylum and refugee policy to be based upon humanitarianism and legal certainty. Most of us want to see regulated immigration and an asylum policy that offers protection and sanctuary to those who are persecuted or tortured or whose lives or health are in danger. Unscrupulous traffickers in human beings must not be protected by the EU’s asylum policy. Nor, however, can asylum policy mean our using gunboats to command vessels containing refugees to heave to or even, as one Italian minister said, using them to fire on such vessels. Nor can it mean treating people who make their way to our part of the world as second-class citizens, moving them around and assembling them in camps outside the borders of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">If, Commissioner Vitorino, the EU cannot successfully integrate immigrants and refugees and provide a framework for an asylum policy characterised by humanitarianism and legal certainty, we have a time bomb ticking away that is just waiting to explode into social and economic tensions within the EU and into external pressure from all those who are outside and want to come in. Let us never forget that the Geneva Convention gives every person his or her own unique right to seek asylum in a foreign country in order to escape persecution and suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal defines a safe third state as one that has ratified the Geneva Convention, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The list of European safe third states includes the current 15 EU Member States and the 12 accession countries, as well as Norway, Iceland and Switzerland. Of the 15 countries that are mentioned on the list, only Switzerland should, however, actually remain on it. Why? On 16 April 2003, the ten Member States signed the accession treaty in Athens whereby the Dublin II Regulation and the Schengen Regulation would, in future, apply to them. Romania and Bulgaria would not be covered by the Dublin II Regulation until the Council had made a decision ‘at a later date’ (Article 6. 2 of the proposal). With regard to Norway and Iceland, the Regulation will also only be applicable, via the Dublin II Regulation and Schengen Acquis, once they have given notice that they accept its content and are incorporating it into their national legal systems. For these reasons, Mr President and Commissioner, only Switzerland would remain on the list, that is to say the list would be very limited.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Commission is called upon to monitor developments in the third states included on the list with regard to their compliance with the aforementioned principles, but the initiative fails to put forward any specific procedure for removing countries from the list or adding them to it. The committee points out that, respecting the subsidiarity principle, any criteria for drawing up a list of safe third states must be seen as minimum standards, which allow the Member States to enforce higher standards. Only four Member States – the UK, Germany, Finland and Denmark – currently have lists of safe third states, either by law or administrative practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee therefore questions whether a regulation is the most appropriate instrument, forcing many countries to implement changes without a political debate on the principles involved. The committee also emphasises that the issue of safe third states is dealt with in the Directive on Asylum Procedures and should be dealt with there in the future too. My remarks about whether a common list really is desirable – which is something I very much question – are of a personal nature.</p>
<p class="contents">The Italian Presidency, which should be present in this House, has promised that the framework Directive on Asylum Procedures will be ready during the autumn. That was also stated in Thessaloniki. We, in this Assembly, have conveyed that we wish to be consulted again once the directive has been redrafted. What is the situation regarding this matter? I had thought of putting the question to the Italian minister, but I cannot see anyone in the minister’s place. It would have been interesting to know whether we shall be consulted on this issue, but that is something Commissioner Vitorino may be able to answer.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we would – all in all and in the light of these arguments – ask Parliament to reject Austria’s initiative tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to make it clear that this is not a Commission initiative. This is an initiative by a Member State. It is an Austrian initiative, drawn up by the Austrian Government, and, in consequence, some of the questions put to me by the honourable Member cannot be answered by the Commission, because this is not a Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Austrian initiative, however, poses a complex problem related to the use in the European asylum system of the concept of safe third countries. The Council has consulted experts who have analysed this issue, and I can say that there is an agreement in principle within the Council in favour of discussing this matter more thoroughly during the next Council meeting on 2-3 October.</p>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Members know, five Member States made a joint declaration in June, calling for the Council to draw up a joint list of safe countries of origin. What the Council is discussing at present is precisely the possibility of including a legal provision on how to define such a list, which could be incorporated into the proposal for a directive – this time a Commission directive – on asylum proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">Linked to this question is another, on which no initiative has as yet been proposed, but which will also be submitted to ministers for discussion on 2-3 October. This is the question of deciding whether a provision of this kind for safe third countries will be included in the directive. That is still an open question at present.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, both the subject of safe countries of origin and that of safe third countries will be discussed at the next Council meeting at the beginning of October. From the Commission’s point of view, moreover, the Council will have to consult Parliament once again on the asylum procedures directive as a whole, including in that consultation any possible provision on safe third countries or safe countries of origin which might eventually come to be included in that directive – which, as I said, has still not been ratified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pirker (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we all know, applications for asylum are normally processed by the first country that we can describe as a ‘safe country’ with which an asylum-seeker makes contact. If this principle is indeed always adhered to, and if there are enough of what we term safe third states, then what will be achieved is the distribution of asylum seekers over many countries and, as a result, speedy decisions enabling a person to know whether or not he is actually going to receive the support due to a refugee. That is what we all want.</p>
<p class="contents">The present situation is unsatisfactory. The Commissioner has himself presented EU statistics showing that a number of countries are at present having great problems with applications for asylum, whilst others have hardly any. Austria, with almost five applicants for asylum per thousand inhabitants, heads this statistical table, followed by Sweden and Ireland, whilst Portugal, Italy and Spain are at the bottom of the scale with 0.1 applications per thousand inhabitants. Comparison of these statistics reveals that Austria has fifty times as many applications to process as do the other states. So I ask you to understand why this initiative has been taken, and that it is to be welcomed, in that its intention is to speed up decision-making in the asylum process. The fact is that there is no stopping either time or the applications already in the pipeline.</p>
<p class="contents">The Austrian initiative is therefore understandable, and it is also necessary. I take a favourable view of it, and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, too, fully supports the substance of an initiative that will give us, in future, a list of safe third states. It does for these two selfsame reasons, that we will both be speeding up procedures and, at the same time, sharing the burden.</p>
<p class="contents">As things now stand, though, it can no longer be fitted in to its ideal slot in the timetable, and so I would welcome it if the attempt could be made – by you, too, Commissioner, I would ask you – to sort out this problem with safe third states, if at all possible, when we deal, as we shortly will, with the procedural directive. We will then not have to do it by means of a specific regulation, which would take up even more time, but would be able to achieve a quick and definite result by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore support the proposal that a better way of handling the whole thing would be for it to be incorporated in the directive, but, apart from that, I am very much in favour – and the Group of the European People’s Party also has an interest in this – of sorting out the problem of safe third states as soon as possible, something that will, in due course, benefit refugees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That vote clearly reflects a broad consensus, at least a procedural one, to the effect that this instrument is not a useful one, and that seeing the initiative through to its conclusion would be a wasted effort. This consensus exists in spite of this initiative’s good intentions with regard to the fundamental issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schmidt has clearly understood that Parliament does not want to turn its attention away from really important matters, and that it is not prepared to take short-cuts which do not actually lead anywhere. That is why I, and my political group, support the rapporteur’s position. In brief, if I may assess the initiative on its own merits and, to an extent, repeat what has already been said here, its overall scope seems extremely limited, both because 10 of the 15 countries classed as safe third countries on the proposed list have already agreed to implement Dublin II and the whole Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span>, and because, as we all know, it is unclear when Bulgaria and Romania will be in a position to be covered by any Community regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">That would make the regulation meaningless, since once Norway and Iceland have incorporated the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis </span>into their national legislation, only Switzerland would remain on the list presented by Austria. Besides, and here also I am reiterating points which seem uncontroversial, it is hoped that the Directive on minimum standards on procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status will be approved rapidly by the Council, as Parliament demanded in the Watson report and as was promised, furthermore, in Seville. If that happens by the end of the year, as we hope, it would quickly render the Austrian initiative obsolete, since this Directive will resolve the fundamental issue of safe third countries. When all is said and done, then, Mr President, that is why today’s debate took place. The fact is that even after Parliament had made a statement on the matter, we were not subsequently consulted about the revised Commission initiative, amended on 18 June 2002. The message we want to send today, therefore, is that we wish to make our point of view known through this debate on asylum procedures. In the final analysis, that is the crux of the matter, and Parliament cannot accept that a joint solution should be postponed and sacrificed in order to accommodate national prejudices or demands. Rather, we must set aside superfluities and hindrances, devoting ourselves without further ado to the task in hand. Precisely in order to avoid any further ado, therefore, I will thank Commissioner Vitorino, who has today shed some light on the matter and made our short debate entirely worthwhile. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, a new directive should be laid down about standards for the recognition of the refugee status as soon as possible, and we should apply minimum criteria in this respect, whereby the Member States may, and can, apply stricter standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe should have specially adapted instruments at its disposal in order to get the asylum problem under control. In Belgium, for example, more than 98% of the asylum applications turn out to be unfounded. The handling of all those cases requires time, manpower and resources that cannot be used to deal with genuine cases. The resultant backlog means that even more files are not dealt with, and, eventually, in that residence permits are granted without any prior investigation. Such inefficiency and laxness only lead to a further influx of bogus asylum seekers. Resources should therefore be found in order to separate the wheat from the chaff, and the list of safe third countries is one of those. It is therefore surprising that the report should question the way in which the list of safe countries relates to the principle of the individual treatment as enshrined in the Geneva Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, it makes no sense whatsoever, on the one hand, to use a list of safe third countries and, on the other, to treat the files originating from those countries in exactly the same manner as the other files. We must have the courage to conclude and recognise that the Geneva Convention needs to be overhauled. This Convention dates back to 1951 and its principal object was to receive refugees from Communist dictatorships. It is a product of the Cold War, and no longer meets today’s needs. Not only should we have a list of safe countries, the principle of territoriality should also be included in it. The places best suited to receive asylum seekers are neighbouring countries in their own regions, so that Europe’s asylum policy is no longer misused on a large scale to circumvent the ban on immigration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We understand the circumstances which led the Austrian Government to suggest it. Those circumstances are highly specific to Austria’s situation, and were clearly explained during the debate by Mr Pirker. We have, on more than one occasion, however, drawn the attention of this House to the problems raised by this type of initiative on the part of Member States occupying the rotating Presidency, since they are often dictated more by internal political exigencies than by an overview either of Community interests or of the healthy development of the legislative framework of the area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">I will also repeat something I have already said once before in this House. It is important to underline the Commission’s role in intelligently implementing the scoreboard established for that area of freedom, security and justice. This initiative raises various complex problems, which have already been mentioned. They include the problem of the regulation itself, which does not really seem to be the most suitable framework for this legislation, for reasons which everyone has outlined; and the issue of compatibility with the Geneva Convention, which was mentioned just now, by which I mean the need for us to take great care to ensure that the existence of lists does not conflict with the logic of individual examination underpinning the principles of the Geneva Convention. What really seems important, however, is that we keep trying to define a common asylum procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with that goal in mind, moreover, the goal of the Directive on that procedure, that we must examine, analyse and debate all of these issues. It was important for Parliament to vote on that Directive, of which there is a new version on which we have not yet been consulted. I would, therefore, like to emphasise the words of Commissioner Vitorino, who mentioned the need for Parliament to vote on that new version in the near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a democrat among the Members who asked for the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be included, as it stands, in the draft Constitution, I cannot agree with his conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the facts and figures expressed very well by my fellow Members, I will make three points.</p>
<p class="contents">The Geneva Convention was drawn up in the middle of the cold war, at a time when the world was one of extremes. The European Union has become a new growth area which, in the majority of States of the world, embodies a hope, a goal to achieve to escape poverty, war and political instability. The tragic escalation of social, religious and ethical tensions and civil wars, cause States to break-up and individuals to despair. Their presence, their exodus towards our countries reminds Europe that poverty and crises are rife on its doorstep. Europe has a specific role to play and the answer is not ‘Fortress Europe’. Yes, we do need a legal framework. Yes, we do need to be very mindful of the decisions we make. I do not believe, however, that a list of safe states is either useful or desirable. Simply by having a list we are contravening Article 3 of the Geneva Convention, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, religion, or country of origin. Not considering a claimant’s request for asylum on the basis of a list of ‘safe’ countries really amounts to denying a refugee his or her most fundamental right, the right to be a fully accepted individual with inalienable rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by saying that there is an urgent need for a European directive in the field of asylum procedure and above all for a concerted Community policy. Without this fundamental legal basis our actions will not allow us to be coherent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
