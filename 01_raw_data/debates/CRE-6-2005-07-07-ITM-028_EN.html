The latest piece of brutality, known as Operation Drive Out Rubbish, involves knocking down whole areas of cities. The UN estimates that more than 200 000 people are without roofs over their heads, and many of them are in danger of dying of cold now. The violent and systematic persecution of Mugabe’s critics is developing into a humanitarian disaster. According to the BBC, Methodist bishops have warned of genocide in the last day or two. The responses from the surrounding world are still too feeble, and the sanctions adopted are scarcely being implemented properly. The worst thing, however, is that the SADC countries, and South Africa in particular, are still protecting Mugabe and accepting the huge sufferings he is inflicting upon his people.</p>
<p class="contents">All this was aired recently in the hearing in the Committee on Development, but there were also proposals about what might be done. First and foremost, the EU must put far greater pressure on both the UN and the SADC, especially South Africa, and so at long last comply with the responsibility it has by virtue of its own strength. Over and above that, it can, in entirely practical terms, increase its support for civil society both within and outside Zimbabwe with a view to developing a human rights culture and producing more documentation about human rights violations. It can increase support for the victims of torture and of organised violence both in Zimbabwe and in exile and it can provide proper legal aid in connection with obviously unjustified legal proceedings brought against human rights campaigners and those who support, or are believed to support, the opposition. There can be support for a free press, with news sent from Britain and neighbouring countries, partly in the form of newspapers published there. All this will cost a lot of money, however. In short, we are pleased about the resolution, but we should like to take the opportunity to emphasise these practical opportunities for offering help, and we hope that the Commission will look sympathetically at them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is most apt that we should have a resolution on Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Operation Drive Out Rubbish’: that is what Robert Mugabe calls his latest atrocity. His government has been responsible for destroying the homes and livelihoods of as many as 1.5 million Zimbabweans. That number will rise if we do not take the necessary action. Just last week a pregnant woman and a four-year-old child were killed during the mass eviction of 10 000 people from the outskirts of Harare. Imagine the pain and suffering, watching helplessly as your home is bulldozed, then to have no knowledge of where you are being taken.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of Amnesty International’s urgent appeal to exert pressure on the Mugabe regime, the African Union last week still refused to condemn President Mugabe. The people of Zimbabwe are victims of a human rights catastrophe. Human rights abuses can never be just an internal matter for a country. It is up to us all to raise our voices in protest and it is even more important that Zimbabwe’s neighbours condemn the atrocities.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should not just raise our voices and then carry on as usual. That is why the return of asylum seekers to Zimbabwe should be halted now. Otherwise EU governments like the UK Government can quite rightly be accused of gross hypocrisy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">President Mugabe played a major role in the fight for independence, both against colonialism and Ian Smith’s white minority regime. During and after that struggle, he always presented himself as the hero of the black majority. In practice, for many years, he did far too little to improve their lot. He seemed to have become a moderate ruler, radical only in his aversion to homosexuality. He was hardly recognisable as the former leader of the fight for an independence that gave the poor hope for a much-changed society, one that would make equality for all people its key priority. Only long after he came into power did he become very radical, particularly towards anyone who threatens, or could threaten, his absolute rule.</p>
<p class="contents">The political opposition, the rich farmers, the poor slums and the market traders became in turn the victims of his activities aimed at intimidating and destroying them. In a previous debate on Zimbabwe, on 16 December 2004, I expressed the assumption that Mugabe had started campaigns of this kind in order to make up for his loss of popularity, trying, through his unexpectedly decisive action, to acquire and mobilise new followers. We now see that his approach can no longer be attributed to clever tactics but rather to the behaviour of someone who is losing his mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of providing better housing for the poor, he is driving them away from the cities by demolishing their dwellings. In this, he is starting to show much likeness to the demented regime that Pol Pot sought to introduce in Cambodia 30 years ago. My group finds it regrettable that this resolution levels exhaustive criticism at Zimbabwe’s neighbour, South Africa, and the African Union, while no attempt is being made to help them solve the problems.</p>
<p class="contents">As long as Europe gives Africans cause to see it as the coloniser that it once was, we will lack the moral authority to be able to contribute to improvement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While a clear picture has yet to emerge, it certainly has all the trappings of a coordinated terrorist attack. Yet again we are reminded of the fragility of our world order and the need to work together to eradicate such barbaric, mindless acts.</p>
<p class="contents">Freedom and democracy are the fundamental tenets of the Union. Just as we continue to espouse these principles within the Union, we need to translate this commitment into tangible actions against regimes that are diametrically opposed to such freedoms. That is why I am lending my wholehearted support to the resolution on Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not sufficient for the international community to indulge in the occasional ritual condemnation of President Mugabe; rather, we need to see a strong and viable opposition to him. If we are truly proponents of a free society, then how can we continue to stand by and allow this dictatorial oppression to continue unabated? Why, as a Union, have we not levied increased pressure against the regime? Why have we not tightened and enforced sanctions? Why has the Council refused to respond to Parliament’s consistent calls in this respect?</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is a great disappointment that South Africa and a number of Zimbabwe’s other neighbours have chosen not to intervene in the plight of the Zimbabwean people. We have witnessed the entire resources of a once wealthy state enslaved. We have seen their people denied their intrinsic human rights, and yet this oppression and destruction has elicited little response from their neighbours. I would suggest to President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa that his choice not to criticise President Mugabe is a very disturbing indictment on his views of what constitutes a fair, free and open society.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when the international community is galvanised to address the endemic problems that Africa faces, it is only appropriate that we look beyond poverty relief to the maintenance of good governance, transparency, the rule of law and respect for human rights for all African countries. I therefore call upon this Parliament to support this resolution wholeheartedly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I extend my deepest sympathy to the victims and their families.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Zimbabwe live under a different sort of terrorism. It is unremitting and comes from the hands of the very authorities that should protect them – the government, the police, the army. The situation there is desperate and deteriorating. Since fixing the election in March, Mugabe has now deliberately destroyed the homes and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of the poorest Zimbabweans, while millions more continue to rely on international food aid for their survival. What does it take before the world responds to this catastrophe?</p>
<p class="contents">Africa is at the top of the agendas of today’s meeting of G8 leaders at Gleneagles and of the UK Presidency of the EU. The focus on Africa is bolstered by the massive wave of popular support for Bob Geldof’s Live 8. All recognise the need for improved aid, debt relief and fair trade. They also all acknowledge that, without good governance, much of the value of such assistance will be destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">The attitude of African governments to Zimbabwe is a true test of their commitment to such good governance, yet South Africa, the key to bringing about change in Zimbabwe, continues its quiet complicity with Mugabe’s oppression. I have asked the British Foreign Secretary and President-in-Office of the Council, Jack Straw, to urge President Mbeki, who is at Gleneagles today, to condemn Mugabe and to use every means at his disposal to bring about change for the better in Zimbabwe.</p>

<p class="contents">I will now turn to Zimbabwe. More than ever, Mugabe seems to be turning into Africa’s Pol Pot. These may be big words, but I read them several times when I leafed through Zimbabwean documents yesterday and the tragedy unfolded there before my very eyes. With his indefensible ‘Operation Drive Out Rubbish’, Mugabe is destroying thousands of shelters in the poor suburbs. All and sundry are being driven into the wintry cold, desperate and not knowing where to go. Many of those driven away voted for the opposition party, Movement for Democratic Change, during the elections in March.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the reactions on the international stage? Neighbouring South Africa claims to be applying tacit diplomacy, but it is so tacit that it is not even being heard in Zimbabwe. The members of the African Union, who met in the Libyan city of Sirte, did not feel it incumbent upon themselves to condemn Mugabe’s regime either. Their excuse is that they do not want to interfere in domestic affairs. The Commission, represented by its President, Mr Barroso, takes the view that we do not need to teach Africa any lessons. The Council seems to appreciate the seriousness of the situation but does little to bring about any real improvement. Together with the United Kingdom and backed by Greece and Denmark, the United States broached the subject of the crisis in the UN Security Council. If the United Nations really wants to do the great things to which it aspires, this is a situation in which it should do them, but sending Anna Tibaijuka, Kofi Annan’s special envoy, to that country will not be enough.</p>
<p class="contents">The world has been watching from the sidelines for far too long, while the dictator Mugabe has gone about his business unpunished, becoming more insolent in the process. At the G8 Summit at Gleneagles in Scotland, poverty was at the top of the agenda. We clearly expect more than the token appeal on the part of the G8 ministers on 23 June to Harare to adhere to the rule of law and respect human rights; an excellent starting point for these world leaders would be this House’s resolution, which is explicit and uncompromising. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to intimidate still more, he mounted ‘Operation Drive Out Rubbish’, the ‘rubbish’ in question being in fact, cynically enough, people, some of whom – having already had to abandon their farms, which had been confiscated, were now losing their homes for the second time, and lacked any means of subsistence.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more than cynical, though, is the behaviour of the African Union, which declines to intervene, and South Africa is playing a key role in this. To President Mbeki, who is in Gleneagles today, I say this: ‘You are personally and politically responsible for what is happening in Zimbabwe, for you have for years been omitting to do what you could to put an end to this human tragedy! If, as is evidently the case, your ‘Old Boy Network’ regards the misery of millions of people as an acceptable price to pay in order to hold on to power, you forfeit the right to govern what has been bequeathed to you by a liberation movement!’</p>
<p class="contents">Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, has at last delivered his trenchant criticism of this behaviour in an interview in today’s issue of the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Council and on all the Member States to make the regime’s pariah status effective at last. You, the Council, are not even prepared to deny this clique entry visas. Those who terrorise their people in this fashion cannot gain the right to attend international conferences by availing themselves of international agreements, yet neither the Council nor our Member States are prepared to administer such a diplomatic slap on the wrist as to refuse them visas. That is another scandal, this time a scandal for European politics. There are certain Member States that are currently capitalising on other Member States’ progressive withdrawal from Zimbabwe by expanding their own presence there, and by so doing, they – all of them – make us this regime’s stooges. The people of Zimbabwe need us, so let us put a stop to this and do something effective at last. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It exported food and provided aid to the other countries in Africa that were less wealthy. Today it is a weak and poor country, and the dictator that rules over it is a great man of narrow interests. Unfortunately, these interests are often also dishonest and bloody.</p>
<p class="contents">Credit is due to the authors of the motion for a resolution for having included the following key idea. Even if we stepped up aid to Africa, and hence to Zimbabwe, we would not be providing much in the way of real assistance unless we also ensured that this aid is backed up by good management, respect for human rights and solidarity in Africa. By this I do not mean solidarity between dictators, but solidarity among societies in support of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Our debate today is concerned with Zimbabwe, but we should also talk about Brussels. For many years now, Parliament has repeatedly asked the Council to take action on this issue, but the Council has acted blind and deaf. This situation is reminiscent of the Polish saying; ‘a beggar talked to a picture, and the picture answered nothing’, with the only difference being that the silent Council is an ugly picture. It is time to give serious thought to real and across-the-board sanctions, and to a boycott to be imposed by the other African countries on Zimbabwe. The European Union, together with the USA and the Commonwealth countries, should exert a certain amount of diplomatic pressure on the African countries to this end.</p>

I do not now intend to repeat what out resolution says; I only wish to say that democracy is a challenging process which requires effort. We cannot even take for granted that it exists where people have sworn to uphold it. Perhaps we need a completely new profession, that of ‘democracy engineer’, to examine the weak points in a society’s structures and conduct an impartial quality control assessment of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">President Mugabe, a former freedom fighter and national hero, has degenerated into a dictator, who guards his own power jealously, and a criminal, and this needs to be analysed. When, a few years ago, we were in Zimbabwe as election observers, we could only wonder at Mugabe, who had the nerve to proclaim during the election that the government would remain, whatever the result. How does such arrogance come about?</p>
<p class="contents">This former fertile African model country is now in a state of chaos. Now its economic structures have disappeared and the country’s plight is worsening the whole time. What is that slow slide from democracy to dictatorship? One keyword is law and order, a condition of the social contract. When he incited people to occupy land illegally, instead of carrying out a controlled land reform himself Mugabe did away with law and order in the country and thus destroyed the viability of its social core. There is also a sequel to this: now Mugabe is using hunger and misery as a weapon against his own people, and is feeding nationalism and blaming colonialism to conceal his own crimes. What is more, by crushing the opposition he is destroying the basis of democratic society.</p>
<p class="contents">For democracy to function, rulers need to be aware of just how dangerous they can be. The possibility of becoming corrupted by power comes from within. The philosopher and theologian, Niebuhr, hit upon a reason for man’s dual nature: our capacity for good makes democracy possible, and our inclination to do bad makes it necessary. Only true democracy guarantees that new faces will replace people who have been corrupted by power.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Louis Michel,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission.</span> <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree more or less with what was said and with what is included in the resolution. Obviously, Mugabe’s regime is an inadmissible one that is doing absolutely unacceptable and abominable things. We agree about that.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, I should like, all the same, to introduce a few qualifications regarding the tactical or strategic responses that are to be made, given the regime that is in place and the means available to us to move things in the right direction. When you speak of sanctions, for example, I obviously share your point of view concerning sanctions directly affecting the Zimbabwean authorities. They definitely must be applied. I would even add: what are we waiting for before applying them? Obviously, I agree. That being said, it needs carefully to be borne in mind that certain types of sanction have harmful repercussions on populations. In general, I am not, moreover, in favour of sanctions. I tend, rather, to be in favour of political dialogue. It has in fact been seen how, when they affect populations, sanctions generally rebound upon those who apply them, rather than target the authorities at whom they were directed. That is the first thing I wanted to say.</p>
<p class="contents">What I should now like to say, I say in the knowledge that my comments make me vulnerable to criticism. It would not, however, be right for me not to let you know my feelings regarding this debate. It is very easy for us, as Europeans, to issue press releases almost every day, denouncing and attacking Mugabe. You should be aware, however, that, every time Mugabe is attacked, his symbolic importance as a black hero in relation to the evil white colonisers is reinforced. As someone – Mr Meijer, I think – said a few minutes ago, Mugabe is clearly making use of this vicious circle to rehabilitate himself politically and in the popular imagination. That needs to be acknowledged.</p>
<p class="contents">There is something else you ought to know, too. Otherwise, you will not be fully informed. Together with yourselves, I certainly recognise that maximum pressure has to be exerted, but it has to be exerted in a subtle way. What also needs to be understood is that the leaders of the other African countries, whom you denounce for not daring to adopt positions, or make value judgments, on Mugabe’s behaviour are put in difficult positions in their own countries every time Mugabe reinforces his symbolic, not to say heroic image. You need to know this and you also need to know that it is extremely difficult for Mr Mbeki, and I would say straight away that the old boy network …</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(In response to heckling by one MEP, Mr Michel breaks off)</span></p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">... </span>no, but of course not, there is no old boy network; I am sorry; it is an insult to the South African President to speak of an old boy network.</p>
<p class="contents">What Mr Mbeki and other African leaders in the region fear is, in reality, that the phenomenon of violence and of an anti-colonialist uprising somewhere might spread into neighbouring countries. I have on many occasions broached this issue with the representatives of the African Union and with the various Heads of Government of these neighbouring countries. I am able to tell you that they certainly want to put pressure on President Mugabe, but that they want the conditions to exist for doing so. In order to bring those conditions about, it is not enough, moreover, for the community outside Africa to relaunch the debate and wave the threat of sanctions, insisting on more of these and on the need to take a harder line. Firstly, what is meant by the need to take a harder line? Someone tell me what has to be done. Do troops need to be sent in? What should be done? President Barroso was extremely vigorous in his condemnation of Mugabe’s attitude following the expulsions that took place recently. I should like someone to explain to me what, apart from that and apart from the vengeful, sometimes cavalier, press releases and the routine chest-baring, is meant by taking a harder line. Alternatively, we could engage in a debate on the duty, or right, to interfere. I personally am ready to engage in that debate. I am not indifferent to such a debate. I suspect, however, that, on the day that the demand is made in this House for troops to be sent to Zimbabwe to bring about order there – in which case, the agreement of the African Union will still be required – great harm will be caused to Africa and to its regional institutions. I also very much doubt that any candidates would be found in this House for assembling the bulk of the troops needed.</p>
<p class="contents">All I want to say is that an attempt at coherence is needed when points of view are defended. We are not just a sounding board. The European bodies, and I too, need at some point to be told precisely what these additional things are that need to be done. There is no end of condemnation going on. I met President Konare in Syrte four days ago, together with President Barroso. Our conversation basically consisted of our saying: but, President, why do you yourselves, as the African Union, not condemn Mugabe’s conduct? To which he would reply: but, my dear friend, every time you attack Mugabe, you make matters much more difficult for us because our peoples do not consider Mugabe to be a tyrant or dictator; they consider Mugabe basically to be standing up to the evil colonisers, embodying genuine resistance and being faithful to history. That is what I hear, and I believe it.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though I know that this is impossible, there is almost a need, for a few weeks, to adopt a low profile and not to talk too much about all this. I am almost convinced that doing so would put the African Union, the regional organisations, President Mbeki and others in a position to exercise their peer review duty. I am almost convinced that you would be putting them in a position to do this. As long as we continue ostentatiously to lambast Mugabe’s attitude with press releases and calls for vengeance, we shall not – and I am sorry to have to tell you this – be able to obtain the judgment we await from the African Union and the African organisations. It is only by obtaining such a judgment that we can in the end exercise influence. That is what I believe. I do not think that there is any other way in which we shall succeed in doing this. That is something you should know.</p>
<p class="contents">I spend a lot of time in those African countries, and I am utterly dismayed to see this vicious circle whereby the more tyrannical Mugabe is and the more the European Union and other international bodies intervene to condemn him, the more popular he is. If, however, this vicious circle did not exist, Mugabe would undoubtedly not last for long, for it is only through this mechanism that he holds on to power. What Mr Meijer said is true: it is this mechanism that is the key.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, there is a need to be very careful when attacking the African Union and the African leaders in the region. I absolutely deny that we are the poodles of Mugabe’s regime. I can tell you that I myself am by no means any such thing, and I can say this after having tried on many occasions to get things moving in South Africa. At one point, South Africa tried to convince Mugabe to transform his government into a government of national unity, opening it up to Mr Tsvangirai and his party. At one point, things had moved in the right direction. Then, along came the sanctions, which again created an extremely difficult climate.</p>
<p class="contents">I vigorously condemn Mugabe’s attitude. I believe that the planned measures and sanctions should be applied against the Zimbabwean authorities. There is no reason for not applying them. That goes without saying. I agree with most of what is contained in the resolution. I am simply trying to explain to you the limits of what we can usefully do, because the problem is, in fact, one of doing things that are of use. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
