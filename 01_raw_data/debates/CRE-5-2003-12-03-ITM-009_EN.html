<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van den Berg (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, Europe must do better on behalf of its citizens. That means dealing successfully with more cross-border problems, and in a more democratic manner. Order should be restored to our European home, at which citizens from across the EU are casting quite sceptical glances.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past year, we had a Convention which resulted in a Constitution, at least in draft form. That is, in itself, very good news for the European citizens, as we have mentioned before.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other ways of restoring order to our European home, though. The report I am presenting to you this evening on behalf of our Commission is also about better, more democratic and more transparent governance. Even without adapting the European treaties, we can implement substantial reforms. Enhancing European governance is one of the Prodi Commission's key strategic objectives for the period 2000-2004. In 2001, we issued the White Paper on European Governance, on which we in this House gave our opinion. Two years later, we are doing the same thing again, only this time it is about progress in respect of the same White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Some important achievements have been made. For example, in April 2002, the Commission started simplifying legislation, which was reduced by no fewer than 35 000 pages. This is an important contribution to the simplification of European governance. In addition, the Commission has published plans in the field of consultation of regional and local authorities, of organisations in the civil society and for consultation with experts. I should like to return to some of these subjects, but what matters now is for all of these plans to be implemented. Not merely lip service, but concrete action!</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can do a great deal more in order to actively bring Europe closer to the citizen. I have, in this report, made various proposals to this effect. The first, and most important, proposal is, in my opinion, that all legislative proposals should be subject to a so-called citizens' criterion. This means that for every law that the Commission lays down, it should think about their social, ecological and economic impact on everyday life of the citizens for whom these are established. That is the only way of ensuring that we come down from our ivory tower and that we no longer issue laws in a vacuum or from the top down. I would call on my fellow MEPs and the Commission to support this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Parallel to this, I should like to place special emphasis on the Commission’s use of experts at an early stage in the legislative process. First of all, I have to say that experts are extremely useful. Secondly, I have to note that there is an enormous jungle and also a proliferation of expert groups, both on a permanent and on an ad-hoc basis. There are 850 groups of experts and another 500 or more sub-groups. Nobody, not even the Commission, quite knows exactly who is involved in these. Parliament has already urged the Commission to publish clear lists specifying which experts can be consulted on which topics. In that way, Parliament and the Council, and I even think the Commission, gain a clear insight into who exactly examines these legislative proposals and into the fundamental policy choices that are made during the policy-forming process. When those lists become available, this will benefit us all. I would call on the Commission finally to do something about these lists after three years of promises, for we want a parliamentary democracy and not a democracy of experts.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point that I have mentioned is Global Governance. Multilateralism and a broad concept of safety, which include peace and security, but also the fight against poverty and sustainable development, have always been at the heart of foreign policy. It is time for the European Union, the UN’s largest economic superpower, to commit itself to spreading its values at world level during the reform of multilateral institutions. However, we want the EU to speak with one voice in this respect, starting, if possible, with one seat in the Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, turning to the consultation of organisations, I have quite specifically underlined the need for local and regional authorities to be among the bodies consulted. 'Europe begins in the regions'. After all, it is the regions where policy is to be implemented and where many of Europe's funds are spent. The regions are also the places with which citizens identify, sometimes even more so than with their own capitals, certainly when regions transcend borders. That is why it is important for regional authorities to have their own voice and to be given this in the legislative process. The Commission has grasped this well and is showing itself willing to do something about this. We would now like to see this translated into action.</p>
<p class="contents">On the same subject, Mr MacCormick has drafted a very important report on tripartite contracts and agreements. These contracts with Member States and regional authorities can be a very useful instrument, enabling Europe to start to bring the region nearer and give it actual shape. European governance thus becomes more efficient and moves closer to the citizen. We warmly support the gist of Mr MacCormick's report.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to emphasise here that it is the responsibility of all institutions to achieve credible, transparent and democratic governance. It is not simply the responsibility of the Commission, but of all Institutions. This is why, in this report, we call for an interinstitutional agreement in the area of consultation, to be binding upon all institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The reforms contained in the White Paper on Governance are of major importance for Europe and for its citizens. What matters now is for us to roll up our sleeves and get down to business. I thank you for the slightly extended speaking time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">MacCormick (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, my report is on the proposal for tripartite contracts and agreements between the European authorities and the Member States, and local and regional authorities. This is, one might think, rather a mouthful for what is essentially a simple idea.</p>
<p class="contents">The point is, as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy pointed out in its opinion on this matter, much of the implementation of important aspects of European policy environmental policy, regional policy and other policies, including transport is carried out in Member States at a level of government below that of the centralised state government. And yet there is a danger of inadequate connection between the Commission, at the centre, and local and regional government. Any steps that can be taken to improve these connections are greatly to be welcomed and much to be encouraged. The Commission's proposal on tripartite contracts and agreements is a proposal for precisely such an improvement, and therefore my Group strongly welcomes it. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and the Environment Committee also welcome it and wish to carry it forward.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the first pilot arrangements in terms of a tripartite agreement was among cities. It was based on the idea of a sustainable city for example Birmingham, Stockholm and other cities in the Union. It was about trying to figure out ways to make sustainability make sense. One of the interesting facts I discovered in reading a report on that pilot project was that the city of Birmingham could write to the central government in London and go for weeks or months without receiving a reply. Central governments in Member States are often very bad at maintaining adequate contact with local and city authorities and with city regions.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are going to make progress in implementing policies in Europe, it is obvious that we must make sure there is interaction between central government, local government and government at the European level. It is important to stress and I address in particular my friend and opponent Mr Bradbourn on this point that this suggestion for tripartite contracts and agreements is not only a suggestion about regional government of which I know Mr Bradbourn disapproves it is also a suggestion about local government, of which I rather think he and his party strongly approve. We must ensure that there is real contact and connectivity and that we get things moving.</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes in this House we use the word 'region' in a very misleading sense. For example, Scotland, the constituency which I represent, is for some purposes called a region. But most of the inhabitants of Scotland think it is a nation within a multinational state. And Scotland itself has extremely varied regions. Only yesterday I was visiting the South of Scotland Partnership, who were discussing some of the particular problems facing the rural south of Scotland, which is very different linguistically, culturally, socially and agriculturally from central Scotland and from highland Scotland. They raised with me the problem of the town - the old borough. Nowadays it is very difficult to sustain small towns. Cities and regions have great identity but towns, in our local government system, have lost that. The sustainable city is currently being trialled as a pilot project. What about the sustainable town?</p>
<p class="contents">We must look at governance in Europe at many levels: the region, the locality, and entities which are lower than the locality in terms of current governmental structures. All these things matter. The report adopted by the Constitutional Affairs Committee needs to be amended, not in such a way as to break the spirit of what was agreed in that Committee, but in a way that completes that spirit by building in some of the points agreed on by the Environment Committee, all of the points agreed on by the Legal Affairs Committee, and some of the things which have emerged from the pilot projects under way.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly commend the report in its amended form to the House, and I very much hope that it will be carried in the vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission is grateful for Parliament’s support for its initiatives seeking to produce better regulation, by for example arranging impact assessments, setting minimum requirements for the consultation of stakeholders, laying down guidelines for the collection and use of expertise and simplifying Community legislation. Next week the Commission will table its annual report entitled ‘Better Lawmaking 2003’, which will for the first time provide an overview of all of the work currently underway to improve regulation and policy-making in the EU. With the same intention, Parliament, the Council and the Commission recently concluded the 2003 Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Lawmaking. This is a major step in the right direction and ensures that the competences of all of the institutions will be fully respected in our future work to achieve better regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, however, I should like to focus on the two key issues that have been raised by Mr van den Berg, namely the consultation of stakeholders or interested parties and the advice that experts should contribute. What are the principles and minimum standards for the consultation of interested parties? Our first task is to provide a coherent and transparent framework for the consultation of these groups. Here the Commission fully shares the European Parliament’s opinion that consultation cannot be a substitute for parliamentary democracy and emphasises that the aim of having minimum requirements for consultation is to give stakeholders a voice, but not a vote. In other words, this is not about deciding, but about being heard. The representatives of the people of Europe will still have to decide. Neither will these measures impact on the institutional role of the two advisory bodies, the EESC and the CoR.</p>
<p class="contents">The general principles and minimum requirements for consultation set out by the Commission could also serve as a basis for a further interinstitutional agreement. The Commission also agrees with Parliament that the consultation process must not be allowed to slow down the legislative process and stresses that the minimum eight-week consultation period for public consultations strikes a good balance between the need for efficient decision-making and gaining the necessary input from external parties. To make the consultation process more transparent, the Commission has published a formal and structured list of advisory bodies. This information can be retrieved from the database of advisory bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">Establishing guidelines for the collection and use of expertise is a further important Commission measure to improve the way in which initiatives are prepared. As we have underlined in the White Paper, European governance standards for the collection and use of expertise need to be improved. The guidelines, which apply to any Commission services calling on and using expert advice, seek precisely to guarantee that high standards and tried and tested practices form an integrated part of the working culture of all of the Commission services.</p>
<p class="contents">Careful preparation, however, is not the only way in which the Commission needs to improve the quality of its work; it must also make this process more transparent. For this reason, next week the Commission will be adopting a new standard explanatory memorandum for all of its proposals, which will make it necessary to explain the reasoning and facts underlying each one. This decision also covers expert knowledge and the consultation of interested parties.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to turn to Sir Neil MacCormick’s report on tripartite contracts and agreements. The approach adopted in this report is in tune with the Commission proposal and is as ambitious as it is sensible. It is ambitious, because it seeks to enhance the status of local and regional authorities and to give them increased responsibility for implementing Community regulations and measures, something which is being advocated increasingly vociferously. This should bring the Union’s regions closer to each other. The conclusion of tripartite contracts or agreements may be an interesting development when implementing particular Community policies. At the same time, however, it is also a sensible approach, because we do not question the need to proceed step by step. The Commission had the same idea in mind when it adopted the communication on tripartite contracts and agreements last December, as it had promised to do in the White Paper on European Governance. There too we proposed first to have a trial period. This phase has already begun. In environment policy, work is already underway in three European cities on an initiative to conclude a tripartite agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Tripartite agreements might also soon be concluded as part of measures to implement the Sustainability Pacts initiative. In regional policy, the Commission is convinced that greater decentralisation is needed. Tripartite contracts between the Commission, the Member State and the region might possibly form part of a new system to implement the Structural Funds. In addition, this would also transfer even more responsibility to the regions and those involved in regional development.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, however, exercise a degree of caution. Firstly, as the rapporteur has requested, we must take stock of the pilot phase and evaluate the results. Secondly, we need to consider what legal, political or institutional stumbling blocks might in certain cases lie in the way of using such agreements. In regional policy in particular, I should therefore like to draw a distinction between two phases: the phase of determining the development strategy, where greater involvement on the part of authorities below the State level is desirable – provided that it is compatible with the constitutional system of the Member State concerned – and then the implementation phase. Here we need to consider what impact these new contracts might have on applying the rules on the use of budgetary resources and on the obligations that the Commission has to discharge as the guardian of the treaties. In addition, we need to check to what extent there is a danger of the Commission having to take on extra administrative and monitoring tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to assure the rapporteur that, in accordance with his wishes, the Commission fully intends to involve Parliament in the implementation and evaluation of future tripartite agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the central idea which the rapporteur has taken up very well in his main report.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I believe that significant progress has been made in recent months with the conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement, between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, on the improvement of Community legislation. I believe this is an issue on which we will continue to work, as the Commissioner himself, Mr Fischler, has said.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me essential, however, to point out that there is a mistaken idea that the reduction of Community legislation reduces the total amount of legislation. Nothing could be more wrong, because every time we adopt a Community rule we are simplifying the legislation by replacing 15 pieces of national legislation. And it is not that I am in favour of adopting Community rules just for the sake of it, but, at the moment, we are dealing with a genuine legislative jungle. Only very positive action by the European Union can put an end to the national legislative jungle which prevents the proper functioning of the European institutions and the European market, the internal market, which is one of our objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not, therefore, one of those people who call on the Commission to legislate less or who propose less legislation. I would ask it to legislate more when it is necessary, because if it does not fulfil its legislative function we will continue with this jungle which, furthermore, can only increase. With 25 Member States each Community rule represents a genuine legislative simplification and the way ahead does not involve a reduction in the Community acquis but in strengthening it and consolidating it.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr van den Berg. I hope that tomorrow we can approve this report without any great difficulty.</p>

<p class="contents">The Commission communication on which this debate is based, and to which Commissioner Fischler made a timely reference earlier, proposes tripartite contracts and agreements committing the Community, the States and regional and local authorities. It proposes this in order to make Community rules adaptable to situations that are characterised by significant environmental and demographic diversities as well as to the political diversities of the Union, from transport policy to regional, territorial policies and so on. This is an important decision, although it must be noted that it will start an experimental phase in which we must take stock in order to learn the necessary lessons, which will partially be procedural ones but which – as has already been said – will also concern the best management of Community regional policies. We know that, in any case, these are agreements bound by an obligation of compatibility with the Treaties regulating the life of the European Union and adjustments that must not hinder the functioning of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, the principle to which the Commission refers in this communication, which is accurately interpreted in the MacCormick report, is that of flexibility. This principle entails respecting the various constitutional systems of the States of the Union, but it recognises that in some States there are constitutional systems that assign huge responsibilities to regional and local authorities, which must not be reduced despite the fact that, in such cases, the need for greater democratic participation must not cause imbalances that would run counter to the guidelines produced by the constituent Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Tripartite contracts cannot, however, derogate from the provisions of secondary law applicable throughout the territory of the European Union because – as I mentioned earlier – it is only in this way that they remain coherent with the guidelines of the constituent Convention. We need to improve the implementation of Community policy. It is, therefore, important that the tripartite agreements and contracts define clear objectives based on the need to give due consideration to diversity throughout the territory of the European Union, although, on the basis of these experiences, it will then be possible to look again at a policy for the management of Community policies that goes beyond the issue of diversity and tackles the more general issue of democracy in greater depth without, however, compromising – and I believe that this must be emphasised – the uniform enforcement of Community law across the entire European area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to stress how necessary it is for the intra-State administrations to collaborate, increasing subsidiarity, in order to achieve the objectives which we have set in the majority of programmes and projects stemming from the European cohesion and environmental policies, and also in order to guarantee sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">I am thinking of the FIFG funds and programmes for the fisheries sector, or LEADER + for agriculture for the target regions of FEDER or the URBAN and Interreg projects, amongst others, in which the participation and responsibility of the territorial bodies is so essential.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also convinced, however, that the fact that a significant proportion of the important Community resources which are budgeted for are not used – the so-called RALs – is due to the fact that the regional and local autonomous governments, which execute the majority of projects, have not so far been able to participate in the early phase, either in the drawing up of policies, or in the adoption of strategies, or in the identification of legal obligations prior to drawing up of the respective European programmes. It is time to put things right, to come down from Mount Olympus and to share decision-making with the other institutions which are closer to the reality on the ground and the reality of the citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope I will be able to respond to a number of the points he made in his opening remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of current events in the UK, this report centres on an extremely important issue. The UK Deputy Prime Minister a hapless fellow if ever there was one is trying to foist regional governance upon our own electorate. This unwanted and completely unnecessary tier of politicians is symbolic of the UK's recent shift towards regionalisation. I have no doubt this move is directly related to the President of the Commission's call for the development of a 'Europe of the regions'. This report, and the Commission proposal that lies behind it, certainly echo this call. By drawing up contracts directly with the regions, the Commission can enter into legally-binding agreements with local and regional bodies on regional and other policy issues such as the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">If these proposals go ahead, one can imagine all manner of projects and policies which could be foisted on the UK by the back door. This move clearly represents a slippery slope towards a system where the prerogatives of national governments are diminished and those of the regions are enhanced. It appears to me that the Commission is attempting progressively to break down the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe into bite-sized chunks, aided and abetted, in this case, by our own government.</p>
<p class="contents">British Conservatives are opposed to any measure which would bolster such a development. I shall certainly vote against this report tomorrow in plenary. Quite simply, we cannot accept a situation where the Commission foists upon us any changes to the UK's government structures. If we accept that the EU can deal directly in any way with the regions, we are compromising national integrity, and the nation as the prime building-block of the EU. This report represents an unacceptable interference in the governance of individual countries, and I reject the approach entirely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to stress the vital importance of an ever more transparent administrative culture in the European Union if we are to gain the approval of its citizens. Obscurity leads to complete darkness, as we know. It is essential to simplify legislation. The public must be able to understand how this whole place works, and it is absolutely necessary to replace mind-boggling legal texts with something that is more streamlined, and I am in favour of that. It is unnecessary to regulate the details, as has been mentioned here. That is our disease.</p>
<p class="contents">I would nevertheless like to make one additional amendment, which is already contained in this report. The Union supports the one-stop shop principle in all areas. According to this, people can always obtain the information and forms they need at one and the same point. As yet, however, the different institutions of the Union do not share a common website where the public could follow the progress of legislation. Discussions by Parliament, the Commission and the Council on legal issues and other projects should be accessible at one website address. The institutions at least need a common portal, like a one-stop shop, where all the necessary links can be found.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and Parliament have become more transparent, but the Council has not. The Council is to have more power, which means more obscurity. This issue has to be addressed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I should like to thank you for your constructive contributions to this debate on the two reports. Secondly, I should like to address a few of the points that have been raised. I think – as Mr Medina Ortega rightly pointed out – that the main way in which European legislative initiatives will be simplified is that in the future it will be possible to consolidate 25 different legal acts into one single one. I do not believe that this can be stressed enough, particularly given that the institutions of the European Union are, as we know, constantly being accused of being somewhat legislation-happy. The reality is rather different. You are probably aware that we did actually look into this a few years ago and it turned out that the Member States introduce more new pieces of legislation every year than the Community has introduced since its inception. This is a clear indication that you are right to make this assertion. Nevertheless, this does not absolve us from our obligation also to organise our European laws properly: organise their preparation, but also how they are structured, so that they meet the appropriate standards of transparency and clarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, however, it will be important to identify what these days we often refer to as ‘European added value’, because any legislative initiatives with no such added value should have a large question mark over them. This is an important point, particularly in the light of the new European constitution, which specifically states that legislation should be subject to such a test.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as tripartite contracts are concerned, I certainly do believe that it is sensible to conclude such tripartite contracts, and I do not agree with Mr Bradbourn, who thinks that they would ride roughshod over national interests. For a start, one of the three parties to these contracts will be the Member State. Without the agreement of the Member State such a contract does not even come into being. I therefore do not understand your fears at all. I would tend to see this the other way round. I regard it as important, particularly for example in structural policy or in my own area, rural development policy, for us to make greater use of the bottom-up approach and to allow that to become a reality, because this gives the people on the ground a better idea of who is responsible for their problems. That is how you should look at it, and that is why we have also taken the precaution of first having a trial period and then an evaluation. That is as it were the icing on the cake. Having said this, I should like to thank you once more for giving such a favourable response to these reports.</p>
