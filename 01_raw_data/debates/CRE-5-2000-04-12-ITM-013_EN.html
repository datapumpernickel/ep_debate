I welcome the compromise we have reached on the Community action programme “Youth” and the outcome of the conciliation procedure. Although some prayers remained unanswered, the parliamentary delegation could be satisfied with EUR 520 million for the seven year term, with a review clause on the accession of the candidate countries in Central and Eastern Europe. I would like to thank all those who took part for their cooperation, particularly Commissioner Reding and her offices, the Portuguese President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Fontes, who certainly did not have an easy time of it at the hands of the Finance Ministers, and I would also like to thank the youth forum for its input. The negotiations for the Youth programme have dragged on for around one and three quarter years. We have drastically amended the original proposal by the Commission, which envisaged combining the existing programmes “Youth for Europe” and the European Voluntary Service in one five year programme. The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport tabled 61 amendments at first reading, aimed at achieving a balanced weighting of the various parts of the programme and using the distinctly larger budget to enable more young people than the 500 000 or so that had already benefited hitherto, to enjoy the experience of an exchange programme.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We wanted to simplify administrative structures and do more to develop disadvantaged young people. The Commission adopted a raft of amendments put forward by Parliament, however the Council was unable to reach agreement on a common position concerning EUR 350 million for a five-year programme. At second reading, the European Parliament concentrated on 13 Amendments, focusing largely on the Budget, on a seven-year term following the example of Socrates and Leonardo, and on a flexible age limit and social protection in matters of comitology.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Immediately after second reading, I entered into informal negotiations with the Finnish Presidency, so as not to lose any time and so as to ensure the programme makes a seamless transition at the beginning of the new millennium. We have the Council to thank for the fact that the conciliation procedure was not opened until the Portuguese Presidency took office. The Council accepted neither our budget proposal of EUR 980 million nor the well-founded compromise from the Commission of EUR 765 million.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">At the second meeting of the conciliation committee we were able, following difficult negotiations, to reach agreement on all issues. The seven-year term with a budget of EUR 520 million and the review clause following the accession of central and eastern European countries was a coup on the part of the European Parliament delegation. The fact that we secured social protection for the young participants from their home country, and sickness insurance cover in the host country was another coup, likewise the fact that age limits are to be kept flexible and not rigid.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">But, as rapporteur, I welcome the fact that the Youth programme is enabling us to send out a signal that the programme really is open to all young people. Both boys and girls are participating in the programme, and we have opened it to students, the unemployed, young people from the Member States, candidate countries or third countries. We have made it possible to hear more about young people’s needs and ideas over the Internet, and to engage in active dialogue with them. Who could imagine a better opportunity and better advertisement for the European core values?</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Provided we make intelligent use of it, the Youth Programme could help to overcome Europe fatigue, and optimist that I am, I believe it could generate enthusiasm for Europe. Therefore my advice to you all is to make use of the opportunities that the new youth programme has to offer. I would recommend that you vote in favour of the joint text on the introduction of the Community action programme “Youth”.</p>

In view of this historic event, we should focus our gaze on the fifty years that lie ahead for the European Community. When the next major anniversary is celebrated though, we will no longer be there to continue building our joint European edifice. This is something our descendants are going to have to do. Now is the time to take steps to smooth the way for them. </p>
<p class="contents">The new “Youth” action programme is the way to further European integration. Young people are Europe’s future. We should do everything we can to make sure that the young people of today feel completely at home in the European Community, better still that they develop close ties with it. Therefore it was, and still is, absolutely essential to create a programme that offers all young people – as Mrs Gröner has already said – irrespective of their origins, educational background, knowledge of languages, study or training, the opportunity to make contact with Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">This is a major innovation on the part of the Youth Programme i.e. that it is open to all young people, unlike the existing programmes, each of which covers a specific area. The new programme closes the gap, as it were, between the youth and educational programmes that are already running. Parliament, as well as the Commission and the Council, saw that there was a need for this programme, even if, as the rapporteur has just said, considerable hurdles had to be overcome in relation to the financial framework. We have the personal commitment of all the participating parliamentarians to thank for the fact that a compromise of EUR 520 million could be reached. I would like once again to take the opportunity to thank all those who haggled over every euro in the course of the conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Gröner said, even if the financial framework fell a long way short of our aspirations, still a large number of amendments were adopted. The new programme is more comprehensible and more citizen-friendly. The level of social protection for the participants has been improved. The programme has been heavily decentralised so as to enable young people in our home regions to take part in actions</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Our Group endorses the programme, so as to spare young people having to wait any longer for their programme.</p>

This report had a long gestation period. But the fact that we are still here so early in the morning is a tribute to the rapporteur’s work on this programme and, indeed, that of the Commissioner and the Portuguese presidency – which has shown itself to be committed to youth, to the voluntary service and to education in its broadest sense. The report we have ended up with now is more closely targeted, with an emphasis on social protection and, as the rapporteur has said, a more flexible approach than in earlier reports.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have more money in the programme in recognition of its importance. We will always ask for more money. The budget is not enough. It is perhaps Parliament’s role to ask for more. But we can be pleased with the outcome. We can be sure that whatever money we have in this programme will be directed at youth and will, in the long-term, be money well spent.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur that this money and this programme will ensure that the efforts are targeted not just at some small sections of society but, as the Commissioner said in a previous report, at all sections of society. We must look to those who will benefit most and those who are in greatest need and who might otherwise be socially excluded.</p>
<p class="contents">We are delighted that some candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe will benefit as well. We can be pleased with our efforts and pleased with this report. In seven years’ time we will look back at the youth of today who will have benefited from this report and be pleased that this was the beginning of real progress.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank the Council and the Commission for contributing to our at long last achieving a good result. The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is very happy to support those initiatives which give young people in Europe opportunities to acquire knowledge, skills and qualifications which will help form the basis of their future development. The strength of the programme is, of course, that, by means of cross-national exchanges, it encourages young people to contribute actively to further European integration. It will also lead to understanding of the cultural and linguistic diversity within the European Union. I also think that the programme will ensure that the fundamental values upon which the European Union is founded will continue to be propagated. Through increased communication between young people in Europe, the programme will indirectly help combat xenophobia and increase respect for human rights. Finally, the Community’s action programme for youth also gives consideration to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union, something which we in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party believe to be of crucial importance to all EU programmes. I would recommend that we support this programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a very good report. Youth is the sector in our Community that is so often ignored. Indeed in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport it is the “Cinderella” sector of funding, as with sport. We hope that imbalance will be redressed.</p>
<p class="contents">The insufficient commitment to youth affairs from the Council, when the European Parliament was calling for EUR 980 million, shows, in my view, this grave disparity and the lack of commitment on the part of the Council to a very important sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The danger, in this regard, with the changes that are proposed, of combining two programmes – Youth for Europe and the European Voluntary Service – is that several good parts of both those programmes might be lost. I hope that does not happen. We should include the best parts of those excellent initiatives in whatever programme we formulate in future.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Youth Programme emphasises the developing links with the youth of entrant countries. That is an excellent initiative. The bridges built between youth will be the bridges that eventually unite Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement to constantly review the situation is an initiative that I welcome. When more funds are needed, budgets should not be cast in stone but be flexible so that they can be amended in the best interests of the deserving needs of youth. What more deserving cause could there be than supporting youth in the European Union.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is in fact the case that all politicians ought to feel a sense of responsibility for this programme and take it particularly seriously, for if we do not succeed in convincing young Europeans, who could pass these convictions further down the line, the European edifice is on shaky ground. We must therefore do everything we can to create the conditions that will enable girls and boys to feel at home in the Europe we have created, and to respect and appreciate the differences between people.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">This youth programme is an important instrument for teaching people to show mutual understanding and display tolerance. Voluntary activities in the environmental and cultural spheres help people to learn what Europe is really all about and also to learn other languages. Interpersonal contact alone facilitates the acquisition of democratic values and promotes understanding on the part of European citizens. That is what this programme is intended to achieve. I feel now is also the time to say that it is not on for Austrian young people to be excluded from taking part in these programmes as a consequence of so-called bilateral sanctions. This is misguided and should be contested by everyone, and particularly by this Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">This new programme has enabled us to consolidate and improve on previous youth activities. Thanks to our proposed amendments we have also improved the level of social protection for participants. Of course the total amount that has now been made available does not suffice, although concerted action on our part enabled us to get more out of the Council than they wanted to give. But the total amount gives the lie to the Ministers who get up on their soapboxes to speak! I am certain, however, that we will make the best of it, and many young people will benefit as a result</p>
<p class="contents">I would also very much like to thank Mrs Gröner for taking on this mammoth task and still being able in the end to reach a satisfactory outcome with the Council and the Commission. Thank you very much and the best of luck! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We welcome the exchange programme because it reinforces mutual trust between the young people of different countries and encourages mutual tolerance, and a willingness to cooperate and show solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">What goes on in the heads of young people of today has a special resonance for the future development and functioning of the European Union and European consciousness. I would like to concentrate on two Articles in particular: firstly Article 4 (2), because it refers to the fact that our overriding concern must be to ensure that when young people apply to the programmes they do not encounter any form of discrimination. Then there is Article 2(1), because it states that participation in cross-border exchange programmes within the Community will further young people’s understanding of Europe’s common core values, thereby increasing respect for human rights and stepping up the fight against racism. I am emphasising these two aspects because, as Mrs Pack has already said, the sanctions against Austria are having most impact on cultural organisations, and the educational and scientific spheres, as well as on scientific cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">This contradiction illustrates how un-European and discriminatory these sanctions are, and how much they conflict with the Community of law and values. We endorse the “Youth” action programme and reject the uncalled-for sanctions against Austria! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In her task she has enjoyed the very strong support of the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport. I offer them my thanks for their work.</p>
<p class="contents">The Youth programme is crucial to the European Union, as you have all already said, because it is a unique programme, in which all young people, without distinction, can participate. I would like to reassure all Members who have spoken about possible sanctions. In the Youth programme and in the way it is implemented, there will be no sanctions against anyone, and that includes young Austrians, who will not be discriminated against. The programme has ambitious objectives, which are essential to the development of the idea of European citizenship. </p>
<p class="contents">This programme will encourage and consolidate the continuation and development of innovative actions at Community level and will help to improve the quality of the action undertaken on behalf of young people. It therefore represents a useful instrument in assisting a policy of cooperation and will contribute to the process of European integration. In addition to ensuring that the programme is effectively implemented, I wish to make a commitment before this House that I will encourage a process of structured and regular cooperation with Member States, in order to work towards drawing up action plans that are up to the task of the challenges, and without which the programme would be less effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I wish to take this opportunity to talk about the youth policy of the future. In fact, I stood before you for the first time last September. I spoke of the White Paper on the European Union’s youth policy, which is a priority. I would now like to clarify the role of this White Paper and the role of political catalyst that youth policy must play in the future. I hope to prepare the White Paper on the basis of broad consultation with the different parties concerned and when I say the parties involved I mean above all young people.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, at the Youth Council on 23 November last year, I proposed to the Member States’ Ministers for Youth that they hold national meetings of young people during the first half of 2000. This proposal was very warmly received by all the Member States and these meetings are being organised at the moment. Most Member States have already set dates for them and most of them have also assured me that these meetings will be open, with the participation of all possible parties including, of course, Members of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">These meetings must allow young people to play an active role and to assert their aspirations, their expectations and their opinions, but also their recommendations for political action in the areas that affect them. The various national meetings will culminate in a huge European meeting which will be held at the beginning of October, under the French Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time as consulting young people, the Commission hopes to consult those responsible for youth policy at national level. The Commission hopes that these national authorities will be able to incorporate into their contributions the opinions and expectations of local administrations, which play a considerable role, I believe, in youth policy. In order to achieve this, the Commission will be holding bilateral meetings with Member States, followed by a discussion seminar with youth leaders. We will also rely on the various studies on young people, which will be financed under the Youth programme, and the study, already underway, on the status of young people and the situation of youth policy in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to include the European Parliament in this exercise. The cooperation methods still have to be worked out, but I can assure you as of now that you will be invited to take part in the European meeting of young people and that I will keep you informed on a regular basis on progress in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to emphasise the fact that the consultation process, particularly with regard to young people, will not be a one-off exercise, because the publication of the White Paper will constitute the second stage of this dialogue with the parties involved, and this is a dialogue that I would like to see established on a more permanent basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, there is a considerable amount of work to be done, but it is exciting. As many of you have pointed out, we are not working for politics here, but for the future of our Union, and I hope that the debate launched by the publication of the White Paper will enable us to strengthen our capacity for joint action in order to implement a genuine strategy for developing the talents of these 80 million young citizens in the European Union, towards whom we have a great responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
