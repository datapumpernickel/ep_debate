<p>(EN)The Council recalls to the Honourable Parliamentarian that the General Affairs and External Relations Council of 22/23 November 2004 concluded that the EU stands ready to assist the Palestinian Authority in the upcoming Palestinian presidential elections to which the Honourable Member of the European Parliament refers to in his question. Therefore, the Council welcomed the Commission's intention to launch an Election Observation Mission as announced by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner on 22 November 2004 and which will be headed by former French Prime Minister M. Rocard, currently Member of the European Parliament. The Honourable Parliamentarian is kindly asked to enquire all further details of EU support to these elections directly from the Commission. Besides election observation and election support, the Council Presidency as well as the High Representative conduct continuous contacts with all relevant parties and partners at all levels in order to ensure that these elections will be organised in accordance with international standards and facilitated by Israel as called for by the Council on 22/23 November 2004.</p>
<p>It also recalls the Presidency Conclusions, adopted on the occasion of the meeting of the European Council met in Brussels on 16/17 December last, in which it states that the EU will support the electoral process financially, technically and politically, and its observer mission - in liaison with other members of the Quartet and of the international community - will help to verify that the electoral process is democratic, free and fair. The European Council also welcomes and supports the Palestinian Authority’s intention to hold legislative and local elections.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0529"></a>

<p>(EN)The Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 9 June 2004 entitled "The European Union and Iraq - A Framework for Engagement" was endorsed by the European Council on 17 June last. At the same time the European Council endorsed the joint letter from the Secretary General / High Representative for the CFSP and the Commission setting out further areas for engagement.</p>
<p>The objective of the EU is a secure, stable, unified, prosperous and democratic Iraq. The Council supports the transitional process in Iraq including elections in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1546. Accordingly support for elections has been an important element in the EU's assistance to Iraq. The European Council, at the occasion of its meeting in Brussels on 16/17 December 2004, reaffirmed this objective and reiterated its determination to support the Iraqi authorities and people, i.e. through election support, financing of UN protection, reconstruction assistance, strengthening the criminal justice sector and promoting respect for the rule of law, and developing political and trade cooperation with Iraq. It finally emphasized the importance of a broad, inclusive political process for the general elections in January 2005.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, substantial support for the elections has been provided mainly through the election cluster of the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI) which is administered by the UN. The UN has a major role in supporting the Independent Electoral Commission for Iraq (IECI) in organising the elections. The Community is also providing training for 150 domestic observers as well as expertise to the UN and the IECI in Amman and Baghdad.</p>
<p>The total amount allocated by the Community will be € 31.5 million Euro, to which it is worth noting that several Member States are contributing additional funds in support of the elections, on a bilateral basis.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0533"></a>

The international network of NGOs in Europe and Belarus has made it possible for children to travel to various countries to convalesce. President Lukashenko has declared that, in future, such journeys must be individually authorised for each child - conditions under which the network's humanitarian work cannot be continued. This will deprive the belated victims of the Chernobyl disaster of the time they need for recuperation.</p>

<p>Unjustified price rises in the European Union primarily affect the living standards of the poorest social groups and of citizens of the poorer Member States with low national incomes, making it difficult to achieve the Union's social objectives. These practices are made possible by pricing agreements between producers and vendors and between service providers on local, regional, national, European and world markets. A typical example would be the fact that fuel prices rise as oil prices go up, but generally do not go down as oil prices fall, and this is particularly relevant at a time when the dollar, in which oil purchases are calculated, falls against the euro. Among those who have benefited from changing oil prices are multinational concerns, most of them non- European, which have significantly increased their income over the last year. Similar price raising mechanisms operate in many of our countries. Only cheap products and services can lead to an increase in the living standards of the poorest social groups.</p>

<p>(FR)The Council shares the honourable Member’s concerns with regard to the social effects of relocations by industrial groups that have received significant public subsidies at national level. In this regard, and in general terms, it would remind the honourable Member of the resolution it adopted in December 2001 on the social responsibility of companies, which emphasises the ways in which they can thereby make a positive contribution, both to the implementation of the European employment and social cohesion strategies and to the sustainable development strategy. Within this context, the Council has already stressed the importance of involving the Commission, the Member States and social partners in the promotion of initiatives and innovations in this field. Within the framework of the implementation of the European social agenda, the Nice European Council of 7, 8 and 9 December 2000 urged the Commission, in order to enhance companies’ social responsibility, to involve them in the creation of an effective partnership with social partners, NGOs, local authorities and social service management organisations. In this regard, the European Council indicated the methods to be followed in order to anticipate and take advantage of the change in the work environment by creating a new balance between flexibility and security. The Council would urge the honourable Member to ask the Commission about the practical measures taken in this regard.</p>
<p>With regard specifically to the public subsidies mentioned in the question, the Council would point out that they fall within national competence and that their compatibility with Community legislation is monitored by the Commission. Hence, it is not the responsibility of the Council to guarantee controls or penalise the behaviour of companies receiving those subsidies.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Luxembourg Presidency intends to deal with the issue of restructuring – and in particular its consequences for employment and the new opportunities which may arise from it – at the informal meeting of Employment Ministers scheduled for 7, 8 and 9 April 2005.</p>
<p>Finally, the Council would remind the honourable Member that, last May, the Commission produced a communication on the social dimension of globalisation, following the report of the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). On the basis of these elements, and in view of the particular importance of this issue, the Luxembourg Presidency intends to urge the ‘Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumers’ Council on 3-4 March to debate it and to adopt conclusions on the subject.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0538"></a>

This Agency will ensure the operational coordination of Member States' activities at the external borders, including the Atlantic Coast.</p>
<p>Currently, two Sea Borders Centres exist within the framework of the Strategic Committee on Immigration, Frontiers and Asylum to coordinate joint operations and measures at sea and ports. These two Centres are the so-called Western and Eastern Sea Border Centres, located respectively in Spain and Greece. These Centres will become specialised branches of the European External Borders Agency as of 1 May 2005.</p>
<p>Furthermore, "The Hague Programme", adopted by the European Council on 4 and 5 November 2004, recognises the need for a better management of the migration flows in order to avoid the humanitarian tragedies that take place in the Mediterranean as a result of attempts to enter the EU illegally and it welcomes the initiatives by Member States for cooperation at sea, particularly for rescue operations.</p>
<p>Taking into account that the control and surveillance of the external borders fall under the responsibility of national border authorities, the European Council invited the Council to establish teams of national experts that can provide rapid technical and operational assistance to Member States that request it, following the proper risk analysis of the European External Borders Agency.</p>

<p>In order to fulfil this task the Commission is preparing a study, which aims at identifying the infrastructure to be considered "security critical" at European level and suggesting supplementary measures which are necessary to increase the protection of these infrastructures against possible terrorist acts..

<p>(FR)The Council would recall that Israel is one of the European Union's partners in the Euro-Mediterranean process launched in Barcelona in 1995, one of the merits of which is that it seeks to promote a climate conducive to rapprochement between Israel and its Arab neighbours. The fundamental objective of the Barcelona Process is the establishment, on the basis of dialogue and exchange, of an area of peace, stability and prosperity. One important element thereof is the establishment of a free-trade area through the conclusion of bilateral association agreements. The Union has negotiated association agreements with all its partners: the agreements with Algeria and Lebanon are in the final ratification phase, while the agreement with Syria has recently been initialled. The agreement with Israel entered into force in 2000.</p>
<p>The Council emphasises on every occasion that respect for human rights and democratic principles constitutes an essential element in bilateral relations between Israel and the European Union. The Council is convinced that dialogue on these fundamental principles must be maintained and intensified. The suspension of a contractual relationship should constitute a measure of last resort so that the dialogue structure established by the agreement is not lost. That is why the Council welcomes the fact that, at the most recent meeting of the Association Council, which was held on 13 December 2004, Israel subscribed to some very specific commitments in connection with the Action Plan drawn up as part of the new good neighbour policy. The European Union will be closely monitoring the implementation of those commitments, since that will determine progress in other sectors.</p>
<p>The Council remains convinced that – as has been expressly recognised, including by Israel – the role played by the European Union, as a member of the Quartet, in stabilising its immediate environment implies that the dialogue structures, particularly those proceeding from the Association Agreement, should be maintained.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0554"></a>

<p>(FR)The Council would like, first of all, to stress the importance of OLAF’s operations in cooperation with the Member States. It considers them to be an essential element in the enhancement of the protection of the Community’s financial interests and the fight against fraud.</p>
<p>While the Council takes note of the honourable Member’s concerns, it would like to point out that OLAF has only recently been created.</p>
<p>On examining the first assessment report on OLAF’s activities, which the Commission produced in 2003, the Council indicated, in particular, the great emphasis the regulations place on the carrying out of internal and external administrative investigations and urged OLAF to take the appropriate measures in order to better organise these. To this end, it stressed the importance of OLAF’s creating internal procedures providing for the methods for implementing actions and measures relating to internal and external investigations. Furthermore, the Council has also stressed the importance of respect for the rules relating to the protection of fundamental rights.</p>
<p>Within this context, the Council would point out that OLAF is responsible for its own internal organisation.</p>
<p>As it has always done, the Council will continue to monitor OLAF’s operation very closely. In this regard, the Council is pleased with the Commission's proposed modification of Regulation No 1073/1999 on the investigations carried out by OLAF. It considered, however, that it was important firstly to further examine the assessment of the activities of OLAF, and it also has a great interest in hearing the European Parliament’s opinion on this proposal.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0558"></a>

<p>(FR)The fifth enlargement comprising the ten new Member States as well as Bulgaria and Romania constitutes the biggest ever enlargement. The EU has responded to the challenges these countries have been facing and are still facing in coping with the legacy of the past and reforming their political, social and economic systems through the creation of several pre-accession instruments. Funding under these instruments has been increased over time, more recently for Bulgaria and Romania, following the Copenhagen European Council conclusions of 12 and 13 December 2002. The European Council decided that the high level of funding should be used in a flexible way, targeting the priorities identified, including in key areas such as Justice and Home Affairs. The EU continues to provide guidance to Bulgaria and Romania in their pre-accession work through the Accession Partnerships, which form the basis for programming pre-accession assistance from Community funds. In particular, the nature and dimension of the modernisation and restructuring needs of Romania call for the EU's financial assistance to support this country in its efforts. The total volume of pre-accession assistance available to Romania for 2004 (around €825 million) is substantial and increasing: it represents a very important financial resource for Romania, equal to around 1.4% of GDP.</p>
<p>Croatia is a candidate for accession, and accession negotiations will be opened in March 2005 provided that there is full cooperation with ICTY. Very recently, the Council, following the opinion given by the European Parliament, adopted a Regulation that will provide for the extension of the pre-accession financial instruments to Croatia from 2005 and the allocation of a certain amount of funds to Croatia under and within the limits of the current financial perspective. The pre-accession strategy for Croatia is aimed at promoting the Copenhagen political criteria, helping Croatia to align with the acquis, strengthening administrative and judicial capacity, preparing for Structural Funds and contributing to the sustainable adaptation of the agricultural sector. The regional dimension of Community assistance to the Western Balkans is receiving special attention through funding under the CARDS Regulation, and Croatia remains eligible for projects and programmes with a regional dimension.</p>
<p>The European Council on 16 and 17 December 2004 concluded that, also in the light of the Commission Report and Recommendation, Turkey sufficiently fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria to open accession negotiations provided that it fulfils certain specific requirements. Currently, pre-accession assistance to Turkey is governed by a financial instrument adopted in 2001. As has been the case for other candidate countries, assistance for Turkey from the European Union is focused on the priorities arising from the Accession Partnership. Financial assistance to Turkey is substantial (the 2004 Programme consists of an allocation of €235.6 million for the National Programme). In its Recommendation on Turkey, the Commission furthermore indicates that, in the context of the next financial perspective, the Commission will propose an increase in the amounts to be allocated to Turkey.</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth noting that the Council is currently examining a set of Commission proposals with a view to improving the effectiveness of the EU external aid. One of these proposals aims at setting up a new Instrument for Pre-accession assistance (IPA) that would replace the existing pre-accession instruments from 2007 onwards.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0565"></a>

<p>(EN)The proposal for a new capital requirements framework has been subject to an unprecedented level of consultation and impact analysis. The question of the financing of SMEs and the application of the framework to banks of all shapes and sizes have been central to the work carried out, over more than five years, to develop this new framework.</p>
<p>At the request of the European Council the Commission has had a study carried out by PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) into the consequences of the new framework for the European Economy and SMEs. As the Member indicates this report concludes that there will be no adverse effect on the majority of SMEs deriving from the new framework. This stems from several aspects of the new framework: significantly lower charges for retail lending and a discount for loans to small companies. Moreover, following some recommendations in this report, the Commission has introduced into its proposal special rules for venture capital financing.</p>
<p>The PwC report looks at the implementation costs of the new framework. While such estimates are by no means an exact science, the report gauges that ‘Basel 2’ implementation costs for the EU are likely to be moderate. In addition the investment required will fall over several years, as many banks have already started their preparations.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the new framework is specifically designed to reflect industry best practice in risk-measurement and –management. Accordingly, many of the investment costs to comply with the new framework are costs that banks would in any event be incurring.</p>
<p>On the question of transparency of banks’ rating systems, it will be important that SMEs – and indeed borrowers generally – continue to have the information that they need in order to obtain timely and appropriate access to loans and other forms of financing. In order to help achieve this, the Commission will publish a ‘Guide to Basel 2’ for SMEs in the first quarter of 2005, and has started a series of one-day dissemination seminars on Basel II to help SMEs and industry organisations to understand the changes that will occur as a result of the Basel II. The Commission has also carried out an exercise on a voluntary code of conduct between credit institutions and SMEs<a href="#defann_18_1" name="refann_18_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> upon request of the Industry Council. This however has not achieved consensus.</p>
<p>In relation to the amount and detail of disclosure by banks – and as is the case at present – it is an important question of balance.</p>
<p>Banks will obviously have to make clear to SMEs the data and information that they (the banks) need in order to process applications for loans and finance. This is simply a necessary part of banks’ credit-granting activities.</p>
<p>There are also disclosure requirements in the directive concerning description of banks’ internal rating processes – including the definitions, methods, data and assumptions upon which the process is based. This will provide important transparency as to the methods used.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that the rules which are proposed in the new framework are sufficient and balanced.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The proliferation of hedge funds remains one of the most striking developments in the international asset management industry in recent years. Hedge Funds increasingly attract investment from pension funds and life insurance schemes. Furthermore, in some countries there are moves to allow the retailing of hedge fund products, particularly of funds of hedge funds to small investors.</p>
<p>Hedge funds are now active in many EU-jurisdictions, although primarily targeted to wealthy and institutional investors, and only to some extent to retail investors. The listing of a few funds-of-hedge-funds makes it easier for retail investors to have access to alternative investment products.</p>
<p>Until recently, the majority of Member States have not allowed the distribution of hedge funds to retail investors, by means of specific legislation preventing unauthorised funds from being distributed on anything but a private basis or by means of tax legislation. Some Member States (France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg) have developed (or are considering) a national legislative framework, using the freedom to regulate on a national basis those non-Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) products. For the moment, by their very nature, hedge funds can not be accommodated by the UCITS framework. Although the UCITS III Directive allows the use of derivatives in UCITS funds, short selling, leverage and closed-ended structure are still restricted.</p>
<p>Until today, there was no strong demand from the industry to have access to an EU-wide market. The growth in the hedge funds industry (and the induced-risk for financial stability) and the “retailisation” of its investor base have raised the question of whether an EU-framework is needed. Before an EU-regime can be put in place, there must be a demonstrable case that a fragmented national approach prevents this area of asset management from developing optimally or that it fails to address cross-border dimension of risks arising from this activities of hedge funds and their managers (systemic risk falling on EU-regulated counterparties which act in the single market; protection of investors who may easily invest in a listed funds-of-hedge-funds; etc.).</p>
<p>The Parliament report (rapporteur: John PURVIS) makes a valuable contribution to this discussion. However, the Commission notes that some of the basic issues associated with operation of hedge funds in Europe are common to a wide range of other types of collective investment vehicles, including private equity funds. The Commission needs a global vision of the optimal treatment of these different types of activity from a European perspective rather than a product-by-product approach. The latter risks creating inconsistencies, artificial classifications and scope for regulatory arbitrage. This view was endorsed by the report of the expert group on asset management in June. Thus, the Commission’s view would be that these fundamental structural issues concerning the appropriate treatment of hedge funds from a European regulatory perspective should be addressed as part of the wider review of the functioning of the EU UCITS Directives which is foreseen for mid-2005. The UCITS review would be the best tool to consider the need for an EU-framework for hedge funds and to strike a risk-benefits balance of any proposal.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0551"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission is well aware of the concerns that the proposed Directive on services in the Internal Market may lead to “social dumping” as pointed out by the Honourable Member. However, the Commission does not think there is any reason to fear this, as explained in its answers to oral question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2004-0515_EN.html">H-0515/04</a> by Mr De Rossa and oral question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2004-0528_EN.html">H-0528/04</a> by Mr Crowley.</p>
<p>First, the proposed Services Directive does not affect the existing Community acquis, namely the Posted Workers’ Directive from 1996, which precisely aims to prevent “social dumping”. The Proposal provides that posted workers, including temporary workers, enjoy a number of important protective provisions concerning working conditions in force in the Member State where the worker is posted. This Directive will continue to apply in full. Therefore, companies will not be able to use this proposal in order to establish themselves, for instance, in low wage countries in order to circumvent the social protection workers would enjoy in the host Member State. This also means, for instance, that companies from another Member State must abide by the health and safety rules in the host country, e.g., regarding the way the workplace must be organised, scaffolding erected, requirements as to protective gear, etc. This concerns not only working conditions laid down by law but also those laid down by certain collective agreements.</p>
<p>Secondly, the proposed Directive reinforces the control of posted workers because it establishes a system of cooperation between Member States and obliges the country of origin of the service provider to assist the authorities of the host Member State in the supervision of working conditions.</p>
<p>The proposal will also allow for more effective control of the real place of establishment of companies, that is, the place where the company has its infrastructure from which it pursues its economic activity in effective terms.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Commission believes that the proposed Directive will not increase the risk of “social dumping” and will, on the contrary, help to prevent “social dumping”.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0564"></a>

<p>(EN)With the historic enlargement of the Union on 1 May 2004, Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus have become its direct neighbours. The coming years will therefore offer to the Union great potential for further deepening its relationship. The Commission in particular recalls the importance of civil society in promoting democratisation, as highlighted in the course of the recent presidential elections in Ukraine. Speaking to the Parliament on 1 December, the Commission confirmed its intention to persist with the support to democratisation and civil society in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Union has launched the European Neighbourhood Initiative which sets ambitious objectives for enhanced co-operation in a broad number of areas based on clear commitments to shared values and effective implementation of political, economic and institutional reforms.</p>
<p>To this end, the EU has adopted action plans that have been agreed with the partner countries setting out benchmarks for its cooperation. The Commission should underline that a significant number of the precise steps outlined in these plans concern commitments to enhance human rights in the countries concerned. Ensuring the respect for freedom of association and fostering the development of civil society are important components in this process. The question of support for the promotion of civil society in Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus, raised by the honoured parliamentarian, is in this perspective all the more pertinent.</p>
<p>While democratisation activities can be financed under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIHDR), it is important to recall that the main bulk of support in this area is provided under the bilateral instrument, Tacis. In order to make effective use of Commission’s limited resources, EIDHR support will only intervene to complement the Tacis assistance.</p>
<p>The EIDHR is particularly well suited for lending support to small-scale civil society projects. As concerns for instance Ukraine, the Commission between 2002 and 2004 allocated some 1,7 Mio € under the EIDHR for micro-projects to local NGOs. Out of this sum, a majority of the actions focussed on civil society enhancement and capacity building. Additional support under the EIHDR for actions in Moldova, Ukraine and Belarus has been foreseen for 2005-2006. Particular attention will be paid to the situation of local human rights defenders as well as promotion of freedom of expression and the media.</p>
<p>With respect to Belarus, the EU is exploring ways to further intensify its efforts with regard to assistance in order to meet the challenges arising from the self-isolation of Belarus. In view of the numerous administrative barriers for direct civil society support, the Commission is at present channelling support to OSCE actions implemented by ODIHR in Belarus.</p>
<p>The Commission will, in cooperation with Member States, be organising a workshop in Vilnius in March. The main objective of this meeting will be to co-ordinate assistance to democratisation and civil society in Belarus.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0543"></a>

<p>(EN)On 26th October 2004 the Council has adopted a Regulation establishing a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union, which will be operational on 1<span class="sup">st</span> May 2005.</p>
<p>The agency has been created in view of improving the integrated management of the external borders; it shall facilitate and render more effective the implementation of the Schengen acquis in this area, thus contributing to an efficient, high and uniform level of control on persons and surveillance of the external borders.</p>
<p>The Agency is in particular entrusted with the coordination of operational cooperation between Member States in field of the management of external borders as regards the movement of persons, including the organisation of joint operations and pilot projects at the external borders and inter alia in the Atlantic coast mentioned by the Hon. Member of the Parliament.</p>
<p>In addition, the Hague Programme invites the Council to establish teams of national experts that can provide rapid technical and operational assistance to Member States requesting it, acting within the framework of the Agency.</p>
<p>In 2007 the role and the functioning of the Agency will be subject to an evaluation. The Hague Programme requests the Commission in particular to review the tasks of the Agency and to assess whether the Agency should concern itself with other aspects of border management, including enhanced cooperation with customs services and other competent authorities for goods-related security matters, and the feasibility of the creation of a European system of border guards.</p>
<p>Without prejudice to these future developments, the Commission is currently considering the creation of a system of risk management in relation to goods traffic, which will give a high level of protection at all points of the external frontier. It would be possible to integrate criteria relating to specific geographical areas into this system of risk management.</p>
<p>As regards maritime safety, the Commission has taken all the necessary measures in order to ensure the setting up of the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), created by Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 of the Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2002. This Agency must support Member States and the Commission in the implementation of Community law, by monitoring this implementation and evaluating the effectiveness of the measures in place.</p>
<p>In addition, EMSA ensures the management of the Community traffic follow-up and information system developed by the Commission in accordance with Directive 2002/59/CE<span class="sup"> </span>of the Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2002 establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system. This system establishes an information exchange platform between Member State maritime administrations and therefore allows to identify vessels navigating in Community waters and to know their movements and cargo. This Directive also lays down operational provisions regarding interventions in case of marine incidents and the establishment of places of refuge for ships in distress.</p>
<p>As concerns the response to ecological disasters, when a major disaster occurs, the affected State can get immediate assistance through the Community mechanism to facilitate reinforced cooperation in civil protection assistance interventions, established under Council Decision 2001/792/EU, Euratom of 23 October 2001. The mechanism is open to the 25 Member States, the three EEA countries Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein, and the candidate countries. The assistance which can thus be readily made available covers all types of emergencies, including ecological disasters.</p>
<p>In order to support via the Community mechanism the pollution response actions of Member States in case of accidental or deliberate pollution caused by ships, the Regulation setting up the EMSA has been modified in view to confer to the Agency new tasks. It can involve, if necessary, operational assistance to Member States concerned with specialised additional means.</p>
<p>In addition, the European satellite radio navigation system GALILEO will be very useful for the monitoring of vessels, search and sea rescue. It will offer more precise and reliable services than current GPS, and in particular, a “search and rescue” service that will improve considerably current international humanitarian search and rescue system COSPAS-SARSAT.</p>
<p>Finally, the issue of a possible strengthening of the cooperation among the Member States within the Community in order to ensure ability to rapidly respond to problems of trafficking and ecological disasters and provide an efficient and coordinated search and rescue service at sea would also be considered in the Green Paper on the Maritime Policy, which should be published by the Commission by the end of the first semester of 2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0549"></a>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>In July 2004, the Commission proposed a change to the current solidarity mechanism in the common visa policy (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2004&amp;nu_doc=0437">COM(2004)0437</a>/final). The proposal envisages the Commission entering into negotiations with those third countries which do not apply the principles of reciprocity to specific EU Member States.</p>
<p>Relations with the United States are, in this respect, of particular concern, as they have visa requirements for 10 of the EU Member States.</p>
<p>In the light of the above proposal, what view should be taken of the skill and credibility of the Commission in negotiations with the United States? Have talks to date brought about any results?</p>
<p>Is it not essential for Commissioner Franco Frattini, who very recently declared the need for good transatlantic relations, to solve this thorny problem, particularly as it appears so trivial against a background of such vital issues in relations with the USA as the fight against terrorism?</p>
<p>Can we expect from the Commission a plan of action with clear deadlines for the removal of visas by the USA, using as a point of reference the process of assessing the preparedness of the new Member States for membership of the Schengen Area (a process which should be set in motion at the beginning of 2006)?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)The Commission considers reciprocity to be an essential element of visa policy and its proposed modification of the existing reciprocity mechanism (in visa Regulation No 539/2001) is an illustration of this.</p>
<p>In fact, the Commission notes that this mechanism has never been used in the past, the reason for this being its dangerous quasi-automatic nature: a notification of a case of non-reciprocity automatically leads to the introduction of the visa obligation after 30 days unless the Council decides otherwise. In either case, the Union runs a great political risk: on the one hand, of a serious disruption in relations between the Union and the third country in question; and on the other, a significant denial of solidarity amongst the Member States.</p>
<p>It was therefore necessary to present a proposal aimed at making the mechanism more effective at a time when almost all the new Member States were victims of a situation of non-reciprocity.</p>
<p>In its proposed review, the Commission has been guided by three essential concerns: to ensure that all cases of non-reciprocity are discussed within the appropriate bodies, to end the quasi-automatic nature of the current mechanism and finally to allow for a diplomatic phase of contacts with the third countries responsible for the non-reciprocity with a view to normalising the situation. During this phase, the Commission intends to play a leading role, which is logical from a legal point of view, since the establishment of lists of third countries subject to visas or exempted from that obligation is exclusively a Community competence.</p>
<p>Parliament has been consulted on this proposal and its Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs is in the process of examining it.</p>
<p>In parallel, the Commission has established a series of contacts with third countries which are exempt from visas by the Member States and which maintain a visa obligation in relation to one or several Member States. In these contacts, the Commission has stressed the importance of reciprocity as one of the criteria underlying the common visa policy and has explained to those third countries that it believes the Member States, linked by this common policy, should be treated in a uniform manner by third countries.</p>
<p>The same position has also been defended in contacts with the United States. The latter, however, take a very different position with regard to admission to their Visa Waiver Programme. They continue to examine each third country individually, on its own merits (taking into account in particular the number of visa refusals and ‘overstayers’, that is to say, people who do not leave the territory after their visa has expired). Nevertheless, the Commission is convinced that the dynamic of accession and in particular the prospect of full participation by the new Member States in the Schengen system by 2007 will help to ensure that the situation evolves in a positive manner. Since the beginning of 2004, the Commission, supported by the Presidency, has systematically raised this issue in all relevant meetings with the United States, and in particular at the EU-United States Summit in June 2004 in Ireland.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission would like to end by emphasising the progress made since 1 May: the number of cases of non-reciprocity has decreased significantly. The efforts made by the Commission are not unrelated to the decisions taken by third countries to extend the visa exemption to nationals from the new Member States. The Commission was determined to continue its efforts in this regard. The Hague programme, adopted by the European Council of 4 and 5 November, now obliges it to do so.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0557"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission does not support the establishment of “camps” outside the EU to which asylum seekers who lodged their application in a Member State or at its borders would be transferred. The Commission has not put forward any concrete proposals which would provide for the processing of asylum applications in third countries.</p>
<p>In fact it would not be legally possible to do so since the 1951 Geneva convention and the European Convention on Human Rights prohibits the removal of persons from the territory of a Member State before a decision has been taken on their application for asylum.</p>
<p>In any case, before any externalisation of processing of asylum claims could take place, there are a number of difficult legal, practical and jurisdictional questions to be answered. Any proposed new approaches would also need to respect a number of basic premises, in particular the international legal obligations of Member States: notably the 1951 Refugee Convention, the non-refoulement principle, and the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p>However, in its conclusions of 4-5 November 2004, the European Council called for a study to be conducted by the Commission, in close consultation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), on this issue. The study must look into the merits, appropriateness and feasibility of joint processing of asylum applications outside EU territory, in complementarily with the Common European Asylum System and in compliance with the relevant international standards.</p>
<p>This study will be complementary to a separate study on the joint processing of asylum applications within the Union.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Commission sees now a broad consensus among Member States on the need for a coordinated and systematic approach to addressing protection issues in the region. In its conclusions of 4-5 November 2004, the European Council welcomed the “Durable Solutions Communication<a href="#defann_25_1" name="refann_25_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>” and invited the Commission to develop EU-Regional Protection Programmes, in partnership with the third countries concerned and in close consultation and cooperation with UNHCR.</p>
<p>In the light of this invitation, the Commission intends to take forward work in this area to define a plan of action by July 2005 and a full EU Regional Protection Programme by December 2005.</p>
<p>The Commission also hopes that, in parallel, the Member States will commit themselves in the implementation of a European resettlement scheme; this would demonstrate the Community’s involvement towards international efforts to find balanced, comprehensive and effective solutions to protracted refugee situations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)Member States meeting in the framework of the European Council in December 2003 decided to establish a Human Rights Agency for the European Union.</p>
<p>The Commission has responded by committing itself to submitting a proposal to establish such an Agency. This is foreseen to be adopted in May 2005.</p>
<p>However before tabling this proposal, the Commission considered it important to consult with the Member States, Parliament and civil society, on issues such as the future Agency’s precise tasks, scope of action, priorities, structure etc. Consequently, the Commission launched a wide-ranging public consultation on 25 October 2004 with its Communication on the Fundamental Rights Agency, to which the Honourable Member refers.</p>
<p>As this public consultation is still on-going, the Commission does not, as yet, hold any firm positions regarding the tasks, scope of action or structure of the future Agency. The Commission is open to all suggestions. The public consultation will end with a public hearing on 25 January 2005. Following this, the Commission will carefully analyse all contributions, both written and oral, when preparing a proposal for a Fundamental Rights Agency.</p>
<p>The budgetary implications will depend on the mandate and tasks of the future Agency. No precise proposals on the budget can be made before these issues have been decided. The Commission will include a financial statement with the proposal to establish the Agency following an ex-ante evaluation. Due attention will be paid to the financial perspectives for 2007-2013.</p>
<p>The Commission will be mindful to ensure that there is no overlap with the excellent work carried out by other organisations in the field of human rights, in particular the Council of Europe. It will of course also be important to take into account the human rights policy that has been developed already by the EU and the important role played by the Parliament in this context. The Commission is committed to the development of synergies between all the major players in the promotion of fundamental rights.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0562"></a>

<p>(FR)The term ‘coastguard’ covers a broad range of public authority activities at sea, including the monitoring of maritime traffic, safeguarding human life at sea, combating pollution, maritime security, and, within the framework of the supervision of the Union’s external borders, the control of illegal immigration.</p>
<p>With regard to the control of persons at external borders, illegal immigration by sea is a constant source of concern and results in many human tragedies.</p>
<p>A first programme for combating this phenomenon was adopted by the Council on 27 November 2003. It contains a series of measures to develop coordination amongst Member States and to promote relations with third countries with a view to better management of migratory flows at source.</p>
<p>A significant proportion of these actions are to be carried out by the Member States. In fact, controlling and monitoring external borders is primarily their responsibility. In particular, they are urged to put in place networks of liaison officers and to develop exchanges of data both amongst their ports and with third country ports.</p>
<p>Other measures are the responsibility of the current centres for the management of maritime borders established in Madrid and Piraeus. In particular, these include completing the inventory of the technical resources available for carrying out joint control actions and research into new more effective resources.</p>
<p>An initial evaluation of the application of this action programme was carried out at the end of 2004. The conclusions that the Council adopted following this evaluation were added to the list of actions to be taken at operational and legislative level.</p>
<p>In the future, an important role will be played by the European Agency for the management of external borders, which will be operational from 1 May 2005. It will be responsible in particular for coordination of tasks and assistance for national authorities, including in the organisation of joint operations, and will also play a significant risk analysis role.</p>
<p>Even though the idea of creating a coastguard service does not appear to have support at the moment, it should be noted that the Hague programme, adopted by the European Council of 4 and 5 November 2004, provides for the deployment of teams of national experts capable of quickly providing technical and operational assistance to Member States requesting it. These teams of experts will act within the framework of the Agency. Furthermore, the Commission is urged to carry out, in 2007, an evaluation of the functioning of the Agency, to re-examine its duties and to analyse whether it should become responsible for other aspects of border management. In particular, the Commission must evaluate the operation of the teams of national experts and, on that basis, the possibility of creating a European system of border guards.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0570"></a>

<p>(EN)Further to proposals of the Commission the Council took two decisions with regard to the Council of Europe Convention on Action against trafficking in human beings. On 28 June 2004, the Council adopted a Decision authorizing the Commission to negotiate the Draft European Convention on combating trafficking in human beings; this Council Decision covers those provisions of the Draft Convention that concern Community law (first pillar). On 25 October 2004, the Council adopted a Common Position on negotiations relating to the Draft European Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings being undertaken in the Council Europe; this Council act covers those provisions of the Draft Convention that concern Title VI of the Treaty on European Union (third pillar).</p>
<p>Further to the Council Decision adopted in June, the Commission negotiated on behalf of the European Community. This Council Decision was adopted on the basis of existing EC legislation, in particular on Council Directive 2004/81EC of 29 April 2004 on the residence permit issued to third-country nationals who are victims of trafficking in human beings or who have been the subject of an action to facilitate illegal immigration, who cooperate with the competent authorities. The Directive provides for a reflection period allowing the persons concerned to recover in order to take a decision as to whether to cooperate. Furthermore, it includes a number of detailed provisions regulating the treatment of these persons during the reflection period and after the issue of the residence permit (Articles 7, 9, 10, 11, and 12). Consequently, in the negotiations in Strasbourg the Commission aimed at ensuring a level of treatment for victims, who are third country nationals, at least complying with the standards set out in the EC Directive. Taking into account the state of play after the last meeting of the competent committee of the Council of Europe this is likely to be achieved.</p>
<p>As far as third pillar issues are concerned (for example substantive criminal law, criminal proceedings), EU Member States negotiated themselves on the basis of the Common Position adopted by the Council in October 2004. The Common Position aimed at the inclusion in the Convention of provisions facilitating to the maximum extent possible the effective prosecution and punishment of criminal offences related to trafficking in human beings in accordance with relevant legislation under Title IV of the Treaty on European Union, in particular the Council Framework Decision of 19 July 2002 on combating trafficking in human beings. Provisions on criminal proceedings should address the special needs of women and children who have or may become victims of trafficking in human beings. Furthermore, the Common Position aimed at promoting the involvement of victim support systems.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0499"></a>

The Commission proposal provided for a feasibility study to be drawn up before the agency was established, but the proposal for a regulation has been presented without any such study having been carried out. Why? Furthermore, it is proposed to appoint four fishing industry representatives, without voting rights, as part of the administrative board. The industry thinks that four is not enough, and that there should be at least eight, with unquestionable voting rights, appointed by European employers’ and workers’ organisations. Is the Commission going to reconsider its position?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)Following introductory presentations by the Commission in Council and Parliament the Council held a policy debate in October 2004 on the Commission proposal to establish a Community Fisheries Control Agency as a key part of the EU drive to improve compliance with the fisheries rules under the 2002 reform of the Common Fisheries Policy. Work on the proposal will continue in the Council working groups in January 2005 and in the European Parliament, whose opinion is foreseen for February 2005.</p>
<p>As its title suggests, the work performed by the Agency will be in the area of control. Any involvement in research will be solely related to control issues.</p>
<p>The agency will also play an important role in combating illegal, undeclared and unregulated fishing. It will provide support to the Member States not only in Community waters but also in relation to fisheries agreements concluded with non-EU countries. It will also be active on the high seas under international control and inspection schemes agreed within the framework of regional fisheries organisations such as the North West Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) and the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC).</p>
<p>Following the decision of 13 December 2003 made by the Council meeting at Heads of State or government level, it became necessary for the Commission to draw up a proposal by March 2004. Given such a short period of time it was not possible to undertake the feasibility study before such a proposal was presented, as was originally planned.</p>
<p>The agency will be concerned with operational matters that directly affect those engaged in fishing. It is therefore appropriate that they will be represented on the Administrative Board. It is important that this body does not become too unwieldy. For this reason the number of members is restricted and the voting powers of the administrative board reflect the important requirement that the agency will act in conformity with Community interests.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0500"></a>

<p>(EN)The questions raised by the Honourable Member refer to three different but interrelated issues: first, unsolicited (commercial) communications and measures to address cross-border cases; second, illegal content in unsolicited email; and third, the protection of personal correspondence and the need to strike a balance between freedom of expression and the protection of minors and consumers.</p>
<p>Unsolicited commercial communications (or “spam”) are regulated under the Privacy and electronic communications Directive<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Following a Communication from the Commission on “spam”<a href="#defann_30_2" name="refann_30_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> adopted last year, the Commission has set up a contact network of spam enforcement agencies to facilitate cross border enforcement. In December 2004, the contact network agreed on a cooperation procedure to ease the exchange of information across borders. The Commission will continue – as indicated in the recently published 10th Report on Electronic Communications Regulation<a href="#defann_30_3" name="refann_30_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> – to monitor divergences in the national transposition of the Privacy and Electronic communications Directive.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as unsolicited commercial communications contain false or inaccurate information, they may have an adverse impact on the economic behaviour of consumers and therefore fall within the scope of the Misleading Advertising Directive 84/450/EEC. Although existing European legislation allows Member States to adopt or maintain more stringent consumer protection measures, the Commission is now proposing to introduce uniform Community rules on unfair commercial practices, which establish a high level of consumer protection and ensure the proper functioning of the internal market. National authorities competent for the enforcement of consumer protection legislation will be able to co-operate in cross-border cases within the framework of the Regulation on consumer protection co-operation no. 2006/2004.</p>
<p>The Privacy and electronic communications Directive, as transposed by the Member States, is applicable to all unsolicited commercial communications, including those which have illegal content attached. In the specific case of distribution of child pornography material using unsolicited communications, the Framework Decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography<a href="#defann_30_4" name="refann_30_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> is also relevant. Other illegal content in unsolicited mail must be addressed according to each Member State’s specific legislation. Member States authorities can also make use of the information exchange possibilities offered by Europol and Eurojust to deal with international cases of illegal content distribution, in so far as these cases are covered by their respective mandates.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission fully endorses both the principle of respect for private and family life, including communications, and the principle of the freedom of expression. These rights are incorporated in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union and in the Convention of the Council of Europe regarding the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The Commission has committed in 2001 to submit any legislative and regulatory act to a test of compatibility with the Charter<a href="#defann_30_5" name="refann_30_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>. Although the Union has as such no general powers to legislate on fundamental rights and freedoms, Article 95 of the EC Treaty allows measures to be proposed and adopted to harmonise the Member States' legislation where these measures have as their object the establishment and functioning of the internal market. It is in that context that the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications should be seen and, in particular, its balance between privacy in electronic communications and their use for marketing purposes. Whenever needed in the exercise of its powers, the Commission will continue to aim to strike the right balance between the various rights at stake.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)The Union’s relations with Cuba are governed by the Common Position, initially adopted by the Council in 1996 and reviewed and updated regularly since then. The Union’s objectives in relation to Cuba remain respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, encouraging a process of transition towards pluralist democracy and sustainable economic recovery, with a view to improving the living conditions of the Cuban population. In order to achieve these objectives, the Common Position promotes a policy of constructive engagement with regard to Cuba, by means of strengthened dialogue with the government and civil society. Neither the Common Position, nor its objectives or instruments have so far been called into question by any of the Member States.</p>
<p>Following the arrest and sentencing of 75 dissidents to prison terms of between 6 and 28 years, the Council is currently evaluating the measures adopted in June 2003. Several countries, including Spain, have called into question the effectiveness of these measures and have advocated that they be re-examined.</p>
<p>The Commission does not believe that the Union needs a new foreign policy with regard to Cuba, which would relegate human rights into second place behind economic interests.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the suspension of political dialogue with the Cuban authorities over the last 18 months does not appear to have had a significant impact on economic and commercial exchanges between the countries of the Union and Cuba.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is a consensus amongst the Member States, shared by the Commission, on the need to seek more effective ways to achieve the objectives of the Common Position, the most important of which is respect for human rights.</p>
<p>Within this context, the Commission takes a positive view of the proposal on a new approach such as the one agreed at technical level by the Member States last December. It would be aimed at normalising diplomatic relations with Havana while at the same time intensifying relations with the peaceful dissidents by means other than invitations to official receptions. The Commission hopes that this new approach will serve to stimulate the release of the 61 dissidents imprisoned since March 2003. The resumption of political dialogue sought should also have the central aim of better pursuing the objectives of the Common Position on Cuba.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0514"></a>

<p>The countries and peoples of the European Union and potential candidates for membership should be informed about plans for future enlargement over at least the next 30 years. Future EU Member States should be involved in the formation of an efficient economic system and communications systems and energy and supply networks in order not to incur unnecessary additional accession costs. This will require a clearer definition of the conditions for accession to the European Union and of the EU's borders, in accordance with the expectations of the Member States (e.g. energy security). A natural EU border would appear to be one that follows the borders of countries all or part of whose territory is in the continent of Europe and which have an interest in becoming EU Member States.

The preamble to the Constitutional Treaty defines Europe as a continent from which civilisation has sprung and asserts that the European Union draws inspiration from the cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe. In connection with Turkey's application for full membership of the EU, the question of the EU's borders and identity has arisen. Does the Commission have a view on the future enlargement of the EU? Could Turkey's accession create an opportunity for states in North Africa and Transcaucasia? At the same time the Commission does not seem to have a clear view with regard to countries such as Ukraine which, geographically and in terms of their cultural heritage, unquestionably belong to Europe.

<p>(EN)In the present Commission, the Enlargement portfolio has been expanded to include the responsibility for the Western Balkans. This is a clear signal that the Commission considers that in addition to the current candidate countries (Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, Turkey), the countries of the Western Balkans have a vocation to become members of the EU when time is ripe and when they fulfil the Copenhagen criteria. This is in line with the conclusions of the Thessalonica European Council of June 2003.</p>
<p>The practice in the ongoing round of enlargement has been to condition the opening of negotiations on the fulfilment of the Copenhagen political criteria. This condition has proved an important stimulus for political change and in-depth reform in the candidate countries. Hence, accession negotiations should only be started with a country that fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria, thereby promoting the fundamental values on which the Union is founded.</p>
<p>The Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe states that ‘The Union shall be open to all European States which respect its values and are committed to promoting them together’. Hence, if a European State has a vocation to become a member of the Union and is committed to European values and if it is able to take on the obligations of membership, it should be accepted as a candidate. However, we should take equally seriously the often forgotten element of the Copenhagen criteria: “The Union’s capacity to absorb new members, while maintaining the momentum of European integration, is also an important consideration in the general interest of both the Union and the candidate countries.”</p>
<p>So far, other countries have not been considered for accession in the medium term. For this reason, it was agreed to include them in the EU’s Neighbourhood Policy, which paves the way for free trade and political dialogue. This involves also cooperation in the field of Trans European Energy Networks, given that a number of countries included in the European Neighbourhood Policy are and will remain important for the security of energy supply of the EU. Being part of the Neighbourhood Policy does not mean that the door is closed for Membership.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s view, Europe is a political concept: its future evolution should be developed jointly between the Member States and the European Institutions, and with the civil society at large.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0517"></a>

<p>(FR)The Commission shares the honourable Member’s view and is aware of the significant risks run by workers involved in the sandblasting, cleaning and painting of hulls.</p>
<p>The Commission does nevertheless believe that the correct implementation of the provisions of the current European legislation in the field of health and safety in the workplace should help to effectively obviate these hazards in the workplace.</p>
<p>In particular, this legislation includes Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work<a href="#defann_38_1" name="refann_38_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, Council Directive 98/24/EC of 7 April 1998 on the protection of the health and safety of workers from the risks related to chemical agents at work<a href="#defann_38_2" name="refann_38_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and European Parliament and Council Directive 2003/10/EC of 6 February 2003 on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (noise)<a href="#defann_38_3" name="refann_38_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, the provisions of which should be transposed into the national legislation of the Member States before 15 February 2006, replacing the provisions of Directive 86/188/EEC<a href="#defann_38_4" name="refann_38_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> on this subject.</p>
<p>These directives impose a number of obligations on employers, including a prior assessment of risks, the implementation of preventive measures aimed at eliminating or reducing risks, adequate training and information for workers and prior consultation of workers. The directives also require the Member States to establish an appropriate system for monitoring the health of workers.</p>
<p>The objectives of the Community legislation cannot be achieved without effective application in the workplace and it is the responsibility of the competent authorities of the Member States to ensure appropriate control and monitoring of the national laws transposing Community directives.</p>
<p>The Commission actively cooperates with the Member States, in particular with the assistance of the Advisory Committee on health and safety in the workplace, which the Council established, with a view to harmonising approaches, facilitating exchanges of experiences and jointly producing non-binding good practice guides intended to illustrate the measures to be taken with a view to compliance with the provisions of the directives.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)Like other Structural Funds, the European Social Fund channels its support into strategic long-term programmes which are planned and drawn up by Member States and negotiated with the Commission. The programmes are implemented by the Member State through a wide range of provider organisations both in the public and the private sectors. These organisations may include national, regional and local authorities, educational and training institutions, voluntary organisations and the Social Partners, and individual companies.</p>
<p>The Structural Funds take part in the financing of operations as they are defined in the regulations on the various funds. As mentioned above, these operations have to fall within the priorities and measures agreed in the intervention of the Funds covering the Member State or region. To benefit from financing from one of the Funds, the operation has also to meet the selection criteria, which are approved by a monitoring committee responsible for monitoring the effectiveness and quality of the implementation of the intervention. Under the principle of subsidiarity, the Member State is responsible for selecting the individual projects to be funded, for their implementation, audit and control, monitoring and evaluation.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the efficiency of and the durable impact of the Funds' assistance, the current Structural Funds General Regulation introduced a new rule aiming to ensure that the Structural Funds objectives are attained in a sustainable fashion (cfr.Article 30.4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds<a href="#defann_39_1" name="refann_39_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>). Pursuant to this Article, Member States must ensure that an operation retains the contribution from Structural Funds only if it does not, within five years of the date of the decision concerning the Structural Funds contribution, undergo a substantial modification which could affect the nature of the operation, its implementation conditions or give to a firm or a public body an undue advantage. A change in the nature of ownership in case of infrastructure or a change in the location in a productive activity is a substantial modification.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission Regulation on employment state aid establishes a minimum period of job maintenance in case of public aid to job creation or recruitment (3 years for big companies and 2 years for SMEs).</p>
<p>A fundamental freedom of the Single Market is the possibility for companies to locate in any part of the Union. The exercise of this freedom must, however, respect Community legislation particularly the abovementioned rules for Competition and the Structural Funds.</p>
<p>Relocation has always been a challenge for regional policy and has become an even greater concern within an enlarged Union. Therefore, the Commission proposes for the future 2007-2013 programming period for Structural and Cohesion Funds to reinforce the provisions related to relocation of enterprises. The time span required to maintain a productive investment has been extended. To retain support from the Funds, undertakings shall maintain their productive investment for a seven year period following the date of the decision granting the Funds' support. The Commission has also proposed that those firms that have to reimburse funds as a result of a change of location within a Member State or between Member States will not be entitled to receive support from the Funds in future.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Within the European Union there are languages with a centuries-old history which are neither national nor official EU languages but which nonetheless often have many speakers living in different regions in a variety of Member States. In those regions, such languages sometimes enjoy official status and in certain cases they have a number of speakers, a literary tradition and a vitality comparable to those of national languages which enjoy official EU status, even though the latter may actually have only a similar or even a smaller number of speakers.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that respect for linguistic diversity is one of the EU's democratic and cultural foundations (as acknowledged in Article 22 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights: 'The Union shall respect cultural, religious and linguistic diversity') and since - in accordance with the EU's values - it would therefore be wrong to discriminate against a language merely on the grounds that it is not spoken throughout a Member States, does the Commission not think that the EU should take greater account of the realities of such languages?</p>
<p>The Spanish Government has already submitted a Memorandum calling for the language arrangements within the EU institutions to be amended in order to accommodate Spain's co-official languages.

<p>(EN)The Commission is aware of the importance and use of certain regional languages in Spain and neighbouring Member States</p>
<p>The Commission is also aware that there are cases, where more EU citizens have one of these languages as their first language than those that speak other languages in other Member States.</p>
<p>However, the Commission recalls that in accordance with Article 290 of the EC Treaty, the rules governing the languages of the institutions of the Community are determined by the Council, acting unanimously and without proposal of the Commission.</p>
<p>These rules are laid down in Council Regulation No 1 of 15 April 1958 (Council Regulation No 1/58), last amended by the Accession Treaty concerning the accession of the ten new Member States joining the European Union on the 1<span class="sup">st</span> of May 2004. Council Regulation N°1/58 lists the official and working languages of the EU institutions.</p>
<p>However, as the Commission stated already in its reply to oral question <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0650_EN.html">H-650/01</a> from Mr Miquel Mayol I Raynal and written question <a href="/doceo/document/E-5-2004-1305_EN.html">E-1305/04</a> from Mr Erik Meijer, the fact that certain regional or co-official languages are not named as one of the official languages of the Union in Council Regulation No 1/58 does not call into question the cultural and linguistic importance of these language.</p>
<p>Likewise, the Commission respects and supports the principle of linguistic diversity as it is inscribed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Constitutional Treaty. However, it is the view of the Commission - without prejudice to recent Member State initiatives - that the implementation of this principle does not necessarily mean that all languages spoken in the Union have to be recognized as official and working languages of the European Institutions.</p>
<p>There are other means to promote the linguistic diversity in the Union.

In its Communication on “ Making citizenship Work: fostering European culture and diversity through programmes for Youth, Culture, Audiovisual and Civic Participation” programmes”, the Commission committed itself to table a legislative proposal in early 2005 for a “post-2006 programme”, that is for the period corresponding to the new financial perspectives 2007-2013.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently preparing this future programme, which will continue to support town-twinning initiatives, but in a renewed and simplified manner. In this framework, the Commission has launched on 15 December an open consultation with a view to draw together the opinions of citizens and civil society organisations on the orientations of the future programme. The results of the consultation will be analysed as part of the ex ante evaluation carried out by the Commission prior to making its proposal for a new programme, which is foreseen by 31<span class="sup">st</span> March 2005.</p>

However, in view of the obvious 'Community value added' characterising the previous INTERREG initiative and the considerable support given to it in the 'great debate' that preceded the reform of cohesion policy, the Commission has proposed that the third objective of the reformed cohesion policy after 2007 should be devoted to territorial cooperation in the context of its crossborder and transnational components.</p>
<p>Crossborder cooperation has, then, not just been maintained: it will benefit from increased funding, and its implementation will be simplified.

<p>Member States are obliged, under the Community’s waste legislation<a href="#defann_46_2" name="refann_46_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, to ensure that waste is recovered or disposed of without endangering human health and harming the environment. The selection of the precise disposal methods and of suitable disposal sites or installations lies within the competence of national authorities and development consent should be granted prior to establishment. In the particular case of landfilling of wastes, this must be done in accordance with the technical standards and procedures laid down the Landfill Directive<a href="#defann_46_3" name="refann_46_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. Landfills for hazardous waste must also be subject to an environmental impact assessment pursuant to EIA Directive<a href="#defann_46_4" name="refann_46_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, as amended by Directive 97/11/EC<a href="#defann_46_5" name="refann_46_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>. Other landfills and waste treatment facilities are also subject to such an assessment if they are likely to have significant effects on the environment. According to existing Greek legislation, an environmental impact assessment is required.</p>
<p>The examination of the project’s impact on the cultural heritage of the archaeological site of Vergina is a matter for the competent national authorities to address. As the Central Archaeological Committee has given its approval to the project, it is assumed that these impacts have been duly addressed.</p>
<p>The impacts of the project on the Natura 2000 site need to be addressed according to the provisions of Article 6 (2), (3) and (4) of the Habitats Directive. On the basis of the information provided by the Honourable Member, the development is not directly affecting the Natura 2000 site. While indirect effects are equally important, no information as to such effects has been provided.</p>
<p>On the basis of existing information, it appears that the construction of the waste treatment facility is currently undergoing the approval procedure of all the competent authorities under national law. This procedure must comply with Community legal requirements as mentioned above. Based on the available information, the Commission is of the view that, at this stage, there is no ground for considering that a breach of applicable EC environmental legislation has occurred. If the Honourable Member has any further detailed information that indicates that Community law is being breached, the Commission will be happy to give further consideration to the issue.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)In addition to the hostage-taking in Athens on 15 December 2004, the attacks in Madrid on 11 March 2004 and on the Moscow underground on 6 February and 31 August 2004 demonstrate that terrorist groups motivated by various causes are perfectly willing to involve users of public transport with no connection whatsoever to the motives for their actions.</p>

SNCF is a publicly owned enterprise, however, whose infrastructure and operations are largely paid for by taxpayers (in France). Throughout Europe, high-speed train routes are highly loss making, losses being offset by governments. Governments are therefore granting rail companies large subsidies, while European competition rules ban state aid for privatised airlines.

<p>(EN)Like many railway enterprises within the Union, the Société Nationale des Chemins de fer français (SNCF) is a publicly owned enterprise. However, concerning the assessment as to whether or not unfair competition exists the ownership structure is not relevant as the European State aid rules apply equally to publicly and privately owned enterprises. Consequently, State aid rules do not permit national authorities to grant large subsidies to their national railway enterprises, while at the same time banning any form of State aid for privately owned airlines.</p>
<p>In the assessment of the Commission of possible State aids to the railway sector, several elements have to be taken into account. First, the promotion of railway transport is one of the key elements of European transport policy as is laid down in the White Paper of the Commission<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Secondly, in accordance with European legislation railway enterprises do have to pay for the use of the infrastructure. This puts other modes of transport in a better position compared to rail. Thirdly, as the high speed trains in France are currently not loss-making there is a margin to lower some fares without causing unfair competition.</p>
<p>Currently, the Commission is closely monitoring the financing of railway enterprises not only in France but all over Europe. This is done in order to assure that the financing of railway enterprises is in accordance with European legislation, in particular with Council Directive 91/440, on the development of the Community’s railways, as modified by Council Directive 51/2004<a href="#defann_49_2" name="refann_49_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, and the State aid rules as laid down in Article 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)The Commission is aware that the free distribution of foodstuffs from the intervention stocks represents an important supply for many associations actively assisting deprived people in the Union.</p>
<p>The Commission has ensured that, from 2004, the appropriations are increased from EUR 200 to 216 million in order to accompany the enlargement to 25 Member States. A budget of EUR 216 million had also been scheduled for 2005. This budget funds the provision of intervention stocks and is distributed in accordance with Eurostat statistics amongst the Member States wishing to participate in the programme.</p>
<p>Furthermore, following the 50% reduction in the intervention price for rice brought about by the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the quantity of products provided for 2005 has increased.</p>

<p>From the outset, the Commission has been concerned to adapt the methods for assisting deprived people in the Community to the development of the context for this measure. This has led it to modify the applicable regulations on several occasions, in particular by introducing two significant relaxations: the possibility of purchasing foodstuffs on the market in the event of the temporary unavailability of these products in intervention stocks, and the practice of exchanging products from intervention stocks for foodstuffs of the same kind.</p>
<p>The Commission takes very good account of changes to the environment in which this measure operates and will certainly carry out the necessary modifications to the application regulations where appropriate.

<p>In November 2004 the European Parliament once again expressed its views with regard to Cuba. Cuba's democrats are criticising manoeuvres designed to soften the EU's stance vis-à-vis Fidel Castro's dictatorship; these include recent statements by the Commissioner Louis Michel. It is shocking that invitations issued to democrats in order to enable them to attend ceremonies organised by the EU and its Member States in Havana should be regarded as 'diplomatic sanctions' (subject to revision). The issue of such invitations is a procedure typical of free countries, which are not a mere extension of a dictatorship and which do not discriminate against the persecuted.</p>
<p>Does the Commission take the European Parliament's views into account? Does it deem acceptable an EU policy which is so subordinate to the views expressed and the pressures exerted by a communist dictatorship that it should result in EU diplomats' bowing before Castro's political police and censors in connection with invitations to their own houses?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)The Commission agrees with the opinion expressed by the honourable Member in his question, to the effect that the invitations to dissidents to attend the ceremonies of the Member States and the Union in Havana should not be seen as a sanction. It is an entirely normal and standardised practice in other countries for the Union’s missions to invite members of the political opposition and representatives of civil society to receptions on national holidays. It is, however, the case that the Cuban authorities have seen these invitations as a provocation and as aligning the Union with United States policy.</p>
<p>The Council is currently evaluating the measures adopted in June 2003 with regard to Cuba, including the invitation to dissidents to receptions on national holidays, which is the most controversial.</p>
<p>Within this framework, the release by the Cuban Government, in November and December 2004, of six new dissidents, including some of the most symbolic, such as the journalist and poet Raul Rivero, is a positive gesture. The Commission believes that the Union should respond to positive gestures, even if those gestures are not yet sufficient, in order to promote and stimulate further significant steps by the Cuban Government. Our objective should still be the release of all political prisoners in Cuba.</p>
<p>Within this context, the Commission takes a positive view of the proposal on a new approach such as the one agreed at technical level by the Member States last December. It would be aimed at normalising diplomatic relations in Havana, while at the same time intensifying relations with the peaceful dissidents by means other than invitations to official receptions. Cuban officials would not be invited to those receptions either.</p>
<p>The Commission hopes that this new approach will serve to prompt the release of the 61 dissidents still imprisoned since March 2003. The resumption of political dialogue sought should also have the central aim of better pursuing the objectives of the Common Position on Cuba, which remain respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, encouraging a process of transition towards pluralist democracy and a sustainable improvement in the living conditions of the Cuban people.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0573"></a>

<p>(EN)Protocol N° 33 to the Treaty establishing the European Community on the Protection and Welfare of Animals introduced into Community law by the Treaty of Amsterdam incorporated into Community primary law the principle of protection of animal welfare in the sector principally concerned, namely Agriculture, Transport, the Internal Market and Research.</p>
<p>Council Directives on the Protection of transported animals have existed since 1977. These Directives were motivated on the need to “eliminate technical barriers to trade in live animals and allow the market organizations in question to operate smoothly, whilst ensuring a satisfactory level of protection for the animals concerned”.</p>
<p>Based on a Commission proposal, the Agriculture Council of 21-22 December 2004 adopted a new Regulation which will introduce strict and innovative standards for the transport of animals from the beginning of 2007. The new provisions aim to provide higher standards of protection for animals during transport and to improve the efficiency of enforcement tools, with a beneficial effect on competition. Extensive consultation of the stakeholders concerned took place during the elaboration of the Commission’s proposals.</p>
<p>These new provisions are to apply in parallel with other measures of the Community veterinary legislation aiming at establishing and enforcing the principle of free intra-community trade in live animals (Article 1 (4) of the newly adopted regulation).</p>
<p>Indeed, Community veterinary legislation explicitly recognizes that the harmonious operation of the common market organizations in animals implies the dismantling of zootechnical and veterinary barriers to intra-Community trade and that the free movement of animals is a fundamental feature of the EU markets and facilitates the rational development and the optimum use of the factors of production. This must of course happen in conformity with the established requirements on animal welfare. </p>
<p>The adoption of the new rules on animal transport to which the Commission has referred aims notably to better reconcile the requirements concerning free circulation of animals with the principle of protection of animal welfare enshrined in Treaty Protocol N° 33.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
