<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Douglas Alexander, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, honourable Members, I warmly welcome this debate, which is held at a critical time as the European Union prepares to open accession negotiations with Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">I have enjoyed my previous exchanges with honourable Members of this House on this topic, and the close and detailed interest that this Parliament maintains in both Turkey's accession process and enlargement issues more generally has further been demonstrated by the questions tabled for Question Time later this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">The December 2004 European Council decision to open accession negotiations brought Turkey's 40-year goal of European Union membership a significant step closer and in the process helped further to bind the country so critical to our future security, stability and prosperity to the Union. The strategic case for opening accession negotiations is convincing. It includes the powerful incentive for reform and the contribution the process makes to stability and prosperity, the example that it sets to the world that there is no contradiction between Islam and democracy, human rights and the protection of fundamental freedoms, and its contribution to reducing tension in the Aegean and over Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">The June European Council confirmed the December decision and recognised the importance for the European Union's credibility of observing our existing commitments. As Presidency, our task has been to deliver on these commitments and we are working hard to finalise the Council's position in the framework for negotiations in advance of 3 October.</p>
<p class="contents">The enlargement process has had unparalleled success in spreading European values and promoting greater security across the European continent, but it is as much for its own continued success that we must ensure we are scrupulous in ensuring that all the requirements are met. As Commission Rehn, who is with us today, has said, the negotiations with Turkey will be the most rigorous yet, reflecting lessons learnt from the previous wave of enlargement. They are also expected to take many years to conclude.</p>
<p class="contents">The powerful incentive for reform that enlargement offers to candidates has been strikingly evident in Turkey in recent years. The European Commission's 2004 Regular Report on Turkey's progress towards accession noted 'substantial institutional convergence in Turkey towards European standards', the reform process having 'clearly addressed major issues and highlighted a growing consensus in favour of liberal democracy'.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much for Turkey still to do in order to reach European Union standards, including on freedom of religion and the implementation of existing legislation, and the Commission will continue to monitor Turkey's progress. But it was the impressive track record of European harmonisation reforms to date that prompted the December Council to conclude that Turkey sufficiently fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria. Indeed, in the same month, this Parliament adopted a resolution supporting the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey 'without undue delay'.</p>
<p class="contents">That December Council set Turkey two further conditions to be met before accession negotiations could be launched: to bring into force six outstanding pieces of legislation which reinforce the rule of law and human rights; and to sign a Protocol extending the 1963 Ankara Agreement to the new Member States. The new legislation entered into force on 1 June, and Turkey signed the Ankara Agreement Protocol on 29 July. Both represent significant developments. The new legislation overhauls the Turkish penal system, aligning it much more closely with European Union models and adds significantly to the reforms that have taken place in Turkey in recent years. Signature of the Protocol extends the European Union-Turkey Association Agreement – or Ankara Agreement – to all 25 Member States. It is, of course, with 25 Member States that Turkey will conduct its accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">You are all well aware that, when signing the Protocol, Turkey issued a unilateral declaration restating its longstanding position of non-recognition of the Republic of Cyprus. Last week the European Community and its Member States issued a declaration setting out its position on the issues raised. That declaration makes clear that the 'declaration by Turkey is unilateral, does not form part of the Protocol and has no legal effect on Turkey's obligations under the Protocol'. Furthermore, it states that 'Turkey must apply the Protocol fully to all European Union Member States' and that the 'European Union will monitor this closely and evaluate full implementation in 2006'. The declaration also restates that the European Community and its Member States 'recognise only the Republic of Cyprus as a subject of international law' and clarifies that 'recognition of all Member States is a necessary component of Turkey's accession process'.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council's declaration also reiterates the agreement of the European Community and its Member States 'on the importance of supporting the UN Secretary-General's efforts to bring about a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem in line with relevant UNSCRs and the principles on which the European Union is founded'. Resolution of the Cyprus problem lies in the hands of the United Nations and the communities on the island. The European Union's role is to support the UN Secretary-General's 'good offices', and to provide a context within which the two parties can re-engage with one another in confidence and accommodate the ultimate agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make one final point in my introductory remarks to this debate. Turkey will not accede to the Union imminently; 35 chapters must be opened and closed; further reforms will be required; and some Member States have already committed to referenda on Turkey's eventual accession. The Turkey that will eventually join the European Union will, frankly, be a different Turkey from the one we see today – and it may also be a rather different European Union that it joins. But the progress made by Turkey so far has been quite extraordinary and Prime Minister Erdogan's Government remains committed to further reform. The conditions laid down by the December European Council have been satisfied, and this paves the way for opening accession negotiations next Monday. I am delighted that the Foreign Secretary will appear before this Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs on the following day; he will of course update the members of that committee then on the progress made.</p>

I am glad to see that they are participating in the work of this House and I look forward to working with them in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate about Turkey is certainly very timely. We are on the eve of accession negotiations, which will begin next Monday, 3 October, the date unanimously fixed by the European Council. This opens a new phase in EU-Turkey relations.</p>
<p class="contents">The reasons which led the European Union to decide to open accession negotiations with Turkey are unchanged: the EU needs a stable, democratic and increasingly prosperous Turkey, at peace with its neighbours, and embracing European values, policies and standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The start of the negotiations will give a strong boost to those in Turkey who want to reform the country to meet the European values of the rule of law and human rights; they are also a way for the EU to exert leverage over the direction of these reforms in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">The conditions set in the December European Council conclusions have been met. First, the six pieces of legislation, including the new penal code identified as necessary by the Commission in last year’s recommendation, entered into force on 1 June. Second, Turkey signed the Additional Protocol to the Ankara Agreement on 29 July.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I would like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and rapporteur, Mr Elmar Brok, for putting forward the recommendation to give assent to the conclusion of the Additional Protocol to the Ankara Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now make some comments on recent developments in this regard. The Commission regrets the fact that Turkey issued a declaration upon signature of the Additional Protocol. This obliged the EU Member States to react and to lay down the obligations we expect Turkey to meet in a statement adopted on 21 September. The EU statement stresses that the declaration by Turkey is unilateral, as Mr Alexander very correctly pointed out. It does not form part of the Protocol and has no legal effect on Turkey’s obligations under the Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the crux of the matter. The legal services of the Council and the Commission agree fully on this point. I am aware that in paragraph 2 of your joint motion for a resolution you intend to ask the Commission to secure an answer from the Turkish Government regarding the ratification process in the Turkish Grand National Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">I am at your disposal to further inquire about the exact details of the ratification process in Turkey, but the essence of the matter is really that the declaration by Turkey is simply unilateral. It has no legal effect and it cannot in any way call into question the full and non-discriminatory implementation of the Protocol. That is what counts.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the EU expects full and non-discriminatory implementation of the Protocol, including the removal of all obstacles to the free movement of goods, which also extends to restrictions on means of transport. Thirdly, the opening of negotiations on the relevant chapters depends on Turkey’s compliance with its contractual obligations to all Member States; failure to meet these obligations in full will affect the overall progress of the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth element of the statement is that the recognition of all Member States is a necessary component of the accession process; accordingly, the EU underlines the importance of the normalisation of relations between Turkey and all EU Member States, as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the statement makes it clear that the European Community and its Member States agree on the importance of supporting the efforts of the UN Secretary-General to bring about a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem in line with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the very principles on which the EU is founded, so that a just and lasting settlement will contribute to peace, stability and harmonious relations on the island and in the region in a broader sense.</p>
<p class="contents">Right before the start of the accession negotiations, the Council should adopt the negotiating framework proposed by the Commission. This framework forms a solid basis for rigorous and fair negotiations with Turkey. It is the most rigorous framework ever presented by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I have read your joint motion for a resolution carefully. I share many of your concerns. I also agree that there is an important link between the pace of negotiations, on the one hand, and the pace of political reforms in Turkey on the other. I shall spare no effort to repeat time and again that starting accession negotiations marks only the beginning of a very demanding and complex process. Turkey will need to continue and accelerate its process of internal transformation and its transition towards a fully-fledged liberal democracy respectful of human rights and minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey’s reform process is ongoing. The human rights situation has improved, but significant efforts are still required. First, let us look at the brighter side. Recently, there have been some encouraging signals. The acknowledgment by Prime Minister Erdogan of the existence of a 'Kurdish issue' is a landmark. His trip to Diyarbakir suggests the importance the government in Turkey attaches to the economic and social development of south-east Turkey. Moreover, the academic conference on the Armenian issue was finally able to be held in Istanbul last weekend, with the support of the government and despite last-minute attempts to cancel it by an administrative court. These attempts were strongly condemned by Prime Minister Erdogan and Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Gül. This is a major step forward in seeking the historical truth in Turkey on this very sensitive issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the darker side, despite the efforts of the authorities, implementation on the ground remains uneven. On the one hand, there are signs that the judiciary is enforcing the reforms. Several positive court judgments have been made in relation to cases of freedom of expression, freedom of religion and the fight against torture and ill-treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, there have been contradictory decisions, particularly in the area of freedom of expression where, for example, journalists continue to be prosecuted and, on occasion, convicted, for expressing certain non-violent opinions. The case of the author, Orhan Pamuk, is emblematic of the difficulties faced in ensuring effective and uniform implementation of these reforms and also of the struggle between reformers and conservatives in Turkey. The novelist was prosecuted by a district judge in Istanbul under Article 301 of the new penal code for 'denigrating Turkish identity'.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already made it very clear that its assessment of the new penal code, in particular the doubtful provisions relating to freedom of expression, will depend on how these provisions are implemented. The prosecution of Mr Pamuk raises serious concerns in this respect. If this is indeed the direction taken by the judiciary in Turkey, then the Turkish penal code will have to be amended so as to ensure that freedom of expression is no longer subject to the very particular beliefs of a district judge, but simply follows European standards as we all know them, on the basis of the European Convention of Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">On these issues the Commission will continue to monitor closely the progress towards fully meeting the Copenhagen political criteria. We shall make a detailed analysis of that progress in our regular report, to be adopted on 9 November. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has reached a crucial point, the importance of which should not be underestimated. By opening accession negotiations with Turkey, we are taking out a strong option on the pursuit of the political, economic and social transformation of that country. In doing so, we respect our commitments towards it.</p>
<p class="contents">I address both to Europeans and, in particular, to Turkey the message that we must build relations founded on mutual confidence. I have confidence that the Turkish Authorities will embark upon this journey with an open mind and that 3 October will provide the opportunity to start afresh. Demonstrating a commitment unburdened by ambiguities and ulterior motives towards Turkey’s transformation into a democratic country with European values will undoubtedly be Turkey’s best chance of winning over the support of public opinion in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">During this forthcoming period, Turkey will have the opportunity to demonstrate that it is serious about integrating European values. Countries that wish to join the Union must, in fact, share our vision of Europe and our concepts of democracy, the rule of law, human rights and solidarity. They must also share our standards whether they relate to society, the environment or industry, among other areas. If it is the case that the European Union is taking a gamble on their future accession, it is because we also believe that it is in our best interests and that it will benefit our fellow citizens. I undertake personally before this House to rigorously enforce our criteria and conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, as I said previously, the journey is just as important as the final destination. The reforms count. Although the common goal of the negotiations is membership, such negotiations are, by their very nature, open as far as the outcome is concerned. However, it is in our mutual interest that this process is structured around clear and rigorous principles, such as those provided for in the framework of the negotiations. That is the best guarantee of success.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Elmar Brok (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the additional protocol, like so many other issues around the beginning of negotiations with Turkey, raises what is very much a point of principle, that being the question of whether a candidate for accession is willing to accept all the parts of that entity of which it desires to become a member, or, to put it another way, whether it recognises all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In December last year, the Commission put to the Council the proposition that recognition in international law was not necessary at the present time, but that the signature of the additional protocol on customs union between the EU of 25 and Cyprus would be sufficient. Turkey did comply with this requirement, albeit with a unilateral declaration that made it at least questionable whether the protocol would be implemented. The Council responded to this with a statement to the effect that this was quite simply not valid in either political or legal terms. Our Committee, though, asked the Commissioner, orally on 13 September and in writing on 15 September, to make his good offices available to us, and he agreed to do so. To date, we have had no response to the question as to whether the Turkish Government intends to include this unilateral declaration in the process of ratification by that country’s parliament. The fact is that, as and when this is made something that the Turkish parliament needs to ratify, thereby making Turkey’s non-implementation of it a matter of law, that presents us with a problem. I therefore invite you, before we proceed to the vote, to provide the Committee on Foreign Affairs with the statement it has requested, and which is mentioned in the joint resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">We should make it clear that it is Turkey that is asking to join the European Union and not – contrary to the impression I sometimes get – we who are inviting it to join us. We must not lose sight of the fact that the joint statement, as submitted by the groups, attaches a great deal of importance to the additional protocol actually being put into effect. If we are to address this problem, we would be well advised to negotiate the chapter on customs union by 2006 at the latest and conclude negotiations on it by the end of that year, in order that this issue – which also has a bearing on the recognition of Cyprus – can be speedily resolved and that we do not end up negotiating with Turkey without the prospect of this fundamental issue being resolved. For that reason, we agree with the Commissioner and the President-in-Office that we will need, in future, to again avail ourselves of the good offices of the United Nations in order to resolve the Cyprus conflict as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I might be permitted a few personal observations. Yesterday, somebody asked me why it is that torture in Turkey – of which there are thousands of instances – is not a fit subject for debate, while an unresolved issue about a general can stand in the way of negotiations with Croatia. I have to admit that I was unable to come up with an answer to that. We should be honest in the way we do politics, taking care not to use arguments as pretexts for our own subjective political ends; instead, we need to be very clear and honest in stating where we stand on this issue. One reason why the resolution submitted by the groups in this House is so important is that we also need to make it clear that one criterion that must be met is the European Union’s capacity for absorbing new Member States – both as an end in itself, and because it raises questions about what is financially possible, what is actually practicable, and what the institutions are capable of handling. I would like to see the Council and the Commission, in these weeks and months, apply to the period of reflection on the Constitution the same consistent effort that they are devoting to Turkey’s accession. Then we might make some headway on this issue of absorbency.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not lose sight of the fact – which the groups’ resolution makes clear – that it is for us in this European Parliament to state that the conditions are formally met – in contrast to their form of words, which refers to ‘sufficiently fulfilled’ – and that issues of minority rights, issues relating to the processes of reform within Turkey, and the freedom of religion issue have a major part to play in this. This summer, the Commissioner exchanged letters with the Turkish foreign minister on the subject of the Law on Foundations, in the course of which the foreign minister rejected the improvements that the Commissioner had suggested, and stated that such things were a matter for the parliament, and then only after 3 October. Issues of pluralism, tolerance and freedom of religion, not to mention the right of the Orthodox Church to train its own priests, which it has been unable to do since 1971, are, after all, issues of substance touching on the European Union’s understanding of its own values and should be given prominence in the early months of the negotiating process.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it – and this is true of Turkey and of many other countries – the prospect of membership of the European Union has an important part to play in these areas. It exerts crucial leverage in getting internal reform processes going in such countries as those in the Western Balkans, Ukraine and Turkey, and it is for that reason that we should never shut the door on them. We also, however, need to be realistic and open-minded, not only about the results we expect from negotiations, but also about the ends we have in view.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hans-Gert Poettering, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE-DE Group</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, scarcely any political issue has such far-reaching implications for the existence of the European Union as the possibility of Turkey becoming a member of it. Being a major issue, opinions differ as to what is to be done about it. Speaking on behalf of my group, and having been one of the signatories to the joint motion for a resolution, let me say that, on so fundamental an issue as this, we do of course allow every one of our members to vote in whichever way they choose, because this is an issue on which every single member of our group has their own opinions, not only because we allow them to, but because it is our profound conviction that they should. That is why different members of our group can be found taking up different positions on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">We do, however, agree on one thing, and it is for that reason that we have been able to give the motion for a resolution our unanimous backing, that being that both parties to the negotiations on Turkey must see them as open-ended as regards their outcome. We want to stress that we all have an interest in democracy, the rule of law, and human rights in Turkey developing in such a way that they are brought closer to our values. Even if Turkish accession is not the ultimate objective, or even if, at the end of this process, Turkey does not become a Member State, we can, today, tell our Turkish friends and partners that it is still very much in our interests to seek a close alternative partnership that will put partnership, cooperation and friendship with Turkey on a sound footing. Having listened to all that has been said by the President-in-Office and the Commissioner, let us not mince our words: we are dancing around as if on eggshells, with statements being issued by this party and that, by Turkey on the one hand and the Council on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Brok has reminded us, Commissioner, you gave the Committee on Foreign Affairs an undertaking that you would attempt to get the Turkish Government to make a statement to the effect that its non-recognition of Cyprus and its refusal to let Cypriot ships or aircraft dock or land on Turkish soil was not an issue in the process of ratification by Turkey. That declaration has not been forthcoming. If we do not get from you such a declaration, in which Turkey assures you that these matters will not feature in the ratification process by noon today, then our group will move that approval of the protocol be deferred, for it is logical – both politically and inherently – that there should be no vote on this until such time as such a declaration from the Turkish Government is in our hands.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me ask a very serious question: how do things stand as regards human rights? I suggest you go and ask the Patriarch of the Orthodox Church, Patriarch Bartholomew. Where the freedom of Christians to practise their religion in Turkey is concerned, nothing has changed. We, in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, are all in favour of partnership, friendship and dialogue with the Islamic world, but that cannot be a one-way street. Islam, too – meaning, in this instance, the Turkish Government – must be willing to acknowledge the legitimate rights of Christians in Turkey and to give that practical expression. That is something that worries me. I am addressing the President-in-Office of the Council – who will, I hope, pay attention – when I say that I call on the British Government to apply the same standards across the board. We know what the human rights situation in Turkey is like, but what about Croatia? We are refusing to begin negotiations with Croatia on the grounds that this general is not being handed over, even though it is patently obvious that the government is not in a position to do that. For Turkey, though, almost all of us close our eyes and apply different yardsticks. I urge you, for the sake of your own credibility, to apply uniform standards and treat Croatia, too, fairly and objectively.</p>
<p class="contents">This is very important, and we urge the Commission to do it. Although it can always rely on our support, we will also take a highly critical line if there is no improvement in the human rights situation within a specified period of time after negotiations with Turkey begin. We know that torture is still going on. If a stop is not put to it, we must also be ready to defer negotiations. We must not pass over these violations of human rights in silence.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the last point I want to make: it is a very important one, and I shall quote from our joint resolution, which I signed along with Mr Eurlings and Mr Brok, whom I want to thank warmly for jointly leading the negotiations on behalf of our group. Paragraph 16 of it states that the Treaty of Nice is not an acceptable basis for further decisions on the accession of any further new Member States and that Parliament therefore insists that the necessary reforms be brought into force within the framework of the constitutional process. What that means is that it is not just Turkey that must meet the conditions for accession. That is a hard and tricky road to go down, and we hope that Turkey will go down the road that leads to democracy, to the rule of law and to human rights. We too, the European Union, must be certain that we can cope with an accession. If that is not the case, then it is irresponsible to keep on enlarging this European Union of ours, for we will end up with something that is no longer the European Union. Here, at the heart of the European Union, let us do what has to be done to make this European Union strong and effective.</p>

That is the message contained in his speech, so let him say so, rather than pussyfooting around the issue. If he does not want Turkey to be a full member of the European Union, then let him say so. His group’s website includes pages full of some of its members saying that very thing. That is the point at issue and that is what he is fighting shy of.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me tell you what our group wants. It has been decided by the Heads of State or Government, 18 of whom are Mr Poettering’s political allies, that 3 October is to be the day on which the accession negotiations are to be kicked off; they will take between ten and fifteen years and are not a free ride, for their conditions have been proposed by the Commission and defined by the Council, and it is these that we are discussing today.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me name a couple of conditions that are indispensable. If Turkey wants to join the European Union, there are fundamental conditions with which it must comply. One thing on which we do agree is that a country cannot seek membership of the European Union while not recognising one of its Member States; that is impossible. We therefore argue that the commencement of negotiations cannot be conditional upon recognition, but recognition must be forthcoming at some point during their course. We also want to make it clear that we cannot wait until the end of a fifteen-year process for it; it must happen at once, at some point in the first or second year, and if the protocol to which Mr Brok referred is not put into effect, which means that Cyprus is not recognised, then the accession negotiations will have to be suspended.</p>
<p class="contents">Delighted though I am that Mr Poettering agrees with us about this, I ask the House to hold the applause a moment or two longer, for there is more to come. If you want to enlarge the European Union, you have to make it fit for enlargement. That is something else on which we agree, and this joint resolution says so. If Mr Poettering wants to be better understood, he will have to be very precise in the language he uses.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union does not have the capacity to cope with Turkey’s accession, then it cannot cope with Croatia’s either. I can tell Mr Poettering what his group, by its policy, is saying: it is saying that it does not want Turkey because Turkey is distant and Muslim, but that Croatia is acceptable on the grounds of being Catholic, conservative and close at hand. That is what his group’s policy adds up to: hypocrisy and nothing more! It is not acceptable to string a candidate country along for 40 years with promises of EU membership; it is not acceptable to demand of such a country that it put itself through processes of transformation that it has already undergone. Under no conservative government – whether that of Mrs Çiller or that of Mr Poettering’s great mate Mr Yilmaz – has Turkey made such progress towards democracy as it has done under Mr Erdoğan.</p>
<p class="contents">So let me spell out the fact that the increase in security that could result from Turkey’s full membership is not to be underestimated. We cannot, however – and I include my own group in this – be naive and say that it can join tomorrow. Its accession is dependent on conditions, and those conditions apply to both parties. Turkey must comply with them, and so must the European Union. This debate could do with a bit more honesty. If you find Turkey unacceptable, then you should say so openly. We want to give it the chance, but we do not know whether its accession will, at the end of the day, be possible, for there are reforms to be implemented by both countries, by both parties.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling by Mr Langen)</span></p>
<p class="contents">You in particular should be more reticent, Mr Langen. I have a clear recollection of December 1995, when this House’s most eloquent advocate of accession was none other than your good self, and that makes you one of our leading hypocrites. Let me tell you, I have a good memory, and shouting the odds does nothing to make your arguments less false. I ask Members to give some thought to the fact that the European Parliament ...</p>

I would be grateful if that at least could be done.</p>
<p class="contents">It is apparent from the uproar among the Christian Democrat Members how hard it is to bear when one is publicly caught out.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me tell the House what our group regards as important. We have, of course, had the same debate that Mr Poettering describes as having gone on in his own outfit. In my outfit too, by which I mean our group, there is more than one opinion, but I do want to return to paragraph 16 of our joint resolution, because it was evident from Mr Poettering’s speech that we will soon have to debate Croatia.</p>
<p class="contents">The same fundamental preconditions apply to Croatia too: cooperation with the International Court is a <span class="italic">conditio sine qua non</span>. It is clear from paragraph 16, though, that another fundamental precondition for any enlargement is that the European Union should have a constitution. If that constitution is not the one that is proving unacceptable in its present form, then let me make it quite clear that enlargement needs more than just Nice and a few adjustments to it. If the European Union is to be made fit for enlargement, we must keep on demanding a constitution for it, we must maintain that as our goal. That applies in the case of Turkey, but let there be no misunderstanding: it also applies in the case of any other candidate for accession.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to know whether Mr Poettering would insist just as enthusiastically on these two conditions being coupled together if this debate were about Croatia. I look forward to seeing whether he will, in that event, be just as passionate in demanding compliance with fundamental preconditions as he has been demanding it of Turkey. That is a day to which I look forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I will sum up by saying that we, as a group, will be voting in favour of the resolution. As regards the adjournment that Mr Brok envisages in the event of the answer not reaching us by midday today, let me say that, if Turkey really does put that on the agenda for the ratification debate in its parliament, then the result will be precisely what we have specified in the joint resolution. The negotiations will then have to be suspended, perhaps even deferred, so an adjournment will not be necessary.</p>

<p class="contents">All the groups have signed an important compromise document together, putting forward a united position, but we have also sacrificed a number of points of correctness for the sake of this unity.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the document is extremely harsh in the demands it makes on Turkey, and such an approach does not even encourage the Greek Cypriots to be more flexible or for them too to seek a solution to this situation, for which they are largely responsible. We must not forget who rejected the referendum; we must not forget the reasons why we are in this situation. I am saying this just to show how things stand.</p>
<p class="contents">A country that was about to join prevented a European Union Commissioner from speaking on state television, and that Commissioner has said that the Greek Cypriot authorities betrayed his trust and went back on their word. I am saying this because we are not doing even our Cypriot friends a favour if we do not demand that they too show a sense of responsibility regarding this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, for those who, like us, have belief and hope in a political Europe as a political, economic and moral force, it is clearly a surprise that we ourselves are not delighted at the success that our gentle European influence is having in Turkey. Perhaps we ourselves do not realise that a number of taboos have recently been broken. Armenia is being discussed in Turkey and it is being discussed with the support of the government: in spite of everything, the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister have supported opening this debate. The Kurdish taboo has also been broken: one need only recall the Prime Minister’s recent speech on the mistakes made in that area and the fact that they have accepted responsibility for the Diyarbakir intervention. These are successes achieved by political Europe, by our capacity for encouraging open, more respectful, democratic structures and systems.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that we are entitled to be critical, but we are not entitled to be cynical; the early death of the European Constitution on the electoral scaffolds of France and the Netherlands has left the continent without an ideal border for its maturity, leading to a build-up of resentments and cynicism, which do not constitute a policy.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not the way to do politics; that is not the way to create a federalist, liberal policy for the Europe that we want: one that encourages freedom, the rule of law and democracy.</p>

<p class="contents">Just shut up, will you?</p>
<p class="contents">We do indeed have a new dimension to deal with, and the question with which it presents us is this: is it, post-9/11, important in terms of Europe’s interests to give Turkey the chance of accession? That question can be answered in different ways, but it must be answered by reference to the interests of the European Union, the interests of the people of Europe, rather than on the basis of emotional, cultural, or racist resentments. That is not acceptable and we do not want it!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Mr Brok spoke without the microphone)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If you are not, if you do not think I mean you, then I do not. In that case, I mean Mr de Villiers. Stop thinking that everything refers to you! You are not the centre of the universe!</p>
<p class="contents">At present, the arguments used in Europe against Turkey rely on feelings, on racist resentments directed against Islam. Not all those who are against Turkey use these arguments, but they ride the wave of these sentiments. It follows that all those in the ‘no’ camp must ask themselves what their arguments unleash, and it is for that reason that I think it right to argue that Europe needs to change first, that Europe has to do its homework, and that Europe needs a constitution; these are things with which nobody disagrees. Europe cannot enlarge itself the way it is now.</p>
<p class="contents">As to whether Europe can, subject to the conditions in the Treaty of Nice, make itself more united by including Croatia, I too have my doubts. That is a legitimate debate. The other debate, though – the debate about whether Europe can absorb a country whose population is predominantly Muslim – is nonsensical. Today, in Europe, there are more Muslims than there are Belgians. They are already included among us. The question of how European Islam is will arise with Turkey or without it, so let us stop discussing it. Islam is the third-largest religion in Europe; whether I, as an atheist, find that to my liking is another matter.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason that the only question to be asked at the end of this debate is what Turkey will be like in ten years’ time. Will it be a democratic state, a secular state? Is Islam European? Will this same Turkey be prepared to join with us Europeans in contending for the values that we enshrine in a constitution? If the answer to those questions is in the affirmative, then I will bid it welcome; if not, then we will have to think up something else.</p>

While people may be familiar with these points, it is not a useless exercise, in my opinion, to reiterate them today. Our group has done so in its motion for a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first instance, it is a question of actually enforcing standards of democracy, as well as actually complying with internationally recognised civil rights and human rights. That obviously includes the civil, political and cultural rights of the minorities and, above all, of the Kurds. This is an aspect that the draft compromise which has been submitted to us, and which is, moreover, satisfactory overall has surprisingly and regrettably overlooked. Well, in our opinion it is vital that Turkey abandon once and for all any notion it might have of solving the Kurdish issue through the use of military force, that it acknowledge the political dimension of the conflict and that it promote reconciliation, particularly with the Kurds who have relinquished the use of their weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same spirit, it is a question of getting Turkey to agree, contrary to any form of nationalism, to look its past in the face by recognising the Armenian genocide. It is significant, moreover, that the unacceptable court action brought against Orhan Pamuk should focus at the same time on the Kurdish issue and on the Armenian issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is a question of ensuring, within a short timescale that it would be useful to clarify from the first phase of the negotiation, that Turkey recognise the Republic of Cyprus, withdraw its occupying troops from the north of the island and, for the time being, fully implement the commitments contained in the protocol extending the EU-Turkey customs union to the new Member States, in particular the Republic of Cyprus. This of course means that Turkey must respect in full the unrestricted access of Cypriot boats and aircraft to its ports and airports.</p>
<p class="contents">Within that list, there are no excessive or unwarranted conditions. On the whole, these measures live up to the expectations of Turkey’s democratic forces themselves. Like us, they want to create the conditions for their country to join the Union in the future. For them – for the Turkish and Kurdish democratic forces – these negotiations constitute an exceptional lever for accelerating the changes that they consider to be necessary. Therefore, our vigilance is to their advantage! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This could mean that Europeans will never consent to it. If Europeans oppose this enlargement both now and in the future, creating the mirage of full Turkish membership of the European Union will amount to creating a tremendous disappointment and upset for the government in Ankara. When the Turkish issue was first debated in the House in December 2004, I pointed out that it is abundantly obvious that all the advantages of closer economic, political and military ties with Turkey can be gained without full membership. Much has been written on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">I should today like to highlight a further problem linked to this enlargement, namely the loss of political and geographical balance it involves. Postponing Croatia’s membership and avoiding a statement on Ukraine’s rightful place in Europe whilst pressing forward with this process for Turkey is painful and unacceptable. It is exceedingly costly and damaging to the European Union in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and in the other countries I mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schulz and Mr Poettering maintain that our capacity for absorption is limited. If so, I would prefer to use this capacity differently. The document before us is actually an attempt at blackmail, as it conditions the enlargement process to the so-called constitutional process.

<p class="contents">When should Turkey recognise all Member States? What is the timetable for opening the Turkish airports and seaports?

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Camiel Eurlings (PPE-DE). – </span></span>  <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, just before the planned start to the negotiations, the relationship between Europe and Turkey is going through a very rocky patch, first of all as a result of a counter-declaration from Turkey that the Commission tried to prevent at all costs, but secondly because Turkey’s perception of what would be needed in order to join the European Union is incompatible with the rules of the club. They perceive things differently.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why at the moment, what we need, above all else, is clarity – clarity about what the rules are and what should happen, and that is why I welcome our joint resolution, for it is bringing us exactly that. It stipulates that the recognition of Cyprus is not negotiable. That country must be recognised as soon as possible; if not, serious consequences may follow. That is what we in this House believe and that is what we should stick to. Mr Schulz mentioned a timeframe of one or two years; so it would be unacceptable even for the Socialists if Cyprus were not recognised in two years’ time, and that is something of which we have taken note. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, clear language is also spoken with regard to the implementation of the Protocol. That should be set down right at the beginning of the negotiations in 2006; if not, this may have serious consequences. With this in mind, I would add that there is another side to this. Europe must take responsibility for encouraging the UN to reconcile the two parties in Cyprus. Last weekend, I spoke with the two leaders of both factions, but they had not seen each other in years. We should at the very least press the UN to send someone out there to talk to both parties. Anything else really would be an admission of weakness.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as regards the legal position of the declaration, the Commissioner is right in saying that it has no legal meaning for us, but Mr Brok and Mr Poettering are also right to say that we have a problem if the Turkish Parliament uses it as part of the ratification. Mr Schulz argues that, if Turkey uses it for the ratification, we must cease negotiations forthwith. How can he claim such a thing if he wants the process with Turkey to go well? I hope that the Commissioner will soon be able to confirm that Turkey is not making ratification dependent on it. Should Turkey do so anyway, it would be preferable for Parliament to keep in check, and suspend the whole process, so that we can exert maximum pressure to ensure that Turkey does not go down that undesirable route and avoids problems rather than, as Mr Schulz says, us maybe having to call the whole thing off in two months’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution is also very clear about how we should deal with the negotiations in time. Whilst Turkey has, apparently, formally met the starting conditions, I would add that the new acts are problematic, because Articles 301 and 305 of the penal code ensure that Orhan Pamuk can be persecuted, a judge can call off an Armenian conference, and I am delighted that Prime Minister Erdogan has spoken out so clearly during the conference, also with regard to the Kurdish issue. That is courageous.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to really solve problems, though, those laws need amending, including the law on religious minorities, which is not worthy of a country that wants to be part of Europe. It can never be right that priests cannot be trained there after years of promises, and that churches are still being taken from the people. That is why I welcome the use of the word ‘deadline’ in this resolution. If we take the priority as regards political criteria seriously, we must be so bold as to set clear deadlines and warn them that they have one or two years to put matters right; otherwise, we cannot move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Last, but not least, the resolution makes explicit reference to absorption capacity. Europe’s capacity to absorb a large country such as Turkey will need to go hand in hand with a constitution and financial arrangements, but above all, the man and woman in the street will need to be persuaded. That is for Turkey to do by means of good campaigns and real reforms, but there is also something for this House to do – not only speaking clear language in this resolution, but also by delivering on that language in the years to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Where Turkey is concerned, there is a difference in attitude between some of the groups to the left, or to the left of centre, and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). That is the first point I wanted to make. I am pleased, though, that we have a clear draft resolution and I hope that it will make it through the voting round unscathed.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, we mainly took this House’s position last year as our starting point for drafting the resolution. We have also deliberately repeated a number of points from it in order to explain the negotiation framework that this House would like to use in the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">We have asked for the first phase of the negotiations with Turkey to centre on the political criteria, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the position of minorities. In that way, the European Union will be able to bring pressure to bear on the Turkish Government not only to set down these rights and freedoms in law, but also to implement them effectively. We have insisted on this many times and will continue to do so; Turkey should therefore put this reform into practice and give it practical expression, so that we can evaluate progress in a good light.</p>
<p class="contents">It is at least as important to confirm once again that the ultimate goal of the negotiations is full EU membership. At the same time – and that is also expressed in the resolution – the outcome will of course depend on the process itself. Success is our goal, but there are no guarantees. As the Commissioner said himself, the process is in itself very important and will also have enormous consequences for the future of Turkey itself.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said, unfortunately, that the debate on the opening of the accession negotiations with Turkey and the text of the resolution are being overshadowed by two issues, firstly the recognition of the Republic of Cyprus, and, secondly, the extension and implementation of the customs protocol, also again in relation to Cyprus. These two problems, I am sad to say, have been brought on by Turkey itself.</p>
<p class="contents">It is beyond us why a global decision such as opening ports or airports should be an immense problem of principle. We cannot understand why Turkey finds it so difficult to recognise all members of a club to which it would like to belong. That is why we insist on Turkey relinquishing its objections surrounding the extension of the customs agreement and on it implementing the Ankara Agreement in full and without discrimination. That is why we insist on Turkey formally recognising Cyprus as soon as possible after the negotiations have started. That is why we press home our position that signing an agreement with 25 countries also implies the recognition of 25 countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We are afraid, and that is also reflected in the resolution, that these issues could lead to hitches in the negotiation process, or even to its suspension. That is not in our interest or in that of the Turkish Government or of the Turkish people. We would therefore expressly call on the Turkish Government to set down to work on this straight away so that these problems can be eliminated.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, although this is not a debate about Cyprus, or the Cyprus issue, this issue has been tabled and I would like to raise two questions in its connection. First of all, like Mr Eurlings, I would like to ask all parties to return to the negotiating table in order to break the <span class="italic">impasse</span> surrounding the future of Northern Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to ask the same parties, as well as the Council and Commission, not to hesitate any longer and take the necessary steps in order to give the economy, and with it the people of Northern Cyprus, a chance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me again make it abundantly clear that I would like the reformers to win. That means that the EU, in its relations with Turkey, must not mince its words, but must also be fair. Where Cyprus is concerned, the signing of the protocol by the Turkish Government means, to my mind, 100% implementation. Let there be no doubt about this. That also means, though, that the EU must deliver on its promise to bring the northern part of Cyprus out of its isolation, and that also means, while we are on the subject of Cyprus – and this I say for the benefit of the Socialist Members of this House – that things must be done in their proper order: we first need to ask Kofi Annan to examine whether a solution is possible, and then follow it up with recognition, because the other way round will not work. Being frank and fair also means that we need to praise Turkey for the new penal code, while pointing out to the reformers that this new penal code still contains far too many clauses and articles that can be misconstrued by the conservatives to frustrate the reformers, as we have seen in the case of the author Orhan Pamuk; that is why further changes are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as I am concerned, the negotiations can begin. I wish the Commission and Council much fairness and clarity and I wish the reformers in Turkey much strength and wisdom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that it is accepted that decisions taken following referenda are respectable, as stated in the motion for a resolution, irrespective of whether she personally expresses her regret. However, I would expect Mrs Bonino to also explain the reasons why the Greek Cypriots rejected this plan and, also, to clarify that 35% of the Turkish Cypriots said 'no' and, also, that the settlers who are committing a war crime under international law also had the right to vote in the occupied territories in Cyprus. That by way of a brief comment.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey must honour its obligations under international law and the principles on which the European Union is based. Account must also be taken of the fact that the European Union consists of 25 Member States which include the Republic of Cyprus and that it would be a paradox if Turkey were to accede to the European Union and, at the same time, to have an occupying army on the territory of a Member State and to refuse to recognise it.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this framework, Turkey has to apply fully and without discrimination the provisions of the protocol, including the chapter on transport. As such, it goes without saying that Turkey has to recognise the Republic of Cyprus.</p>

We have already had the first punishment: a Constitutional Treaty that has been torpedoed by two referendums. A second, late electoral punishment is in the offing in the form of new referendums if it turns out that the so-called ‘open-ended negotiations’ with Turkey are to culminate in membership. Why do the Member States not simply opt for a solid neighbourhood programme with Ankara? In the final analysis, even a fully-fledged Customs Union between the EU of 25 and Turkey is already throwing up a nigh insurmountable political obstacle in the shape of the deep divisions about the divided Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the prospect of negotiations with Turkey particularly saddens me on account of the position of the Christian church in that country, which is – and I emphasise this – without rights, and I am not even mentioning the serious cases of physical abuse of Turkish Protestants last month. I am looking forward to initiatives on the part of the Council and the Commission as regards compliance with the Copenhagen political criteria, and Commissioner Rehn might remember that I called him to account on the same subject one year ago.

The Turkish Government’s refusal is, on the contrary, a sign of surprising intransigence.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that it was a unilateral statement without legal effect, but for that very reason it was serious and unjustified. No less surprising is Europe’s attitude: with its eternal compromises it has once again shown its ambiguous role of putting off and exacerbating problems instead of solving them.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to emphasise that the outcome of Turkey’s accession procedure must not be a foregone conclusion. Turkey has to make tangible commitments, and we cannot make allowances on that account. I do not mean to say that there have been no improvements, but there is still too much to do on torture, respect for human and civil rights, and the protection of minorities. Above all, Turkey must not refuse to recognise an existing European Union Member State like Cyprus, let alone continue to occupy Cypriot soil with some 40 000 Turkish troops. What is needed is a serious, transparent accession procedure in line with the values of integration and mutual respect.</p>

Unfortunately, last year saw retrogression and no progress.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing essential thing, apart from legislation on sex discrimination, was requested from Turkey. That was that it extend implementation of the Ankara Protocol to include Cyprus.

<p class="contents">Turkey's treatment as a candidate country has to be fair, but strict. Who among the previous ten candidate countries would have dared, when embarking on their negotiations, not to recognise a Member State? And yet that is the case with Cyprus.

He did it a disservice, though, in delivering this unacceptable unilateral declaration at the same time as he signed the Ankara Agreement. It goes without saying, though, that this agreement has legal consequences that Turkey must not merely accept but also put into effect.</p>
<p class="contents">I do nevertheless believe that we, in the European Union, need to show Turkey what it means to think and act in a European way, and to go forward in confidence and with consistency. That is also why I believe that the European Union must open negotiations on 3 October. Why is this so?</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, although the reform process that is going on in Turkey is facing obstacles and problems, to which Mr Kasoulides is right to draw attention, it would be irresponsible of us to curtail it, and it would be damaging to Europe. Rather than do that, we must help it along.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must give all groups in Turkey, and such minority groups as the Kurds in particular, the chance and the opportunity to use this reform process as a means of finding new ways of expressing their culture and participating in political life.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we have to ensure that Turkey, having been recognised as a candidate for accession to the European Union, should also, and in a similar way, improve its relations with all its neighbours, particularly, of course, with Armenia, and this will involve, among other things, acknowledging its own history and the atrocities to which that testifies.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, it is absolutely vital that we also give support to the Turkish-speaking population of Cyprus. We have a lot to say – and rightly too – about the island’s Greek-speaking majority, but let us not forget that it was the Turkish minority that said a resounding ‘yes’ to reunification and a resounding ‘yes’ to Europe. Let us not forget either that Europe has so far failed to discharge its obligation and responsibility to this minority in such matters as trade and financial support.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, we should adopt a consistent attitude and say an unambiguous ‘yes’ to getting negotiations underway. It will be a difficult process, with many, many problems to resolve, but we must make sure that Turkey presses on with the reform process. If Turkey succeeds in doing that, then it can and should become a Member State of the European Union. It is only if it fails in this that we will need to seek out other forms of relationship with it.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say, for Mr Poettering’s information, for the sake of absolute clarity and the avoidance of doubt, that we, in this group, hope that 3 October will see the opening of negotiations not only with Turkey but also with Croatia. That would be a great signal to move forward. We have no desire to play Turkey and Croatia off against each other. Both countries are worthy of negotiations being opened with them. If we can start them now, the negotiations with Croatia will certainly be completed before those with Turkey, but let us go forward into the future of our continent with both these countries together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In spite of these serious violations of the duty to remember and of the principles of democracy, Europe’s institutions are acting as though there were nothing wrong and are confirming that the die is cast: on 3 October 2005, the European Union will begin accession negotiations with Ankara.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, in a word, to respond to all those who explain to us that starting these negotiations in no way makes their results a foregone conclusion. That is untrue, and for at least two reasons. The first is that these negotiations are opening explicitly with the subject of accession in mind, and not with a privileged partnership in mind. To say otherwise would be to lie. The second reason is that, obviously, the opening of the negotiations will lead to the subject of accession. Over several years, we will open, examine and then close again, one after another, the various chapters relating to accession. Yet we already know how the situation will end: no country, at the close of a long process, will take the responsibility solely upon itself of saying ‘no’. To say otherwise would again be to lie.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Europe is undergoing the most serious crisis in its history, and there is no project or prospect on the table, either from the Council or from the Commission, apart from the prospect, if the recent declarations are anything to go by, of turning our back on political Europe. The only item on the agenda is the enlargement to include Turkey, just as though, in this bewildered Europe, perpetual forging ahead were from now on taking the place of vision. In the future, Europe will require a real overhaul. We will support all those who wish radically to reform the European project in order finally to give substance to a political and democratic Europe.</p>

The first thing I have been asked to do is to thank all those in this House who, over a period of many years, have campaigned for human rights and democracy in Turkey, and that at a time when Turkey, like the rest of the world, was waging the Cold War, and when some of those talking about human rights today saw everything in Turkey except the problems with human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I bring with me a plea for us to press on with the process of bringing the country closer to the European Union, for that is the only way in which democracy and reforms will be put on any kind of sustainable footing in Turkey.</p>

In contrast, constitutional reform has remained a mere aspiration and there is still the 10% barrier in electoral law that prevents the Kurds from having their own representatives in parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">A new law restricts lawyers’ ability to carry out their professional duties; journalists can be arrested and their articles considered an attack on territorial integrity; teachers’ unions have been condemned for defending everybody’s right to speak their own language as well in school; and Mehmet Tarhan, a young Turkish gay, has been sentenced to several years in prison for claiming to be a conscientious objector.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is even worse in the Kurdistan region. Only a few weeks ago, Prime Minister Erdogan raised hopes that a peace process might begin, but nothing of the sort has happened. Although the Congra-Gel have declared the suspension of all military action, there are still reports of violent military action against the Kurdish population, together with torture and rape.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must call on Turkey to politically acknowledge the existence of the Kurdish issue and to start public negotiations. The road to the European Union passes through Diyarbakir, the capital of Turkish Kurdistan. Human rights and respect for democratic rules are non-negotiable, yet the Turkish Government does not seem to have any intention of agreeing to the call from the European Court of Human Rights to grant Abdullah Ocalan a retrial. The European Union must not ignore that situation, unless it wants to undermine the credibility of that institution.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea that Turkey can join the European Union without recognising Cyprus is utterly unacceptable: the ball is now in Turkey’s court. We can negotiate on economic and customs agreements for years, but never on human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An example yesterday: it prevented the Pope from going to celebrate mass in Istanbul. Tell me, which other country in the world prohibits the Pontiff from visiting it? Even communist Castro received the Pope with the honours befitting a head of state. Turkey bans him. That is racism. This ban is racism. It is not just against the Ecumenical Patriarch; it is not that they have converted the biggest church in Christendom, Saint Sophia, for oriental dances and swimsuit fashion shows. It is an insult. What is happening is an insult to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It does not recognise Cyprus and some people are talking about the Annan plan. If the Annan plan was so attractive to Turkey, let it apply it to the 20 million Kurds. If the occupying army leaves, the 1960 constitution will be restored, with a Greek Cypriot President and a Turkish Cypriot vice-president and there is an end to it. Automatically, northern Cyprus will enjoy the benefits that southern Cyprus enjoys. It is a straightforward matter; it just needs logic, not the intervention of the Americans which, unfortunately, also directs the steps of Europe here in this Chamber.</p>

In particular, those like me who live on the most southerly patch of European soil, in the heart of the Euro-Afro-Asian basin, are aware more than anyone else of the need to establish borders and boundaries in a spirit of peaceful coexistence.</p>
<p class="contents">The democratisation process that the Turkish Government has launched with a view to possibly joining the European Union still seems slow, uncertain and contradictory. Some obstacles have undoubtedly been overcome, but others have yet to be removed. It is not a case of the West subjecting Turkey to a long, never-ending examination, but it is essential to base enlargement on foundations of democracy and respect for civil and international rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union therefore has a duty to support Turkey on its westward journey of preparation, but it also has a duty to be inflexible and intransigent in this field.

The <span class="italic">pacta sunt servanda </span>principle appears to apply only to us, with no demands being made of Turkey, which is evidently – to judge by the events of the past few months – not even prepared to abide by our rules. <span class="italic">Pacta sunt servanda</span>; but not even the Council or the Commission put that into practice, for they constantly break the rules, and infringe the treaties that we have in common. They really ought to be taken to court for it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Copenhagen political criteria are non-negotiable, and the other candidate countries had to fulfil them before negotiations could begin. Suddenly, none of that applies to Turkey any more, even though – despite all the reforms – everything there is wrong. What has happened? Commissioner Rehn said earlier that the Commission finds Turkey’s misdemeanours regrettable, yet it is still arguing forcefully in favour of negotiations and full membership. The Commission tells us that Turkey now attaches great importance to economic and social development in its south-eastern regions; well, it does not. What is going on there at the moment is a great show staged by Mr Erdoğan. The truth is that the Kurds are shut out not only from the EU process, but also from their own national parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that it was a member of the Turkish Government who originally blocked the conference on the Armenians. Orhan Pamuk is being put on trial. The day before yesterday, Turkey’s gay and lesbian organisation was outlawed. Peaceful demonstrators were beaten to the ground and then hauled before the courts. Torture is still widely practised. The position of women is shameful; that alone is a reason to say no to negotiations being started, for there is no prospect of any change in that area. Freedom of religion does not exist in practice, but Turkey quotes it as justification for the country’s Islamicisation. By abandoning – whether out of naivety or in the service of massive national interests – any and every means of exerting pressure, the European Union is allowing all these things.

At this point, however, I should like to say to Mr Erdogan: frankly, you did not help us with your unilateral declarations when the Ankara protocol was signed. As you know, there are three groups in this Parliament, as has been seen clearly today.</p>
<p class="contents">There are those who let it be clearly known that they do not want anything to do with Turkey and who have even been gleefully making funeral preparations.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a second group: those who resign themselves to a marriage of convenience by telling themselves that, after all, Turkey is a great country, it is a crossroads for energy resources, it has water, it is a friend of the United States and it behaved correctly during the Iraq war by not interfering in events and that, when all is said and done, there still remain 71 opportunities for each country to use its veto during the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is a third group, and this third group, to which I myself belong, believes in this project but believes in it as a real political project, opening the way to a tolerant, pluralist Europe that is accepting of diversity. This is not a funeral. Instead, this huge project, which is a tremendous gamble about which the voters will require some convincing, involves two aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that we will not compromise, not on Cyprus, not on the Armenian issue, not on the rights of the Kurdish people and not on women’s rights. What we want is a proper marriage in which the parties concerned can speak their minds. We are adamant in wanting democracy of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, there is a second aspect, which is even more difficult to get right. Will we – by whom I mean Europe – be able to change without betraying our social model? In welcoming Turkey, will we be able at the present time not only to enhance our institutions and to vote in favour of the Constitutional Treaty but also to show solidarity with this country which, large though it is, is nonetheless poor? That is a question that remains open. However, if we open the negotiations, we must not forget that, in a marriage, there are two partners and that each of them bears a responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Signing the protocol on customs union was meant to be a quasi-recognition of Cyprus, which would have enabled Ankara to save face while also meeting one of the essential conditions for the opening of negotiations. The disregard of every agreement by inserting the additional statement, whereby recognition is rigorously, but surreptitiously refused, and the toothless new compromise, amount, in many respects, to brinkmanship. Not only are we no nearer to resolving the issue of Turkey and Cyprus, but giving in would mean that Turkey would be dictating terms to us, which is absolutely unacceptable. Further evidence of this is provided by Turkey’s frequently arrogant attitude in demanding from the EU strict adherence to undertakings already given and backing these demands up with threats, while not regarding itself as bound by any treaties or agreements whatever. That is not the right way for Turkey to become a part of Europe.</p>

From now on, we know that the only significant decision to be taken in this second – and yet altogether crucial – half-year of 2005 will be the opening of the negotiations with Turkey. Such a decision is the height of pretence and of diplomatic correctness, shows indifference to the opinion of our populations and is inconsistent with the European integration project. It is, above all, this project that we are talking about. The European Union that we desire is not the one that Turkey’s presence would force us to create. There is an incompatibility between our political Union and the destiny that this great Nation State, which we respect, wishes to pursue on a sovereign and nationalist basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 15 December 2004, the situation has become even more perilous than what we have known in the past. We can clearly see that, when it comes to freedoms, rights, the non-recognition of the Armenian genocide, the situation in the region populated by the Kurds and, finally, the refusal to recognise Cyprus, the negotiations will be conducted under Turkey’s, rather than Europe’s, terms, which is a state of affairs that we have always criticised. How can it be said that, after the decision taken by the Council at the end of last year, we have now more adequately met the conditions for opening the negotiations?</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, ladies and gentlemen, it is imperative for this Parliament, which represents the people, to give a strong signal by postponing the decision on the Ankara protocol and by saying that the negotiations cannot be opened under the conditions that there is a desire to open them under today.</p>

The task, however, is a very difficult one, as this debate shows, since hostile forces exist that are gaining ground and striving to see this process end in failure.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, what we have here is a textbook case illustrating the political difficulty involved in taking decisions that are burdened with complications in the short term and whose positive results it will only be possible to appreciate in full 10 or 15 years later. That is why I urge you to grant a great deal of importance and to devote a lot of time to the task of explaining. You have to publicise the difficulties, of course, such as this unilateral Turkish declaration on Cyprus that has just been mentioned, as well as the recent cases of people being sentenced for their opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, we must also emphasise the progress made and the reason for the delays. With this in mind, I cannot but believe that the declaration on Cyprus, which we regret, is a response from Turkey, long-awaited by its people, to the refusal of the UN draft by the Greek Cypriots. That does not excuse anything but does help us to gain a better insight into events and, above all, urgently to inform the UN of the need to step up its work and to resume its mediation. Furthermore, we must, above all, lay a great deal more stress than at present on the meaning of the academic conference held in Istanbul only recently on the Armenian issue. It is a taboo that has finally been broken, and it has taken a very firm commitment from the Prime Minister to make this happen. This does not mean that, from now on, Turkish public opinion is prepared to recognise what took place, but at least it is the start of a crucial stage towards such recognition.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, the process will fail if the negotiations that you are conducting and the progress that they give rise to are not mentioned. Give descriptions, explain yourselves – you need to fight on two fronts: that of your Turkish partners and that of European public opinion. Fight on both of them and never fail to do so! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, that is the way it should be in the EU, which is, and needs to be, a community founded on the rule of law. Turkey is developing rapidly, as I have seen with my own eyes. Turkey really is changing day by day. This process of transformation is something that we must support and encourage. Not everything is, however, as it should be in Turkey – far from it. The customs agreement between the EU and Turkey has been signed, but Turkey will still not allow Cypriot ships to call at Turkish ports. That is completely unacceptable. What I am demanding of Mr Erdogan is crystal clear. Turkey must treat the Cypriot ships as if they were Danish or French ships. They must have access now. The EU’s foreign ministers must make this indispensable demand of Turkey on Monday, 3 October 2005. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I do not have time to rehearse them now. For me the key argument is one of democratic accountability. The accession of a new Member State as large as Turkey would dilute the influence of all other Member States and would, therefore, further compromise the self-determination of the people I represent in the UK's East Midlands. For this key reason I oppose Turkish accession.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge our Turkish friends to consider the proposal of Germany's Angela Merkel for a privileged partnership. This is not a second-best option; on the contrary, it would give Turkey most of the benefits of full membership with few of the costs. It is, therefore, a better deal than full membership. Indeed, privileged partnership is such an excellent deal that I wish it were available to my country, the United Kingdom. It would be a much better option than full membership on current terms.</p>

Those conditions have been met. The process of modernisation that has been taking place in Turkey over the past 70 years has been massively accelerated and additional attention is now being given to human rights issues and to overcoming historic grievances.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there are still dissident elements within Turkey that pursue separatist ambitions or wish to reorient Turkey away from westernisation. Care must therefore be taken to ensure that any weakening of protective state structures does not become an opportunity for radical elements to change the nature of Turkey's unified and secular democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard that the negotiations will be the most rigorous yet. Natural justice and fair play should demand that Turkey be treated in the same way as other candidate countries to the European Union. The Cyprus issue should be a matter quite separate from the candidacy of Turkey, but it has become inextricably linked. The history of that island has been distorted these past 30 or so years. There have been wrongs on both sides and no justice is served by the pretence that the Turks alone carry the blame. We should ask no more of Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots in relation to the Republic of Cyprus than we ask of Greece and the Greek Cypriots in relation to Northern Cyprus. It was the people of Northern Cyprus who voted in favour of the Annan Plan; it is the Government of Northern Cyprus that has expressed its readiness to reopen negotiations on the basis of the UN Secretary-General's plan. The rejectionists are in the south. Why should Turkey open its ports to ships flying the flag of the Republic of Cyprus when the ports of Northern Cyprus are closed to international trade and direct international flights cannot land at Ercan airport?</p>
<p class="contents">In May 2004 the EU Council promised to end the isolation of Northern Cyprus, but has done little about it. That is not justice. The Cyprus issue must be resolved. The unification that so many of us want to see must be brought about in a manner which meets the concerns and interests of both communities on the island, not just one.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the opening of negotiations with Turkey. Those negotiations will last for many years. Commissioner Rehn has correctly observed that for Turkey the journey is as important as the destination. What is clear is that the prospect of Turkey's accession will have a catalytic effect on the nature of the European Union; the EU will have to drop its integrationist ambitions and become a looser community of sovereign nations. This will be of enormous benefit to us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Equally, the idea that Turkey must join the EU in order to be transformed is incomprehensible. By the same argument, we should get Iraq, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Nepal and many other not-so-democratic countries to join the EU. A woman does not get married to her rapist in order to reform him. She stays well away from him and hopes he is put in prison for a long time. Let us stop behaving like a subordinate of the United States.

For the first time, we are expanding beyond the borders of Europe. We are no longer talking of a European Union, but rather a superstate.</p>
<p class="contents">There are nevertheless huge risks attached to opening negotiations with Turkey. Firstly, the interests of Cyprus must not be violated simply because of the presence of Turkey, a large country. The fact that Turkey does not recognise one of the Member States is an indication of her attitude as she enters the negotiation process. If the intention is now to commence talks without Turkey having recognised Cyprus, the whole process will be very humiliating for the entire European Union. Turkey will be dictating to us how to proceed, rather than the other way round.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier on, the leaders of a large number of countries emphatically demanded that Cyprus should be recognised. Hopefully they will not now be withdrawing their demands. I myself, as someone who represents a small country, am very worried that we will be allowing Turkey to walk over Cyprus. Evidently, nothing has been learnt from the French and Dutch referendums.</p>
<p class="contents">I was especially worried by what Mr Schulz and Mr Cohn-Bendit said. They were so keen on the idea of an EU superpower that they paid no heed to the position of Cyprus, a small country. They did not talk about the status of the minorities in Turkey: the position of Christians, the Kurds, or even the status of women there. If they just want to make the EU into a superstate and do not at the same time strongly insist that Turkey should make headway in human rights matters, we can only ask: where does the racism really lie?</p>

The government is taking the report very seriously and has started to get new projects moving and to enact new legislation. In fact, the Minister told me that the number of relief centres has increased from 15 to 26.</p>
<p class="contents">While I was in Turkey, many things have happened that have given people in both Turkey and the European Union much to think about. The problems concerned were a conference about the Armenian issue, the persecution of Orhan Pamuk, the recognition – or not, as the case may be – of Cyprus, and the closure of an organisation that stands up for the rights of homosexuals, Kaos-GL.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell you from first-hand experience that the conference on the Armenian issue, despite claims in various media to the contrary, did take place. In the end, the conference took place at the Bilgi University where I was, as it happens, giving a speech on women’s rights at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also spoken, in Turkey, with Orhan Pamuk, the author, who is hopeful that the whole thing will fizzle out. He was also somewhat taken aback at the commotion in Europe. The Pamuk case indicates how important freedom of expression is. Whilst a government may not be able to interfere in the independent administration of justice, it can change laws that cause confusion in its interpretation.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Cyprus is concerned, I was given the assurance that the Turkish Government would certainly recognise Cyprus once a sustainable solution has been found for the whole of the island. The good news about the homosexual rights organisation Kaos-GL is that it is still active, but I would urge the Turkish Government to leave NGOs such as this one alone. They too must be able to take part in public debate openly.</p>
<p class="contents">I would call on both Turkey and the EU to remind themselves of what is at stake when the membership negotiations open on 3 October. I wish Turkey and the EU much wisdom and patience on that day and in the days to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is because we are diverting attention from ourselves; it is because the way the Turks are putting us on the spot hurts. The European Union was meant to take over peacekeeping operations on the island on 1 May 2004 – but we did not. We kept none of our promises. We have neither put an end to Northern Cyprus’ isolation, nor have we injected the EUR 259 million we promised for the reconstruction of the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not just the case that Turkey has to recognise the Republic of Cyprus; we must, once and for all, acknowledge that the Turkish Cypriots who live on the island are people with equal rights. Young North Cypriots are not even allowed to participate in international sporting events – still less are North Cypriots welcome as Members of the European Parliament, or as observers in it. When we say, in the Ankara Agreement, that we want to open up all the ports and airports, then the port at Famagusta and Ercan airport must be among them, in accordance with the principle of equal rights for all – unless, that is, Turks are second-class human beings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The people have requested some respite. Well, this unfathomable Europe, that of our Heads of State or Government, is demonstrating, once again, that it is not interested. This is a two-fingered gesture to democracy. Thus, nothing will be able to halt Turkey’s accession process, the accession of this country that lacks the courage to apologise for the Armenian genocide; of this country that does not recognise the existence of our friends from Cyprus. Well, the Council told us that such recognition was a fundamental factor. As far as I am concerned, it is an essential factor. Torture and discrimination against women still go on in this country, which does not respect minorities and the freedom of worship; it has no place in the European Union. Who are we trying to kid?</p>
<p class="contents">In order to reassure public opinion, the Council today maintains that Turkey will be very different as a result of its joining the European Union. Then, we are told that the negotiating conditions will be so difficult as to ruin these negotiations. What hypocrisy! What do the people of Turkey think about this? And Europe for that matter? Europe is in crisis, and this crisis is serious. Its institutions are not allowing it to operate properly with 25 Member States. It still has no budget for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you to the UK Presidency, whose only track record will be that of having bowed to US pressure calling for Turkey’s accession. This Europe refuses to come to a decision about its borders. What has become of our European integration project? We are told that this accession is necessary for our economy and our security. Well, in that case, we should propose to Turkey a strategic partnership with a view to a strong cooperation project with that pinnacle of Europe comprising Russia, our new neighbours from the East, Turkey and the Maghreb. Turkey has no business in joining the European Union. Truth requires the courage and the determination to demand that the opening of the negotiations may result in this partnership. Unfortunately, Europe is continuing to forge ahead regardless, and with a cowardliness that our fellow citizens no longer accept.</p>

<p class="contents">This means that the start of negotiations with Turkey does not imply that everything is negotiable. On the one hand, the honest will of the Union to see a European Turkey as an equal member one day is non-negotiable. On the other hand, Turkey's obligation to apply the protocol in full is non-negotiable and Turkey's obligation to recognise Cyprus is non-negotiable.</p>
<p class="contents">If these obligations change into a simple wish list, it will be catastrophic. Consequently, clear objectives are needed, together with timetables, cut-off dates and sanctions if they are not achieved. We owe it to the people of Turkey, to its millions of citizens who honestly wish for a European, democratic, prosperous and peaceful country. We owe it equally to the European citizens, in order to combat easy and dangerous Turko-scepticism.

We have to ask ourselves what is actually going on. Where Cyprus is concerned, what is the truth of the matter? While the extension of the customs agreement amounts to its indirect recognition, a unilateral statement is made at the same time to the effect that it is not recognised at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Never before, in the whole history of the opening of accession negotiations, has anything like this happened. The Turkish attitude may well be understandable, but we, in this House, must not stand for this sort of coercion.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say, secondly, that nobody has so far been able to convince me that Turkey meets the political criteria; it may do so on paper, but it does not in reality. Authors who make explicit reference to the Kurdish and Armenian problems are hauled off and find themselves in front of a judge. Lawyers who seek to defend the Kurds’ human rights are obstructed when they try to represent their clients. I do not want to go into the issues surrounding women’s rights, but they fall a long way short of European standards.</p>
<p class="contents">It was in the hope of progress in relation to human rights that the EU undertook to open negotiations with Turkey, but the crucial thing is that we are applying dual standards here. We are, for example, taking a far more tolerant line towards Turkey than towards Croatia, which has produced far more evidence of progress in this area and is meeting the targets of the Council Task Force’s Action Plan.</p>
<p class="contents">The Eurlings report represents an attempt at squaring the circle. If it is not somehow laid down in black and white that these negotiations are open-ended, and if this House’s minimum requirements, as set out in these two additional amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, are not complied with, then I am in favour of rejecting the whole report in order, before 3 October, to send a message, not least to the Council.</p>

I would rather have anticipated difficulties relating perhaps to religion or ideology, and now it appears that Turkey is creating difficulties at political or diplomatic level. The fundamental question arises as to whether Turkey wishes to join Europe in a responsible manner, or whether Europe wishes to admit Turkey irresponsibly, at any price, in the spirit of international socialism or as a previous speaker put it in such fine romantic language, in the spirit of love. But fine is only what is true.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, is this not a case of our being hoist by our own petard, or in other words of our being caught out by the rule sometimes known as too much invested to quit? With all this in mind, is it not the case that Europe has moved too far in Turkey’s direction, despite the latter behaving like a spoilt child blackmailing its parents? Is it not perhaps also the case that Europe cannot now afford to lose face by withdrawing, or does not know what other solutions it could conjure up to ensure coexistence and a common future?</p>

<p class="contents">The Turkey of today certainly could not join the European Union, but we are not debating that, and the resolution that we are going to adopt includes a raft of conditions. We are debating the possibility of revitalising Europe as a leading figure that can promote a project of democracy and stability at a time when the world has seen a prevalence of insane political decisions based on hatred, fear and the presumption of exporting democracy with bombs. Such decisions have led to death, insecurity and greater instability.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had enough of giving in to fear. We need a change, a sign, I would say a different policy, like the Zapatero-Erdogan proposal taken up by Kofi Annan regarding an alliance of civilisations. I am therefore in favour of opening negotiations for the sake of the security of Europe’s citizens; for the sake of peace; for the sake of the fight against terrorism, which, to be effective, must also include political decisions to isolate terrorists; and for the sake of the strength of Europe as a model of democracy that exports democratic values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Which is more important: democracy and the Copenhagen criteria or Turkey's significance as a geo-strategic partner? There is a serious danger that those who favour the geo-strategic argument are underestimating the gaps in Turkey's democratic attainments to date.</p>
<p class="contents">Views are deeply divided as to whether matters are improving or deteriorating in terms of meeting Copenhagen criteria. The decision to press charges against Orhan Pamuk on grounds of having libelled the Turkish Republic because he had spoken critically of the Armenian genocide and the treatment of the Kurdish minority is deeply worrying. In a fully democratic state these cannot be grounds for criminal proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">There are those who would overlook these and many other shortcomings on Turkey's part, not least by saying that they are 'road accidents'. The trouble with that approach is that it gives too much leeway to those who are not really interested in the democratic transformation of Turkey. Equally, it disheartens the country's committed democrats. What is the point of being committed to democracy if others can get away with non-democratic behaviour?</p>
<p class="contents">All this raises a difficult question: does the Turkish Government have control over all the institutions of the Turkish state? If it does not, then there is no way that Turkey can comply with Copenhagen criteria. That in turn raises the even more difficult problem of the Turkish armed forces, which still have the right to intervene in the political process as guardians of secularism and the country's territorial integrity. Is that compatible with Copenhagen criteria?</p>

I would like to shall begin, however, by echoing the earlier remarks made by Commissioner Rehn in welcoming to Parliament the Bulgarian and Romanian observers.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome also the timeliness of this debate and the genuine efforts of Mr Brok and other Members of this Parliament to ensure a broad base of support, so that the voice of the European Parliament is genuinely heard before 3 October.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to thank Commissioner Rehn for his contribution to the earlier discussions. The terms and substance of his contributions evidence the extent to which a common approach is being taken by the Presidency and by the Commission on the important issues facing us.</p>
<p class="contents">I pay tribute to Mr Brok and his predecessor as rapporteur, and indeed to the leaders of all the political groupings we have heard from today, in setting out their views so clearly. I would like to take this opportunity to recognise the work of other Members of the European Parliament, for example Mrs Pack's work in relation to women's rights in Turkey, which I think has been evidenced by both the experience and the expertise brought to our discussions and deliberations this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask Parliament's forgiveness for not seeking to respond to every specific point that has been raised during the course of what has been a long but nonetheless illuminating debate. Instead, let me try to address the main themes that were picked up on by a number of different speakers.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall start with the general point alluded to by Mr Wurtz, which was that the Presidency is steering the Council to fulfil the mandate of the December European Council's conclusions, which were then indeed reaffirmed by the June Council. The decision essentially to open negotiations with Turkey on 3 October has therefore already been taken. Our job as the Presidency is to ensure that the conditions are met and that the framework for doing so is agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context let me touch on the issue of Croatia, which was alluded to by Mr Brok, Mr Poettering and indeed by Mr Schulz. Turkey and Croatia are of course separate issues. Conditions have been set out for both and the Council will make decisions independently on the basis of an assessment of those objective criteria. I am pleased, however, that in the case of both countries it is clear already that the anticipation of making further progress in relation to both countries' desire to be part of the European family has brought significant progress, as was recognised explicitly by Mr Duff in his contribution this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall also address some of the specific questions that were raised. Concerns were raised about Turkey's statement prior to 3 October. It is important to recognise specifically that concerns were raised in relation to the recognition of Cyprus and the implementation of the AAP. The Council's position on both of these matters is clear, and indeed was set out in the declaration which I quoted in my introductory remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">I will let Commissioner Rehn reply to the specific points relating to your letter to him, but the Council's position on the need for full implementation, including the statement, has already been made clear. Indeed, the need for monitoring is also set out.</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically in relation to the reforms that have already been undertaken, but also, more significantly, continue to need to be taken, I have noted very carefully the concerns expressed here this morning, whether in relation to the position of minorities, to the freedom of religion and expression or, indeed, more broadly on the issue of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Rehn has already commented on the specific issue of the case of Orhan Pamuk, the distinguished Turkish writer. I would, however, respectfully remind Parliament that the draft negotiating framework, and the overall reform process set out by the Commission, are designed to address exactly those concerns. Indeed, that is one of the reasons why both the Commission and the Council has been so keen to take forward the process of negotiation to ensure further progress in relation to the reforms. It is also worth reflecting at this point in our debate on the words of Mrs Bonino, who made clear that the European Union process has already achieved a huge amount within Turkey, notwithstanding the fact that there is much further progress to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">One question left hanging in the air somewhat in some of the contributions has been to ask what the ultimate goal of the discussions and the process being taken forward is. Again, the starting point in responding to that question is to recall the conclusions of the December Council of 17 December 2004. Let me quote directly from the conclusions: 'the shared goal of the negotiations is accession'. However, the statement also went on to say that 'these negotiations are an open-ended process, the outcome of which cannot be guaranteed beforehand'. So let us be very clear that the shared goal of negotiations was full accession, but, equally, the conditionality inherent in that statement was very clear.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also taken note today of the concerns that have been expressed over the absorption capacity of the Union. Indeed, this is reflected in the Commission's draft negotiating framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Some speakers referred to the need for a settlement in Cyprus and this is, of course, an important and sensitive issue. However, I welcome the Parliament's recognition of the importance of widespread support being garnered for the UN process, and again that is reflected in the Council's earlier declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point I want to touch on is the issue of the Constitution. Many have talked about it in relation to Turkish accession. I would, however, respectfully remind Parliament that there will be further opportunities for discussion on the European draft Constitutional Treaty. Indeed, the June decision of the European Council was to have a further rendezvous and revisit this issue in spring 2006. That does not remove the obligation on the Council or the Commission to continue to make progress on a range of areas concerning Europe's future in the meantime. That is what we intend to do. I value the contributions made in relation to our thinking about Turkish accession and particularly value the opportunity to have heard the views of MEPs at this particular stage, given the imminence of the decision and the process now being taken forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Olli Rehn, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I compliment Mr Alexander, especially as regards the questions about the legal nature of the declaration. Like him, I will skip the small talk and get straight down to business.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members have asked whether the Commissioner can provide a written statement from the Turkish Government concerning the ratification process and the nature of the declaration. I take this question very seriously and I am willing to ask for details of the ratification process from my counterparts in the Turkish Government. We need to take into account that Turkey has a parliamentary system – thank God, it is a parliamentary democracy. It is the Turkish Grand National Assembly that will have to ratify the Ankara Protocol, not the Government of Turkey. I am sure that as parliamentarians you well understand the order of business and will agree that it would be a very delicate matter and indeed questionable for a Commissioner to give guarantees on behalf of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The key point that needs to be underlined again is that the declaration made by the Turkish Government can in no way call into question Turkey's obligations. The protocol has to be fully and properly implemented and the declaration does not in any way reduce the legal relevance of the Turkish signature of the protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a very strong revision clause in the EU declaration that the Member States adopted last week, which refers to 2006. Moreover, we have all the necessary means to make sure that full implementation takes place, for otherwise there will be direct consequences for the progress of negotiations. There is a very clear and strong conditionality – and please let us not underestimate the intelligence of Turks. They know that in order to make progress in the negotiations they must fully implement the protocol, as they have signed it and will soon ratify it.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the prospect of new peace processes in Cyprus, which was referred to in many speeches, the European Union remains fully committed to our overall objective, which is the reunification of Cyprus. In that context, I would like to recall the declaration by the EU and Member States, which agreed last week, and I quote, 'on the importance of supporting the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General to bring about a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem'.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission remains ready to assist the United Nations wherever possible, as proactively as we have done, and we will continue this work with determination in the future. However, let us be frank and open here: the keys to the solution are in the hands of the two communities and it is high time that both communities engaged in a serious dialogue with each other, so that Cyprus can become a Member State like all others, united and in peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Both communities are keenly interested in a solution and they are best placed to address the critical issues. Certainly, we also expect Turkey to continue to work constructively towards a settlement and support the resumption of the UN efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us also recall what today's vote is all about. It is about concluding a procedure on the EU side, relating to a commitment that we have ourselves demanded, even insisted on, from Turkey. Now that we have achieved this, there are some on our side who say 'no thanks'. Seriously, I cannot help comparing this to a rather strange situation on a football field. Imagine that your team has worked very hard for 89 minutes to score a winning goal. Finally the striker is alone in the box, he passes the goalkeeper and he is just about to put the ball into the empty goal when suddenly the coach shouts 'stop, turn round and bring the ball back'! Maybe this makes sense to some but certainly not to me. To my mind it is rather like an own goal.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it is difficult to understand why this House would want the Customs Union to apply only to Germany but not to Poland, to Greece but not to Cyprus. Again, this may make sense to some but not to me. By voting for assent now, you will help to extend the Customs Union to all new Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and this is extremely important, I want cordially to ask honourable Members, for the sake of Europe, not to weaken our negotiating position by postponing assent to the protocol. Instead, by voting for assent now, we will be giving the European Union far greater credibility in its demand for rapid ratification by the Turkish Grand National Assembly. That should be our objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Please let us keep this main target in mind and, for the sake of our credibility and for the sake of Europe, let us vote in favour of assent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My misgivings are founded on the simple fact that Turkey is not a European state. To maintain that that statement is an indication of racism and of hostility to Islam is a distortion of the facts and a deliberate slander that I wish to repudiate. Mr Cohn-Bendit himself drew a subtle distinction between those who are self-evidently European and a shift towards Eurasia. That was actually a very astute line for him to take, although he then threw his chance away by starting to deliberately and slanderously accuse those who take a critical view of the situation as racists, and that is something I repudiate!</p>

That argument was settled years ago when we accepted Turkey’s membership of the Council of Europe. Opponents of Turkey’s membership try to equate ‘European’ with ‘Christian’. Yet Islam has played a part in Europe’s history and culture for centuries. In any case, the motto of the European Union is “unity with diversity”. We are not trying to harmonise cultures but to find ways of working together whilst keeping our various identities.

Turkish recognition of Cyprus, respect for human rights, better treatment of the Kurds, recognition of the Armenian genocide and many other issues must all be dealt with, as Turkey is currently far from any acceptable standards. The only way to raise such standards is to continue dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
