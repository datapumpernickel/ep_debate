If, however, it is indeed a question of reacting firmly to the violence being committed in Côte d'Ivoire, we also have to take much longer-term action, and not only when the situation becomes untenable.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we think we need far-reaching reforms not only of France’s, but also of the European Union’s, policies on Africa. The reforms should relate, in particular, to issues of sustainable economic development in the foreign policy we conduct with regard to these countries. In the case of Côte d'Ivoire, it must, even so, be emphasised that the falls in the cost of raw materials and of cocoa have plunged a large portion of the population into extreme poverty, which is helping to destabilise the country still more.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has also very recently renewed its fishing agreement with Côte d'Ivoire, which poses huge problems at a time when Côte d'Ivoire is in a state of civil war and there is no means of monitoring these fishing agreements. There are also the structural adjustment policies which have hugely destabilised the education and health systems and the public services. In short, all these policies – economic, commercial and financial – also play a considerable role in the political situation in these countries, a fact that obviously does not in any way detract from the responsibility of the African and Côte d'Ivoire politicians themselves. We most certainly need, however, to take long-term action to link these policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, we cannot, on the one hand, advocate the development of armed forces in the North – albeit in the good cause of disarming forces to whom, incidentally, we have previously sold arms – and, on the other hand, help thrust whole populations into extreme poverty by means of inequitable and destructive financial and commercial policies, thereby making it that much more difficult to establish a democratic state governed by the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore want to see the European Union steer a totally different course regarding Côte d'Ivoire and all the African countries so that all these aspects might be reconciled and so that we are not content merely to react – react though we must – to extremely difficult crises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People used to flock there in search of work and prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is very worrying because there has been clear incitement to violence. This is particularly resonant when one recalls that exactly the same situation arose in Rwanda, where the militias were urged to attack civilians, and French civilians in particular, in messages broadcast both on government and private radio stations. I welcome the fact that this incitement to violence through broadcasts has been dealt with in the UN resolution, but would also like to see the United Nations being granted, as part of its mandate, a peacekeeper's right to deal with such situations.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Côte d'Ivoire is primarily about the blame game. When I was there around a year ago on an ACP-EP mission, there was a great deal of talk from the North and the South, the rebels and the government, about which side was responsible for the failure of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The resentment in that country is not just against France. The weight of history is now being used as a potent weapon to arouse popular resentment against President Gbagbo and France. Some fear that Abidjan is going the way of Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a country whose skyscrapers and boulevards now lie in ruins.</p>
<p class="contents">My view is based on what I saw when I was in Côte d'Ivoire, and is that this confrontation is much more between African and African. It pits ethnic groups from the North against ethnic groups from the South and landowners against migrant workers who want to be landowners. It is also a confrontation over Côte d'Ivoire's most valuable asset, cocoa. What makes the situation particularly intractable is that there are issues that were never resolved at independence and which have continued to fester ever since. These are questions such as: who exactly is a citizen of the Ivory Coast? Who can rule the Ivory Coast? Who can stand for election in the Ivory Coast? Who can own land in the Ivory Coast? The northerners claim that they are being disenfranchised and are continuously being discriminated against by the elites – as they see them – in the South. The problems in Côte d'Ivoire will never be resolved until property rights and other demands are addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with reference to the UN resolution, I agree that the arms embargo is of great importance. What the previous speaker did not mention, however, was the very important fact that this embargo was strongly supported by the African Union, which is a very positive development. Chapter VII of the UN Charter authorises the use of force in the event of the arms embargo not being respected. I should therefore like to ask the Commission how it will ensure the EU supports and works with the UN in its efforts in Côte d'Ivoire and takes stronger action, over and above Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, in respect of the situation there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We should not forget that in the case of one of West Africa’s most important countries, it was claimed for years that the democratic framework of society was stable, and the presence of several tens of thousands of Europeans and the relatively stable economic situation of one of the world’s largest exporters of cocoa meant that observers of events from Abidjan failed to notice the racial problems present in the country, and, above all, the inherent risk of tension between the Christian south, the Islamic north and any refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no question that today’s difficult situation is the result on the one hand of rivalry between France and the United States over West Africa, and on the other hand of a deterioration in the country’s economic situation, which has triggered social tension and acted as a breeding ground for religious groupings of an extremist bent. Something which is particularly alarming is the number of acts of violence carried out against the civilian population on grounds of nationality, race and religion. Despite the fact that this issue involves a conflict between two imperialist powers, we must therefore do everything in our power to support the deployment of international peace troops, with a majority of these troops being African, as only in this way will we be able to put the basic conditions in place for the crisis to be resolved. This would also be one way of appeasing the anti-French sentiment aroused by the intervention of the former colonial power’s army.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe it is appropriate to paralyse the regime’s air force merely because a number of opposition armed groups exist in the country, and should like to note that such measures offer no kind of solution to the situation. The only thing which is certain is that they bring nothing but suffering to the vast majority of citizens, as well as a deterioration of health and social services. We cannot look idly on while human rights are violated and while the population is incited to commit violence, destroy infrastructures and silence the opposition, and indeed putting an end to such actions is one of the aims of the motion for a resolution. I should like to urge you in favour of this resolution. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As in the majority of West African countries, of course, there is tension between the Christian and animistic South and the predominantly Muslim North, as well as problems relating to borders, which were drawn by the colonial powers in a highly arbitrary manner and which generally separate ethnic groups, and sometimes even entire nations, living on either side of them. There is of course also economic and social instability, which is another consequence of the mistakes made by colonial powers. Yet there is one thing of which we must be aware; none of these factors can justify the use of violence or human rights violations. We must also remind those in positions of responsibility in these countries and within the Organisation of African Unity, or the African Union, of their duty to become heavily involved in achieving stabilisation in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Item 6 in our joint motion for a resolution – a resolution which is also supported by my group – could be interpreted as criticism of France, but I should like to make it clear that such criticism would be unfounded. It is of course true that everyone makes mistakes, France included, and it is indeed to blame for some of its colonial problems in West Africa. On the other hand, however, it must be said that without the French we would have absolutely no hope of ever putting an end to the murders, robberies and looting in Côte d’Ivoire. It is all well and good for this House to hold speeches and adopt resolutions, but it is the French soldiers, and sometimes French civilians, in Côte d’Ivoire who have to put their heads on the line for a peaceful solution. This is why we must show our solidarity with them.</p>
<p class="contents">Item 6 of the resolution is not, as I understand it, a criticism of France, but of the other countries in Europe and the rest of the world which have left France to deal with this matter alone, very conveniently beating a retreat and shirking their responsibilities. I should therefore like to counter Mr Kohlíček’s comments by saying that the former imperial and colonial powers do, of course, have responsibilities, but it must also be said that without the French presence in Africa in the 1970s and 1980s, the Soviet Union would have occupied central positions on the continent, and so France prevented these positions from falling under the control of the Communists and their expansionist ideology.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it would perhaps not have been possible to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia, as we did yesterday, had there been no opposition forces in the 1970s and 1980s. Today we are faced with the responsibility of ensuring that a fresh start is made in Africa, by working in partnership with the nations of Africa and not by acting as a colonial tyrant. In order for a fresh start to be made, of course, the acts of violence must first come to an end. When this has happened, it will be important to achieve a new ethnic balance, to promote statehood, to build civil society, to solve problems relating to the different nationalities living within countries, and, above all, to bring about decentralisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Experts on issues of church-based development aid, such as my colleague Mr Dess, are doing exemplary work in supporting decentralised projects, by which I mean not flagship projects, but projects which really help people. This is the way of the future; building democracy from grass roots upwards by means of local self-government, decentralised projects, helping people to help themselves and not – and this is another point upon which I agree with the critics – by means of flagship projects, which are more reminiscent of the colonial past.</p>

These figures reveal the disastrous consequences of the French intervention in Côte d'Ivoire. France’s role has proved ambiguous, as the whole of its African policy now is. What is the lesson to be drawn from these grave events in Côte d'Ivoire?</p>
<p class="contents">Global anarchy in the area of migration leads to grave dangers on which terrorism feeds. The Arab-Islamic world is in a state of high agitation, and the West is a privileged target for radical Islamists embarked upon the conquest of our continent, as demonstrated by the development of networks in Spain, Great Britain, Belgium, Germany, France or the Netherlands. Not wanting to regulate migratory flows constitutes a danger to the future of Europe. Like it or not, immigration is the key problem of the new century.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time to correct a number of drastic mistakes and to think in terms of a balanced and realistic project of North-South cooperation that respects everyone’s identities, territories, cultures and religions. The only reasonable course for the European and African continents lies in close cooperation. Europeans and the French need to know that they have everything to gain from the success of better cooperation, for the balanced development of Africa will help loosen the threatening stranglehold of migration and help reverse the flows.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with this aim in mind that we propose another North-South dialogue based upon confidence, honesty and the protection of our reciprocal vital interests. To paraphrase President Mbeki’s favourite quotation, it is time that something new in this area came from Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union has consistently expressed its deep concern at the violence by both camps since the start of the crisis in September 2002. While the situation improved slightly last year, it has deteriorated again since the beginning of this year, particularly recently. As Mrs Kinnock said, Côte d'Ivoire was known as an economically successful country, but clearly there is no long-term economic prosperity without political stability and respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In March, the government security forces and parallel militias indiscriminately killed innocent civilians in Abidjan and committed massive human rights violations. We know that at least 120 people were killed. Abidjan has changed and Mrs Kinnock compared it to Kinshasa.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Aubert and others have stressed, several mass graves containing more than 100 bodies were discovered in June in the northern part of the country now controlled by the ex-rebels of the new forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Freedom of expression and the media have been serially breached. On 1 November the main opposition newspapers were looted and vandalised by the young patriots. Pro-Gbagbo extremists took control of the public radio and television. They have been inciting violence against foreigners. International radio transmissions have been sabotaged.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue of concern is the government's decision to cut off electricity supplies. In the northern part of the country water supplies are also cut off. Under pressure from the international community, including the Commission, electricity supplies were resumed, only to be cut off again. If the government continues to cut electricity this will lead to a humanitarian catastrophe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is considering preparing a new humanitarian aid decision to improve the situation, notably in the north of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community must react to the situation and to the violation of human rights. The Commission therefore welcomes the UN sanctions, the arms embargo, the travel ban and the freezing of assets, not only for those who block the full implementation of the Marcoussis and Accra III Agreements, but also for anyone else found to be responsible for serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission fully supports the African Union and President Mbeki's mediation efforts. On 15 November President Mbeki met President-designate Barroso in Brussels. The Commission shares the concerns expressed by President Mbeki about Côte d'Ivoire's future.</p>
<p class="contents">In August this year the Commission proposed to the Council that consultations be opened under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. At that time the Member States did not wish to proceed with the proposal. They did not want to jeopardise the Accra III Agreement, which was signed just a few days before.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent developments and the non-implementation of the Accra III Agreement demonstrate the importance of opening Article 96 consultations to put pressure on the Côte d'Ivoire authorities to resume talks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over recent months, though, the impression has unfortunately been that the voices calling for such initiatives are becoming rather more muted, in order to ensure that good trade relations are maintained with China. I am therefore delighted that this House has responded to the urgent need for joint measures, and made known its opposition to the imminent execution of the Buddhist lama Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, who was not given a fair trial, and whose execution is scheduled for early December, without there being any proof of his guilt.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore call on China, as a matter of urgency, to abandon its plans to carry out this execution, and to guarantee a fair trial in accordance with international legal standards. China must in any case put an end to its use of the death sentence in general – that is one of our key demands – and must also finally respect the religious freedom of the Tibetan people, a people which has used no violence in defending its rights and calling for these rights to be respected, thereby earning our deepest respect.</p>
<p class="contents">At the forthcoming EU-China Summit, the Commission must express its concern at the use of the death sentence, and press for an acceptable solution to the Tibet issue as a whole. There are international precedents for such a solution, and it is our duty to make repeated reference to these precedents in order to secure the peaceful coexistence of Tibet and China. If there is to be a good partnership between the European Union and China, then Tibet is a key to it, and the performance of this task is for us a duty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On 3 December 2002, Tenzin Delek Rinpoche was condemned to death after being convicted of trumped-up and politically-motivated charges in a court in Tibetan China. He was framed for a crime he did not commit, and this is backed up by independent research by Human Rights Watch. He remains in Chinese custody, waiting to die, and his current whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Tenzin Delek has always maintained his innocence. He is quoted as saying: 'I have been wrongly accused. I have always said that we should not so much as raise a hand against another.' Indeed, his moderate and peaceful way of dealing with the problems that the Tibetans face and with the repression in Tibet, his work as an active lama to foster Tibetan Buddhism, and his practical work in Tibetan communities have earned him many supporters. He is a symbol of Tibetan identity and a champion of the Tibetan cause. He is no friend of the Chinese authorities. The arrest, detention and sham trial of Tenzin Delek mark the culmination of a clampdown on his activities and on those of his associates who, even now, face severe penalties if they dare advocate on his behalf. The paradoxical silence that followed the death sentence on Tenzin Delek, who is such a popular figure, is attributed by Human Rights Watch to a campaign of intimidation and terror executed by the Chinese authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">International human rights organisations have also expressed acute concern that he was tortured while being detained – a likelihood rather than a suspicion. Human Rights Watch also reports that he was denied the most basic of rights under international law: the right to a fair hearing. The Chinese authorities, claiming that state secrets were involved, still refuse to disclose what actually happened in court. In short, his trial was a sham. Regrettably, the case of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche must be placed in the context of a catalogue of the human rights abuses perpetrated by the Chinese authorities against the Tibetan people both in the Tibet Autonomous Region and Tibetan China. The systematic repression of all things Tibetan just about sums up Chinese policy on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must send a clear message to China that this policy is unacceptable and it must do all it can to ensure the protection of human rights and the cultural, political, environmental and religious identity of the Tibetan people. The miscarriage of justice suffered by Tenzin Delek must be put right. I would therefore ask all Members to support this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is always at the expense of the freedom and the culture of the people already inhabiting that area, if the culture concerned is different from the dominant culture. Tibet, which, like its neighbours East Turkestan or Xinjiang, has, against the will of its people, for a long time been recognised internationally as part of China’s territory, is no exception. Chinese people from the densely populated central and eastern areas of the country have been colonising that country, and many newcomers have taken on the role of civil servant, policeman or soldier.</p>
<p class="contents">Opposition to this humiliating situation has been suppressed for many years with all, mainly violent, means. As is often the case in similar situations, it looks like the rulers in China do want the Tibetan territory but not the inhabitants.</p>
<p class="contents">I am no admirer of the traditional theocracy in the old pre-1951 Tibet, which temporarily managed, in practice, to defy the authority of a China that was for a long time ravaged by war. Even so, I find the present situation wholly unacceptable and it seems to me sensible that China should negotiate solutions with the Tibetans in exile in India, led by the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems are only growing if what the government terms as separatism is being punished with the death penalty or with a suspended death penalty. That also applies if prisoners are kept in isolation and tortured. A country that is into that kind of practice should certainly be prohibited from buying weapons from the EU Member States. Where relations with China are concerned, the main consideration for the Commission and Council should not be that this is a large country with a fast growing economy. Indeed, this is a country that refuses to release colonised peoples, puts economic growth above everything else and moreover, violates human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">If Europe makes it clear that we do not consider this Chinese policy acceptable as a matter of course, then that would be a contribution to the much-needed change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite the resolution we adopted unanimously, despite appeals from all over the world and demonstrations held in front of national parliaments, despite numerous vigils held by volunteers and despite strong protests voiced by diplomats, Lobsang Dhondup was executed in January 2003. His teacher, the highly-regarded lama Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, is facing the same fate in a matter of days, as his two-year reprieve will come to an end in two weeks’ time on 2 December. Rinpoche is still treated like a terrorist by the Chinese authorities, which continue to refuse him a proper trial and independent legal representation. His alleged confession to involvement in the bomb attacks was forced out of him, and his state of health is unknown after several reports of torture. The solitary confinement in which he is kept is a clear violation of the UN Convention against Torture.</p>
<p class="contents">I concur with the view held by the three previous speakers, namely that our remaining silent would be the worst thing that could happen to a culture and a people we value. The real reason why Rinpoche has been imprisoned is his enormous influence on the population and his support for the Dalai Lama, which certain Chinese hardliners found intolerable.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I call on the European institutions to bring more pressure to bear on the Chinese authorities. I should like to remind Mr Figel’’ that this case must be raised at the EU-China Summit on 8 December, by which time it will hopefully not be too late. I should also like to remind the Council that this House has repeatedly made joint calls for a special representative for Tibet, who would be able to make a productive contribution to the finding of a peaceful solution. In 2008, the People’s Republic of China will host the Olympic Games, and the country is a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Yet how is China to gain trust or approval if it does not observe human rights or respect minorities?</p>
<p class="contents">We have had some experience of this in this House since Monday. People have joined in creating a mandala; people have been meditating. The monks who led them in these activities took the opportunity to tell us about their culture in Tibet, and what it would mean if it were to be destroyed, if it were no longer possible to speak in one’s native tongue in one’s homeland, and if visible manifestations of culture and religion were to be forbidden – this would be the worst thing that could happen. I was delighted that many Members of this House, including the previous speakers, as well as assistants, journalists and many visitors, were present at the creation of this mandala, which has just been completed.</p>
<p class="contents">We greatly welcome the fact that China has made some progress, such as initiating dialogue with representatives of the Dalai Lama and releasing, after decades of martyrdom in various prisons, the nun Ngawang Sangdrol, whom we were delighted to welcome to the European Parliament, having, indeed, played a part in her release. Yet is this to be the end of such a reasonable approach? Is it appropriate, in such a context, for sentences to be passed which have no kind of legal basis? Ladies and gentlemen, let us use all our power and influence to ensure that the death sentence against Tenzin Delek Rinpoche is not carried out, and that he is given a fair trial in the presence of independent observers. The Chinese authorities must no longer resist the voice of common sense.</p>

The Tibetan people live in unique circumstances imposed by nature and have always been somewhat isolated from the surrounding world. They have developed a unique culture and a unique approach to international affairs. Yet for several decades, the Tibetan people have been subjected to fierce persecution by China, an imperialist and Communist country that took advantage of the fact that Tibet has never aspired to any kind of special international standing. Given the unique circumstances imposed by nature I mentioned earlier, Tibet has never seen any reason to send ambassadors to other countries or to aspire to any kind of international standing. In consequence of this, China declared it to be a state and a nation without sovereignty and without any right to sovereignty. The Tibetan nation and state did indeed have a right to sovereignty, but not in the sense in which this is generally understood in Europe. We are in the habit of recognising states if they have their own ambassadors and diplomatic representations and take part in international conferences.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot condone the unlawful actions of the Chinese authorities, as a result of which this peaceful nation has become a victim of Chinese imperialism. What we are now witnessing is the infliction of violence on this peaceful nation, a violence that is escalating and causing the mass exodus of Tibetans to Europe and to other countries round the world. We cannot condone the wholesale persecution of a peaceful society and the destruction of this society’s culture, language and religion. Nowadays, the world today is prepared to turn a blind eye to a great many wicked acts, provided these acts are committed by those who provide economic contracts and who offer the chance of some kind of material benefit. The House should not accept moral principles of this kind, principles held by people who would agree to a nation being eradicated from the international arena provided they gained some small material benefit. It might not even be that small a benefit; it might actually be quite considerable. We have tabled a joint motion for a resolution intended as an appeal to all the EU governments and those who will participate in the EU-China summit to ensure that China puts a stop to such persecution.

<p class="contents">One of the many – too many – ugly stories of common, ordinary, everyday violation of human rights. However, this was not how this story went. Tenzin Delek Rinpoche is an emblem: he is an important lama of Lithang county in Kardze, arrested in 2002 just after an attack in Chengdu. The procedures during the trial were clearly far from complying with international standards and the suspension of the death sentence is due to expire in two weeks’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">Tenzin is a Buddhist monk who is very popular among Tibetans for his unshakable loyalty to the Dalai Lama, which he has openly professed on many occasions, and for always having refused to recognise the Panchen Lama chosen by Beijing in 1995. He is therefore a symbol that China wishes to eliminate and destroy.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe should, especially within the framework of the forthcoming bilateral summit, forcefully demand that the death sentence imposed on Tenzin be lifted and, in more general terms, call for a moratorium on executions. Let us raise our voices, Commissioner Figel’, to prevent the umpteenth bloody, unjust, gory insult to Tibet and the Tibetans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Respect for human rights in Tibet is a strong concern of the European Union and, as Mrs Lichtenberger said, 'a key item' on the agenda of the EU-China human rights dialogue. I fully share the view of Mr Mann that freedom of conscience is first among political freedoms. The European Union has on several occasions expressed concerns about individual cases in Tibet. The EU Troika raised the situation of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche in Beijing in September in the last round of the EU-China human rights dialogue and also in an ad hoc approach to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday this week, asking for information about his whereabouts and state of health. The Union expressed the hope that the death sentence imposed on him will not be upheld and called for a judicial review of the case.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is fully committed to following this issue very closely. The execution of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche would send a very negative signal, clearly damaging the credit recently gained by the Chinese government through recent gestures such as the visit of special envoys of the Dalai Lama to Tibet, which were warmly welcomed by the international community. It would also be a very bad sign for EU-China relations, at a time when we are preparing for our annual summit.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, as part of its overall policy on Tibet, the European Union has called for many years and will continue to call for the establishment of a direct dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities, as the only realistic way to find a lasting solution to the question of Tibet.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider the recent third visit of the Dalai Lama special envoys to China to be an encouraging sign of progress. In its dialogue with China, the European Union has already regularly expressed concern about the extensive use of the death penalty, referring to its long-standing position in favour of abolition. It has continued to press hard for at least the introduction of a moratorium. In the fight against terrorism, it has also stressed that this fight can only be successful if it is firmly rooted in respect for fundamental principles governing international relations, particularly as regards safeguarding human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is not only international protest which is now needed in Eritrea, but dialogue with civil society within the country itself, as the only way in which a peaceful coexistence can and will be re-established in the country is by sitting all the participants down at one table and endeavouring to reopen the channels of dialogue.</p>

<p class="contents">Looking at the motion, one finds that my country, Malta, and Libya find their place in the resolution. It was a great misfortune that some time ago a substantial number of Eritreans were forcibly repatriated to Eritrea. It was unfortunate because they did not have enough documentation that would have allowed them to apply for refugee status. They did not want to do this as at the time Malta was not part of the European Union and their original intention was to go to Italy. Although technically Malta was right, it was certainly not morally right.</p>
<p class="contents">We now know that the fate of those Eritreans, through reports from one or two survivors who have managed to escape their country again, has been terrible. Many were incommunicado, many were tortured. An eye-witness has even said that a number have died or been murdered. I believe that, when faced with such a situation, the European Union has to take a different attitude to such a country. There should be no further dialogue because dialogue is not understood. Dialogue has broken down. We have to assert ourselves in a way whereby the Eritreans come to see the need for the European Union. Financial help and all forms of assistance may be withdrawn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We frequently talk of universal human rights, but I am not sure that our European understanding of such rights can always be applied in all countries throughout the world and in all cultural contexts. In spite of this, however, it must be said that for a number of years now we have witnessed attempts by some of the most reactionary regimes to use their support to promote the development of hotbeds of obscurantism and militant Islam in certain areas of the world, as well as to bring about a military solution to border disputes, for example in the case of Eritrea and Ethiopia.</p>
<p class="contents">Although attempts were made in the past to establish democratic principles and peaceful cooperation with its neighbours, the situation in Eritrea has now become a great deal more complex, and there is a gradual deterioration in the majority of fields monitored by international organisations. Poor infrastructure, low levels of literacy among the population, a slow rate of economic growth and religious obscurantism are culminating in moves to draft more young people into the armed forces, with the response to such moves being attempts to leave the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever standards of human rights we apply, such a state of affairs cannot be passed over in silence. We must not stand idly by while members of the Eritrean parliament and foreign journalists are held in prison without any kind of formal charge, while freedoms laid down in Eritrea’s Constitution are violated, and while the fundamental requirements of international human rights conventions are contravened. We must take action in accordance with Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, as already referred to by Commissioner Figel’. The motion for a resolution which has been tabled is a first step on the path towards change, as well as an attempt to help find a resolution to what appears to be a dead-end situation in one of the world’s poorest countries.

One should rather say the dramatic situation which we are also faced with in Eritrea, as we face drastic developments of this kind in many African countries. In his speech yesterday to this House, President Mbeki gave a long list of African trouble spots, a list which it would have been impossible to give in full, although I do believe that the omission of Zimbabwe was not – unfortunately – a coincidence.</p>

<p class="contents">Today, then, sees our debate on Côte d’Ivoire being followed by one on Eritrea, a country which has not been independent for all that long and which has already been involved in a bloody border dispute with its larger neighbour, Ethiopia. The country’s interior is equally divided, and the 1997 Constitution, under which civil rights, including religious freedom, are guaranteed, is not worth the paper on which it is written. Eleven former members of parliament, the ‘Asmara 11’, have been imprisoned since September 2001 without any charges against them. The African Human Rights Commission called for their release in March 2004, and it is a positive development to hear such calls coming from Africa itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Journalists have been arrested, and, as has already been said, the country occupies the unenviable position of fifth to last in the world press freedom ranking. We are calling for respect for human rights, including those of all prisoners, and in particular those of the juveniles arrested on 4 November, who must also be allowed contact with lawyers and relatives.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, we are calling on the Council and the Commission to initiate the consultation procedure provided for under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, with the aim of preventing a regime of this kind from profiting from the privileges granted under this Agreement.</p>

That was the Dutch Government’s response on 6 May of this year to broadly-based parliamentary questions on religious freedom in Eritrea. The draft resolution does not do justice to this important communication by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, and I very much regret that. Let us remind ourselves of the key facts.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, general freedom of religion is enshrined in the Eritrean constitution. Secondly, a government decree of May 2002, however, prescribes the registration of all religious groups. Thirdly, this registration does not apply, though, to four of those religious groups, namely the Orthodox Christians, Muslims, Catholics and members of the Evangelical Church of Eritrea. Fourthly, many small Protestant churches were for years refused registration, their prayer houses being officially closed. Fifthly, according to a recent report of the US Administration, probably more than 200 members of non-registered groups are currently being detained. Sixthly, the Eritrean police is forcing members of non-registered churches to sign statements in which they renounce their religious convictions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, there is no shred of religious freedom in Eritrea. That is why I hope that the European Union will continue to pull out all the stops, preferably in tandem with the US Administration, which has given evidence of equal involvement in the case of serious violations of religious freedom in Eritrea. Indeed, this is an excellent opportunity to give shape to trans-Atlantic cooperation in a bid to uphold western values, which is desperately needed in the European Union of 2004. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It then, foolishly, rapidly went on to fight another conflict, first with Yemen over fishing grounds around the Hanish Islands, and then in 1998, with Ethiopia again over disputed border territory. The latter dispute was only resolved in June 2000 after the loss of some 70 000 lives.</p>
<p class="contents">To date, Ethiopia refuses to accept the award of the village of Badme to Eritrea by the International Border Commission, and there is a 4 200-strong UN peace mission at the border, although their work is made difficult by Ethiopia's failure to permit demarcation and Eritrea's restrictions on UN actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Eritrea is a very poor country and alone in Africa – the other exception being the Democratic Republic of Congo – in postponing indefinitely the elections promised by President Afeworki's so-called transitional government under the 1997 Constitution and originally scheduled for December 2001. With this has come press censorship and imprisonment of journalists, including recently a Swedish citizen. The ruling People's Front for Democracy – a bit of a misnomer, I must say – remains the only legal party. However, a new party formed by exiles is the People's Liberation Front Democratic Party and this was established in 2002.</p>

The Commission shares your views and is greatly concerned at the Eritrean Government's tightening of its grip in the area of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The government is introducing restrictions on freedom of expression and the right to information, association and movement. Some of these points have been elaborated by Mrs Lichtenberger and Mr Kohlíček. The Commission regrets that there are no indications that democratic reforms will be introduced in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="contents">The restriction of religious freedom is part of the overall trend of severely restricting civil and political rights in Eritrea. The Commission is aware of recent reports from different international partners to the effect that the Eritrean government has violated human and religious rights and is restricting freedom of worship for some religious minorities. According to various sources of information, the government has harassed, arrested and detained members of non-approved religious groups, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, and adherents of the Baha'i faith.</p>
<p class="contents">On 4 November, the Commission witnessed events in Asmara during which Eritrean security forces indiscriminately arrested thousands of youths suspected of evading military conscription. These arrests took place in the streets, shops and offices, at roadblocks and in homes. Those arrested are being held in army prisons and are thought to be at serious risk of ill treatment. Reports say that some have been shot dead and that many more were wounded following a disturbance at one prison. Relatives and lawyers have no access to the prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">So what is being done? The Commission is endeavouring to address the problem through support for NGO projects in Eritrea in the areas of human and civil rights awareness, strengthening of civil society organisations and independent media. Eritrea is a focal country under the European initiative for democracy and human rights and is allocated EUR 1.6 million per year from this budget line. It has been difficult though to identify civil society and human rights projects because of the weak capacity of local civil society and the fragile political situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission considers that we are seeing a pattern of human rights violations and, in coordination with Member States, is closely following developments. The Commission is analysing the situation and will soon present proposals on the basis of Cotonou Agreement, as was called for by Mr Kohlíček, Mr Gahler and Mr Tannock. However, the Commission must emphasise that it has been very difficult to establish dialogue with the government of Eritrea. Now that it has been established, the Commission considers that it should be pursued with a view to seeking improvements in the internal situation and external relations. We wish to avoid threats and feel that confidence-building is more likely to contribute to an improvement of the human rights situation. The Commission will continue, as part of this dialogue, to address human rights violations, and in particular the case of the so-called Asmara-11 group and the continued detention of independent journalists.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, on regional relations, the European Union is anxious, as a witness to the Algiers agreement on the solution of the border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea, to maintain open, balanced and measured dialogue with both parties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
