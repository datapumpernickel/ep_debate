<p class="contents">It is a specific response to the numerous requests Parliament has been making, in the interests of greater monitoring and compliance with social legislation in the road transport sector, particularly in relation to rest, since tiredness can become a risk element at any given moment and, therefore, affect safety. This is the only angle from which, as Commissioner for Transport, I can take measures in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">The specific legislation set out in the report issued by Parliament at first reading in January 2003 of the legislative proposal on driving and rest periods are a good example of the concern and position of this Parliament on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has taken on many of the recommendations drawn up last year by Parliament, including that concerning the monitoring of provisions on working time, both on the road and at company premises. The proposal increases the percentage of checks, which rises from 1% to 3%, on the working days of professional drivers, introduces various measures to improve the quality of the checking activities in the Member States, and also establishes a common approach to the most serious offences.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aim of the proposal is to guarantee that all the inspection services of the Member States are able to apply the same sort of sanctions, including immobilisation, or the restriction, suspension or even withdrawal of the driving licence or the licence of the corresponding undertaking.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this proposal that has been tabled must contribute, without a doubt, to greater observance of the current rules and, therefore, to an improvement of safety on European roads, while promoting and continuing to support the reality of our internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I insist that there be no attempt to convert this proposal into a catalogue of the documents that need to be monitored, that excessive data collection tasks are not imposed on the inspectors, especially on those working on road checks because, quite simply, when we create a regulation that is difficult to apply, we are making a mistake: we must create a regulation that is, in addition to everything else, realistic and applicable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With the accession of the new Member States, this development will substantially increase. Mr Turmes is right; in the White Paper, the Commission found that compliance with the regulations on working conditions and rest and driving times in goods transport on roads is only patchy. In addition, the Commission, in its two-year report on the implementation of Regulation 3820, has recorded a constant increase in the number of infringements.</p>
<p class="contents">Ensuring strict application of the social regulations for road transport is not only a matter of social and competition policy, but is also of decisive significance for the safety of road transport. This is shown by the large number of accidents involving buses and lorries that are primarily attributable to failure to comply with these regulations. The purpose of the Commission proposal was to implement modernisation of the enforcement measures, qualitative improvements in reviewing and quantitative expansion of the control measures. Even in earlier debates, we agreed that a directive or regulation would make sense only if compliance with it could also be monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">Which now are the most important changes that the Commission and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism are making relative to the currently applicable regulations? On the positive side, I would like to point out that the proposed Directive is to apply not only to employed but also to independent drivers. In addition, through the Directive, a special monitoring of small companies in industrial areas is to be introduced. The scope of the control to be carried out in industrial areas has been substantially extended, for example to the weekly driving times, the total driving times during two successive weeks, the weekly rest times and offset times. This decisively increases both the social standard and the safety of transport. In its proposal, the Commission fails to allow for what Parliament contributed in the first reading on the implementation of the rest and driving times for professional lorry drivers. The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, however, agreed to include the proposals of Parliament at the first reading in the proposal made here, in particular the definition of the driver, the range of application of the Directive and the subject of the controls.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very well aware of the difficulties entailed by a delay in the introduction of the digital tachograph. Unfortunately, so far there are no binding undertakings from the industry to the effect that the devices will be available in sufficient numbers by the scheduled deadline. To that extent, I regard the solution of the committee as acceptable, which is to increase the control not, as originally proposed, to 3% but only to 2%, as was already found in my report on the revision of Regulation 3820, at any rate in connection with the option of a further increase of the controls on the introduction of the digital tachograph.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much regret that a small majority of the committee did not accept the reduction that I proposed in the threshold for classification as a serious breach. The fact my fellow MEPs agreed to reduce the permitted excess of the weekly maximum working time from 20% to 10% makes it all the harder for me to understand that in respect of excesses of the maximum driving times, the rest times and cases in which the minimum rest time is not provided they did not follow the percentage reduction. There is therefore a legitimate fear that, as a result, drivers and companies will regularly be tempted not to comply with the statutory standards. For this reason, we have once again submitted the relevant motions, and I earnestly ask you to give them a majority.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to highlight our good collaboration with the rapporteur for the Committee for Employment and Social Affairs, Mrs Schroedter, in the context of the enhanced cooperation procedure. I would also like to express warm thanks to the Commission staff involved and to the secretariat of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, especially Mr Hauck, for their highly effective and helpful support. I also extend thanks to the representatives of the various trade union organisations, employers’ associations, and police authorities responsible for monitoring compliance with the social regulations, for their valuable suggestions for the practical implementation of a directive of this kind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My name is Elisabeth Schroedter, and I am the rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, as already stated, in the context of the procedure of enhanced cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for this important dossier. I will take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for his constructive collaboration.</p>
<p class="contents">It is all the more disappointing that – as already mentioned – the Committee of the Regions has thrown out the Committee on Social Affairs’ main improvements, which had to do with the tolerance of excesses. The committee, that is to say, has proposed that excesses of up to 20% should be tolerated. What does that mean in concrete terms? It means quite specifically that the 56-hour driving times that are already permitted per week can be increased by a further 20%, in other words, that a further 11 hours can be added. In my opinion, this is physical irresponsibility with regard to the drivers, and, secondly, it puts every road user at enormous risk. So I think that this matter will really be improved only if we agree, here in the plenary, to reduce this tolerance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This directive replaces the one dating from 1988. It relates to the monitoring of social regulations. The adjustment was more than necessary because there has been, in the interim, considerable progress, not only at the level of the regulatory framework as such, but also in the context of the technical facilities for monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">We can all agree on one thing, namely that social measures essentially have the purpose of improving employment conditions, avoiding distortions of the market and improving safety, and that the directives that we have drafted for this purpose only make sense if they are implemented and monitored. In particular, those of us who live on the border between Belgium and Germany, where we see thousands and thousands of lorries passing each day, know that transport is a cross-border affair and calls for solutions at European level. Not only the drivers but also the companies expect that in the various countries they will be charged and monitored under the same rules of the game.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming a few days before enlargement, I see this Directive as having particular importance. It provides a partial answer to the question whether enlargement, which involves different working conditions in the various countries, will distort the market. Initiatives of this kind are intended, in particular, to avoid this. On the basic considerations, we all agree. I regard minor differences of opinion – which have indeed been mentioned – as matters of detail, because the Group of the European People’s Party is advocating realistic and viable controls. This relates to the working days – to which the rapporteur has just referred – and also to the distribution between road and works controls. These controls are intended to promote efficiency and should not lead to firms being charged too much. The figures that are to be monitored are of course the driving and rest times. With regard to working times, we know very well that, unfortunately, the interpretation is so different from one Member State to another that in some cases it is relatively hard to monitor this correctly in each country. The sanctions as such were also part of a debate as to what should be regarded as serious and what not. However, it is clear that exchange between countries must take place, that the auditors must apply the same type of monitoring and that their equipment must be compatible.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that I see this directive as raising the quite fundamental question of whether all these details, which we are discussing here, are necessary? Would these details be necessary if the Member States were actually to put into practice their conviction that directives only work if they are monitored? Almost all Member States take safety, improvement of working conditions and the removal of unfair competition as their watchwords. Why do not all Member States monitor in the same way and why do they not all give the monitoring authorities the same technical facilities that they need? If they were to do so, there would be no great need for details, and then part of this directive would perhaps also be superfluous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We all recognised in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism that the European Commission's proposal was generally positive, but that there was room for improvement. Our rapporteur handled the subject extremely well, demonstrating how close he is to transport workers. He knows and understands their problems which, in this case, relate directly to road safety and concern us all. The combination of this awareness and a sense of moderation mean that the proposed measures have been addressed realistically and without overreacting. In our opinion, the volume of controls required needs to stand in logical proportion to the volume of results anticipated.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee took precisely this approach to the proposed amendments. We also took account of the need for maximum possible harmonisation between social provisions in the field of road transport in the Member States, the opportunities offered by modern technology in connection with the subject of controls, the statistics available to us, the views already expressed by the European Parliament about better application of current social provisions and the views of the social partners. Of course, we must remember that we still expect the Council to submit a common position on the regulation harmonising social provisions in the field of road transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Congratulations once again to both the European Commission and Mrs de Palacio and our rapporteur Mr Markov. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposal has the important aim of improving road safety, and there must be an effective system of checks to act as a sufficient deterrent against failure to implement the legal provisions strictly. What is important is that there should be equal compliance with the provisions everywhere in the EU, in order that competition should not be distorted.</p>
<p class="contents">The checks, however, should not be made too onerous for the transport sector. It is also important here to take the position of drivers and consignors into account. Moreover, as the resources for monitoring are few it is most important to allocate them where most results can be achieved. That is why our group is not in favour of all the details that have been decided in Brussels concerning how the checks should be organised: it is better to leave the power of implementation to the authorities in the Member States. For example, we do not see any need to specify that at least 50% of checks should be on small enterprises in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be even greater differences among us with enlargement, and we have to allow for differences in circumstances. We are thus in favour of safety and efficiency, but at the same time of taking the position of transport companies and drivers into account when it comes to practical matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, we are in favour of implementation of the few rare measures of social legislation decided on by Parliament. Inadequate social legislation is better than the completely discretionary power of the road haulage employers.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact remains that the social legislation is inadequate, and scandalously so. It is content to fix the ceiling for driving time at 56 hours a week, with a maximum of 90 hours over two weeks. The fact that even a driving time of 56 hours is regarded as an improvement for a number of lorry drivers demonstrates the greed of employers in this sector, who not only exploit their employees disgracefully but who, moreover, expose everyone to risks. How can we be surprised at the frequency of road accidents after a week of more than 50 hours?</p>
<p class="contents">This shows that I am of course opposed to all the amendments directly inspired by the employers’ lobby, which are aimed at watering down the controls ensuring compliance with this already intolerable working time. I am speaking on behalf of the road haulage unions, which are demanding that working time should be fixed at 45 hours at European Union level. I should add that, over and above this claim, which is in fact modest, it is unacceptable that the concern is not to reduce the working time and efforts of the men, but only to ensure profitability, that is basically to ensure the profits of the road haulage employers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The same applies to adults. Something pushes them to the edge of what is allowed, and often a corrective measure is needed to keep them on the straight and narrow. In road transport, what one party gains by infringing the law can force another party to do the same in order to remain competitive. I am convinced that we can drive back these situations by effective controls on legislation, so that infringements do not pay.</p>
<p class="contents">In his report, Mr Markov has made sound proposals in order to tighten up these controls. However, it also contains less meaningful remarks, and some aspects are missing. The positive points concern the paragraphs about the equal interpretation and application of existing rules and striving towards the non-discrimination of drivers to be checked. The inclusion of the driver's licence in the controls is a useful addition. In our view, however, the remarks about what we refer to as 'serious' infringements in their current form overshoot the mark. Due to the restricted margin of error, everyday traffic situations can result in infringements on the part of both drivers and undertakings, while there is definitely no intention involved. Only repeated infringements should be regarded as serious. The fact that the working hours directive has been included in the scope of controls is another example of the report overshooting the mark. At the moment, national freedoms make it difficult to regulate clear enforcement, which leads to much ambiguity and frustration. It would be wise to agree on an equal interpretation of the provisions first before including them. One crucial failing, at present, is in the position of the inspectors. In not all Member States have they been given the powers that are needed to be able to perform their duties satisfactorily. That will need to change.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite these reservations, I should like to thank Mr Markov for the sound report. I hope Members will be willing to reconsider my observations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
