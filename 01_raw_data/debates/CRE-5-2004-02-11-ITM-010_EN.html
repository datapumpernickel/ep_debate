<p class="contents">We believe it is an essential element if we are to maintain sustainable development in the European Union, combine economic growth with quality of life, with competitiveness and with transport which is competitive and respectful of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to improve and clarify the way we use the possibilities we have, combining modes of transport, which will allow us to optimise the infrastructures we have at our disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about the intermodality sector, we need a more coherent and rigorous approach to the maintenance and control of units, because it is the units which are going to allow the container – the principle of the container, as we have seen, is the carrier for the future – to be transported by ship, by train or by lorry through our territory.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the need for a more coherent and rigorous approach to maintaining the control of the units with a view to increasing safety, the harmonisation of certain characteristics of swap bodies in order to improve the efficiency of transfer and of the maintenance and implementation of a European intermodal loading unit which combines the advantages of current sea containers and those swap bodies, that is to say, stacking capacity, resistance, together with an optimum size for European pallets in accordance with the provisions of European road transport legislation. I would insist that it must also be possible to transport them by road.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s intention is to create a more harmonised and efficient system of loading units for intermodal transport. Although rail transport will undoubtedly benefit from the proposal, one key objective is to give greater opportunities to inland waterways and short-sea shipping within the European intermodal market. Therefore, only by means of greater harmonisation of loading units can we achieve the performance necessary to slow down the rise in transport costs, of transfers, and make sea transport more competitive when it has to take over from road or rail.</p>
<p class="contents">In presenting this measure, the Commission has not proposed anything revolutionary – we are not trying to re-invent the wheel – we have faith in the approach, already proven and satisfactory, according to which we created the internal market: a Framework Directive which establishes the essential requirements and which leaves the technical details to the European standards bodies, which call on experts and also sector chiefs. It is they who know what the sector needs in order to achieve the political objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say once again that we have held a very useful and in-depth debate on the issue with the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and I would like to thank them for having dedicated the time and effort to this measure necessary to allow this first reading to already be an entirely mature decision.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Council, however, things are not going so quickly. I trust that the Council will carefully study the results of this first reading in Parliament and that it can agree a Common Position quickly and, if possible, a Common Position which supports the proposal which is going to be issued by this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stockmann (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commissioner is right: intermodal transport is competitive only to a limited extent, and the existing units – whether they are containers or swap bodies –cannot be easily used in all four modes of transport. The complicated and lengthy process of trans-shipment not only wastes a great deal of time; it also costs a great deal of money. By its very nature, intermodal transport is therefore at a disadvantage. Firstly, it is far more complex and therefore more complicated to organise, and secondly, there are very few actors who have a clear overview of the whole intermodal chain. That is why we must promote intermodal transport, and that is what we are doing with this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the directive is three-fold: firstly, to create a new loading unit, the<span class="italic"> </span>European intermodal loading unit; secondly, to establish specific intermodality requirements for all new loading units, and we hope that at least in the medium term, we will therefore be able to halve the trans-shipment time at terminals; and thirdly, to improve safety in line with<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>the International Convention for Safe Containers (CSC). Perhaps it was slightly misleading for the Commission to present the directive as part of the programme for the Promotion of Short Sea Shipping. Yes, of course it will benefit short sea shipping, but what we are talking about here is the entire transport chain and intermodal standardisation the like of which has not been seen before. As a rule, it is the individual modes of transport which are standardised, or standardisations are introduced for specific aspects of an individual mode of transport. This directive is therefore a first.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of standardisation, however, is not only to identify an ideal technical solution. Through standardisation, we will achieve planning and investment security, reduce barriers to market entry as well as product costs, and open up new markets. I am convinced that Europe needs the best possible intermodal loading unit combining the advantages of containers with the advantages of swap units. It would be a kind of European supercontainer, capable of being used on all modes of transport and trans-shipped easily. It would be stackable and lifted from its top corners; it would be suitable for use on ships, offer maximum space for transporting ISO palettes, and enable loading and unloading to take place quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission estimates that the number of road vehicles required to transport the same amount of goods would be reduced by 25% if the new supercontainer were used. I think that is slightly optimistic, but at least it points in the direction of change. Fears that the use of existing loading units would no longer be permissible are unjustified. The use of the new supercontainer is not made mandatory by the directive; instead, the market must regulate it. This means that different units will continue to be in circulation, but the European loading unit will become the market leader because of its stated benefits. I too believe that it will be a great success in the export market. China and Russia are two massive markets to be conquered, and the expected increase in the transportation of goods to Eastern Europe speaks for itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor does the directive affect the ISO norm. We have managed to assuage concerns about this issue through amendments to the Commission’s text. Cellular container ships, for example, are currently configured according to applicable ISO standards. We have stipulated that safe stowage inside and on deck of existing cellular container ships must be possible without adaptation of currently existing cell guides. We have also stipulated an external height of 2 900 mm, which corresponds to the height laid down by the European Organisation for Standardisation (CEN). We have thus created the best possible loading unit for road and rail.</p>
<p class="contents">It must, though, be the European standardisation bodies, in conjunction with industry, that have the task of developing the detail of the standardisation. We have simply set a framework for this process. We wanted, or want, to create a standardisation procedure based on a mandate, so that standardisation can proceed more quickly. Efforts to achieve this have been under way for a long time, but they have not been concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is merely the start of the process. Apart from the loading units, there are many other possible areas of intermodal transport where standardisation would be possible, for example at the interfaces between infrastructure and services, that is, terminals, trans-shipment facilities and, of course, information systems, liability and contractual regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">Standardisation will therefore continue. I am pleased that we have made a start here, sending out a clear signal in favour of intermodal transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Through his positive cooperation, he helped us understand the topic, which was not always an easy task, especially in a technical sense. He managed to immerse us in the subject without burying us. From our perspective, this was a very interesting experience of collaboration. The report, and indeed the Commission’s proposal, contained a number of challenges, and in my view, we dealt with these challenges very positively in committee. A new product must be attractive, in other words, it must be suitable for the market as well as being efficient and complying with modern requirements. I believe this outcome has been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">The product is designed to make the process quicker and easier while being suitable for new and existing lifting and stowage techniques. Existing systems will not simply be jettisoned overnight, as this would confront the people working in this sector with the need to undertake new or expensive investment overnight. Their security must be guaranteed. Very good solutions have been found to all these issues, in our view, and the Commission’s proposal and your committee report therefore have our support. Of course, it was the particular example of short sea shipping that was specified here, where intermodal transport already stands at 40%, but intermodal transport has not yet reached these figures in other modes of transport. In my view, the current initiative is designed to be an incentive for business and the transport sector to invest more in intermodal transport. I believe that we will persuade them to do so not only by offering subsidies, but by proposing efficient instruments, such as the all-round container, the supercontainer, as you call it, which allows for optimum loading while also taking account of what is happening on the international market and opening up new opportunities such as those you have described.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, we are very satisfied with your proposal. The only difference is that we still take the view that if the product is that good, the market will regulate it, so we do not need to invest any public money, although we are all convinced that it will be good for the overall development of the transport system if many actors become more multimodal. I would therefore like to make one final comment: I see our work today as a technical contribution to this concept, which we all endorse. However, if the loading units that we are proposing demonstrate their efficiency on water, in the air and on road and rail, then whatever form of transport is rolling along beneath them must demonstrate its efficiency as well. I say this to the railways in particular – we can improve the entire multimodal concept as much as we like in technical terms, but if one of the actors in the chain is weak or claims to be weak, the whole concept will be of no benefit whatsoever. So we see this as a positive step in the right direction, but it is also yet another clear wake-up call, especially to the railways, to adopt a multimodal way of thinking, to invest in this concept, and to review their structures and efficiency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At first there were various opinions on the matter and even misunderstandings, but the rapporteur managed, through a determined effort, to make headway on this issue and the committee in the end was very much of one mind on the development of the new European loading unit. The topic of discussion is the very challenging idea of making the various means of freight transportation in Europe compatible with one another. Standardised containers would bring benefits for congested Central Europe and, even more especially, to regions overseas. For example, 80% of the flow of foreign trade from my country, Finland, goes by sea, and the flexible operation of multimodal transport is absolutely crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has chosen the right way to proceed. The amendments are an attempt at ensuring there is compatibility with European standardisation offices and the prevention of problems with ISO standards. Operators in the sector will be given the responsibility for designing the new container in detail. There is a potential problem with Amendment No 17. If the height of the containers is to be 2.9 metres they will not, when stacked, fit the space currently available on present Roll-on Roll-off (RORO) ships. For that reason, the Commission’s proposal for the height of a container to be 2.67 metres would perhaps be better. Our group supports the proposal and we hope that the matter will also make speedy progress in practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In theory, these roles can be readily indicated, but practice has proved different, and so we have noticed that a number of modalities have been disadvantaged. One problem in this respect is the vast range of loading units, resulting in many cases from day-to-day practice. Some are used on a large scale, others to a lesser extent. All of this depends on the market situation. This latter is a dominant factor in the transport of goods. Changes are only meaningful when these are supported and encouraged by the market. This will only happen if actual benefits can be reaped.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the Commission proposal still contains a number of shortcomings. The introduction of a new loading unit is an excellent idea, provided it can actually be used in all modalities without any adjustments. It should be used in practice though. All commotion and comments with regard to this proposal seem to suggest otherwise. We are therefore delighted that the proposal is more market-oriented in the present report. The European Intermodal Loading unit (EILU) loading unit is no longer the panacea for all existing problems, but an option to be used in future, embedded in current operational activities.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another area that will require attention during tomorrow’s vote, namely Amendment No 16. If the measurements included in this amendment are laid down, this is, to all intents and purposes, an elimination of the draft. In order to retain the positive aspects of the EILU – more pallets in one unit – it appears useful to leave the specific measurements to the market too, thus enabling the companies that do want to use the unit to achieve this technically. All things considered, Mr Stockmann has done an excellent job. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The port authorities and shipping companies shot your proposal down in flames. In my view, we must also be grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Stockmann and the entire Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. Mr Grosch also worked very hard in the discussions with the industry, and as a result, we have largely assuaged the sector’s concerns. I think they were simply misunderstandings.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that, especially with the amendments proposed by the rapporteur – which we on the Committee on Transport jointly support – we can establish and ensure here today that we are not proposing a European type of standardised container – I prefer not to use the term ‘supercontainers’ – which could obstruct our global transportation business. In the export and import industries, we are reliant on the effective, efficient and swift transportation of these loading units on ships without adaptation of currently existing cell guides etc. In my view, as stipulated in our amendments in committee, we must leave the task of working out the detail to the standardisation committees. As a lawyer, I would be reluctant to embark on the task of developing the fine detail in my role as a Member of this House. It is, however, my belief that the principles we have set out in the proposed amendments will ensure that the new European loading unit does not conflict with existing international norms. This new loading unit is important, for it enables us to align the industry’s interests in greater stowability of palettes with the interest of the shipping companies and port authorities not to have to change all the loading gear and the entire structure of the container ships. In this respect, I think we can be quite happy with what we have achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the industry will adopt what we are hoping for, namely more widespread use of intermodal units. We are reliant on the industry here. We simply make proposals and will have to wait and see whether the new standardised container is accepted by the industry. The industry’s task is to protect its own interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out that this proposal contains not only a definition of this new loading unit, but also a requirement for more stringent controls and inspections of all loading units, regardless of type. If loading units are not properly maintained and repaired, they can pose a danger in goods transportation, in port during trans-shipment etc. We must ensure that serious accidents do not occur, especially in ports and on ships. In this respect, the Commission is right to propose more frequent and thorough inspections of all loading units. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the problems of increasing traffic on the roads are to be solved, the European Union has to be pro-active in promoting intermodality. Pro-active, above all, means that the authorities should use the market to deal with the questions raised, not that the authorities should saddle the market with difficult regulations and added costs. In this proposal, this line of approach has not been followed completely, and that is why, initially, I had my reservations about a number of sections of the Commission’s proposal and the rapporteur’s proposal. However, now that the proposals have been adapted by means of amendments in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, my greatest concerns have been lifted.</p>
<p class="contents">In their choice of loading units, the participants in the market have to be free to find the best possible solution for each type of goods and mode of transport. At the same time, we should at all costs avoid a situation in which owners of intermodal loading units are faced with unnecessary obligations and high administrative and implementing costs. I do not think it necessary to use tax benefits or subsidies upon purchase to support the introduction of the European intermodal loading unit. The Commission has itself stated in its proposal that it does not want to make its use compulsory, but wants to leave its commissioning to the market. The introduction of subsidies and tax benefits runs counter to this idea.</p>
<p class="contents">Technical specifications in which the characteristics of the intermodal loading units are described must be examined critically. Accordingly, it is important for the essential requirements that are prescribed not to contravene the international ISO standards. This on account of the fact that considerable use is made of units which are manufactured in accordance with international standards and which are also used outside of the Union. I am pleased that the rapporteur shares my concern in this matter, and that this is also being expressed in the text by means of an amendment. This also applies to adjusting the inspection period of the European intermodal loading units by equating them to those of the ISO container, which is frequently used in international traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of new intermodal loading units, though, does not yet guarantee intermodality. In addition to the current diversity, the poor quality of the rail services on offer constitutes an important barrier to the growth of intermodal transport. Internal shipping should also be included more in the discussion. As already stated, the improvement of transport requires quality legislation in which consideration is given to the scope of the market and which, by correct timing, can be introduced on time in an adequate and harmonised manner. That is, in fact, why I am of the opinion that the introduction of the digital tachograph should be shelved for one year so that legislation can meet the requirements to which I have referred, but lack of time has made it impossible to discuss this urgent matter with the Commission this week. This House still finds it difficult to actually get something done about it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to point out firstly that I completely agree with several Members who have said that this alone is not sufficient: much more is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">This initiative forms part of the strategy we have been developing over recent years, aimed at achieving more competitive, dynamic and operative transport, particularly in the rail sector; to update infrastructures so that we can genuinely put an end to the fragmentations and obstacles existing not just in the rail sector, but also – as we are doing now – amongst other modes of transport. This type of measure will enable us to promote intermodality.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur has said quite rightly, following this attempt at convergence by means of certain common standardisation measures, other measures will have to be adopted, such as, for example, those relating to dock terminals. The Commission is already working on this issue in order to ascertain how we can achieve standardised dock systems, which facilitate loading and unloading and the docking of ships and which reduce times and costs. All of this is also associated with our proposal – which, unfortunately, has not moved forward – on the liberalisation of port services, in relation to which we also have to provide impetus and greater dynamism.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all part of a whole. A single measure does not get us very far. We must make progress on all of them in order to achieve the best we can.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to the honourable Members that we accept the majority of the amendments. Some of them – Nos 2, 5, 14, 16 and 17 – must be reworded, because their current wording is perhaps not ideal. In any event, all of them are intended to clarify that the standardisation of intermodal loading units will not necessarily cause conflict with the existing global rules – in no way is that our intention. We believe that European standardisation bodies must not be, nor have any reason to be, slaves to the standards laid down by the International Standards Organisation, but that those bodies must decide which are the best possible standards for European intermodal transport, while taking due account, however, of the existing ISO standards and the needs of commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, this proposal ultimately depends on whether the market accepts it. What we are proposing are common standards which can facilitate – if the market considers it appropriate – operation within the intermodal network with these new bodies, which, as I said before, would prevent interruptions and would allow the quick transfer from river to sea, to rail or to road.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that we must reject Amendment No 6, since it states that harmonised rules will be developed by the European Standards Committee (CEN) and leaves out certain important standards bodies in this sector, such as the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (Cenelec) and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I trust that, following approval by Parliament, with the exclusion – I hope – of this Amendment No 6, we can make rapid progress in the Council and thereby launch a proposal for the sector which eases progress towards intermodality, which is absolutely essential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
