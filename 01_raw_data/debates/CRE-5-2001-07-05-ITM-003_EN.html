<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Carrilho (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue now under our consideration is one of the most tragic facing mankind at the beginning of this new century: the phenomenon of populations uprooted as a result of violent conflicts. The text of my report contains some figures that are by themselves striking enough. Nevertheless, recent estimates show that the situation is growing worse. In the last two years, more than five million people have been forced to leave their homes. According to current estimates, more than thirty million people are displaced, some as refugees seeking shelter in foreign countries, others forced to seek refuge in safer areas within their own countries. The continent that has been worst affected is Africa, but the situation in Asia has also deteriorated. We only need to look at Afghanistan and the refugee camps in Pakistan. Problems also remain in Timor, for example, although East Timor is making considerable progress in building on its independence and democracy. With regard to Latin America, the situation in Colombia has become practically intolerable. We could mention other tragic examples, but the essence of the problem speaks for itself.</p>
<p class="contents">What have we done in the face of this situation? Since 1984, the European Parliament has promoted the creation of a budget heading designed for refugees in Asia and Latin America. It was only in 1997, however, that this heading was given a legal basis. What are the substance and the grounds for such aid? We all know that there are budgetary headings for emergency aid, such as the ECHO programme and other forms of what we could call ‘horizontal’ aid. These aid packages only cover the first six months, however. They are an attempt to provide a period of basic survival.</p>
<p class="contents">The line of aid discussed in this report seeks to fill the gap that exists between emergency aid and development aid. In fact, in many cases, once populations have passed through the initial survival phase, they still lack the organisational ability needed to obtain development aid – sometimes also because their countries themselves lack the necessary political structures. There is broad consensus in Parliament on the importance of this aid line, and the proof of this is the 1996 adoption of the Howitt report. Nevertheless, the 1997 regulation expired in 1999. What did Parliament receive more than a year later? A proposal for a regulation that was very similar to the previous one. At the same time, and with regard to the past, it should also be noted that, due to the shortcomings of the Commission’s planning, the timescale for Parliament’s work was exceptionally tight. It is only now that we have finished, due to the cooperation of many NGOs, and those who have worked on the process on behalf of the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament not only strove to provide greater flexibility, clearer coordination and greater rigour in the assessment and implementation of aid but also fought to include greater coherence between cooperation and development policies in the regulation, bearing in mind the European Union’s political commitments. It is precisely in order to ensure coherence that we must make more appropriations available: we must increase them from EUR 36 million in 2001 to around EUR 55 million per year over the next three years. We cannot claim to consider this to be sufficient, but it is important to emphasise that this is a political message which is positive and meaningful at international level and which is also an incentive for the work of the NGOs and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to draw your attention to the urgent need within the European Union to address the refugee issue in a united way. Our strategic objectives must be to prevent further occurrences of this phenomenon. We must invest in conflict prevention and in establishing conditions that save local populations from the tragedy of major large-scale displacement. We must give priority to cooperation and development policy throughout the European Union’s external policy, not least as an important source of legitimacy for the common foreign and security policy. In raising the question of Africa as one of its priorities, the Belgian Presidency is working towards this goal and we are very pleased with this development. We therefore hope that we will have the support of the Commission and the Council, especially because this type of action gives more credibility to the common European project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As she said, this report is important because it aims to help uprooted people, in other words, refugees, displaced persons and returnees in Asia and Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, I would like to emphasise the need to approve this programme immediately so that we do not lose the appropriations for this year. Parliament has always been in favour of having a separate action for uprooted people on the basis of the unique circumstances facing them, as outlined by the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">I have some reservations about the function performed by the management committee. My opinion includes an amendment replacing the management committee with a consultative committee in order to enable the Commission to exercise more adequately its responsibility for implementing the budget. One of my main concerns is that the legal base for these actions expired at the end of December 2000. I do not know why the Commission left this new proposal so late, especially when we only had a one-year extension granted in 1999. I have yet to find an adequate response to that.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to improve the spending on this appropriation, it is not acceptable for the Commission to submit each and every project to a committee. It is important that the committee should concentrate more on annual work plans and look at ex-post evaluation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in these particular lines, the Commission has not included a reference amount in the legislation. This is wholly justifiable as the nature of the programme dictates that any attempt to anticipate future needs will prove futile.</p>
<p class="contents">I recommend we approve this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the main, the programme is a success. I should like to commend the rapporteur for having tackled all the most important problems and thank her for having adopted all my amendments. One of the greatest human catastrophes of our time is taking place in Afghanistan. I am therefore pleased to see that most resources go to uprooted people from that country. More than 50% of the aid at present goes to refugees from Afghanistan. There are between 500 000 and a million displaced persons in Afghanistan, almost 2.6 million of whom live in the neighbouring countries of Iran and Pakistan. These people are some of the most disadvantaged in the world, and that applies especially to the women. We are all familiar with the depressing pictures of veiled, ghost-like women who are shot if they show the slightest signs of rebellion.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, there is a need for increased supervision of programmes such as this. I have added that OLAF must have the opportunity of exercising supervision on the spot. I have also asked the Commission to answer the question of whether EU aid to, for example, Afghanistan has been chanelled through an illegal money network by the name of Havela. Havela is a closed, secretive and worldwide network which, within twenty-four hours, can transfer large amounts of money to anywhere in the world. The transfers take place without documentation and can therefore never be traced. The network is considered to be a dominant factor in global money laundering. To a certain degree, the end justifies the means when we are dealing with as serious and catastrophic a situation as that in Afghanistan, but the methods used must be open and above board, and I have therefore asked the Commission if it thinks it is in order for EU aid to be used to conceal money laundering and funds from drug smuggling and the trafficking in human beings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last year I was the rapporteur for this report when we extended the budget line for a few more months.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that the Commissioner is here this morning to reply to the debate because I want to talk to him about a big idea. Are we not in a rather curious position? On the one hand we have asylum-seekers coming to Europe and seeking help, shelter and aid and, on the other, we have displaced people living in camps in countries such as Afghanistan and right throughout the world. These are the same people and we need to make that connection: the people who come here are actually the same sort of people who are living in camps. If we can help them to be resettled, then we are not only helping them fundamentally but we are also helping to alleviate a problem that is growing in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">My big idea is nothing to do with this, however. It is about the Montevideo Convention. I would like to ask the Commissioner whether he could envisage a new approach? After the Helsinki and Harare meetings we now give aid to countries on the basis of human rights, good governance and so on. Yet there are 59 civil conflicts around the world creating uprooted people and many of these conflicts are about looting natural resources, greed and dictators wanting to run their show their own way.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet we all recognise each country as an equal sovereign nation. I find it very curious that on the one hand when we give aid, we treat people with a certain measure of circumspection, but when we recognise the national sovereignty of a country we apply the Montevideo Convention and say they are all sovereign. When the British ran the British Empire, particularly The Raj, they had a habit of giving gun salutes to different Maharajas and Rajas depending on how they behaved. It is time that we looked at how we recognise what we call national sovereignty and how we treat so-called independent nations. We need to differentiate between countries and presidents and governments that are democratic and behave in a civilised way and countries that are dictatorial or brutal. Then we can give different levels of ‘gun salutes’ to the latter countries so that we do not treat everybody in the same way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I did this report in the last parliament. But she has more than ably taken on and developed the work that I and Mr Deva have been involved in the past and I warmly thank and congratulate her on her work.</p>
<p class="contents">I have three points that I want to make. Firstly, it is important to say to the Commission that we in Parliament, having established this budget line, have adopted some important principles that we want to see adhered to in the way that it is implemented, strengthening our commitment to non-refoulement. There have been instances in the past where we could have been accused of complicity with forced return: it is absolutely illegal in international law and the Commission must be vigilant on that. We want to ensure that this budget line is used creatively, including not just visible support for camps, clean water and so on, but the less visible help that is so critical in refugee situations including psycho-social support and counselling, support on reproductive health issues and indeed, support for refugees with disabilities. I should like to associate myself with the points made by Mrs Gill on comitology where that is particularly damaging to the delivery of this budget line. I suspect Commissioner Patten will agree with that point.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to reiterate to Commissioner Patten that the fact that the Commission brought forward no money for Latin America in their preliminary budget is bizarre particularly when 2.1 million displaced people exist in Colombia. He is doing a lot of very good work in terms of emergency assistance there, but the safe and protected return of internally displaced people in that country is crucial and it is bizarre that they do not include that in their plans.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner Patten himself told us in Parliament when he brought forward the 12-month extension that it would not be late again; he listened to our views and yet the situation has arisen again. It is important that we be seen to ensure that the reform is on track, and that means these issues being dealt with much further in advance than we are now once again seeing. I guess he is a little embarrassed by having to come at this late stage once again here today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is what you might call a range of subjects. There are certainly sound reasons for having such a range, without my explaining in more detail what I mean. Until I heard Commissioner Liikanen commenting on recreational craft, I was quite convinced that it was these that would win the debate in the press. After hearing his contribution, however, I am, in spite of everything, a little less certain of that. He did in fact manage to talk the subject down.</p>
<p class="contents">In the previous debate on the G8 Summit, we of course discussed the usefulness of the global meetings. As Commissioner Patten strongly emphasised, these are important, but it is just as important that these meetings should be followed up, and the present debate might well be said to be an example of such follow-up. It is also an example of how – one might almost say – tediously practical the work of democracy also is and of how it is therefore difficult for democracy to compete with the more violent and spectacular global demonstrations. Nonetheless, this work is absolutely essential.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal no doubt also emphasises very clearly, however, that the only really effective method we have in this context is effective prevention, and I should like to have seen this emphasised a little more. The proposal also shows – and I think this is a good thing – the need to involve the NGOs in the work. Without them, success will elude us. I shall therefore just conclude by saying that – like the previous speaker, Mr Blak – I too think it is heart-breaking to see the developments in Afghanistan. I can clearly remember the first time I heard about them on the radio. Developments there increasingly cause one to despair, as does the fact that the international community has so few opportunities for intervening in time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not intend to go into detail at all but would just like to say that we are all waiting for the Commission’s overall proposal for Asia and Latin America to arrive soon – after the summer, if I have understood correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, I would like to criticise the Commission and the Council for having shown themselves to have been extremely ill-prepared for the legislative process, which has led to payment of the limited funds available for development aid being delayed for an extremely long time. Now, many aid organisations and non-governmental organisations are desperately waiting to receive money. This really is not the way it should be.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to remind the Commission that, at the Gothenburg summit, an undertaking was given to contribute to sustainable development on a global basis, for example, by ensuring that the UN targets for aid, amounting to 0.7 per cent of GNP, are achieved. I would like to ask the Commission whether there are any plans regarding how this is to happen, bearing in mind that Germany is now down to 0.25 per cent of GNP and that only Sweden, Denmark and Luxembourg have achieved the target or exceeded it. What plans are there for achieving this in practice? I think it is shameful that Germany is now down to around the same level as the US. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I should like to state my disappointment at the Council’s insistence on introducing a time limit and a tight one at that, for this regulation. The problem of refugees and uprooted populations is a structural and global problem, which will not be resolved by means of one-off and short-term measures. By being so unwilling to compromise on this issue, the Council is preventing us from developing a strategic approach, which, incidentally, was present in the Commission’s initial proposal.

In fact, I completely concur with the views he has outlined.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason why I have taken the floor is to draw your attention to a specific situation, namely that in Indonesia, and the Moluccas, to be more precise. I am also doing this because it appears from the reports that most of the Union’s funding for refugees and displaced persons in Indonesia has been allocated to Timor. Needless to say, I fully understand why that was done, given the recent tragedies there and the huge amount of work that still needs to be done there. Meanwhile, however, the situation on the Moluccas has become far more serious. More than 300 000 people have fled from island to island due to aggression, especially from Muslim fundamentalists of the Laskar Jihad and disloyal sections of the Indonesian army and police. On 20 May, another nine people were killed and seventeen wounded in Belakang Soya and Karan Pajang, and even after that incident, violence simply carried on.</p>
<p class="contents">People from the Christian communities are also fleeing because they are forced to convert to Islam. There have even been forced incidents of circumcision. Similar atrocities are taking place in Irian Jaya.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore ask the Commission to use the aid for Indonesia not only for Timor, but also for the displaced and refugees on the Moluccas and in Irian Jaya.</p>
<p class="contents">I should welcome a reaction from the Commission to this request. I should also like to highlight how important it is for the European Union to cooperate with the UNHCR and the NGOs. I could not agree more with Mrs Dybkjær, for they end up doing the practical work anyway. In this connection, I should like to know from the Commission whether the problems with the UNHCR have now been solved, that is to say whether the UNHCR is now obtaining more funding from the Commission. For while the number of refugees and displaced persons is increasing, the budget of the UNHCR is being cut back. That is, surely, not justifiable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With the criticism about a lack of coherence in European policy fresh in my memory, I consider Amendments Nos 3 and 4 to be of particular importance. Emergency aid also forms part of that development policy and must fit within the general objectives of the European Union’s development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Organisations involved in development activities in the grey area between emergency aid and development aid sometimes threaten to fall between two stools. I was faced with exactly that situation involving a Dutch development aid organisation. Furthermore, there are often distressing situations among the target groups of this aid.

Europe must do all it can to help displaced people, in this case in Latin America and Asia. We must help those who are forced to leave their places of origin for reasons of extreme poverty, wars, various situations of repression and force, and internal conflicts in which civil power crumbles and democracy as the normal way of coexisting is scorned.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must make a political effort at an international level to encourage countries to adopt a flexible interpretation of the Geneva Conventions and also to promote new instruments of international law to protect these internal refugees. In our capacity as donors, the European Union Member States and the European Union itself must not hesitate to use every possible means to ensure that the countries with which we cooperate guarantee the safety of their nationals and respect for their human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, taking on the responsibilities of the Union in the field that we are concerned with here must be matched by a consistent financial effort, which should already be reflected in the budgets for 2002. Alongside the immediate, urgent need for political and financial action to help the uprooted victims, however, we must not lose sight of the need to attack the very roots of the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Our medium and long-term efforts must be directed at the eradication of poverty and the consolidation of the rule of law and democracy everywhere, which can foster development and social justice.

I would like to comment on a couple of the points that were raised, though I am sure we will have opportunities on other occasions to follow up the speech on sovereignty that was made by Mr Deva. Mrs Schörling, asked what we were doing in order to oblige Member States to meet the UN target for development assistance. Had Mrs Schörling been able to be present for the debate we had earlier today on the G8, she would have heard how much I sympathise with the objective which she has, but it is an argument that one has to put to the governments of Members States and to their parliaments, which vote on this public spending of those governments. I sympathise, particularly against the background of declining aid flows in the 1990s.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Maij-Weggen knows that I share her concern about the situation in Indonesia, not least the situation in the Moluccas and some of the other islands and provinces and I assure Mrs Maij-Weggen that we will be allocating EUR 3 million to the Moluccas next year and for future years, if that is required.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, however, to begin the substantive part of my speech by congratulating Mrs Carrilho, for the quality of this report. I am very well aware of the difficult work conditions and the time pressure. The analysis, conclusions and amendments contained in her report are, in the Commission's judgment, of the highest quality and contribute to improving significantly the original Commission proposal. I say that without any qualification. We share all the concerns and the recommendations contained in the honourable Member's report. I would also like to thank the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control for their contributions to this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">On 21 June, the international community celebrated the 50th anniversary of the 1951 Geneva Convention on the status of refugees. Unfortunately, there was not much to celebrate. Today, there are more 22 million uprooted people in the world and that figure is increasing. Every day from Afghanistan- and I will certainly look into the points raised by Mr Blak – to Colombia, from the Balkans to the region of the Great Lakes, thousands of families are displaced by war, famine and poverty. We know that the international community is affected by donor fatigue. The UNHCR is struggling to find the resources to cope with these human tragedies and has recently downsized its operations. Again, in response to the honourable lady, we are involved in discussion not only with the UNHCR, but with other UN organisations to try to put our financial relationship with them on a more sensible footing.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a good time to state clearly that the European Community will continue to earmark financial and human resources to help uprooted people to go back to their homes, to start a new life and live in peace and security. Parliament has decided to send a political signal in this respect by proposing an increase in the financial resources available and we welcome this proposal. Since 1997, more than EUR 200 million have been committed to finance projects throughout Asia and Latin America in favour of uprooted people. Money has been used to help refugees to live a decent in camps, to return to their home country, or to resettle in a third one and to become self-sufficient. The budget line has financed projects to protect uprooted populations in the host countries on their way home and at their final destination. It has helped host communities to accept and integrate uprooted families. Most of all it has ensured the presence of the international community in the delicate transition from humanitarian aid to long-term development – a point raised by Mr Deva – by rebuilding homes and schools, ensuring access to drinking water and irrigation, improving health and education services, setting up credit facilities and restoring economic activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the evaluation carried out in 2000, though indicating a series of management weaknesses that the Commission has addressed with its reform of external aid, confirmed that the budget line is highly relevant and should be continued. Coming to the specific amendments proposed by Parliament, the Commission agrees with all the changes proposed. First, we appreciate the strengthening of the human rights of the regulation; second, the clarification of the role of the regulation in the continuum of relief, rehabilitation and development; third, the reinforcement of control monitoring and reporting functions and finally, the strengthening of peace- building and conflict management dimensions of the regulation along the lines of the recently adopted Commission communication on conflict prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the duration of the regulation, the Commission originally proposed that the regulation should be valid for an indefinite period of time to avoid periodic discussion on a question which seems, sadly, unlikely to go away or change in nature in a significant way. However, we consider that December 2004 is a very reasonable compromise, particularly in the light of our intention to revise the Asia and Latin America regulation, and will examine the possibility of incorporating the question of uprooted people into a single geographical instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we take note of the desire of the Parliament to earmark, for the operations to be financed under this regulations, financial resources beyond the amount already programmed. Once again, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the excellent job which she has done and I hope that as a result our programmes in this very important sector will be both generous and better focused and managed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The demonstrators used powerful public address systems, that is, loudspeakers. This unbearably noisy spectacle hampered both me and other members in the exercise of our mandate. Please ensure that, first, demonstrators have no cause to enter the grounds of Parliament, as happened yesterday and, secondly, that they are prohibited from using public address systems in the vicinity of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">So as to avoid any misunderstanding, may I point out that I am an advocate of the right to demonstrate and am delighted when groups of musicians visiting members entertain us in Parliament and the inner courtyard with their musical renditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
