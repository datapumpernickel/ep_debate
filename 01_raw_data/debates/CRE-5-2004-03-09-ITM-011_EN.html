<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Reding,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I promised that during the first half of 2004 I would outline the future prospects for the European programmes for which I am responsible. It is done. The Commission has just given the green light for the communication about these new programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The two communications adopted today affect all Europeans, from their schooling to their lives as citizens. That is important because Europe is not only about economics, finance and commerce. Europe has a soul. Europe is men and women in their cultural diversity, which is our Union’s true wealth. The new programmes are trying to listen to them; they are designed to respond to their aspirations and help them to create a genuine European citizenship. Questions of education and citizenship will in fact be among the major issues of the coming decade. In a Union which is expected to have nearly 500 million people in 2007, strengthening the sense of cultural belonging and of being a citizen of a community of extraordinary diversity will necessarily require mobilising all the tools and programmes at our disposal. The programmes concerned by the communications adopted today will therefore form part of a new overall logic: building bridges between cultures and individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, these programmes will be our future because their main thrust is to help young people to realise their European aspirations both in the field of education and in the vast field of citizenship. I know that these programmes come up to a lot of expectations. They have not been plucked out of thin air. There have been public consultations with thousands of professionals, with thousands of people involved in culture and education. We had the agreement and the express request of Parliament to go ahead. I can also tell you in all honesty that the timetable will be tight because we will need 2006 to put these programmes in place and ensure a smooth transition between today’s programmes and tomorrow’s.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to tell you that the Commission has taken advantage of this to propose a major simplification. That simplification does of course have its limits because the legal bases, the customers, if I may put it that way, and the interventions are different. We have, however, managed to reduce the number of legal bases from 13 to six and the number of budget lines from 26 to seven. A revision of the Financial Regulation is also planned in 2005 and I very much hope that, in the interests of greater transparency, greater efficiency and less bureaucracy, we shall succeed in particular in making these programmes easier for the citizens to use.</p>
<p class="contents">All these programmes are European programmes which emphasise European added value and were therefore created and conceived at European level. However, their implementation will be decentralised to national agencies closer to the citizens. Those agencies will be responsible for the practical implementation of the programmes because they will be directly familiar with the citizens concerned. I can tell you that there is a tremendous capacity for absorption in this respect because even today our budget execution is virtually 100%. The applications we are receiving for projects connected with education and culture in the broad sense are at least 50% more than we are able to grant. We really have capacity to fill because there is a very large public demand to be satisfied.</p>
<p class="contents">Why did I wait until today to present these new programmes to you? Quite simply because I had to wait for the financial perspectives in order to be able to move forward. As I believe President Prodi said in this Chamber, the Commission thinks that education and citizenship are very strong aspects of future European policy. That is why the financial perspectives have offered us a greatly expanded budget. However, even if that budget is four times greater than what we have today, it is still far from being enough, ladies and gentlemen, because at the moment our programmes still account for only 0.8% of the Community budget. Even if the expenditure in question is appreciably increased in the interests of citizenship and in those of the men and women of whom Europe consists, it will still be only a very tiny percentage of the Union’s overall budget, not to mention the fact that, as I can tell you very clearly, there is still a lot of political work, a lot of persuading, to be done if we are to have that tiny percentage.</p>
<p class="contents">I said there were two programmes. The first is about education and is called ‘The New Generation of Community Education and Training Programmes’; its common theme is life-long learning, which must start at a very early age, teaching children how to learn, and must continue until citizens leave working life. There will therefore be just one integrated programme, a programme whose aim will be to ensure that languages, new technologies and, very importantly, the dissemination of the results of our work, which are considered transversal elements, cover all aspects of education.</p>
<p class="contents">There will of course be different levels, as there are today: schooling, vocational education and training, higher education, adult education. European added value will be introduced at all these levels: mobility, of course, because it is up to us to stress mobility; partnerships between school classes, between organisations concerned with education; transnational projects, in which our educationalists will develop new programmes at the leading edge of progress. A few figures will illustrate what we propose. We want at least 10% of primary school pupils to benefit from real or virtual mobility projects: today’s figure is only 1.5% a year. We want a threefold increase in the number of Erasmus students: the present number is 120 000 students a year. We want the number of people benefiting from the Leonardo programme, which is concerned with vocational education and training, to rise from 45 000 a year today to at least 150 000. We want genuine mobility in adult education: the present figure is, I am almost ashamed to say, 2 000 people, and we would like to increase that to at least 50 000 people a year. I am speaking here of mobility within the European Union, because there is also, of course, the world outside the European Union. There are our new neighbours, whom we shall have to bring into our way of making Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, Mr President, we want to develop Tempus and make it into Tempus Plus, which will no longer concentrate solely on the university level, but will also provide aid tailored to the needs and capacities of each country, aid for all areas of education policy, including schooling and vocational education and training. Then there are our Jean Monnet Chairs. Today we have them in 50 countries. We think development at this level, too, is very important. Another aspect which will be of interest to the honourable Members who were speaking of finance only a few minutes ago, Mr President, is the integration of institutions like Bruges, Florence and Maastricht into our programmes so that the legal base is regulated once and for all. So much for the big new integrated Education programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there will be a second large integrated programme: ‘Making Citizenship Work’, which will combine several current programmes. These will continue as at present, under the umbrella of citizenship. It will cover three fields: youth, culture and media.</p>
<p class="contents">The first field is the Youth Programme. I know that some of you are more particularly interested in this programme, several aspects of which will be developed. The first aspect, the first strand, ‘Youth for Europe’, will combine mobility, participation and exchanges. Then the second major strand will be ‘European Voluntary Service’. By extending this service not only to individuals but also to groups, we would like to make voluntarism among youth a really strong and visible policy with the intention of extending it even beyond Europe. We want to make a kind of ‘Youth of the World’ programme, to contribute to the development of mutual understanding through an open-minded approach to the world and active engagement of young people. I am thinking of the countries of the enlarged Europe, of strengthening cooperation with the candidate countries, with the Balkan countries and the EFTA countries, and also with other third countries. Another aspect which must not be neglected is the action of socio-educational instructors and support systems for training youth workers, and support for political cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second field is culture. There will be three objectives with European added value here: professional mobility, the transnational circulation of works of art and intercultural dialogue. These will be the three common themes running through all our cultural actions. There will be no more rigid sectoral divisions like there are today, but rather the major emphases I have just described, with the three types of action we already know today: multiannual cooperation with private operators and businesses – an opening to the field of cultural businesses; innovative annual projects, no change there; and going back to the problems we have just solved, support for European cultural bodies. Here, too, ladies and gentlemen, there will be much simplification. There will be just one budget line instead of the five we have today.</p>
<p class="contents">The final field is the audiovisual sector. Here, too, there will be three major objectives: the preservation and enhancement of cultural diversity and heritage, the circulation of works inside and outside the Union, and strengthening the competitiveness of the industrial sector. You must understand that we are retaining the present scheme of things. Even today we say that investment in film production is a national, regional, private investment, or whatever you wish to call it, but not European. We are not changing that, but we are going to give the Member States the possibility of continuing that investment and continuing public aid for the cinema. To do so, we are going to intervene up and down stream. Upstream by acquiring competences. Our cinema schools must be networked. One might (why not?) imagine an Erasmus for cinema schools. That would be a very good thing. To have access to credits, it will be necessary to learn the specific work of filmmaking, including business plans. We do not want to educate oddballs, we want to educate people capable of making good films which, moreover, will sell.</p>
<p class="contents">Downstream there is the problem of distribution. You know that European films do not travel well, despite all our efforts. There is always the problem that people will go and see a national film in the country where it is made, but then the difficulties start when it crosses the border. We must therefore do all that we can to change the situation, not only to expand the market for films, but also for reasons of cultural diversity which I do not need to explain. We are going to strengthen the system of support and of selective automatic distribution and we are going to add support for dubbing and subtitling, support for multilingualism, so that it will not be too expensive for films to travel. I am thinking of new technologies in this connection, because 40% of the income from a film is already generated by DVDs. DVDs already have the potential to be multilingual. We will therefore have to work on that with a lot of commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the question of greater promotion, in Europe of course, but also outside Europe. I am thinking, for example, of packages of European films translated into different languages, that would be shown at a festival in New York or New Delhi, accompanied by the European stars to really make the most of it and for high visibility.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to prepare for the future, ladies and gentlemen, we are reserving a space for ‘pilot projects’, a space of flexibility, because there are bound to be big developments in new technologies. We must therefore be ready to accompany those developments as required.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, that in a few words is what has been decided today. It is of course a framework. It is a structure, but I think that structure shows that the Commission is taking very seriously Europe’s most precious asset, Europe’s greatest wealth: the citizens and their cultural diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I would like to know if the extension of the Tempus programme to Tempus Plus is a response to the question raised in Thessaloniki as to whether the educational programmes were being extended to the countries of the Balkans. I would see that as not going far enough; I would like to see the whole of the Socrates programme extended, rather than just having Tempus as a new one.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, does the reduction of the Budget line not have the result that we, in this House and in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport have even less of a say as regards who gets subsidies? What are the facts of the matter here?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, are the programmes’ titles being lost? Are the names ‘Erasmus’, ‘Socrates’, and ‘Comenius’ no more, or are they being retained somewhere? It is not clear to me from the text. Although I hope I will get an answer to this, I regret that I will not be here to hear it, as I have to go to a briefing before another meeting.

It is good to see the new programme already up and running, and I would like to put three short questions to you. Since you want to increase and extend everything – Leonardo, for example, from 45 000 participants to 150 000, 10% primary schoolchildren rather than 1.5%, a leap from 2 000 to 50 000 in adult education, and more of the same besides – how much can we expect in the Budget? We used to get 0.8%; if we want improved performance and higher quality, that will have to be paid for somehow. Also, in what sort of stages is this objective to be achieved? How is it proposed to achieve it by 2012 or 2010, and who will then bear the additional expenditure if – as I am given to understand – many countries are no longer prepared to contribute more than 1% to the European budget? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, in this period of gloom after the intergovernmental conference, this House does not often shake with enthusiasm. You have given us the opportunity to do so, which is a pleasure to hear. I have many questions, but I will put four of them to you. Three of them are concerned with what you have just said and one strays slightly from an issue that you dealt with, but it concerns our problems.</p>
<p class="contents">My first question is this: could you be a little more explicit about what you just quickly touched upon as regards quadrupling the budget? Over what period? On what basis? Is this about the whole budget for culture, youth and the media? What news! We are starting with such a small amount. All the same, we would like to know a little more.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question concerns languages. We know each other well, Commissioner Reding, and I admire the enthusiasm and the spirit with which you defend language initiation programmes and take on the defence of minority languages. In this context, it is the Council that is delaying. Will the Commissioner, in support of the programmes that she has just described, be prepared to go back to the idea that the Council must manage to put pressure on the Member States to make it compulsory to teach at least two modern languages? Furthermore, according to linguists, it would be preferable for one of these two languages to be outside of the linguistic family of the mother tongue. In this way, Europe would become multilingual and not dependent on our jargon that is similar to English.</p>
<p class="contents">My third question concerns the cinema. It was a pleasure to listen to you on this point, Commissioner Reding. On the issue of promoting cultural diversity and defending it in the area of cinema, however, you did not mention this unsuccessful text that was – it seems to me – drawn up by the Internal Market Directorate General. In the name of protecting competition, it claimed to harmonise, but in fact it is to remove or completely change all our structures for helping cinema and that worries us all. In our opinion, this reasoning was stupid, but we would like to hear it from your own lips.</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth question is a point of application. It concerns what you said on the issue of European high culture. You spoke about Bruges and Florence. I have just learnt that in Florence, following an international agreement fixing the budget of this institution, the notification sent to it was cut back by the Commission Secretary General by 20% compared with the sum agreed on and adopted by this Parliament, which is sovereign in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that we, working together with the Commission, will be able to budget for them. I would remind you that Erasmus aimed to include 10% of students in the programme. Let us hope that we succeed in doing that.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the new programme. Our agenda simply describes this as a debate on the education and cultural programmes. My fear is that young people will end up footing the bill if their concerns are thrown into a single package along with everything else. We, I think, must ensure – and you, in your proposal, must specify – that the youth programmes must be properly funded, that the informal system of education will continue to be valued as it needs to be in the future, and will be able to be extended in order to prepare people for active citizenship. If all these things – youth, culture, audiovisuals, media, and films – end up in a single package, my fear is that young people will end up paying the bill and losing out.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> There seems to be a fear that the various elements in the Socrates programme will be done away with. I can tell Mrs Pack that the precise opposite is the case: the fact is that we will be extending the Tempus Plus programme to all types of schooling, that is to say, to schools, vocational training, adult education and universities. She asked whether the names are being abandoned, to which the answer is both in the affirmative and the negative. We now have an overall designation for the educational programmes, so that Socrates is no more, but Comenius, Erasmus, Leonardo and Grundtvig will remain for schools, universities, vocational training and adult education respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Prets asked me about the position as regards the Budget. It is simple: when there is nothing left to be shared out, we will get nothing. The Commission takes a different view; what it would like is for something to be left to be shared out, and that is why it has no sympathy with those countries that want to pay just 1%. We need more if we are to be able to invest in the <span class="italic">citoyenneté</span>, in the citizens, in our young people, and the fact that the Commission’s budget for the future is an enlarged one means that it has made more funds available for education and for citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">I have quite deliberately sought not to get involved in this debate, believing as I do that it is very important – including in political terms – to clarify what we want for Europe, where we want to take it, and what we need in order to achieve that end. Only when we have done that should we look to see how much money we need in order to make that a reality. Tackling this from the other end is the wrong way to go about it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> I wanted to say to Mr Rocard that quadrupling the budget is in line with the Financial Perspective that the Commission has presented. You will, therefore, experience a lot more pleasure, Mr Rocard, in negotiating and battling with the Council, which will surely want to grant less than the Commission proposes. It will then be necessary to clarify the area where reductions will be made. Do we want 120 000 or 360 000 Erasmus students every year? We need to be very clear. If we do not give ourselves the money to finance the 360 000 Erasmus students or the 10% of schools that could benefit from an education mobility programme, then we cannot do it. That is clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Languages, Mr President, are included, as a common theme, in all our education programmes as well as in our programmes for citizenship. Clearly, Europe cannot be built without linguistic diversity. Despite everything, I am pleased to mention the modest progress achieved in our Member States and I will never fail to take the opportunity to speak to them to persuade them to forge ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards cinema and aid for it, I thought that I said, Mr President, that we have to be logical. If, in the name of the European Union, we do not want to invest in the production of films, then we must give Member States the possibility of doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">You will have to wait until next week, Mr Rocard, when, in your capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, you will hear an answer that will satisfy you and I am sure not just you, but all European film-makers and all those who love the cinema. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
