Allow me also – although this is not customary – to thank the Commission, and especially Commissioner Šemeta, because despite the initial reluctance to introduce an EU financial transaction tax, the Commission modified its position, endorsed the main points of Parliament’s arguments adopted in various resolutions in the past, and finally responded to our call and presented a legislative proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider it a very fortunate coincidence that we are having this debate in plenary today, on the same day as the informal European Council summit, whose agenda is exclusively dedicated to growth and job creation, because I believe that the financial transaction tax is an integral part of Europe’s strategy to exit the crisis. This is because it can raise significant revenues which can be used for stimulating growth, job creation and smart fiscal consolidation, as well as public goods such as development goals and tackling climate change. This will bring a fairer and more balanced distribution of the cost of the crisis, which is today being borne by labour and the productive economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you that we are all in favour of a global financial transaction tax, since the broader the jurisdiction the more effective the tax. Our challenge is how to reach a global agreement, and since Europe has the largest financial market in the world, it is up to us to make the first step and open the way. That is why we are in favour of an EU-wide financial transaction tax.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that the unanimity rule makes it exceedingly difficult for us to advance on such issues. We have taken huge steps on enhanced economic and budgetary rules and compliance, which contrasts with a lack of progress on tax coordination. A minimum of tax coordination in the context of this enhanced budgetary and economic surveillance is certainly a must. It is an integral part of the new architecture which we are designing. We cannot be held hostage by a handful of Member States, and that is why we can support, as a first step, enhanced cooperation among a certain number of Member States – once we have exhausted our efforts to achieve an EU27 agreement, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">On the technical aspects of the proposal, the success of the financial transaction tax depends on its design, which should leave no scope for tax avoidance. The report seeks to strengthen the design of the directive and make sure that the framework will be watertight and tax evasion minimised. We have introduced two new elements: the issuance principle, which complements the residence principle, and the ownership principle, which ensures effective enforcement of the law.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a financial transaction tax which can safely be introduced at EU level, or by certain Member States, without significant risk of relocation. Let us keep in mind that the cost of relocation will be much higher than the cost of compliance, due also to the very low rates.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me underline that the clear precondition for an effective financial transaction tax is its wide scope, covering all transactions without exemptions. Exempting institutions from the scope of the tax could pose systemic risks and encourage risky strategies. Exemption would open the door wide to tax avoidance.</p>
<p class="contents">Dear colleagues, I call on you to support by a large majority this tax, without exemptions, because it is one of the fairest and most effective tools we have to exit the crisis and ensure that it does not happen again, and also because I believe that it is now time to give substance to our claim that the financial sector should be at the service of the real economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Margrethe Vestager, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span>– Mr President, on behalf of the Danish Presidency I would like to thank Parliament for its continued interest in this important issue of taxation of the financial sector in the follow-up to the crisis. I am aware of Parliament’s keen and long-standing interest in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we will discuss a possible common solution for taxation of financial transactions at EU level. The subject was highlighted in a resolution adopted in March 2010 on ‘financial transaction taxes – making them work’, as well as in a subsequent resolution in February 2011, which looked at innovative financing at global and European level. There have been many other resolutions on the wider issues of the financial crisis that have addressed this subject, and today we are debating a report by Ms Podimata on the Commission proposal for a common system for taxing financial transactions within the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of this House will also be aware that the Council has been taking the issue of a financial transaction tax (FTT) very seriously. The Council fully agrees with Parliament on the need to ensure a fair contribution from the financial sector in the light of the huge costs and risks inflicted on Member States’ public finances by the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Before the Commission presented its proposal on an FTT, various options for further taxing of the financial sector were discussed extensively in the Council High Level Working Party on Taxation, as well as at ministerial level in the Economic and Financial Affairs (Ecofin) Council. Broadly speaking, the Council discussions have reflected different views from Member States as to which tax instrument should be given priority.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of last year, the Commission submitted to the Council a proposal for a directive on an FTT. The Polish Presidency announced a political discussion and a technical analysis of the proposal. This work was subsequently taken over by the Danish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the importance of the issue and the interest in it, the Danish Presidency has engaged in an intense programme of work. We have accommodated the wish expressed by some Member States for a speedy process. There have been extra meetings at a technical level, as well as political-level discussions both at the Ecofin Council in mid-March and at the informal Ecofin meeting in Denmark at the end of March. These discussions have enabled us to make progress, and I expect we will have the issue on the agenda at the June Ecofin meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency concluded the first technical examination of this matter in March and, at the time, identified a number of issues that will require further attention, some of which are also of concern to Parliament. Among these are the risks of reallocation of financial activity outside the EU, and tax avoidance issues, if the EU were to move forward with its own FTT. The design of the tax should, to the greatest possible extent, accommodate such concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Another question is whether such a tax should allow for possible exemptions – for pension funds, etc. That would naturally impact on its revenue potential and would lead to other competition-related challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the impact of the FTT on growth and jobs, on banks’, companies’ and households’ borrowing costs, and on the functioning of financial markets in general. Not all aspects and possible effects of the tax are sufficiently understood, nor is there agreement on answers to all the questions that could be raised. It is clear that there are challenges to be overcome if the FTT is to be made workable.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the comprehensive work that has been done and the good progress achieved to date, honourable Members will be well aware that not all Member States are able to support the Commission’s proposal. I note that adoption of the proposal requires unanimity. At the Ecofin Council, it has been decided that we should follow a two-track approach: while discussion on the basis of the Commission’s FTT proposal would continue, exploring room for possible compromise, we would look, at the same time and in the light of the Member States’ various points of view, at alternatives with regard to both the substantive and the procedural aspects of an FTT and with regard to other tax instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">This approach is designed to facilitate progress on the matter. One alternative, for instance, could be a financial activity tax applied by some Member States. Another could be a transaction tax that builds on some elements of stamp duty. While work along these lines must continue, there is also a wish among Member States in the Council to clarify matters and to reach a conclusion on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I am looking forward to hearing your views, which will provide useful input for the Danish Presidency as it seeks to take forward the work in the Council. The Presidency will submit a report on this issue for the June Ecofin Council. This will give ministers an opportunity to discuss a way forward and will provide guidance, as to future options, for the incoming Cypriot Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to use this opportunity to thank Parliament and the rapporteur for their constructive cooperation on the ongoing work in the EU to further this discussion and to strengthen financial regulation in the light of the crisis. One of the main priorities of the Danish Presidency is to strengthen financial regulation so that future crises can be avoided. I sense that this work is accorded high priority by all the European institutions, including Parliament, and all the parties involved. I thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is an extremely important file for me because I truly believe in all that an EU FTT has to offer. It will create a fairer tax system in which the financial sector makes a just contribution to public finances. It will act as a market-based instrument which incentivises steady financial activity and deters high-risk speculation and, of course, the FTT will deliver substantial new revenues without asking any more of the ordinary citizens. This money can be channelled into growth-promoting measures, used to support growth-friendly tax reforms, or help to finance global challenges. Used as an own resource as proposed by the Commission, this would result in a net decrease in Member States’ GMI contributions to the EU budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to address four main issues related to our debate.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the Commission welcomes the idea of exploring how to widen the net of our transactions. In this context, elements inspired by the issuance principle should certainly be discussed. We believe, however, that this approach should be limited to instruments with a clear link to EU territory.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission is not opposed to making the legal enforceability of a transaction conditional on the payment of the tax. However, the Commission does not see a reason to act at EU level. Member States should decide how to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Commission would not support the exemption of UCITS and pension funds. We have defined a broad-based approach for tax neutrality, to avoid distortions of competition and to encourage long-term ‘conservative’ investments. The impact of the tax on pension funds should not be overstated.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, although a step-by-step approach could be considered if necessary, I do not believe this should be modelled on the UK stamp duty. That tax has too limited a scope and leaves most transactions, and notably those of professional dealers, untaxed. With such an approach, we would not meet our policy objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I really appreciate the strong support for this proposal that we have seen from the European Parliament up to now. I hope that I can rely on your continued support in making this tax a reality in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Treaty does, after all, clearly state that the Union is to finance its budget from its own resources. Nonetheless, the majority of the budget is paid for by contributions from the national budgets, which are subject to all kinds of special arrangements in the form of rebates and rebates on the rebate. It is a complex, incomprehensible system that is in need of reform. The Committee on Budgets considers that a financial transaction tax could be a source of new own resources, since it would have broad geographical coverage and could generate significant revenues. Naturally, this would require all 27 Member States to be on board, and it is pretty clear that not all 27 countries want to be. Personally, I am opposed to this financial transaction tax, but I would like to thank the rapporteur for receiving the opinion of the Committee on Budgets constructively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, if we wish to avoid serious distortions in the internal market with regard to any type of financial transaction tax, it is essential that the land base for this tax is the EU, and nothing but the EU. Neither the euro area nor an alternative geographical arrangement would constitute an adequate base or have a suitable framework for it. Only the EU has an internal market. Only the EU has a budget. All other considerations relating to the budget and the correct functioning of the internal market can only be of worth if they are useful for the entire European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we clearly stated that it should logically be a tax that favours certain types of healthy financial transactions which are necessary for the economy, such as the fund industry, which we proposed should be less heavily taxed than derivatives or High Frequency Trade, and that other types should be penalised. Finally, we insisted that this should be an own resource, because we should not create the first truly European tax simply to bail out Member States’ budgets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, the rationale behind the financial transaction tax is worthy of great support. The FTT is needed for better transparency; to curb speculation and, in this way, to decrease systemic risk; to boost own resources and revenues; to encourage long-term investments; to cut down the pressure on other taxes; and to ensure a fair contribution from the financial sector.</p>
<p class="contents">For this, it needs to have a model which delivers the targets. So that means it covers broadly both all markets and all financial instruments. A uniform capital allowance-based stamp duty would leave out up to 70% of financial markets; that could not deliver the targets of the financial transaction tax which has been proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The report and the message we are adopting today send a clear signal to the Council. The financial transaction tax has broad support, not only in this House but also amongst our citizens. Even though the negotiations are difficult, I would like to encourage the Council to take this message seriously and to shoulder its responsibility. It should try to find an approach enabling it to establish an all-inclusive, residence-based financial transaction tax for Europe. The model proposed by the Commission and advocated in this report is too good to be thrown away lightly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The non-transparency and frequency of these transactions, along with high pay and very high risk, not only characterise the world in which we live today, but also constitute fundamental reasons behind the crisis that we are currently experiencing. However, it is ordinary people who have been forced to take responsibility and to shoulder the burden for the crisis to a far greater extent that the sector that caused it.</p>
<p class="contents">This moment is therefore crucial. Given its importance, I personally would like to get to a situation in which this tax were brought in universally in all of the EU Member States and later extended to the rest of the world, with the active involvement of the Commission and the EU in general, under the G20. I would like it to cover all products, without exceptions. I would also like it to serve as a basis for the necessary strengthening of the EU’s own resources.</p>
<p class="contents">In the short term, it is necessary to accept compromises, but we should not lose sight of the direction that we need to follow. This can only be achieved if the objectives are clearly identified by Parliament and by the Commission, and if they receive strong backing from the Council. That is what Europeans are looking for us to deliver today, and I can only express my thanks for the role played not only by Ms Podimata, who was tireless in this process, but all of those who have succeeded in overcoming their differences to arrive at this common position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can therefore fully understand the idea behind taxing such transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial sector has, after all, caused considerable damage in recent years, and is not exactly without blame for the difficult situation that we currently find ourselves in, particularly in Europe. The speculative losses of JPMorgan Chase that recently came to light bear witness once again to the fact that the financial industry really has not yet learnt from past mistakes. It seems that the greed of some players has still not been assuaged.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has tabled a very creative proposal, and the residence principle that it has proposed has been supplemented by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with the issuance and the ownership principles. Together, these should actually ensure that the risk of financial transactions being shifted out of the EU to other regions of the world can be relatively well averted. Nonetheless, naturally, there are still issues outstanding.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike the Commissioner, I feel that we should, in fact, exempt pension funds, because I do not see why savers who are putting aside money for their old age should be penalised. Moreover, there are naturally a few questions regarding the practical implementation of how the tax is levied that have yet to be clarified, and last but not least, how the revenue is actually going to be used. What will go to the EU and what will go to the Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">In our approach to resolving this, there are two things that we should not lose sight of. Firstly, we must not weaken Europe. Secondly, we must ensure that we do not fragment Europe further. We have to achieve the exact opposite – not fragmentation, but as much progress as possible on the harmonisation of our taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">A global introduction of the tax is not feasible at present; we know that. Regrettably, we cannot introduce it EU-wide either. It appears that the British veto cannot be broken. The rapporteur’s suggestion that we proceed now by means of enhanced cooperation does not seem to me to be sufficient. If we were to push ahead with only nine or ten Member States, we would actually be contributing to further fragmentation in Europe. That is not what we want. That is why I feel that as a minimum, we must have all 17 euro area members plus a couple more on board.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have to look for alternatives that would enable all countries to participate. I feel that we could even take the UK’s stamp duty as a starting point, and then of course expand it and include not just shares, but also bonds, derivatives and professional dealers. If we content ourselves with the current proposal and the mechanism of enhanced cooperation, then I believe we will be going down the wrong route.</p>

The interesting development is that precisely through Parliament’s efforts, we have achieved a clear shift in the Council’s position and in the position of the Commission. Commissioner Šemeta, I am pleased that you have truly had a Damascene conversion on this. That is pleasing, and I fully endorse what you have said here.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the background that we must discuss is how we can implement this tax as generally and widely as possible on a broad tax base and as evenly as possible. That is precisely what we are wrestling with now. In other words, the issue is whether we will succeed in including as many taxpayers as possible, based on the proposed residence principle, so as to avoid competitive disadvantage. Parliament is therefore proposing that we supplement the Commission’s proposal by adding the principles of issuance and ownership. I would be pleased if you could examine this very carefully. In my opinion, and in that of many experts, this makes the tax stronger; it ensures that it can be levied more evenly.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we immediately start now to debate its scope of application. Firstly, currency transactions. We propose that currency transactions, which is where the whole debate on a Tobin tax began, be included. We do not find the legal concerns that have been asserted in that area to be very convincing, nor do various experts. We think it is right to include these currency transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the issue of high-frequency trading. In this case, we are proposing that transactions that are not completed are also included in the tax base, since in practice, the number of instructions that are not executed, not completed, is 15 times as high as the number completed. The tax would then also put a brake on high-frequency trading. I regret to say that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is currently proposing a general exemption in this area for the undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS). Exempting the large investment funds market would be a serious mistake. It would mean that banks would simply establish a UCITS and thereby be able to carry out their transactions without any tax liability. That would be doing ourselves a real disservice.</p>
<p class="contents">On the matter of pension funds, I regret to say that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is now also proposing that pension funds be exempted. That, too, is a mistake in our view, because studies show very clearly that the less frequently that pension funds trade, the more profitable they are for their investors in the end. The OECD has just presented such a study. Implementing this tax consistently will not penalise them.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would also like to address the Council. The Danish Presidency – a country with a high tax burden, including on the factor of labour – should have a particularly great interest in progress being made in the area of the taxation of capital yields. So far, you have achieved little in this respect. Please would you get moving on this, and instead of looking into alternatives, just go with Parliament’s proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are many fundamental reasons why we reject this matter, and I would now like to set out some of these.</p>
<p class="contents">First, European statesmen have long talked about boosting European competitiveness and kick-starting growth. Economic history provides no examples to show that tax increases of any kind may lead to the kick-starting of growth and greater competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point has been mentioned by some of you, and it was explicitly raised by Mr Engel of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and the time is now right to make a reply, in my opinion. The financial transaction tax (FTT) is seen as part of the long-term attempt to find new sources of funding at European level. For us, this is fundamentally unacceptable because we believe that the European budget is overweight and needs a drastic diet. We need to cut budget expenditure, not look for new sources.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, economists have now correctly concluded that the banks need more capital and liquidity. How can it then be logical to take money out of the sector? If the FTT is introduced, we can expect to lose a significant part of the financial sector to places where there is no FTT.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, imposing the FTT on transactions involving shares and derivatives will not help improve the stability of the financial sector, as the great majority of you believe. On the contrary, it will lead to greater volatility. The new tax will oblige traders to focus on other, less standard and as yet untaxed financial transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, if the FTT is approved, it will lead to slower growth in the European area and a lack of capital on the markets, which will restrict the investment that industry and the economy so badly need.</p>

It plays well politically, and we can hit those greedy bankers, whom we all hate in public while we shovel money into their pockets in private. However, I do not think it is quite going to work out that way. All taxes are passed on to customers at the end of the day – sorry everybody, but that is just how it works – so again it will be the little people who pick up the tab. It will be savers, it will be pensioners and it will be ordinary folk who pick up the tab for this tax, not the greedy fat-cat bankers that you are trying to get at.</p>
<p class="contents">It is interesting, when you look at the small print, to see they are saying that some of the money raised can perhaps go towards saving future failed banks. So we know – we concede, do we not? – that more banks are going to fail. We know this because we have the same ridiculous, fractional-reserve banking system, the same crooked, money-printing, criminal behaviour at the central banks, and so on and so forth. So nothing has changed. This is another strong signal to bankers and politicians to continue the theft.</p>
<p class="contents">But beware those who think that taxing London is a risk-free game – and we mean London don’t we? When it comes to financial services, other EU countries are Mickey Mouse. Financial services account for 14% of UK GDP, and the UK contributes GBP 50 million pounds a day to this crumbling institution. Do not kill the goose that lays your golden eggs!</p>
<p class="contents">Zurich, Geneva, New York and Hong Kong are licking their lips wondering what piece of glorious stupidity we will come up with next. An FTT is a special tax, so what next? A special tax on sunshine holidays in Spain; high fashion in Paris; luxury cars in Germany; mobile phones in Finland; and perhaps a justifiably special tax on dreadful flat-pack furniture from Sweden? It is coming to your street next! The greedy bureaucrats just want your money.</p>

Today, for the first time, we are discussing the financial transaction tax. If approved, it will be the first clear signal that speculators will not go completely unpunished for the crisis that we are currently experiencing. Parliament and the EU institutions should be responsible for people, not the financial markets. For decades, the financial markets’ lobbies have succeeded in ruling the world without any opposition or hindrance. It is obvious to us that, during 2008 and 2012, the crisis of the speculative financial markets was at the root of most of the problems we are experiencing. Yet these speculative financial markets have managed to achieve not just a complete failure to take action, but also a direct transfer from the public purse to those same speculative markets.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been fighting for this for many years, Mr President, but it was only when people across Europe started to say that enough is enough that we have finally seen some initiative on the part of the institutions that govern the EU. This is the very first sign of the answer that we have needed to give to the people. The citizens of Europe, who have paid for everything, do not deserve to be paid so little respect. This proposal is neither complete nor perfect, and it will not solve the whole problem of financial speculation, but it is an important signal. We have been ... or rather, the EU leaders have been apologising to the financial markets. They should apologise to the people who have been affected. To finish, Mr President, I would like to recall the words of a famous politician, who said that these markets that we are talking about govern us without ever having been elected.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely hope that governments will give a signal that they trust the people, and I sincerely hope that following the adoption of this directive and a positive vote from the Members, we can begin to talk about justice and solidarity in Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, let us pluck up our courage and make this project succeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The turnaround in mood to the point where a majority now realise the necessity of a financial transaction tax, particularly the Commission, is very much to be welcomed. Now it is a matter of winning the numbers game.</p>
<p class="contents">The arguments we have just heard put forward suggest that the revenues would amount to EUR 50 million, when in reality we are talking about potential revenue of EUR 60 billion. We now have to prevent what we consider to be propaganda from the United Kingdom from taking root among the people of continental Europe. It is not true that it will massively harm those who have put money into pension funds. One could argue, in particular, that the opposite is true if pension funds pursue long-term investment strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">The important thing, of course, is that the money does not just go into the EU budget, but rather that it actually benefits those who have unjustly suffered in the crisis; in other words, that it is actually invested in measures to promote growth. Studies already show that the allegedly negative effect of the loss of economic power can be turned around, that the financial transaction tax can even result in economic growth; so all these arguments that we are hearing, driven by the City of London, can be refuted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to simply reiterate the fact that Parliament has already made its position regarding this tax very clear through several resolutions and decisions. I think that the important thing today is effective implementation, because we are sustaining the report with a whole series of plans, a whole series of words and, behind it, nothing much is happening. In my opinion, it is important for us to be realistic. Since this is a tax matter, Parliament is only being consulted on this report and, in view of this, I feel we must be clear and concise when stating our views.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal is interesting and good, and I believe we should support it. We must not try to weaken it; there are already strong disagreements within the Council and the chances of seeing the success of this report as we wish, at EU level, are relatively slim. That is why some people suggest that we work in closer cooperation. That is one of the ideas. Parliament is only consulted on this subject, but we should put all the necessary efforts in place.</p>
<p class="contents">The position of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is clear. After discussions and equivocations, the PPE Group is, today, in favour of the financial transaction tax. We would like the tax to be as comprehensive as possible, but, as the PPE Group is realistic, we know that this is not possible in the current climate. We would like the tax to be adopted at European level and that it not be implemented at a lower level, as this would certainly be detrimental to the European financial economy. We must not look the other way: if there were no European internal market – the European market forms a single entity and, personally, I do not believe in running away from things – if it falls to a lower geographical level, there is a real risk.</p>

The first is that it is only possible to act on the largest possible scale, if possible on a global scale, and that any descent to a lower level would lead to a risk of unfair competition. The second argument is to say, ‘Oh, no, but certain products, which are safe, have to be excluded’.</p>
<p class="contents">I would simply remind our fellow Members of the commitments made by the European Union, in particular through the members participating in the G20, who, in London, in April 2009, said, ‘We have decided that all financial institutions, markets and products of systemic importance should be subject to an appropriate level of regulation and supervision’. It seems to me that the taxation of financial transactions must also, under these conditions, cover undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) and pension funds, that the level of intervention at which we will be able to launch this proposal will be the correct level of intervention, and that the issue of risks must be assessed on a global scale and not simply always to protect them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course, if we only dealt with issues on which there was already a consensus, there would be less work to do in this House. If we only dealt with issues on which there was general agreement from the start, on the basis of a notion of the internal market which entails, at times, simply taking full advantage of it without ever wanting to play the solidarity and level playing field card, that would be much easier. However, we live in the real world.</p>
<p class="contents">I would invite you to reflect on the following. We are making an effort in the euro area and throughout the European Union to consolidate public finances. My feeling is that much greater importance is always attached to the ‘expenditure’ component than to the ‘receipts’ component. However, to balance a budget, it is important to reduce expenditure and to manage it properly, but it is also important that receipts flow into the coffers of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I invite you to consult the latest Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) report on the growing inequalities in Europe, and I would truly recommend that you read it. It is not a document produced by a far-left outfit. It is a document produced by the OECD showing that the increase in inequalities, which jeopardises political stability in our countries, is, in part, linked to the fact that there has been a shortage of tax revenues for a number of years. This is a major problem and, regarding this issue, I would say that the procedure for introducing a financial transaction tax is secondary. There are always manoeuvres to focus on small details, to try to exempt one category or another or exclude one country or another, and to turn a blind eye to what is happening right now in our societies, namely, a scandalous rise in inequalities linked to the fact that large companies and rich individuals no longer pay tax. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been said that an FTT would have to be global in order to be tenable, whereas in fact a number of countries around the world already have a form of transaction tax, including the United Kingdom, South Korea, Switzerland, India, Hong Kong and South Africa. It exists, and it exists in a way that is effective. It has also been said that an FTT could easily be avoided, but the European Parliament has just set out that we will supplement the principle of residence with a principle of issuance and a principle of ownership that will make the tax extremely difficult to avoid.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been said that an FTT would cost us in terms of growth and jobs, but the Commission’s updated calculations in fact suggest the opposite. If we use the revenue wisely, if we use it for investments, then it could, in fact, boost European GDP by 0.2% to 0.4%. It has been said that ordinary pension savers would be hit when they put their money into savings plans, but alongside this is the fact that we need an incentive for pension companies, too, to choose more long-term investment models. That is, after all, what this is all about. It has also been said that a financial activities tax would be just as good as an FTT, but the fact is that an activities tax would not change the financial sector’s speculative behaviour and would not bring in the same revenues. It would also be easier to avoid than an FTT. I would therefore urge the Council and today’s summit to listen to the European Parliament, to look at our report and at some of the suggestions that we have made to improve the Commission’s proposal. I think you should listen to the very large majority of the European population who would like to see a tax on financial transactions. I think it is time to shift the debate out of the vacuum that it has been in. I believe we need to move on swiftly to enhanced cooperation, and I believe that we need an FTT that could bring in revenue and cut down on the highly speculative behaviour in the financial sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not describing the consequences of predatory bank practices or an external economic shock. I am simply illustrating what proponents of a European FTT are willing to inflict on their own constituents in pursuit of a misguided attempt to make someone, anyone, pay for the financial crisis of 2008. It is no secret that the UK stands to lose the most from the imposition of such a tax, but I am not here to argue against the FTT as a Brit, but as a European concerned about the welfare of our economy, and the future wealth of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Ever since this tax’s inception, the discussion around the FTT has not been an objective, evidence-based one. Instead, the Commission, and some in this Parliament, have pretended that the effects of the tax would be negligible, when they are not, that the tax would be just, when it is not, and that it would be internationally viable, when, thankfully, it is not. It is high time that we were honest about the true detrimental effects of this tax on European savers, the European economy and, in fact, financial stability.</p>
<p class="contents">These are dire economic times and we have an awful lot of work still to do before we can rightfully claim to have made financial markets safer and more beneficial to the real economy. Making our voters believe, however, that this tax will get us any closer to fairness and growth is untruthful and a distraction from our massive workload in the area of financial services.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you just one example of how we are pre-empting and improving upon the objectives of the FTT in other dossiers. In the course of the review of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, we are discussing ways of dealing with any risks posed by high-frequency trading (HFT) which are more sophisticated and effective than any FTT could ever be. I call upon my colleagues to follow the Council’s lead in rejecting a European FTT and to leave it up to individual Member States to pursue such a tax if they feel it necessary.</p>

We cannot think that giving the EU tax-raising powers without normal democratic scrutiny is acceptable. It is not.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the legal argument on which this House is trying to base the establishment of an FTT is incorrect. The different sizes of the financial industry in some Member States are not an indication of distorted competition, but rather due to historic developmental differences. This should never have been interpreted as a reason for tax harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission proposes to tax both sides of the transaction. If one of the parties is not a signatory to the treaty, then the other party would have to raise both amounts. What would then happen to the UK veto? It would be useless. The UK taxpayer would end up paying the tax on all transactions that involved Member States who have signed the treaty. However, it would not enjoy a reduction in its EU contribution as it has not signed up to this treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, this House and the Commission must know that as long as the FTT does not become a global tax, the financial sector could move to other, more tax-friendly locations. But they feel the EU can afford the loss of this very important industry. It cannot.</p>

It can at least be said to take on board the idea that the financial markets should participate in the tax system and, above all, should share in bearing the costs of the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that sends a very important message to the financial markets. However, it is also an important message to send to our citizens, to our electorate. There have been a great many actions, petitions and written pleas to politicians in a wide range of Member States asking for a financial transaction tax to at last be introduced at European level. I believe that with the majority that we are seeing here in favour of this report and this tax, Parliament has achieved a major success.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is undoubtedly not sufficient to stabilise and restrict the markets in the way that may be necessary, I feel it is a really important step that we are taking here. I would particularly like to urge the Council to take seriously the voices of our citizens, of our electorate, and to work towards this actually being introduced and not to block the introduction of this tax because of the British position or other positions.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is clear that the citizens of the European Union want this tax, and I think we have a great responsibility here. It is now up to the Council to take action on this, and I should like to use my speaking time to urge the Council to do everything it can to ensure that this tax is now actually introduced and becomes a reality.</p>

Eurobonds will also cost billions of euro a year and will make the Netherlands severally liable for Greek and Spanish debts.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we are debating yet another scam designed to rob the Dutch of their money: the financial transaction tax. This tax will cost the Netherlands up to EUR 4 billion a year.

Mr Barroso and the Commission have made a mess of it. Europe is in ruins and the Netherlands is being asked to pick up the tab.</p>

<p class="contents">But we are not going to do that.

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Overall, the Commission has tabled a good proposal. It is better than many others, such as in the area of energy taxation. It is good on the residence principle, on the tax rates, on the reasoning. I salute the Commissioner. What I cannot support is the justification. In his opening remarks, he repeated that this tax must come about without adding to the tax burden on citizens. However, this is an illusion. If we tax the financial market, then we know full well that, in the end, the burden will be borne by consumers, customers, citizens, and not by an anonymous financial market.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that what this is about is a different issue entirely, which is that the financial market has to be slowed down. If the financial market has to shrink overall and return to its service function in order to achieve this, then such an instrument – high-frequency trading has already been mentioned, elements are included in our proposal – is certainly ideal for this. However, linking it all with own resources, revenues and issues of fairness is not sufficient for its implementation. I believe it is important that we somehow prompt London, the largest market, to come on board. That is why it is important to have a clear vote in Parliament, because more than two thirds of all financial market transactions in the EU of 25 Member States are made via London.</p>
<p class="contents">If we only manage a partial solution, then we will not make progress and will not achieve our objective. That is why I am asking for a clear vote in favour of this financial market transaction tax, in order to create a basis for the whole of the EU to participate. Naturally, one cannot simply disregard the alternatives that are currently being discussed in the Council, namely, an expanded stock exchange tax that includes derivatives. We have passed a regulation on derivatives and created the conditions for this. It all belongs together, and I hope that we will support the Commission on this with a clear vote.</p>

<p class="contents">As regards regulation, the origin of this crisis lies in the deregulation of the financial market, and introducing this tax will provide us with an instrument to better regulate it and prevent future crises in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as speculation is concerned, it will stop the dramatic fluctuations that take place daily in financial transactions and steer resources towards the real economy.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to justice, it will mean that those who were most responsible for the crisis will play a greater part in resolving it.</p>
<p class="contents">From a taxation standpoint, several billion euro can be channelled into a number of areas, including EU resources, Member States and implementing projects that will boost growth and employment.</p>

However, a transaction tax is not the right response to the citizens’ anger. It is a bad tax which risks increasing charges for ordinary bank customers, making investment in Europe more difficult, damaging growth and, as a result, jeopardising jobs. In addition, I believe that the calculation of the revenue cannot be relied on.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal has been under discussion for the last 40 years and it has been tried once in Europe, in my home country of Sweden. The result was that the majority of share trading moved from Stockholm to London. If a transaction tax has to be introduced, it must be introduced globally or at least throughout the entire EU. However, I think that the financial sector should pay more tax. A better model, for example, would be to introduce a stability fee for all banks.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise very briefly, I think that the banking and the financial sector should pay tax. It is not a problem for me, but this is a bad tax which will have a counterproductive effect. Mr Šemeta, please try again and take a new approach.</p>

I actually think that this is no coincidence and that the tax is not only a fair contribution from a sector that was largely responsible for the current crisis, but also an own resource of the European Union, a resource, a revenue stream to finance this much-heralded recovery, which is something we all so earnestly desire.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that this own resource and the battle for own resources are of paramount importance. We must not separate the issue of the financial transaction tax from that of own resources. We need this own resource, and maybe others for that matter, to fund the recovery projects.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that austerity, austerity alone, leads to exasperation and, sometimes, to votes and political situations that actually lead nowhere.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that, today, we need to move forward. The Commission has tabled a good proposal; it has come up against a good many objections, including the one that has just been raised on the issue of the place of transaction. I therefore truly hope that we will be able to move it forward, including in the Council, which is an onerous task for you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The sanction of invalidating transactions upon which the financial transaction tax has not been paid will undermine the rule of law. It would represent the superiority of fiscal interests over the real economy. Contrary to what is intended, the financial transaction tax will affect not only the most speculative practices, but the entire financial market, which also supplies what is known as the real economy, whereby the latter needs money now like never before. Numerous European politicians continue to propose new taxes to overcome the crisis: carbon taxes, environmental taxes, energy taxes, and finally, the financial transaction tax and the coordination of income taxes. This is the worst possible solution. Today, Europe needs competitiveness, and new taxes will kill this competitiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to create a truly effective instrument that achieves its objective. Personally, I support the idea of the financial transaction tax (FFT) as well as the structure set out by the Commission. I agree that the private sector, too, must help pay for the crisis that it caused.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last few years, we have seen the States intervene in the private sector, precisely to resolve critical situations caused by unbridled speculation and the lack of supervision. However, we need to ensure that this tax is not passed on to end users, as so often happens.</p>
<p class="contents">A further doubt concerns the effects on the financing of sovereign debt stemming from the inclusion of securities in the scope of the tax. Although the issuing of sovereign debt instruments is exempt from tax, the reduction of liquidity on the secondary market resulting from the introduction of the tax will affect the price of securities in auctions on the primary market, thereby leading to a rise in the interest tax payable to investors by the State. This effect will harm States with a high public debt.</p>
<p class="contents">The levying of this tax at EU level – or only at EU level – must be a first step, but the final objective must remain the introduction of a global tax to stabilise the markets and prevent speculation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why? Because the financial services sector is largely undertaxed: it enjoys an EUR 18 billion per annum VAT exemption. It should pay a fairer rate of tax, particularly since its return to profitability, and it continues to pay out large bonuses.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we prefer a global financial transaction tax, but we have been prepared, unlike the UK Government, to engage constructively in the debate for an EU FTT. It is clear that it has to be workable, it has to be effective, it has to be simple to collect and it has to minimise tax avoidance.</p>
<p class="contents">A well-designed FTT could help tackle speculation, and it could help stabilise the economy away from short-term profit towards serving the real economy. It would raise money to meet global development and poverty challenges and climate change commitments. It could raise revenue to meet our national priorities for investing in our economic future and youth employment.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be a bonus if an FTT could tackle the kind of hedge fund activity which last week saw a US tax-exile hedge fund manager in the Cayman Islands paid EUR 400 million from the bailout cash we paid to the Greek Government to pay its bondholders. Frankly, if J.P. Morgan can carelessly afford to lose EUR 2 billion – even maybe EUR 7 billion by recent estimates – they can afford to pay an FTT.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to be clear, though. Tax policy requires unanimity between all EU Member States, and the EU does not have tax-raising powers to allocate resources for an FTT. We will continue to campaign for the global FTT and to engage in this, but we will not vote for an FTT that is prioritised for own resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The general argument that wealthy banks that make money from people’s savings should be in solidarity with their clients appears, at first glance, to be plausible. When applying this idea, however, several complications arise. Our financial experts are unable to agree on the items that should be properly included in the tax base, and all questions as to what consequences the introduction of a new tax on pension funds, foreign exchange transactions, and also high-frequency trading may have are justified. In addition to the complications arising from the definition of the tax base, the issue of the geographical scope of its application remains unresolved. It is clear from the attitudes of our major trading partners that at a global level, it shall remain so, nor shall we come to an agreement on the tax being applied throughout the European Union.

In this respect, Commissioner, all the proposals fall short.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial transaction tax will not bring the financial pact under control if we do not at the same time tighten up the rules and establish supervision that truly prevents any further short selling and controls high-frequency trading.</p>
<p class="contents">The vague wording of Article 17a does nothing to increase my confidence in the Commission and the Council. The wording does not specify who will manage this revenue. That is why I agree with Mr Klinz and Mr Giegold that there are exemptions here which cannot be justified, particularly when it comes to investment funds. The issue of how the revenue will be administered has still not been settled, and there are no proposals for how the financial markets will be regulated and supervised. I will therefore be voting against the report today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No one is in any doubt that everyone needs to contribute at this time of crisis. However, today’s proposal and debate have raised a number of doubts. First, what is so useful about debating a proposal that will lead to so many problems for the Council, at a time of crisis and when we need to invest in growth, which requires unanimity? Second, as this is not a global solution, what impact will it have on the internal market, which is itself part of a global market? Could it be that it will only lead to distortions? Third, what is the aim of this proposal? Regulation is not the right path. Is it to find revenue for the EU budget? That would indeed be a good path to follow. How will the impact on taxpayers be limited? How will it not increase prices for those not obliged to pay a tax like this one? All these questions have been raised about the good intentions and good ideas behind this proposal, and we should reflect on them, naturally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We now have a basis of assessment including exchange transactions, derivatives, equities and bonds traded on the secondary market. Like the Commissioner, we want the financial transaction tax to be imposed on pension funds and undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), which, unfortunately, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wants to exclude. We also have two tax rates, including a lower rate for derivatives, which seems paradoxical given that we want to combat speculation.</p>
<p class="contents">By and large, however, the compromise we are reaching will be an important step forward, especially if it obtains a large majority in plenary. This would send a strong signal to the Council, where political change in France is opening up new possibilities for European growth initiatives, funding for which could be achieved through the mobilisation of this first European tax instrument. This places the burden fairly and squarely on the financial sector, which is responsible for the crisis, and not on its victims, European citizens. The tax revenue will also help reduce the contribution of the Member States, which are being asked to reduce their deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, Parliament is suggesting that it is not impossible to reconcile fiscal justice, deficit reduction and support for growth.

That would have enabled it to avoid a fundamental contradiction, which has been detrimental to the text as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">How is it possible to start from a laudable intention, which is to curb financial speculation, considered so harmful, only to end up punishing the financial instruments aimed at collecting savings in the long term? That, however, is what the Podimata report is leading to at the moment by taxing undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) in the same way as other financial institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">This treatment calls for two basic remarks to be made. The first is that the text’s rapporteur seems to be aware of the problem of coherence, as pension funds were finally excluded from the scope of the proposed directive. If that is the case, however, the reasoning must be carried through to its logical conclusion, since the vast majority of pension funds invest in collective investment funds. Therefore, I have to say to my fellow Members, ‘More effort is needed, ladies and gentlemen, if you want to adopt a coherent approach’.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly – and this is the most serious point – to treat the different financial institutions equally in fact amounts to introducing intolerable inequality. Investment funds are, by their very nature, constantly required to carry out transactions on their portfolio. That is why they exist. To tax each transaction in the same way as high-frequency trading is to introduce cascading taxes that are so disadvantageous that the European funds industry would be condemned in the face of competition from third countries, which are already rejoicing. I do not think we can condone this. I therefore ask you to support the February amendment concerning this exemption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is aimed at reducing speculation and increasing healthy competition, within the single market, and at generating revenue. The Podimata report has attempted to bring the Commission’s initial proposal closer to the UK’s well-known system of stamp duty, thereby making it more attractive to reluctant Member States. It is to be hoped that the Council will also get the message.</p>
<p class="contents">While, in the Commission’s proposal, the tax would apply to transactions made by financial institutions based within the EU, the idea now is that transactions involving European assets will also be taxed, even when conducted by non-Europeans. This measure will expand the revenue base and reduce leakage. It is to be hoped that the revenue from the tax will be considered a source of own resources for the EU and its Member States, thereby reducing taxes in the Member States, but this remains undecided.</p>

<p class="contents">Secondly, even the Commission recognises that the financial transaction tax will lead to less growth. The discussion is about how much less growth, but it will give less growth, which is contrary to what Europe needs today. We need more growth and we need reforms that support economic growth and dynamic financial markets in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the financial transaction tax is not providing us with new money. It will be paid by customers – those who are going to invest and those who trust in their future pension schemes. It will be paid by all of us, because there are no taxes paid by anyone apart from the citizens of Europe. This tax will not help in the Europe of today, so we should vote ‘no’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I understand the prudence, the caution, the need to do things gradually expressed by Mr Šemeta and the technical issues rightly raised by Ms Vestager. Precisely for this reason, though, I hope that Parliament will express a clear, political will, with a broad majority, in order to encourage and drive forward the initiatives necessary to address the unresolved problems, especially at Council level.</p>
<p class="contents">We all want to closely examine the impact of this tax, but it is not right to stir up unfounded fears which could even lead to contradictory and counterproductive choices. I refer, for example, to the rationale behind the proposed exemptions. If we are careful to reduce the impact of the tax, it is important to have as broad a tax base as possible, with a low rate, and not to attempt to extend the exemptions <span class="italic">ad infinitum</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">To those who are concerned about the consequences for small investors, I would point out the progressive nature of the tax, so those who carry out several transactions are affected more, and it is clear that the competent authorities must, in any case, ensure that there are no attempts to offload the possible costs onto end users. I therefore hope that Parliament will vote in favour of this tax by a large majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why it makes sense for there also to be a tax on financial transactions. It also makes sense for this to be done in a cross-border arrangement. In Europe – or at least in the euro area – this would not result in distortions; rather, it would make a lasting contribution to bringing about a stable financial market which generates what financial markets are actually there for, namely, to provide enterprises with access to capital, to allow savers to save or put something aside for their old age, and so that the financial markets can once again do the job for which they were once created, which is to provide added value for the real economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything that drove us into the financial crisis consisted of products that added no value for the real economy. That is why it makes sense to have a tax that can be used to help ensure that this is severely penalised, that sanctions are taken, that steers us towards a situation in which capital goes back to doing its job. That is why I am advocating that we adopt this proposal today with a broad majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The contribution made by the financial services sector to alleviate this deterioration is one of the commitments made at the G20 summit held in Pittsburgh in September 2009. Without that contribution, there will be no fair way out of the crisis: this is the ‘polluter pays’ principle.</p>
<p class="contents">A tax of this nature should be part of an agenda for growth and employment in Europe. It has the potential to generate EUR 60 billion per year, which will help to stabilise public accounts, deter speculative investments and the excesses of the financial system, and promote investment in the real economy.</p>
<p class="contents">From a broader perspective, taxes are the price of civilisation. All those who participate in and benefit from it should pay those taxes. The financial sector must also shoulder its fiscal responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The tax on financial transactions will correct the anomaly that, under current EU legislation, financial services are not subject to indirect taxation. This exemption only makes sense in order to avoid double taxation for transactions directly linked to the real economy, such as payment services or credit, but not for trading in purely financial products.</p>
<p class="contents">We should now remove that privilege and prevent the tax burden from falling on the rest of the industry and on citizens who are not consumers of financial products and services.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the resolution of March 2010, in the Guerrero report, which included one of my own amendments, this has been the European Parliament’s position, with the aim of establishing a real international tax that contributes to the Millennium Development Goals and overall development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I trust that this report will be a positive contribution by the European Parliament to the fight against speculation and in addressing the question of the supervision and resolution of the financial sector.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it would be helpful if broad agreement could be reached within the framework of the coordination of tax and budgetary policies and if this tax could be integrated into that, in order to prevent distortions in the single market even though, as we all know, such agreement is difficult to reach.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we must press on with our efforts within the framework of the international community, because we also need to protect our financial sector. It is a Union objective that I consider extremely important. We also need to consider how we can ensure that we do not undermine the much-discussed growth which the Union so desperately needs at present; that is why I support the amendment exempting investment funds and pension funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a word about resources. It has always been my understanding that this tax is linked to resources and their availability. I believe that this is an opportunity for the Union to acquire a source of own resources and to utilise this tax to give growth in Europe the kick start that it needs. This is a moment of creation and we must make use of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
