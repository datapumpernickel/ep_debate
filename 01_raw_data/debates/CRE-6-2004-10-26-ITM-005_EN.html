<p class="contents">In June, a consensus of the Heads of State or Government nominated me as President of the Commission. On 22 July, Parliament gave me its confidence with a large majority. I thank you for the honour that you bestowed on me. I then put together my team, with the Council’s agreement and based on the nominations by the Member States. I also decided how responsibilities would be shared out among the Commissioners-designate and the main features of the new Commission’s internal organisation. Throughout this period I kept in constant contact with Parliament and I had the opportunity to meet all of the Members of the Council, except those Heads of Government of countries in which elections were held recently.</p>
<p class="contents">I appear before you today, ladies and gentlemen, to request approval for the future college.</p>
<p class="contents">This Commission is a team with a number of positive features: it contains more women than in any previous Commission; it contains representatives of the main political streams in Europe, Christian democrats and people’s parties, socialists and social-democrats, liberals and democrats; it contains people with extensive political experience, at both European and national level.</p>
<p class="contents">All of the Members of the future Commission are committed to defending and promoting our Union’s interests, and are aware of their joint responsibility towards Parliament. In its internal operation, the Commission will be guided by complete compliance with the principle of collective accountability. As I said to you in July, and in accordance with your wishes, there are definitely no first-class or second-class Commissioners in this college.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also true that, broadly speaking, the Commission that I now propose to you has been received very favourably by the general public in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">All the men and women in this Commission have attended hearings in the parliamentary committees. This procedure, which has no parallel in the Member States, is an example of democracy in action at the heart of the European institutions. Your hearings have revealed a broad consensus between Parliament and the future Commission. In the vast majority of cases, Parliament's verdict has been positive. In a few cases Parliament has identified weaknesses and asked for a response from me.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Conference of Presidents last week, I gave my reactions to the letters from the parliamentary committees. Today I wish to clarify my position on the most important points, without going into details of the undertakings I have already given, and provide you with the additional steps I am ready to take.</p>
<p class="contents">In a specific case of a potential conflict of interest, I gave the strongest possible guarantees that the Commission's work in the field of competition policy will not be affected. These guarantees are based on rules and procedures that are a matter of public record. The Commission will always carry out its responsibilities in the area of competition impartially, independently, transparently and with assiduity and expertise.</p>
<p class="contents">Some doubts have been expressed about the mastery of the details of certain complex and technical portfolios, such as energy. I can assure you that I have absolute confidence in the political skills of the Commissioners-designate and their ability to absorb and defend their brief, however technical.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the criticism levelled against one Commissioner-designate, relating to her former political career, I would remind you that this concerns allegations which can be dealt with under existing national control procedures, including judicial investigation. At this point, no accusations have been made against this Commissioner-designate and she therefore retains my confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">I expect all Members of the Commission to meet the highest ethical standards and to comply fully with the Code of Conduct. Let me say once again that I intend to use all the powers that the Treaty confers on me to ensure that this is indeed the case. I will not hesitate to demand the resignation of any Member of the Commission who is manifestly not up to the job or who fails in the duties imposed upon him or her by the Treaty. This also holds for cases brought up by Parliament, which I will actively consider before taking a final decision.</p>
<p class="contents">All the Members of the Commission have undertaken to tender their resignation if I ask for it. Obviously this also applies to any possibility of a reshuffle during the mandate of the next Commission. Once the Commission is approved by this Parliament, I will have the power to make the adjustments I may deem necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The verdict on Mr Buttiglione's performance at one of the hearings he attended was positive, and at another hearing it was negative. Following this hearing, I asked him for a clear explanation of his position. He replied in writing, expressing his regret and reaffirming his commitment to the principle of non-discrimination. I, for my part, would never accept anyone in my Commission who defends positions that are not compatible with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I am sure that Mr Buttiglione will fully comply with the Treaty and the Charter and I can confirm that the rest of the Commissioners-designate share my view.</p>
<p class="contents">However, one good thing will have come out of this unfortunate incident: it has highlighted the importance we attach to decisive political action by the European Union in the fight against all forms of discrimination. For this I must thank Parliament. This debate enables us to move from words to substance, and about substance no doubts are allowed. This Commission will give civil rights and anti-discrimination policy top priority.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already told the Conference of Presidents – and I confirm this today to you – that I intend to create a group of Commissioners responsible for fundamental rights, anti-discrimination and equal opportunities. This group, which I will chair, will monitor all Commission action and measure initiatives in these areas. It will also act as the political driving force. This group will not be a talking shop. It will ensure that the action by the Commission in promoting fundamental rights and fighting against all forms of discrimination is cohesive. It is my intention to set an ambitious agenda for this group. I will be ready to discuss it with you and to ask for your suggestions. Already I can announce that I will make use of the results of a public consultation aimed at facilitating the creation of a European fundamental rights agency, which will take as its starting point the current Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia in Vienna. I will await Parliament's contribution before presenting a legislative proposal on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I also intend to initiate work with a view to a framework directive on the basis of Article 13 of the European Community Treaty, which will replace the directives adopted in 2000 and extend them to all forms of discrimination. Currently, these directives have a limited scope. With the framework directive, Community action will cover all areas of discrimination, including discrimination on the grounds of gender or sexual orientation. With this initiative, I am simply confirming even more clearly what has, from the very beginning, been one of the features of this Commission: that its very composition, with eight women in the college, affirms its determination to combat discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I intend to launch a programme and an action plan to combat discrimination with particular reference to all forms of anti-Semitism, racism and xenophobia. In this connection the future Commission will commit itself to relaunching negotiations on a framework decision on racism and xenophobia, which has been blocked in the Council for far too long.</p>
<p class="contents">All these initiatives, and others that might be considered by the group of Commissioners or suggested by you, will be prepared under my authority. I am prepared to present them to you in person when the time comes – not just in plenary but, if necessary, in the relevant committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make it very clear that I will personally assume full control of our action in the fight against discrimination and the promotion of fundamental rights. So, as you see, I have listened carefully to Parliament's opinion. I have taken into consideration your major concerns and objections and have provided substantive replies. Some of you would have liked a more radical response and a reorganisation of the team, but is that a real option at this stage? All the information I have, after careful consideration and extensive consultation, makes me think that changing the portfolios at this stage of the procedure would cause more political and interinstitutional problems than it would solve. We should bear in mind that this process involves not only the President-designate and Parliament but also the Council, as a third and very relevant partner.</p>
<p class="contents">My team may not be considered perfect by all of you, but is there any team in any of our national governments that we can consider perfect? However, it is recognised by many to be, on the whole, a very strong and balanced team. I am convinced that we can do our job in the service of Europe and its citizens, under the political monitoring of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It was a great honour for me to receive your support and confidence in July by a very large majority. I ask you now to support the solution I am proposing, as it is you who best serve the interests of the European Union at this point. You will be able to judge the President and all the Members of the Commission later in the light of their actions and not just their words. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in July, I announced to you my intention to build a partnership for Europe – a partnership for prosperity, solidarity and security. In order to achieve this, the new Commission must tackle some major issues, both at internal and international level. It must meet the expectations of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Fundamental institutional changes await us in the years to come, when the Constitution enters into force – as the Commission hopes it will – after it has been ratified by all of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We must prepare for those changes. We must also explain, clearly and objectively, to people the many advantages of the Constitution over the current Treaties. This Constitution will significantly enhance both the democracy and the effectiveness of the European Union. It will provide the EU with the appropriate instruments to address the actual needs and expectations of Europeans more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The main task of achieving ratification at national level naturally falls to the Member States, in accordance with the procedures laid down in their internal legal orders. The future Commission, however, is more than ready to work with the Council and with Parliament to set up a common communication strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must place growth at the heart of its activities. Europe needs more growth, more jobs, more entrepreneurial spirit, more innovation and more research. It must achieve reforms that foster economic dynamism. It must invest in education and training, knowledge and technological development, so as to be a genuinely knowledge-based economy that is up to speed with the increasingly tough demands of international competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Those reforms and that spirit of constructive change must form part of a sustainable development strategy that takes up the challenge posed by climate change and that appropriately addresses the issues of energy, transport and protection of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, we must redouble our efforts at both internal and international level, in our quest for a coordinated strategy within a multilateral framework. The Russian Federation’s ratification of the Kyoto Protocol is a tangible success of the multilateral strategy for the environment, which bodes well for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">A more dynamic and more competitive Europe must go hand in hand with maintaining the European social model, and I would add that a more dynamic and more competitive Europe is the only one in which we will be capable of completely safeguarding this model. We must also bear in mind that, in some of our countries, we are still a long way from a genuinely fair level of social protection. Competitiveness, cohesion and solidarity must progress in tandem. It is clear that cohesion policy and actions aimed at creating a more competitive and more dynamic European economy are intrinsically linked and complement one another. The new Member States in particular expect us all to make an effort in terms of cohesion and solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that solidarity is a core value and abandoning it would endanger the character of our societies. Solidarity – between generations, between members and groups of our societies, between Member States and regions – is not an abstract value. It is a wise choice, which fosters social cohesion and which requires both political commitment and the appropriate financial resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Our European Union is not only an economic area; it is also a fully-fledged area of freedom, security and justice. The Commission attaches the highest importance to implementing common policies in the areas of asylum and immigration – fair and balanced policies that are intended to promote economic and social integration for third-country nationals, policies that respect every individual’s cultural identity and the core values of European society.</p>
<p class="contents">In this area, cooperation with third countries is crucial. I must state that I am opposed to setting up ‘camps’ outside the EU. The Commission will cooperate more extensively with third countries in order to help them deal with migratory flows. Partnership with third countries is only possible if based on a joint undertaking and in compliance with international law. Let me be clear on this point: the future Commission will work with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees to build international cooperation in this field. It will urge those third countries that are our partners to sign up to and comply with the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">This new Commission will also continue to work towards strengthening the security of us all, whilst respecting their civil liberties, to meet the tough challenges posed by the threat of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must play its full role on the international stage. It has important responsibilities and must be a strong and credible partner. It must continue to foster peace and stability and to strengthen the multilateral dimension in a wide range of areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We must strengthen relations with third countries and with regional organisations. Cooperation with the United States must be based on a relationship of equals and on deep mutual understanding. The election of a new US President, at the same time as the new Commission takes up its duties, gives us the opportunity to restore the transatlantic axis, regardless of the election result. I firmly believe that the United States is ready to contribute towards setting up a more balanced relationship with Europe. Whilst we want the United States to take a more multilateral approach, we must also, on our side, carry out our activities with greater unity and effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall continue the process of enlarging the EU to include the candidate countries. Our neighbourhood policy is also something that we see as a priority, a powerful tool in the EU’s external relations that will enable us to build stronger partnerships. I believe that our continent stands a much greater chance of lasting peace with an enhanced stability policy in Eastern Europe, the Balkans and the Mediterranean countries. I feel that development policy is essential for greater cooperation with the parts of the world that need our support and our assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, next January, I shall appear before you in this House to present the EU’s strategic priorities. This will not solely concern the Commission’s legislative and work programme for 2005. My intention is to give the strategic programme a broader outlook. In the spirit of the Constitution, I shall present to you the priorities for the next five years. My aim is to reach an agreement on long-term programming with Parliament and the Council, and in so doing, I shall be addressing one of the main concerns expressed by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In July I told you of my wish to establish positive cooperation between Parliament and the Commission. I strongly believe that the Commission’s strength and credibility lie in Parliament’s support and in active cooperation between our two institutions. I have studied carefully Mr Borrell’s proposals on relations between our two institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I await your resolution with interest and I am ready to respond most openly during tomorrow’s debate. Let me say straight away that I am in favour of transparency and cooperation between our two institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, as soon as the new Commission takes up its duties, negotiations will get underway between our two institutions aimed at introducing the necessary changes to the framework agreement. Europe needs fruitful cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, the two institutions that are always at the forefront of the European project.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, an event of historic importance is almost upon us – the Constitutional Treaty is set to be signed in a few days, on 29 October. This is not a simple matter of revising the existing Treaties; it is the culmination of a long process involving Parliament, the Member States, the Commission, the national parliaments and civil society, aimed at making the EU more democratic, more transparent and more efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">As the representatives of the peoples of our enlarged Europe, you are aware of the magnitude of the European citizens’ expectations. You are aware of the apathy and the scepticism that are affecting European democracy. You are aware, as I am, of populist threats coming from people who wish to weaken Europe and who always seek to call into question the credibility of our institutions. We must not give them any fresh arguments to use against us.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a momentous time for our countries and for the EU. I have shared with you the principles that have guided the composition of my Commission and I have shared with you my intention to work closely with you throughout the next five years, so as to promote prosperity, solidarity and security. We have no time to lose; the time has come to take action and to work together for the benefit of the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us devote our energies to promoting growth, jobs, harmonisation and the Lisbon strategy, to strengthening a dynamic knowledge-based economy and to promoting greater cohesion in our enlarged Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This Commission is worthy of your confidence and deserves your support. I appeal to your sense of responsibility. I appeal particularly to your European commitment to express your confidence in this college. We can build a stronger Europe on the foundations of this relationship of mutual respect and confidence.</p>

Today you are here with the team that has been proposed to you by the national governments. Mr President-elect of the Commission, you have expressed your willingness to cooperate very closely with the European Parliament, and, while we welcome this, we will also take you at your word in the future. We also very much welcome the further commitments you have entered into today. We welcome your desire to be the President of a strong Commission, and several times you have mentioned the responsibility that you, as President, will have for determining overall policy. That too is in our interests, for we need a Commission with a strong President, such as the European Union has enjoyed in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group has tabled a motion for a resolution. It is regrettable that the groups could not agree on a joint motion, but ours will be the yardstick for monitoring the Commission. We expect the new Commission to agree its political and strategic programme in close cooperation with Parliament and we expect the Commission to be in regular attendance in Parliament and its committees, not only today – and it is impressive that they are all here – but also throughout the five years of its term of office. Do not forget your responsibility to Parliament once you are confirmed in post tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect the Commission to take the principles of subsidiarity very seriously. We want a strong Europe, but we also have the identity of our nations, the identity of our regions and the identity – let us not forget – of our towns and villages.</p>
<p class="contents">What are our values? The cornerstones of our free society are respect for the dignity of each individual, tolerance, pluralism and the rule of law. Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The strength of our European cultural identity lies in the fact that we accept cultural difference and tolerate it. It is my firm conviction that, if we stop doing so, then Europe will fail, and that means that no one in the European Union, no one in Europe, no one in the world should be discriminated against, including for their religious beliefs.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We want a Commission that is made up of a diverse range of people and not just one with people from all of the countries in the European Union, as the Treaty stipulates. We want people from different cultural backgrounds, with a range of different religious beliefs or non-religious beliefs and convictions. If we accept this – and it seems to me that this is what the Commission team represents – Europe has a good future ahead of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone here should be aware that if this college does not win the vote of confidence tomorrow it will not mean that one, two, three or four Members will be replaced: no, the status of every member of the team that is here today will then be open to question. This is not about one person, it is not about two or three people; it is about the whole college and we should be aware of that.</p>
<p class="contents">On Friday, we will have the signing of the European Constitution. We all know how difficult it is going to be to win approval for this in those nations that are holding referendums. And please bear in mind that if we were to get a result tomorrow – I do not think that we will, but if we did – that suggested to the European Union that we do not accept our cultural pluralism, it would make it even more difficult to have the constitution adopted in the 25 countries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">All of this must be borne in mind. Let me be quite frank, ladies and gentlemen, and say that I find it very moving to see public figures from 25 European countries sitting in front of us now. When I was elected to the European Parliament in 1979, I could only dream that one day we might have Members of the Commission from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Malta and Cyprus. These public figures are here today in our midst. It is our responsibility tomorrow to express our confidence in this Commission so as to secure Europe’s future.</p>

The Council of the European Union feels that Queen Beatrix is representation enough today. We should take note of that. Because Mr Poettering is of course right that this is an important day. Here we have a Commission President who is fighting for confidence in his Commission. Parliament is here, as is the entire Commission. Perhaps the Council will arrive later on. Mr Barroso, you have made remarks that we have all heard before. Today you added a few initiatives, but you still have not addressed a significant part of what my group has been trying to get over to you for days. The point is that we expect you to draw the obvious conclusions from a six-week process that has taken place here in this Parliament. For six weeks we have listened to the nominee Commissioners and have drawn conclusions in five different committees – controversial conclusions in the case of one particular Commissioner, who did not win a majority in one committee, and four further sets of conclusions in which serious comments were made, serious comments which led to proposals and suggestions being put to you. And the answer that we are being given yet again today, Mr Barroso, is this: I will not change anything; the portfolios will not be reassigned. That is a significant hurdle.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That is a hurdle. I can only appeal to you once more to think again. This morning, once again, I should like to tell you about the impression I get; it is that you are confusing the vote of confidence on your Commission with one in a national parliament. The European Parliament does not form opposing majorities. The European Parliament is – you are right there, Mr Poettering – heterogeneous. It consists of diverse currents of opinion. Even within our groups – as you of course know from bitter experience – there are very heterogeneous currents of opinion, and anyone who wants to win a large majority in this House has to show consideration for these different currents and try, as far as possible, to accommodate them all. For weeks, your approach has been: I have a Commission, I have handed out the portfolios, and I am not prepared to make any changes! If that is the case then even cosmetic changes in the form of announcements of initiatives are not going to help. If that is the case then it will be very difficult for us to express confidence in your Commission.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This is also about the issue of confidence. We know that we are voting on the Commission as a whole, not on individual Commissioners, however controversial they may be. This being the case, the question becomes one of basic confidence. At the end of the day, after weighing up all of the facts and all of the observations that have been made about individual candidates, do we have a fundamental confidence in this Commission as a whole, as a collective body, or do we not? That is the salient question here. Since we cannot pick out individual points but have to decide whether we have this fundamental confidence in the collective body, that is precisely what our group will be considering this evening. Do we have this fundamental confidence, or do we not?</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that I found nothing in your speech this morning to increase my confidence. I should like to take up one point that you mentioned. You referred to the US elections. My group does indeed hope that John Kerry will be elected President. We hope that he will be President because he is someone who says that the war in Iraq was a mistake. We want the USA to be led by a President who says, yes, that was a mistake, and a leader who admits to his mistakes is what we want for Europe too.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">One final comment: a democratic vote is a normal democratic act. If this Parliament voices its confidence in your Commission, then you will have won. That decision will have to be respected! But if you do not have the confidence of this House tomorrow, it will not herald an institutional crisis, it will be a normal process, a normal right exercised by a freely elected Parliament in respect of an executive.</p>

My Group and this House have offered a sober and considered rejection of his nominee for Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, we recognise that you could work only with what you were given. We recognise that your independence is not total. We have, on the whole, offered our support for the other members of your Commission. But our judgement stands, and it will be respected. This Group supported you as President of the Commission; we voted for you; we still support you. But we value the prerogatives of this House too highly to see them taken lightly.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the package of measures that you have put before this House today. I believe you come here in a genuine search for rapprochement. Some of the measures you propose are bold and all of them are important. I believe that you are committed personally to the promotion of fundamental rights and that this spirit will infuse the Commission you will lead. Liberals and Democrats will consider your proposals carefully. But I am bound to say that they come late in the day and they contain little about Mr Buttiglione's future, a future which may be intimately bound to the future of the Commission-designate.</p>
<p class="contents">This House is not asking to be placated or patronised.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We are asking that the other branches of our European government recognise what our Treaties recognise and what the European Constitution recognises: that power in Europe rests in some measure with this Chamber and its elected Members. The approval process is not a rubber stamp and this Parliament should not be treated as one.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been said often in the last week that it will be Liberals and Democrats who decide the fate of this Commission. But Liberals and Democrats did not nominate the Commissioners rejected by Parliament's committees. It was not Liberals and Democrats who would not or could not find the compromise that might have put Mr Buttiglione beyond the reach of controversy. Whatever happens tomorrow, the fate of this Commission has more than one architect.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I know that I am not the only one in this Chamber who feels that there is an invisible elephant in the room. The elephant is Justus Lipsius. The elephant is in the heads of the governments who gave you a weaker Commission than you deserve, and then refused to come to your aid when our House called their bluff.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">How many of Europe's governments would have done what Mr Berlusconi probably did and told you to take their man, <span class="italic">basta</span>, even if it left you with a Commission containing a Commissioner whose political feet of clay would probably disqualify him from inclusion in most of the European Union's national governments?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">My Group feels that Member States owe Europe their best and their brightest. How many governments have shown their willingness to accept the democratic and legal right of our Parliament to judge the men and women who were proposed? The silence you hear is the sound of Europe's governments leaving you and your new Commission swinging in the wind.</p>
<p class="contents">As the defenders of the Community method, the strength of our House is ultimately the strength of yours. Because if the Council can mock the prerogative of this Parliament, then be absolutely sure that it thinks the same of the independence of your Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council prefers this Parliament to be weak. Too many in the Council find it convenient for the Commission to be weak. My Group wants this Parliament to be strong, because we cannot conceive of a strong European Union without it. And we want your Commission to be strong because the European Union needs an independent executive of the highest calibre. We have demanded a new framework agreement with your Commission: draft it and sign it, so that we will not be brought to this impasse again.</p>
<p class="contents">This House faces a heavy choice. If Liberals and Democrats vote against the Commission-designate, we will not do so lightly. But we cannot, and we will not, diminish the status of this House, the standing of the Civil Liberties Committee or the stature of the post of the European Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs in the interest of an easy life. You might say – if I can use Mr Buttiglione's own words – that we will not change our principles against our conscience for political convenience.</p>

After auditioning some of your musicians, we found a pianist on the oboe and violinists playing the drums and, following these auditions, we told you that the music did not sound right. At which point you told us, ‘no problem – if a Commissioner here or there has a conflict of interests, he will be a part-time Commissioner and I, Barroso, will take care of things. If a Commissioner is not very familiar with the agriculture dossiers, that is no problem, she will go on a course to catch up and she will take a written exam. If a Commissioner for the environment is not too familiar with his dossiers, that is no problem, Mr Barroso is here. If a Commissioner for energy does not know the technical aspects of the dossiers, that is no problem, there are night classes and he can go and catch up. If a Commissioner for taxation is not too familiar with his dossiers, that is no problem, Mr Barroso is here’.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr Barroso, it is on television that we look for superstars; in this House we look for something else. First mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">Second mistake, Mr Barroso – you have been on a tour of capital cities. You asked Heads of Government to telephone Members of this House. Mr Barroso, did Mr Schroeder, Mr Blair and Mr So-and-so take part in the hearings? Were they here when the hearings took place? No, they were not.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This is why, Mr Barroso, you must respect the institutions. The Council nominated you. You were elected with a healthy majority. My group did not vote for you, but we recognise this election. Then there were the hearings. Please stop asking the offices of Heads of Government to disturb us. In any event, the more they telephone, the fewer votes you will get. Try to tread carefully. Listen a little to the British Members of this House who are starting to become fed up with telephone calls from Downing Street.</p>
<p class="contents">Your third mistake, Mr Barroso – at this point I come back to what Mr Poettering said to us on the subject of cultural difference: ‘there is no need for uniformity in this House’. Yes, Mr Poettering, nobody here criticises anyone whatsoever for their religious beliefs, their philosophical beliefs or their ideological beliefs. Nevertheless, any religious or ideological fundamentalism is poison for democracy. If a man campaigns against divorce, he is perfectly entitled to be against divorce and to wage a political campaign. If a man campaigns against a woman’s right to have an abortion, he is perfectly entitled to be against abortion and to wage a political campaign. If a man campaigns for the withdrawal of discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation from the fundamental Charter and from the Constitutional Treaty, as Mr Buttiglione did by signing Amendment 444 of the Convention, he is perfectly entitled to do so, politically speaking. We are perfectly entitled, however, to say that he is the least suitable person to defend the principle of non-discrimination in the European Union. This is a political decision, not an ideological one.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, let me state this once again: you cannot say in this House that democracy will be rejected by the general public if it is working; you cannot say that if there is a ‘no’ vote here the general public will reject the Treaty. The opposite is true – if Parliament shows its democratic colours, the general public will vote for that democracy and for that Constitutional Treaty.

This presentation of the situation by the President-designate constitutes, as far as my group is concerned, a deeply flawed assessment of the crisis affecting the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent mounting criticism of the Barroso team is nothing short of a clap of thunder in a calm sky. Let me remind you that a not inconsiderable section of this House had, as long ago as July, expressed its mistrust of the rather too liberal choices that characterise Mr Barroso. It cannot be a surprise to anyone that the college of Commissioners presented to us only serves to exacerbate all of these reservations. By putting in the highly sensitive competition post an ardent devotee of market economics, as one analyst put it, an industrial lobbyist who represents and fosters dubious relations between public responsibilities and private interests, to the point of having been severely and unanimously reprimanded by his national parliament; by naming in the post of international trade a champion of free trade, who has no compunction about announcing that he puts his faith in competition to improve the performance of public services; by giving the internal market portfolio to a fundamentalist of liberalism, that of the environment to a conservative, for whom ecology appears to be the least of his concerns, and that of agriculture to a champion of the agricultural business, and so on and so forth, the President-designate has no doubt succeeded in convincing a number of doubters that he nurtured a particular idea of Europe that they certainly did not share.</p>
<p class="contents">Against the backdrop of this fundamental challenge to Mr Barroso’s economic, social and environmental choices, the Buttiglione bomb has gone off. Mr Barroso told us that he set great store by communication. He has got what he wanted. One single Commissioner has brought fame to the whole of his Commission, albeit at a considerable price. The image of his team, whatever may have been the quality of some of its members, is forever tarnished with unworthy and anachronistic words that were not punished as they should have been. If a candidate country displayed such fundamentalist beliefs on the place of women in society, and such discriminatory beliefs on homosexuality, it would be rejected. At the very least, we should have done likewise with a European Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add that other statements made by Mr Buttiglione are also worthy of our attention, even if, or rather, all the more so, because the Council and the Commission have among their ranks a number of sympathisers with these dangerous ideas. One such idea is to set up camps for migrants and asylum seekers in North Africa, on the subject of which Mr Buttiglione felt the need to clarify that they would not be, and I quote, ‘concentration camps at all, but humanitarian centres’. Thank you for clearing that up. A further example is the bellicose view of the fight against terrorism that Mr Buttiglione has trotted out: our society is afraid, we are at war, we will win. This is the message drummed out by the Commissioner-designate, picking up an old refrain dear to the current incumbent of the White House.</p>
<p class="contents">It is these elements that should influence our decision tomorrow. Never, in the 25 years that I have seen colleges of Commissioners come and go, have I seen such an unloved Commission before it has even taken up its duties. In fact, I firmly believe that, following the failure of the Santer Commission, then the stormy journey taken by the one that succeeded it, following the succession of increasingly bitter disputes between governments and the Commission, between governments themselves, between the Commission and Parliament, following numerous worrying signs of ‘eurofatigue’ among the general public – to use an expression often heard in the new Member States – not least after the elections, which were notable for a record low turnout, and given the fact that the draft Constitution might not be ratified in a few days’ time, I firmly believe that the Barroso syndrome, which will tomorrow lead to an historic defeat or to a Pyrrhic victory, constitutes a new and powerful indicator of the deep crisis of a Europe without vision and without a unifying plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly a root-and-branch review is needed to put some sense back into what could and should be one of the high adventures of our times. Accordingly, my group, in a unanimous decision on the part of its 17 members, will tomorrow vote against the appointment of the Barroso Commission.</p>

The Commission is the government of the European Union and it has the sole right to initiate law – something which the constitutional treaty does nothing to amend. The Commission is the motor of integration. The Commission is the guardian of treaties that are already unacceptable. The Commission is the enemy of the nation-state. That is what it is all about.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter and applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Here in Parliament over the last six weeks, we had a series of hearings where we put the Commissioners-designate through their paces. As a result, as every speaker so far has said, certain committees raised questions on the suitability, or otherwise, of individuals. In fairness, Mr Barroso has responded: he has made changes and has moved some way towards meeting some of those concerns. However, Mr Barroso rightly has not rolled over and died in front of the onslaught that has taken place, over the last week in particular. We need mutual respect between all the institutions of the European Union, and an understanding that power does not rest within one institution alone and that we are interdependent on each other.</p>
<p class="contents">From some of the speeches this morning and our discussions over the last week that if you have experience in business or politics, if you have strongly held beliefs, if you have a strong ideology, if you have a strong opinion, then, according to some, you are not suitable to be a Commissioner of the European Union. And yet what Europe is trying to find at the moment – in order to ensure that the rich tapestry of today's re-united Europe is properly represented within all the institutions – is people who have opinions, people who have visions, people who can best represent the countries that nominate them.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, what seems to be forgotten in this whole discussion and debate is that in July this House gave its endorsement and its confidence to Mr Barroso. That was not done in isolation: President Barroso already had confidence placed in him by the governments of the 25 Member States who put his name forward for that position. Each of the national governments had nominated the people they considered to be the best for the position of Commissioner in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is incumbent on us to play our role within the democratic make-up of the institutions of the European Union, but it is also our responsibility to ensure that we do not allow it to degenerate into domestic political discussions and false accusations with regard to ideology or 'who said what to whom'. Let us become the voices of a new world. Let us represent the peace, the tolerance and the acceptance that the European Union should truly represent. Let us understand and fully bring into being the Europe of diversity in this reunited form. Let us give credit where credit is due: Mr Barroso has moved, he has brought forward new initiatives and new policies. Let us ensure that we can show the same tolerance that we expect of others.</p>

Let us not forget that, amongst other things, Mr Barroso has openly supported US intervention in Iraq. I therefore hold him jointly responsible for the stand that certain European countries have taken alongside the United States, a stand that has caused serious harm and damage to the whole of our continent. To defend our Europe and our interests as Europeans, the Commission and its President should be adopting a very different stand.</p>

Against this backdrop, you managed to give a political answer, safeguarding both the Commission’s character, which is that it has a President in sole charge – a specific political figure – and that of the college. You also managed, therefore, to take advantage of the political reality of the Commission to endeavour to answer at least some of the pertinent criticisms made in this House. You did the right thing. You did the right thing by refusing to commit the cardinal sin of buckling at the outset of a Commission that, for the good of Europe, must be a strong Commission with strong leadership.</p>

You have said yourself, Mr Barroso – and it has already been stated today – that you want to be the President of a strong Commission. There are actually a whole series of Commissioners who have shown themselves to be very strong, including in the hearings, for example those sitting in your immediate vicinity today. And there are many Commissioners who, as you said, have the potential to be very good Commissioners once they have acquired the necessary technical knowledge. Even though many of them hold views on politics and social policy that are not akin to our own, we are convinced that they will make suitable Commissioners, and so we have approved them.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of cases, however – and you have had to defend them today, which is already unfortunate at the start of a new Commission – that are going to cause problems in the Commission in the years to come. Of course there is one Commissioner in particular whom we do not consider fit to head the department that he has been allocated. It is true, as has already been said many times, that Mr Buttiglione has every right to hold these views, which we do not share. But if he holds these views, and if he also, and repeatedly, acts in accordance with them, then he is not fit to hold the portfolio that you have allocated to him. This must be made absolutely clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, the problem is no longer just Mr Buttiglione. By acting or not acting in the way you have, you yourself have made the Buttiglione case into a Barroso case. This is regrettable and it will certainly have a significant bearing on our decision this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">Although you have just made a series of proposals, Mr Barroso, you are still not taking Parliament seriously, as much of what you are selling here is already in the pipeline. You act as though you were responding with something new. But you are not responding, you are simply taking up what already exists. You are selling old wine in new skins. We cannot accept this. We will give it very careful consideration, but I do not believe that we will be able to accept Parliament’s being approached in this way because it is not a true reflection of reality.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, Mr Barroso, your proposal to create a kind of sub-Commission within the Commission is already being mocked by Mr Buttiglione. He is making fun of it and is slandering a fellow nominee Commissioner, Mr Špidla. Is this any way to treat your proposals for the Commission itself? You did not comment on this. I would be glad if you were to do so. What do you think of a member of your Commission slandering another member of the Commission, making false claims about them and mocking your proposals? That is precisely why we cannot derive much comfort from what you have proposed today, President Barroso.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret to say that I wish things could have been different. You have not convinced us. You have not even made a serious attempt to convince us.</p>

These pledges will once again determine how we vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore ask you, Mr Barroso, to take this very seriously. I am pleased that you wish to steer a very definite liberal economic course with your Commission.

Commissioner-designate Buttiglione has reminded us all of the meaning of marriage and the family, and of the role these institutions play in society, a role sanctified by time and by the experience of generations. We fully support everything Mr Buttiglione has said on these issues. His critics assume the moral high ground, and this is wrong. It is actually Mr Buttiglione who holds this moral high ground. Unfortunately, however, we will not be able to give him our support in terms of votes, as we are to vote on the Commission as a whole, and this Commission contains 25 Commissioners. Our support for one of these Commissioners must not be allowed to outweigh our opposition to the remaining 24. The way in which the Commission is appointed is exceptionally undemocratic. As a general rule, those nominated by governments as potential Commissioners have no chance of gaining support from voters in their own countries, and have met with public disapproval precisely as a result of their activities to date. This was certainly how the Polish Commissioner-designate, Mrs Hübner, was chosen, and our opinion of her is a negative one. I am sure the same is true of the Commissioners-designate from the other post-Communist countries. In view of the outgoing Commission’s attitude to Poland, and the unfair conditions upon which we were admitted into the EU, which differed greatly from those granted to the German Democratic Republic, there is every reason for us to have the gravest reservations about the European Commission as an institution. We cannot support it. I apologise to Mr Buttiglione. Our vote against this Commission is not directed at him personally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet although the governments sometimes put forward controversial candidates, it is unfortunately not the governments, but Mr Barroso himself who has to swallow the bitter pill today. I should like to make it clear, however, that we do not object to the vast majority of the members of Mr Barroso’s team. I believe Mr Barroso will honour the promise he made today before this House, namely that he will change the make-up of his Commission during his term of office, if the situation so requires.

<p class="contents">A Constitution is more than just another Treaty and the stage leading up to the adoption of a Constitution is not just another stage. How must politicians behave at a time when we are drawing up a Constitution? We must be in a position to partially put aside our ideological differences and our party differences. What are we going to ask of the European citizens when we ask them to support the European Constitution? That they put aside their ideological differences in order to vote for a constitution for everybody.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to ask supporters of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, socialists, liberals and conservatives to vote together for the Constitution. And how can we ask them to make this effort and to behave in this way if we are emphasising our ideological differences and our parties’ strategies differ more than ever?</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament must be the exemplary institution during this formative period. Parliament is the only institution elected by universal suffrage by all the citizens, and the social environment our societies require demands that we start by creating a political environment which is based on the greatest possible degree of cohesion and unity. We therefore want to act in a manner which is consistent with this political environment which the adoption of the European Constitution is going to require, by supporting Mr Barroso unequivocally.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people believe that a defeat for Mr Barroso will be a victory for the European Parliament. I must tell them that they are wrong: it will be a success for those who do not believe in the European Union.</p>

This is partly due to the very particular way in which Mr Buttiglione has commented on the interpretation of fundamental civil rights in Europe and the wounding remarks he has made about large groups of people. My group is not alone in finding these remarks unacceptable and totally inappropriate for a future Commissioner who has the specific task of defending the fundamental rights of every European citizen. The way in which the next President, Mr Barroso, has so far defended Mr Buttiglione leads us to believe that the opinions held in large parts of this Parliament are of no great concern to him. As you stated this morning, a reshuffle is out of the question.</p>
<p class="contents">What threw into relief the problems surrounding Mr Buttiglione was the open and direct manner in which the European Parliament heard the new Commissioners. Bearing in mind the urgent need for clarity, and without any preconceived ideas, the Members of this House have tested the new Commissioners on their vision of the future and the functioning of the European Union. It is certainly true of my group that the work that has been carried out painstakingly over the past four weeks forms the basis for the ultimate judgment we will be passing about this Commission tomorrow. This is not just about the provocative statements Mr Buttiglione has made. It has become evident to us that a number of other candidate Commissioners do not always display sufficient knowledge and dedication for the roles they may be playing over the next five years. Thanks to the in-depth and serious manner in which Parliament has acquitted itself of its task in the hearings, the failings of a number of candidates have become apparent. I refer to the almost total lack of commitment to Europe on the part of the new Latvian Commissioner, Mrs Udre, and also to the various conflicts of interest that will make it virtually, if not totally, impossible for the Dutch candidate Commissioner, Mrs Kroes, to fulfil her role on a number of important issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The outstanding issues surrounding a few Commissioners and the weak performance of some others are not the only problem. At least equally important is the fact that, during the hearings, only a few of the future Commissioners appeared to have a clear vision of the role of the European Union. As a result, they were hardly capable, if not incapable, of setting clear priorities for the Commission’s coming term of office, or of setting a good example for Europe’s global role. The Social Democrats want the European Union to play a strong role in the world and apply effective multilateralism in order to reinforce peace and democracy. Europe should offer a clear and coherent alternative to counteract the unilateral approach of the United States. It is disappointing that during the hearings, few innovating ideas emerged from the Commission on this score.</p>
<p class="contents">The open and direct way in which the European Parliament has welcomed the future members of the Commission has given rise to great expectations. Over the past four weeks, we have shown the European public that we want a new Commission with competent and honourable governors who also have clear ideas about Europe’s future course. Tomorrow, the European public are expecting from us a clear verdict about the Commission presented by Mr Barroso. Although a number of the candidate Commissioners clearly meet the high requirements prescribed by us, our general verdict about the Commission cannot be positive at the moment, not even after this morning.</p>

This is a case of discrimination on the basis of religious conviction, and that is something of which the European Parliament should not be guilty. What is described as tolerance means tolerating only what progressive Europe wants to hear. Mr Buttiglione has never called for the rights of women and homosexuals to be jeopardised. He has merely given his personal opinion in response to a specific question. That is constitutionally acceptable. However, a conscious attempt has been made to find a stick to beat a dog. It appears that a minister from the Berlusconi Cabinet is unacceptable from the very start. By rousing popular feeling in this manner, the European Parliament wants, indirectly, to have an impact on individual Commissioners. As Dutch Members of the Independence and Democracy Group, we see the present proposal for the composition of the new European Commission as a reason to vote in favour of it.</p>

We have not talked about immigration policies, the fight against terrorism, the reform of the Structural Funds or the reform of the Stability Pact. The stage of our little European theatre has been taken over by a thoroughly ideological and calculated attack on the Commission-designate and in particular on the Commissioner-designate Mr Buttiglione, who is guilty of having personal opinions and religious beliefs. The apologies which the Commissioner-designate did in fact offer were not enough; even the changes which the President-designate did in fact make were not enough: people want to settle a score at all costs. That is unacceptable. Voting down the Commission tomorrow – let us not pretend otherwise – would lead to an institutional crisis that we really do not need right now. Just two days away from the signing of the Constitutional Treaty in Rome, which ought to be a solemn, historic moment, we really cannot allow ourselves a pathetic act of weakness that would be totally out of keeping with the expectations of Europe’s citizens and of the world as a whole.

Mr Buttiglione! It is true that this philosopher has behaved in a rather dubious fashion. He has quoted Kant, Hegel and Carl Schmitt, but, tellingly, he has not quoted Socrates, who, himself, had a somewhat modern sexuality. Clearly, this is a case of discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">When President Borrell, however, contemptuously suggested that Mr Buttiglione should take care of agriculture, what was he trying to say? That because pigs were rarely homosexual, they would not be a source of embarrassment to Mr Buttiglione? When it comes to agriculture, incidentally, I shall not speak about Mrs Fischer, her interests in a sugar multinational, nor her family pig farms businesses that relocated to Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">The composition of your Commission is perhaps more balanced than it might appear. The competition Commissioner, for example, is from a background of unbridled capitalism. She will have her victims but Mr Buttiglione will pray for her. You are therefore inventing the compassionate capitalism Commission. There are contradictions, it is true, but we know from Chairman Mao that a distinction must be made between antagonistic and non-antagonistic contradictions, and you are a Maoist! This is also why Cohn-Bendit says: turn the spotlight on the Barroso Commission!</p>

That is something quite unheard of in other parliaments. The selection, however, was done elsewhere. The coach has put his team together in consultation with the management, in the full knowledge that each member of that management was allowed to designate one player. We do not find all the players equally agreeable; we would have liked to see some more women and, above all, some more players with a jersey in our colour. We, too, though, are bound by rules, and it is not up to us alone. Some players have weaknesses, but all of them have enough experience on the field, have promised fair play and have accepted the authority of the coach and all of them realise that it will be an important match. For those who may not be positioned correctly, additional man cover has been provided, and the coach can change people around at any time and, if necessary, send them off the pitch. With that coach we have already agreed to play, and we are indeed counting on him to turn this team of twenty-four into a cohesive team and to ensure that it will end up in a higher division than last season. That is what the supporters want too; above all, they also want the match to begin at last. A certain degree of drama, but not too much, is always a bonus. What counts is what is on the scoreboard and the points that are awarded during the match. I believe that this team can take office. I have confidence in them, and taking office is, of course, not the same as being given a blank cheque.</p>

In each of those fields, Mr Buttiglione proved problematic. During his hearing before the Civil Liberties Committee, Mr Buttiglione showed that he was completely out of step with what we are constructing in our committee. This was the case not only as regards fundamental rights, but also the right to asylum, the European arrest warrant and judicial assistance in criminal matters. The Civil Liberties Committee could scarcely decide in favour of awarding this portfolio to Mr Buttiglione.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, as guardian of the Treaties you must defend Parliament’s rights. We therefore call on you to take our opinions on board. We feel that it would be unthinkable for you to force this through. The adjustments that you have suggested are unacceptable, not to say humiliating, for the Commissioners concerned. Parliament carries out its duties, all of its duties. We are the representatives of the people and this is not an institutional crisis at all. This is democracy in action.</p>

<p class="contents">It is also obvious that quite a few of those appointed are quite unsuitable for their tasks. During questioning in the committee, Mr Dimas, as a nominated Commissioner, showed that he lacked both the necessary knowledge of environmental policy and a vision of its future. There are similar problems in the energy area. The nominated Agricultural Commissioner is a landed property owner, and the candidate for competition issues has very strong links with large-scale industry. The person who is to protect the rights of women, homosexuals and refugees is opposed to equality, is homophobic and wishes to restrict the right of asylum.

Nevertheless, this year not a single government has bothered, or rather was brave enough, to nominate several candidates. The elected president of the Commission had no opportunity to choose. He could select only from the few options put forward by Member States. Governments made their nominations in many ways: some sent to the Commission those they wanted to get rid of. However, there were wise governments, and fortunately, those that proposed their most talented politicians were in the majority, thus helping along the collective European issue. In the opinion of our group, those who have done particularly well were: Benita Ferrero-Waldner, Dalia Grybauskaite, Charlie McCreevy and those who gave a particularly weak performance were Ingrida Udre, László Kovács or Neelie Kroes.</p>
<p class="contents">It takes someone on the ball to forge a unified team from this motley crew: a European government that is able to halt the Commission’s loss of prestige that has been going on for years. President José Manuel Barroso has proved already as Prime Minister that he is strong and a true leader. I am sure that he will be capable of getting together a good Commission. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will judge the work of the currently forming Commission according to what extent it will be able to create more unity, more cohesion and more competitiveness in the Union: to bring it closer to the citizens, to improve citizens’ standard of living and security, to help the joining up of the new Member States and to promote minority rights. He who seeks to indulge in short-term political personal interest threatens the stability of the Union’s institutions and plunges the big plan of the newly united Europe into crisis. If we were to look at our personal considerations, we would not support more candidates either. However, we are looking at the issues of a common Europe. The stake is high and I hope that the European Parliament will not fail.</p>

Such was the case with Mr Dimas in environment, who refused to see the sword of Damocles above our heads. Climate change and the effects of wastefulness on our planet mean that we must find other ways of thinking than purely productivity-based economics and other ways of governing than pure liberalism. Sustainable ecological development is crucial, whether we like it or not. Inequality is on the rise, nature is being exploited, society is taking backward steps, health care is being ravaged, all the warning signs are on red alert and what your college proposes is to continue along the same inflammatory path.

<p class="contents">For those of us who have been given democratic mandates in democratic elections to campaign against the centralisation and bureaucratisation of the European project and for those of us who have been given democratic mandates to reject the draft Constitution, this Commission is therefore unacceptable.</p>

<p class="contents">I freely admit that I have been shocked by the views expressed by some people in your team during the hearings, and I wonder about the ability of certain others to fulfil their portfolios. This is most regrettable, given that your Commission is intrinsically a good one. More than 85% of your college was favourably received. Some Commissioners-designate are competent and know their portfolios well. Must the functioning of the European Union suffer as a consequence?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, you have unfortunately fallen into the media trap of short sentences. You must take on board today the recommendations made by Parliament following the hearings. Your proposal to create a fundamental rights agency surprises me a little and does not reassure me greatly. The truth is that we create agencies when we do not exactly know how to address a problem. You therefore have a great responsibility and we expect you to make sure that this Commission is strong and that it respects Parliament, that it explains the Constitution, that it implements the Lisbon Strategy, that it pursues reforms leading to greater competitiveness, social cohesion and happiness for our citizens and that it addresses the Turkey issue objectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘yes’ vote that we will give you is not one of blind trust, but one of common sense. If your team responds to these challenges, it will have our trust. Please be aware, however, that, as in any relationship, trust is subject to constant review. I wish you good luck. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But leaving aside that political persuasion, you are committing an institutional error by ignoring the true nature of the European Union’s institutional triangle, just as your predecessors did.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Santer fell because this Parliament had been too complicit, too indulgent for too long with regard to its natural ally, the Commission. Your direct predecessor, Mr Romano Prodi, arrived terrorised by this Parliament and wanted to ignore it for more than a year, until the day when he found himself powerless in the face of the European Council and was obliged once again to rely on the true power of this European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, you want to set up a special dialogue with the Council, but the Council is not there to support you at a time when you are involved in this difficult dialogue with our institution. So you are saying to us: ‘it is too late to change Commissioners or remodel portfolios’. If, however, it is too late, then what real power does this European Parliament have? I hope we will demonstrate it tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, you are making a fundamental mistake, because one of the essential powers of your Commission is the one it will exercise in the field of competition. From this point of view, your candidate is weak and will weaken your Commission’s power as a whole. An example of this is the idea that because a person has been a company director they will be a good Commissioner. Well, Mr President of the Commission, I can tell you that all our experience, at national level and at European level, suggests quite the opposite. The post of Commissioner is a political post for which we need people capable of carrying out their duties with complete independence and with an acute sense of the European dimension and interest, and not any individual interest.</p>

As we are dealing with an area of policy that is very sensitive, namely civil rights, asylum policy, and immigration policy – an area of policy that will become more and more European in years to come, and so you need somebody on board who is the driving force behind that policy. Mr President of the Commission, or rather Mr President-designate of the Commission, you are implying, by the measures you have announced, that you do not have the right man for the job on your team.

Firstly, there is the fact that this Commission is an administrative college which has absolutely no need to be invested and which need answer to nobody other than the political body of the Council. Furthermore, this team seems particularly mediocre, starting with yourself, Mr Barroso, who owe your election to your great skill in playing the waiting game. Furthermore, the composition of your Commission reflects a true deference to the United States, since the more countries have followed the United States, particularly in relation to the Iraq crisis, the better represented they are.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this we have the choice of certain surprising characters: a Commissioner with very close links to multinational interests who is responsible for competition; an Ayatollah of the WTO and free trade who is responsible for commercial relations. It seems to me that Mr Buttiglione is the only one who can rise above the general mediocrity and that begs the question of what he will achieve amongst all these anti-Christians.</p>

This is a further sign that, in terms of the way Europe works in practice, Parliament is often ahead of constitutional developments and it takes time for the Treaties to catch up. That is why, Mr Barroso, the CDU-CSU Group – and I mean all of its 49 Members – want you to take office and want you to work closely with the European Parliament, more closely than is laid down in the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the Socialists want to prevent you from taking office. They are clearly prepared to trigger a full-blown European crisis, even though the Chairman of the Socialist Group has taken the precaution of explaining that it would not be a crisis but a normal parliamentary act. The only problem is that it is so ‘normal’ that it has never happened before in Europe. And why? There is only one reason for this that will stick in the mind of the general public and that is the fact that a candidate for the post of Commissioner dared to express his religious convictions. And, because this is what it is actually all about, I should like, once more, to make our position clear. We are in fact under an obligation to respect the principle of non-discrimination. The state has no right to poke its nose into such matters. Nobody should be discriminated against on the basis of their sexual orientation or their gender, either. That is what is stated in the Charter and in the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">I thought this statement would have been greeted with applause; in any case, I can see heads nodding in agreement, and so I can tell you that what I just said was a quote. I quoted word for word what Mr Buttiglione said in the hearing. And that is what you are arguing about. It is laughable, ladies and gentlemen!</p>

There is one against the President, who unashamedly wishes to do as he pleases with this freely elected Parliament. There is another against Mr Buttiglione, who has drawn public attention and disqualified himself from the post of Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs by making unspeakably discriminatory remarks, and there are many more.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to single out Mrs Udre, the Latvian candidate. She is quoted as saying that the European Union as a whole is superfluous. At the hearing she praised improvements, but that is not enough. This Commissioner of all people, who is to be responsible for customs duties and tax, is not so very particular about money. The financing of her party is shrouded in mystery. There is compelling evidence of dubious relations with the Russian oil industry, which transports a large proportion of its oil to the West via Latvia, greasing many palms on the way.</p>
<p class="contents">What the public expects of us is that we approve members of the Commission only if they are beyond reproach. In this case it is personal integrity that is lacking, and, along with the other question marks, this is a further reason to reject the whole Commission.</p>

Tomorrow’s Europe must take a leading role in international politics, in a fair, mutually supportive and balanced relationship with the United States, as you said yourself in your speech.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Mr Barroso, is why we ask you to commit yourself to obtaining a seat for the European Union on the UN Security Council. We ask you to continue to make the Union play its part for peace in the Mediterranean, its face turned towards the south, towards the African continent. That is where future emergencies will lie; that is where we must seek solutions to problems; that is where we must act to address the urgent immigration question. The Europe that we need to develop within a framework of a balance of powers – between Council, Commission and Parliament – must also, however, be the homeland of rights, respect for people’s individuality, non-discrimination, subsidiarity, transparency and equal opportunities – in short, the homeland of freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">The Barroso Commission is perfectly capable of steering Europe towards these goals and of protecting the interests, rights and freedoms of the people. I agree with your choices, Mr Barroso, just as I also agree with the Italian Government’s choice in appointing Mr Buttiglione as a member of this Commission. He is a European politician who is pro-Europe and who, as the Italian Minister for Community Policies, has demonstrated that he upholds the interests of the Union. I must remind this Chamber that the majority of the Members who listened to Mr Buttiglione in committee came out in favour of him as a candidate Commissioner – a Commissioner who must now and in the future be judged by what he does and not by his religious beliefs. Judging him and the entire Commission on the basis of this one factor would be an anti-European decision, and doing so on the eve of the signing of the Constitution would be not only a grave political mistake but also a serious blow to the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-designate, under my leadership the Italian delegation in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, places its trust in you and your Commission. We are sure that it will be a factor for change in the institutional framework. Good luck, Mr Barroso.</p>

We are paying close attention to your initial actions, and in our opinion these actions are convincing and demonstrate the will of the strong leader we need. We believe that under your Presidency the European Commission should place particular emphasis on three points. These are completing enlargement, standing by the principles of solidarity and cohesion, and developing the EU’s eastern dimension. The first challenge will be to involve the new Member States in all aspects of EU policy. Enlargement of the institutions has now taken place, but a great deal more work and time is needed for the new Member States to achieve full rights and equal treatment. Only then will it be possible to regard enlargement as being complete in the real sense of the word, and not merely in the institutional sense. The second task is to close the economic gap and to ensure social and economic cohesion within the EU, in the name of the principle of solidarity. Your most immediate challenge will be to convince the Council of the need to ensure the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective does provide for a correlation between the EU’s increasing number of tasks and competences and the funds necessary to implement them. ‘You cannot have more Europe for less money’, as you said before this House in July, and we expect you to remain true to these words. The current enlargement is very cheap, but attempts should not be made to make it even cheaper, thus depriving the EU’s poorest countries of the chance to overcome the development gap, a chance that was given to other countries. Your Commission’s goal should be to implement the Prodi Commission’s proposal for a budget based on 1.24% of gross domestic product. We also expect you to keep the promises you made to the House in this regard. The third issue is that of the EU’s eastern dimension and its new neighbourhood policy. We need a policy that is generous but not permissive, and one that is demanding and effective. We hope you will have confidence in us, and we intend to vote in favour of your Commission, including Mr Buttiglione. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fear that this is a further example of your not listening carefully to Parliament, because the letter from the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs also definitely contained critical remarks. Personally, I very much regret the fact that Mr Buttiglione would not, or could not, take the opportunity of a second hearing in the Legal Affairs Committee, but he did clearly emphasise to that committee that his religious views were not in fact simply private views but principles that he wanted to guide his political actions. He would want to assess proposals that ran counter to his personal convictions and proposals from other Commissioners on the basis of his private ideas. Personally I am in no doubt that this goes beyond any definition of what private views are. I should also like to say that I am still waiting for an apology for the attacks on the Commissioner-designate Mr Špidla.</p>

The procedure is fully open and is followed with great interest by the media and the general public. It forces each Commissioner to reflect upon his or her visions and ideas.

I therefore believe that he must be given a chance, and that his authority should not be undermined at the very outset. We should also not allow this House to become an arena for domestic political battles, and instead we should seek a constructive and positive solution, and not allow ourselves to be manoeuvred into a crisis. Mr Barroso will therefore have the support of the Czech delegation in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.</p>
<p class="contents">I should further like to note that Mr Barroso spoke before this House as a guardian of the Treaties and as a guardian of the spirit of the European Treaties, and this is something which I welcome. I should also like to point out that the Treaties state clearly that any amendments to them must be agreed unanimously, and that this also, above all, applies to the European Constitution. It would require only a single state not to ratify this Constitution for it to be nullified. It is therefore unacceptable that various politicians should make statements to the effect that it is immaterial whether one, two or three states do not ratify the Constitution, and that its validity will anyway be unaffected, or even that any state which fails to ratify the Constitution will have to leave the European Union. I hope that the Commission will support clearly the position set out in the existing Treaties, that it will state its opposition to flexible interpretations of the Treaties and to statements such as those mentioned above, that it will signal clearly its preparedness for an alternative scenario in which the European Constitution does not enter into force, and that it will be willing to help find a solution to such a future scenario, not that I would wish to anticipate it.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that the Commission will act as a catalyst for constructive debate on the European Constitution, and that it will play a positive role in this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We do not like the views of a number of the individual Commissioners. It surprises me a little that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has not presented any criticism at all of the nominated Commissioner who has still been unwilling to repudiate the Prague invasion of 1968 and who knew nothing about his own political area.</p>
<p class="contents">We dislike some of the views expressed by individual Commissioners, but we assess the Commission as a whole, and largely in the light of the fact that we also think it only right that the individual countries should be able to nominate their Commissioners if European cooperation is to work. Our task would be a hopeless one as far as European cooperation is concerned if religious views and private moral opinions were to be presented at European level for judgment in this Parliament. Our task would also be a hopeless one if Parliament were to reject the candidates presented by the various countries’ governments.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall therefore support the Commission with President Barroso at its head, partly in view of the fact that there is now a long list of important tasks before us. There is the new Constitutional Treaty. We have to ensure the success of the enlargement that has now taken place and to negotiate successfully with new candidate countries, especially Turkey. The Lisbon process too has to succeed. We do not intend to conduct a discussion that leads to Europe’s failing to make this process succeed.

<p class="contents">The Buttiglione affair, in contrast, is mostly up to you. First, because it did not arise out of prejudice or religious conflict but out of the Commissioner-designate’s own words and actions, which have revealed him to be totally unsuitable. He would also have appeared unsuitable to Jesus Christ and not just to homosexuals and women, since Jesus taught that only he who was without sin could cast the first stone. You are trapped by a diktat from the Italian Government which prevents you from finding a reasonable and dignified political solution. The shadow of a great many conflicts of interests hangs over your Commission. The conflict of interests of a government, however, is not just a shadow but rather a boulder, which is why I do not think that voting against you would be damaging to the Union. You could have avoided the situation but you did not, and so you end up by ripping up your promises of autonomy and independence from the national governments in this same Chamber where you made them, before this same Parliament that you had vowed to respect.</p>

Issues of personal morality are not matters to be legislated for by the Commission, nor for us here; they are for our national governments and private individuals to decide.</p>
<p class="contents">While I have registered serious concerns about what I viewed as the reported lack of tolerance expressed by my former colleague Mr Buttiglione – a PPE-DE colleague for the last five years – in his statements on certain issues such as Baltic minorities, homosexuality and sinning, single mothers and fathers, I agree to support his candidature on balance. I accept his right to his strongly-held orthodox Catholic views. As a Catholic, I do not happen to share some of his very strong fundamental views on that matter, but we can agree to differ. That is what the whole principle of the European project is about.</p>
<p class="contents">I have strong reservations in relation to up to five of the Commissioners, but based on his curriculum vitae and experience, Mr Buttiglione has the ability and aptitude for the job of Commissioner. Could it be, Mr Barroso, that he is the right man in the wrong job? He has said that he will not change his principles or conscience for political convenience, and I would not expect him to do that, but it is going to be impossible for him in his particular portfolio, given the challenges that will be before him.</p>

I therefore regret the difficulty that we are experiencing in appointing the Commission that you are now proposing to us. You think that your strength comes from these strong-arm tactics with Parliament. You are mistaken. The problem is not only tomorrow’s vote. The problem is in ascertaining the political basis that will guide your term in office for the next five years. You think that you only need the Council’s support. You are mistaken. Look at how they have left you to your fate today. Your strength, and that of the Commission, comes from the confidence placed in you by both the Council and Parliament. Without Parliament’s solid support your Commission will always be a weak Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In the next twenty-four hours, do what you have to do to win Parliament’s solid support. If you do not make the most of this opportunity, do not play the victim or dramatise the rejection of the Commission. Please take such a rejection not as a personal defeat but as a clear mandate to obtain from the Council a Commission that is worthy of Parliament’s support. The decision right now is yours, and yours only. You must decide if you want Parliament’s support, or if you want to remain a hostage of national government proposals and, in particular, of those of the Berlusconi government. Please make the right choice, and we will be fine. Thank you.</p>

Firstly, there is surely no doubt about the abilities of the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso. Secondly, in some cases we have got so carried away that we are no longer listening and are no longer capable of reading texts in full. We must therefore recognise that Mr Buttiglione stated that he is in favour of non-discrimination and in favour of compliance with the Charter, and that he draws a distinction between a moral code and a legal code to which I believe we could all subscribe.</p>
<p class="contents">I have further observed in this debate that the lack of technical knowledge that has been noted here in the case of a few Commissioners appears, in many cases, to be completely irrelevant, provided – perhaps – that they are of the right political hue. In any case this issue has been pushed right into the background in today’s debate. This brings me to the conclusion that there are a number of Members for whom this decision is a decision about values: political correctness instead of an attachment to values that stem from a religious conviction. This is, I believe, a statement that it is not proper for us, as a Parliament, to make. It is our job to judge the knowledge that these people have of their subject and not their personal religious beliefs. I believe that this is an important and decisive point that we should keep to the forefront of our minds. That is why I believe that we need to have a bit more tolerance and liberality, rather than being slaves to the same, fashionable opinion.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This is the point that we should keep in mind. And in the light of the fact that the Barroso Commission is actually giving ground to Parliament and doing good work on foreign policy, the Constitution, enlargement – which needs revitalising – the rights of the European Parliament and the Lisbon Process, I would make this appeal to my fellow Members: do not bring it down because of a difference of opinion over someone’s values.</p>

Nowadays, there are fewer questions, there are more disillusioned, embittered statements and these statements are based on experience. There is nothing wrong with what you say, or with what you said today. For you know exactly what needs to be said in this House and with imposing self-assurance you listed the encyclopaedia of European values and fundamental rights. There is, nevertheless, a problem with your decisions, the harmony between words and deeds. When allocating the portfolios you wanted to please Europe’s most conservative elements. So far you have not shown very much of the promised flexibility and tolerance and there is no guarantee that your deputy Commissioner-designate will not turn against the results achieved so far in Europe. We prepared for the birth of the first Commission of the 25 like a celebration. You have one day left to replace the tension and distress with the joy of celebration.

<p class="contents">In order to exercise its competences responsibly, however, this Parliament must be demanding rather than complacent, it cannot resort to haughtiness nor act with the arrogance of a mandarin.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that if the Commission does not satisfy every one of our demands, we cannot simply refuse to invest it and send it out into the street. The Barroso Commission must be judged exclusively on its capacities and its competence, not on the personal, ethical or moral convictions of its members, because if we had followed that criterion, Madam President, we probably would not have been able to vote in favour of the President of the European Parliament. That is what is so great about our kind of tolerance, Madam President.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to the few members of the Liberal Group who are still here that they taught us a lesson in sensitivity and responsibility in July when they voted in favour of the President of the Commission, despite having been left outside the pact which led to the election of a Socialist President for this House.</p>
<p class="contents">There are capable people in Mr Barroso’s Commission, former Members of this Parliament, who must be judged – I would insist – not on the basis of their personal opinions, but on their capacities and competence. I would therefore appeal to the members of the Liberal Group to consider their vote seriously, to reflect carefully and to consider the virtues of voting for this Commission. This is the best way to achieve the positive complicity which the President of the Commission has spoken about and which has led to the progress made by the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the hearings have given rise to serious misgivings as regards the general political direction which the Commission will pursue in that, apart from a few shining exceptions, a strong neo-liberal perception prevailed, without any corresponding convincing social commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">Our misgivings also arose as a result of the hearings on the questions of competition, taxation and agriculture, which require additional clarification and specific political commitments. However, what was decisive in shaping our position was the hearing on the questions of security, justice and civil liberties. The statements made by Mr Buttiglione touched at the very heart of our values for the European society we wish to build, a society we want to be mutually supportive, tolerant and non-discriminatory.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, our position is clear. Unless there is a material change in Mr Buttiglione's portfolio, we shall be obliged to vote against your Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">You referred to the danger of institutional crisis. However, the exercise of the jurisdiction of the European Parliament, a jurisdiction provided for by the Treaty itself, cannot under any circumstances cause a crisis. On the contrary, it is an expression of democratic institutional function. The ball, Mr Barroso, is now in your court. You still have the opportunity, you have the jurisdiction to find an institutional and political solution to the situation which has arisen.</p>

I would like the European Parliament to perform this task with both dignity and credibility. I was happy to vote for the future President of the Commission, not because he is from the beautiful country of Portugal, but because he presented a vision worthy of support. Today he has reinforced that vision with a number of programme elements, with a clear desire for close collaboration with the European Parliament and also with the desire to lead the Commission in the spirit of the European Constitutional Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not interested in discussing today the outcome of the American elections or the fate of Berlusconi, nor should we be going right back to Adam and Eve. We should be concerned with the future of the European Union and the strength of its Commission. It is not our role to make judgements about the personal views of the candidates but to decide on the competence of the proposed Commission. We have more than enough challenges ahead of us for us to be playing little games.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not happy about much of what I have read about the hearings, either on the left or on the right. However, even if I did agree with the criticism, I cannot put the whole Commission at risk for the sake of one single majority vote in one of the committees for one of the candidates. If we adopt the practice of making judgements according to some ideological yardstick fuelled by one or two sentences, or quotes taken entirely out of context, we will have difficulty finding a candidate who would survive, as everyone has, at some time in their life, said something that could easily be the subject of long political debates. I will, of course, support a Commission which will operate in a collegial manner, based on the assurance of its President, and I wish it every success.</p>

This process involves an assessment of whether a candidate country respects human rights and whether it is transparent and free from corruption. I have serious doubts as to whether your Commission will be able to carry out this task well. I therefore feel bound to ask whether a Commissioner who has clearly shown that he does not understand, or does not wish to understand, the European system of human rights of which we are so proud, can be entrusted with carrying out an assessment of the extent to which human rights are respected in Romania, Bulgaria, and maybe even in Turkey. I have a second question to put to you too, Mr Barroso. The formation of your Commission is also a lesson in European democracy, and a lesson that citizens throughout the European Union are observing closely. What kind of a message are you currently sending out to citizens? Why, that the opinion of the European Parliament need not be taken into account. Is this a positive message? Does it bring the European Union closer to its citizens? Is it the right kind of message to send out two days before the European Constitution is signed? Mr Barroso, please listen to what the European Parliament has to say, rather than fighting against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, with regard to the doubts expressed about certain Commissioners, I went into detail at the meeting with the Conference of Presidents. In particular, in relation to the issue of independence in the competition portfolio, we will make public all the opinions of the legal services, which show that we can guarantee the independence of the Commissioner and the Commission on issues of competition. With regard to the accusations about the previous priority activities of one of the members of the Commission, despite what certain Members have requested, I cannot hold enquiries into the pasts of all the Commissioners-designate. It is not possible. I must take an objective view. You are well aware that, in political life, many of us are subject to unfounded accusations. I cannot accept a culture of intolerance, a culture of suspicion, simply because there are rumours or simply because there are attacks in our respective countries. Nevertheless, in the event that there is evidence of unacceptable practices, you may rest assured that I would have the means to act.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the fundamental issue on which I very much wish to express my feelings: the institutional question. Ladies and gentlemen, before becoming Prime Minister, I was leader of the opposition. I am also a parliamentarian, I have a great respect for all genuinely democratic parliaments and a great respect for your Parliament. The debate has shown, however, that, on more difficult issues, particularly on the issue of the portfolio of Mr Buttiglione, there was a division. It is true, it exists: some of you are asking me to replace Mr Buttiglione and others are asking me not to replace him. There has been no common position at your Conference of Presidents, quite the opposite. You have sent me letters from all the committees. On the subject of Mr Buttiglione, I have received two letters: one said that he deserved your support and the other, but for one vote, said that he did not deserve it. In these circumstances, I must find a balance. As far as we are concerned, you have the right to represent all the peoples of Europe, I know this and I respect it. I have the greatest respect for you. The European Union requires a difficult balance, however. The governments also have the right to represent the nation states and I myself, or the Commission once invested, must think of the general European interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell you, in all honesty, that it was precisely by considering the general European interest, not the interest of any particular State or of any particular electorate, that I came to the conclusion that the best solution was, I believe, the one I have proposed to you. I have not given way entirely to those who wanted a shake-up, it is true, but I have gone a long way towards dealing with your concerns and I have given significant guarantees with regard to the substance, fundamental rights, civil liberties and non-discrimination. I believe I have been very clear and I can tell you that my Commission, if you place your trust in it, will be the most advanced Commission in terms of freedoms, civil rights and non-discrimination, as demonstrated by the composition of my Commission.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">To be very frank, ladies and gentlemen, I expected certain criticisms, particularly from those of you who were opposed to my investiture from the outset. I expected ideological criticisms, but the only criticism of my Commission I did not expect was the accusation of a lack of commitment to human rights and non-discrimination. Our attachment to those values can be seen in the very composition of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I must therefore ask for your trust, because I have sought a balance. It is necessary to seek a balance, not just the balance between the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission, but also a balance within this Parliament. Are the honourable Members who are critical of my choice sure that if I were to grant your request, the other side of the House would support the Commission? After all the consultations I have held, particularly with the leaders of the political groups represented here, I am convinced that any other approach could lead to a crisis. That crisis could be resolved, I am sure: in a democracy, all crises can be resolved. I would, however, ask you, ladies and gentlemen, whether it is normal for those amongst you who are most committed to Europe to be able to vote now alongside extremists who do not want Europe, members of the extreme right who are against Europe, people who are completely opposed to the advancement of our European project...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Do you not find it strange that populists, those who wage a constant battle against the credibility of our institutions, can vote against this Commission alongside committed Europeans, as most Members of this House are, I am sure?</p>
<p class="contents">So, ladies and gentlemen, I am committed to respecting the principles of institutional balance. I have made a great effort to deal with your legitimate concerns, but I must tell you, quite responsibly, that European culture is also a culture of tolerance and compromise. It is not a question of demanding everything you want from the other party.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I do not want a show-down with Parliament, because I am well aware that you represent the peoples of Europe, but what I can tell you is that we must move forward and meet each other halfway in terms of our concerns. That is what we must do. Some people were against the Commission from the outset and now they have found an opportunity to gain more support. I would, however, say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that if this Commission does not receive the necessary support, I honestly believe it would be difficult to talk of victory for the one side or defeat for the other. It would be a bad moment for the whole of Europe. I do not believe we would be able to commit ourselves truly to what we need to do in terms of the harmonisation of the Lisbon strategy, the debate on the financial perspectives, the cohesion of our Union, making a great success of this enlargement, putting ourselves on an equal footing with the United States or holding a debate with Russia at the summit planned for November. I believe that would be bad for Europe. I have therefore fulfilled my responsibility and I believe that everybody should now fulfil theirs. I can tell you in all honesty, however, that you can count on me to work with you, in a spirit of compromise. I appeal to you to show the same spirit of compromise for the good of Europe.</p>
