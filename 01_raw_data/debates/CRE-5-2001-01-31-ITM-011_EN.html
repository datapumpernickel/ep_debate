<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ferri (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Wieland, this resolution of mine may not be as sexy as it could be, for justice is usually naked, or at least, attempts are made to strip it of its effectiveness. In reality, I see this motion for a resolution as being quite an effective, substantial initial step in that it is practical.<span class="bold"> </span>In any case, I would like to start by making the point that the Member States, often out of a misconstrued sense of power, attempt to block what can appear to be a renunciation of sovereignty, particularly in the field of criminal justice. Therefore, combining Community sovereignty and the sovereignty of the Member States in this area is not easy.</p>
<p class="contents">The mechanism for mutual evaluation by the Member States set forth in the 1997 Amsterdam Joint Action Plan, which – albeit somewhat behind schedule – has become operative, allows us to carry out the first stage. The first five countries have been selected: Denmark, Ireland, Greece, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, and a Committee of three experts has been set up. The group evaluating a country may not contain members who are nationals of that country and so the action is, so to speak, quite unrestricted.</p>
<p class="contents">These initial assessments have revealed, first and foremost, that there is often a lot of political involvement in legal matters, particularly as regards requests for judicial cooperation on urgent measures, confiscation of property and searches, and this takes different forms, either involving the Ministry of Justice or different judicial authorities from that requesting assistance, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, certain positive elements have also been noted, such as a computer system from the Netherlands known as KRIS, which has been used as a model. We are, of course, fighting extremely sophisticated organised criminal networks which use advanced technology. Methods change and so we also have to learn to deal with crime in different ways.</p>
<p class="contents">The reports from Italy, Belgium, Spain and Finland are also ready, but as yet unofficially. However, we hope that there will be a monitoring system for the evaluation mechanism, to be the responsibility, in the long run, of the Court of Justice. Parliament has advocated this on several occasions too.</p>
<p class="contents">In actual fact, in this regard, it is most important to stress that a number of approximation rules need to be proposed. I refer, for example, to dual criminality, which often holds up the ordinary, quicker passage of justice; I refer to the situation where a crime has been committed which is not a crime in the other Member States. For example, Luxembourg once refused to comply with the requests made by the judicial authority of another country because the act was not a crime under Luxemburgish law. There are therefore various impediments, and if we do not succeed in eliminating them, judicial cooperation will, in effect, be nothing but a word.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in order to make it effective, another resolution has already been prepared on the mutual recognition of final decisions. I have referred to it in this motion for a resolution as well in order to provide a mosaic, a complete raft of actions intended precisely to make this judicial cooperation more effective. We all realise the urgent need for an electronic register, a centralised documentation instrument recording at least the final decisions, at least within the Community framework. Clearly, it would be extremely useful to be able to quickly have the confirmation of final rulings against defendants or criminals who have already been convicted, at a wider level within Europe, but computerisation would already be a good basis – not necessarily on a huge scale – since information technology should now make it possible for us to achieve significant results quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution calls for relatively rapid intervention by Eurojust – we have verified it on several occasions – and particularly by the so-called European Public Prosecutor who, at least on matters of serious crime – organised crime, telematic crime, white collar crime, Mafia crime, etc. – can effectively take the lead. We therefore call for cooperation from the judicial authorities, public prosecutors and judges of the different Member States as well, which will then become part of the European Public Prosecutor as support at the level of the different States.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, it is a proposal supporting the European Judicial Network and what is known as ‘good practice’. I would stress this because, when all is said and done, common sense and good practice in applying the various procedures calls, first and foremost, for the direct transmission of requests between judicial authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following what was agreed in Tampere, it is crucial that we harmonise national legislation on criminal offences and the applicable sanctions in the field of organised crime. In other words, it is essential that we focus our efforts on adopting common definitions, incriminations and sanctions with regard to the approximation of legislation in criminal matters.</p>
<p class="contents">This evaluation mechanism, which Mr Ferri has just mentioned and which forms the basis of the excellent report that he presented to the Committee on Citizens’ Freedom and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, was instituted on the basis of the action plan against organised crime approved in Amsterdam in June 1997. This can already be considered, <span class="italic">per se</span>, as a significant step forward, reinforced by the establishment of the European Judicial Network and other initiatives to modernise and increase the effectiveness of systems to prevent and combat crime. </p>
<p class="contents">Under this evaluation system, although it is envisaged that the Council will adopt the necessary measures after one complete round of evaluations – in other words, three years, with five countries being evaluated per year – we should welcome the decisions taken by some Member States to determine in advance the reforms and improvements considered to be most urgent within their own legal systems, bearing in mind the results of these evaluations. We are all keen to have the results of the evaluations of the remaining countries, one of which is my own country, Portugal, conveyed to us quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that the matter that has been chosen for the first round of evaluations is that of delays in the operation of the system for mutual legal assistance and in the treatment of urgent requests for the confiscation of property, with particular regard to procedures used in cases of organised crime. The emphasis on the problem of delays is particularly positive. Indeed, we are concerned to see an increase in overall delays in trials and we are fully aware of how damaging this is. Justice which is delayed or which comes too late is, ultimately, always a negation of Justice itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I thank Mr Ferri for his work. In the EU there are 15 different penal codes, a large number of police forces, some of them competing with each other, and 15 legal systems, all deeply marked by their own mentality, tradition and culture. Until the EU’s criminal law systems are harmonised – something which is to be desired – judicial cooperation will continue to operate through a complex and antiquated system of requests for legal assistance, an emotive term for almost all public prosecutors and judges.</p>
<p class="contents">But European cooperation is more urgent than ever. For example, 77% of all cases of organised crime in Germany in 1998 had an international connection. There is a great need for the Council to act. In Luxembourg, for example, the Minister of Justice must give his personal authorisation whenever the banking sector is involved. The Netherlands use their own classification of urgency instead of adopting the urgency of the requesting State. The five countries have insufficient staff and inadequate technical and financial resources for dealing with requests for legal assistance. On the positive side, we can mention the Netherlands’ KRIS programme, the Irish system and Denmark’s experience with the Nordic countries. Where contact points exist within the Judicial Network, there is good experience and results, but the network has no influence over formal requests for legal assistance. The creation of contact points alone is still no guarantee of the qualitative leap needed in European cooperation. At some contact points, the willingness to make regular exchanges also left much to be desired.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Council is serious about successfully fighting cross-border crime, which simply disregards democracy and the rules of the legal economy, the recommendations of the rapporteur and the committee must be translated into action. I do not want to go over the details of what Mr Ferri has already said, but it does mean that the candidate countries need to be fully involved in the strategy for fighting organised crime at an early stage. The Judicial Network must be further expanded, for example with internet pages about the various legal systems, with videoconferencing facilities and, finally, Eurojust should become a meaningful adjunct to EUROPOL and OLAF. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has brought some logic and sense to it but while giving praise, I have some criticisms and some points that I cannot agree with. On any of these issues we must be very careful that we do not come out in a rush of Christian frenzy, thinking that we are going to solve all of the problems of all of the crime in the European Union simply by setting up another institution or another office with more staff, and coordinating and harmonising more power into a central authority.</p>
<p class="contents">There are already examples of where cooperation and coordination work. We have Europol, and other institutions like this, where different agencies in different Member States working together can achieve results. We also have the opportunity to assess other Member States and take the best practices from them and use those as a common minimum standard for all Member States. However, we still have differences of law within the Member States. We still have different legal systems, for instance. In Ireland and Britain we still work under the old common law system whereas on the mainland of Europe you have the civil law system. It is very difficult, perhaps impossible, to marry these two together, so we must always work on the basis of three tenets of how things should operate.</p>
<p class="contents">Number one: effectiveness, number two: speed, and number three: justice; and we must not forget the word ‘justice’. People should have the right to defend themselves when they are accused or allegations made against them. Perhaps it is only a problem of interpretation, but some of the suggestions for the fast-track approach seem to be saying we have to cut through some of the present legal impediments for instance with regard to the right of appeal.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly happy that Ireland gets honourable mention because of the Criminal Assets Bureau. I would encourage each and every Member of this House and every Member State to look at how the Criminal Assets Bureau operates in Ireland and how successful it has been since its establishment.</p>
<p class="contents">One proposal which I oppose – and we have asked for a separate vote – is on the question of a European Public Prosecutor’s Office. I am totally opposed to a European Public Prosecutor’s Office with its powers extending over the territory of all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, sanctioning Member States is a very dangerous area. We already have experience of how it can go wrong and how difficult it is to reverse. It is better to rely on cooperation; the carrot works a lot better than the stick. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would like to congratulate Mr Ferri on the excellent report he has presented, which contains a very astute and clear-sighted analysis of the problems we face in the field of judicial cooperation and presents an ambitious and exacting vision of the efforts required to overcome these problems. The Commission broadly supports the analysis and the vision laid out by the rapporteur. We agree, in particular, with the approach that consists of stating that improving judicial cooperation – or even, to use Mr Ferri’s words, “a radically new joint effort” – must never be seen as a weakening of the sovereignty of the Member States. Instead, this should be seen as a tool, and perhaps the most important tool, for making this sovereignty effective in the face of the sophistication and power of organised crime, which today poses an extremely serious threat to the structures of democratic government, to the very functioning of the rules of the legitimate economy and to respect for citizens’ rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We are clearly on the way to achieving this, but it must be emphasised that this progress has been made not as a result of regulatory instruments – because many of these instruments are no longer in force: for example, the conventions have not been systematically ratified by the Member States – but mainly because, in the meantime, practical mechanisms have been created, such as, for example, the mechanism for mutual evaluation. This has given tangible proof of the need to find a new model and, in certain cases, has already led to Member States introducing the necessary amendments to their own legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">This process of professionals in the field exchanging information, whether it is carried out in the framework of mutual evaluation, in contacts within the judicial network or, quite soon, I hope, in the framework of cooperation within Eurojust, is crucial and must be pursued. Parliament is now being consulted on the renewal of the Grotius programme, which is an important tool for enhancing cooperation between legal professionals and similarly, on the project of creating a European network for judicial training, which will facilitate the development of closer cooperation links between magistrates’ colleges in the various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the suggestions and requests made by the rapporteur, I wish to highlight just three aspects: firstly, Mr Ferri referred to the need to amend Article 35 of the Treaty on European Union so that the Court of Justice of the European Communities is given the power to decide whether the Member States comply with their obligations. This loophole in judicial control is, in my opinion, linked to the nature of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union itself, which remains heavily impregnated with an intergovernmental spirit. I wish to emphasise that it would perhaps be more productive, at the appropriate time, to call for a more categorical and complete arrangement, either using the working method or the institutional framework method of the ‘third pillar’, according to the Community method, which would thus ensure greater control by the Court of Justice, as well as decision-making processes that involve greater participation by the European Parliament itself. I do, nevertheless, harbour some doubts as to the prospect of being able to adopt measures for punishing Member States that do not comply with their obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the measures recommended by the draft resolution is the creation of a European Public Prosecutor's Office, with jurisdiction over the whole Union. As Parliament knows, at the last Intergovernmental Conference, the Commission proposed that the Treaty should provide for an independent European Public Prosecutor, but with the specific and sole aim of safeguarding the Community’s financial interests. This proposal was not accepted in Nice and the Commission will certainly take this decision by the Council into account, having already moved ahead with improving the arrangements and means necessary for OLAF to be able to fulfil its duties. By the same token, we hope that the creation of the Eurojust network will also be something that contributes to this aim, which was not achieved in Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the issue of extradition, I wish to assure Mr Ferri that I share the concerns expressed in his report with regard to the simplification and acceleration of extradition procedures, which are, in fact, the theme of the third stage of mutual evaluation. This is why the Commission has included a specific initiative on the adoption of fast-track arrangements for extradition in its programme for 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to close, Mr President, by stating that I share the concern expressed by the rapporteur that, in this field, all legislative initiatives must be implemented with respect for individual rights and fundamental freedoms and that this respect for citizens’ rights and freedoms is inextricably linked to the fight against organised crime. At a time when the Union has proclaimed the Charter of Fundamental Rights, it is our duty to seek to act in such a way that the progress made in the field of judicial cooperation, the mutual recognition of judgments, the coordination of crime-fighting activities by the police and the courts and the simplification of extradition procedures accord with the principles that we advocate and that they are not achieved at the expense of the rights of individuals. The construction of an area of freedom, security and justice cannot by achieved by using the lowest common denominator where respect for citizens’ rights and freedoms is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
