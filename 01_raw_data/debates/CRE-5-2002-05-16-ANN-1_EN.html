In addition, he recognised the occupied territories as a political entity in pointing out that the northern part of Cyprus had not negotiated at all with the Union and therefore did not fulfil the criteria for accession.</p>
<p>Are Mr Solana's statements an expression of the Council's own position? Are they contrary or not to the decision taken at Helsinki, which refers to the 'accession of Cyprus' and not a part thereof, and to international law, the resolutions of the UN and the Member States, which recognise a single government only in Cyprus and, therefore, a single interlocutor?

<p>On 15 April 2002, the General Affairs Council deferred further decisions on additional targeted measures against the Government of Zimbabwe until May although the domestic situation has been increasingly deteriorating since the March elections. In the meantime, countries such as the US and New Zealand have extended their lists. What is the Council's interim assessment of sanctions to date? How many visa applications have been rejected by the embassies of the 15 Member States? Given the exceptional events taking place, have the same criteria been applied by the 15 Member States? On what grounds are certain Member States preventing or delaying the extension of targeted sanctions? Are those Member States afraid that identical criteria could be applied in their spheres of influence in Africa and that, as a result, they themselves could come under political pressure to account for their actions? Is the Council prepared, at its May meeting, to extend the present list of 20 persons in line with what individual EU states and other states are doing in practice and on the basis of Parliament proposals?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council confirms that on 15 April it decided to defer consideration of additional targeted measures against the Government of Zimbabwe until its meeting in May. This discussion, when it takes place, will of course also imply an interim assessment of the sanctions.</p>
<p>The issuance of visas is the responsability of the Member States. The Council does not dispose of any information concerning the number of visas issued. It has no reasons to believe that Member States do not apply the same criteria to the restrictive measures. The Council is not aware of any Member Sates preventing or delaying a possible extension of the targeted sanctions either.</p>
<p>The European Council in Barcelona on 15-16 March decided to dispatch a high level troika in the future to confer with countries in the SADC region about the EU’s concerns regarding Zimbabwe. When the Council in April decide to defer its discussion till May, it was under the assumption that the troika would have taken place before the 13 May. The troika will be finally be carried out from 20 to 22 May leaded by the Spanish Secretary of State of Foreign Affairs. Therefore, the Council will not be able to discuss the question of Zimbabwe at its meeting in May.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0323"></a>

The Council will use the present opportunity to stress the crucial role played by the author of the question as chief observer for the EU's observation mission to the elections. It will also pay tribute on this occasion to the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), and to the people of East Timor, who have now realised the dream of independence for their nation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0336"></a>

<p>The Council is aware of the sensitive nature and human interest involved in this issue, which has already been addressed several times in this forum. Indeed, when this issue was last discussed, in April, the Presidency made it clear that the European Union continues to monitor the situation and to address the issue in the context of the bodies created within the framework of the Europe Agreement, most recently at the EU-Romania Association Council on 12 March 2002, as well as in bilateral contacts with the Romanian authorities. Furthermore, the Presidency undertook to take further action in this area, should this prove to be necessary.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Presidency recalled that, in the revised Accession Partnership for Romania that was adopted by the Council on 28 January 2002, the priorities and intermediate objectives included the stipulation that Romania should "maintain the moratorium on international adoption in place until new legislation compatible with the best interests of the child and Romania's international obligations is adopted and the administrative capacity to implement the new legislation is ensured". Whilst maintaining the general moratorium, in December 2001 the Romanian Government took measures to enable the completion of adoption procedures for those cases that were already subject to court procedures when international adoptions were suspended. In addition, procedures exist to process pending cases that can be judged as exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p>As for the most recent developments, in April an independent working group presented a report on inter-country adoptions to the Romanian Government. Prime Minister Nastase has welcomed the report as a basis for future policy on international adoptions and provided an assurance that the current moratorium will not be lifted until there is adequate administrative capacity in place to implement revised legislation. He has indicated that the package of laws proposed by the independent working group will be adopted by the end of 2002 and that, in the meantime, steps will be taken to improve administrative capacity in order to implement this legislation. These appear to be positive developments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0345"></a>

<p>The EU is consistently seeking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the targets agreed at Kyoto. One important means of doing so is the introduction of emissions trading in the EU. An essential element in emissions trading is that it takes the place of energy taxation so as to avoid imposing a double burden on operators. Thus ‘bad’ businesses will be compelled to transfer revenue to ‘good’ ones. However, there will be a corresponding decline in the taxes and levies which businesses have previously paid to the state, and this could significantly affect two other aspects of sustainable development, namely the social and economic. These adverse side-effects make emissions trading significantly different from environmental taxation, for example, on which it has not yet been possible to reach a decision within the EU despite the fact that it could be an equally effective way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>Respect for human rights, including the rights of the child, is a key element of the political accession criteria laid down by the European Council at Copenhagen in 1993. The Commission provides a comprehensive assessment of progress made by each of the candidate countries in implementing the Copenhagen criteria in its Regular Reports. In this framework, the Commission draws on all available sources of information, including the reports of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child or other competent bodies as well as Non Governmental Organisations, to examine progress made by candidate countries in this area.</p>
<p>The Commission gives high importance to projects that aim at improving the situation of children in the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe. In the years 1997-2001 about EUR 70 million have been provided for this purpose, on average EUR 14 million per year. Actions financed through the Phare national programmes aim inter alia at the reform of childcare and education. In some cases projects target specifically children from disadvantaged groups such as the Roma. Moreover, the Commission has funded and continues funding through its Delegations in the candidate countries a great variety of small projects in favour of children under the Lien, Democracy, Access and Small Projects Programme as well as the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.</p>
<p>In Turkey, the Commission contributes inter alia EUR 100 million over five years to a Reform Programme for Basic Education.</p>
<p>The Commission follows a standard external aid classification of sectors of intervention in its reporting on the Phare programme. Projects in favour of children fall under several generic sectors, the main ones being “Education, training and research”, “Social development and employment” and “Civil society and democratisation”. In order to provide specific information on projects for children, an ad-hoc research through our Delegations in the candidate countries is necessary which has been undertaken for the answer to this question. Due to these methodological difficulties the Commission did not systematically report on children’s projects. It will further elaborate on this issue in order to include an ad hoc section on children in the 2001 Phare report.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In its report on the financial perspective for enlargement, the Commission indicated that support for the closure of the Ignalina power station would be required for decades to come. On the other hand, the Council is not prepared to make any commitment beyond the end of the current financial framework in 2006. The Lithuanians are reluctant to commit themselves to closing the second reactor without a clear indication of future support.</p>

<p>The Union's position on the closure of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant should first be recalled.</p>
<p>Concerning the closure of the plant, the Union requires a clear and binding confirmation of Lithuania's commitment regarding the final closure of Unit 1 before 2005 and a clear and binding commitment by Lithuania to close Unit 2 by 2009 at the latest.</p>
<p>Regarding external financial assistance for the closure and decommissioning, the Commission would like to recall the substantial Union assistance already provided, notably through Phare. Furthermore, the Union has expressed its readiness to explore with Lithuania further financial support. Moreover, the Commission has been very much encouraged by the Member States, which generally have welcomed the proposals in this regard presented in the Commission's paper on the Common Financial Framework in January 2002. The Commission indeed considers that the decommissioning of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant is an extra-ordinary burden for Lithuania in view of the plant’s economic importance relative to the country’s size and that this situation renders necessary additional support, which - as indicated by the Honourable Member - should continue for the next decades.</p>
<p>In general one should however notably underline that nuclear reactors of the RBMK type<a href="#defann_11_1" name="refann_11_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, including the two reactors of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), suffer from fundamental design failures, so that - despite any short-term safety improvements - they cannot realistically be upgraded to an internationally acceptable high safety level. The Commission recalls that the decision to build up such an NPP in Lithuania was made under particular historical circumstances.</p>
<p>The Commission is furthermore encouraged by the ongoing work in Lithuania to prepare the necessary decisions. The highest political level, including the President, the Government and the Parliament, are all engaged in this very difficult but important process.</p>
<p>Lithuania is fully aware that the accession negotiations are based on the present acquis including the limits set by the current financial perspectives.</p>
<p>On the basis of the above, the Commission is confident that all parties involved will find in time an adequate and well-balanced solution, based on Community Solidarity and mutual trust. The fact that the European Parliament as budgetary authority continues to attach high importance to this matter only increases confidence in this regard.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission follows cases of human rights violations and torture in Turkey very closely, and shares the Honourable Member’s concerns regarding the conditions of detention and in particular the treatment of female prisoners. The Commission is aware of the reports produced by the various human rights organisations, including Amnesty International, and is in regular contact with both Non-Governmental Organisations and the Turkish authorities on these issues.</p>
<p>The Commission has been directly informed of cases of sexual abuse of women detainees and prisoners over the past years. As many women are afraid to report such abuse, however, it is estimated that the true numbers are in fact higher than the figures documented.</p>
<p>Several cases against the perpetrators of such human rights abuses have been brought to court. At present there are 52 cases at the relevant courts in Turkey, and 25 court cases at the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that such cases do not contribute positively to Turkey’s preparation for accession to the Union. The improvement of detention conditions and the prevention of torture in Turkey are amongst the short- and medium-term priorities of the Union’s Accession Partnership with Turkey.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to discuss these issues with the Turkish authorities.</p>
<p>The Commission has reported in detail on Turkey’s compliance with the Copenhagen criteria for accession in its regular report of November 2001.

<p>Significant pan-European federations exist which represent particular industries and do vital work to disseminate among their members best practice and know-how in their field as well as ethical traditions relating to it. This is very important in the context of enlargement, as industries in Eastern European countries seek to establish a new business ethos and to bring their know-how better into line with that of their counterparts in the EU countries. At the same time they have an important part to play in implementing the acquis communautaire in their fields.</p>
<p>However, some industries are primarily made up of SMEs, whose European organisations lack funding, although they are important from the point of view of the wide range of know-how which they possess. For example, the organisation representing the locks industry can promote awareness of the importance of security in society at large.</p>
<p>So far, businesses in the applicant countries have only limited resources for participating in the work of such organisations, although links with them are essential. Similarly, organisations representing SMEs have only limited opportunities to foster the participation of their new members.</p>
<p>Is the EU supporting the work of such small organisations representing industries in order to facilitate the participation of businesses from applicant countries?

<p>The Union has supported and intends to continue to support the work of organisations representing businesses in the candidate countries through the Phare Business Support Programme.</p>
<p>The Business Support Programme is a multi-beneficiary Phare programme supporting the corporate restructuring and acquaintance with the acquis of industrial business representative associations in the candidate countries. It relies on typical institution building activities such as training, internships and placement actions delivered by sister business associations in the Union.</p>
<p>The existing Business Support Programme (BSP)–Phase 1 (EUR 20.9 million) has focused on assisting business representative organisations (BRO) in the Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) in strengthening and acquainting them with the acquis.</p>
<p>A new decision on a Business Support Programme-Phase 2 (EUR 15 million) was adopted by the Commission for both horizontal and sectoral CEECs associations and a call for proposal is due to be published soon.</p>
<p>The BSP Phase 2 will focus on the following objectives: full familiarisation of target business representative organisations with the relevant acquis and its implications vis-à-vis their company members; the strengthening of target business representative organisations in the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>As regards Union small business organisations, the Commission is committed to ensuring an on-going dialogue with them. Addressing the specific concerns of small enterprises and taking their views into account is one of the key recommendations of the European Charter for Small Enterprises.</p>
<p>In this context, in December 2001 the Commission appointed an "SME envoy" to make sure the Commission listens carefully to small business’ needs, and to give them a single access point to the Commission’s services.

<p>As the honourable Member has stated, Article 49 of the Treaty on the European Union states that: ‘Any European State which respects the principles set out in Article 6(1) may apply to become a member of the Union’. Attention is drawn to the use of the present tense (‘respects’). The Member States and the institutions of the EU (including Parliament and the Commission) must thus assess candidates for accession by reference to their present performance in the areas of human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. Judgments in respect of past events are excluded.</p>
<p>At the same time, though, all legal instruments which actually form part of a candidate country's legal system at the time of that country's accession and are capable of giving rise to new legal consequences after that date, are, without exception, examined to ascertain their compatibility with EU law.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that the Czechoslovak Exemption from Penalties Act of 1946 is one of the most controversial of the Czechoslovakian presidential decrees and other legal instruments enacted after the end of the Second World War. These legal instruments have recently been the subject of intensive discussion. The Commission has endeavoured to intervene in this debate in order to clarify matters. Its objective was not to evade legitimate questions but to ensure that discussion could be carried on calmly and objectively. On 11 April 2002, the Commissioner responsible for enlargement made, jointly with Mr Zeman, the Czech Prime Minister, a statement to the press on this subject. This statement referred, inter alia, to the fact that certain aspects of some laws enacted by Czechoslovakia in the post-war period were in need of clarification. The work being done on this at present enjoys full Czech support. The law referred to in the question is one of those under examination, a process which has not yet been completed. The Commission is therefore unable to give a final assessment today, but wishes to draw attention to a passage in the German-Czech declaration of 1997, in which the Czechs express regret for excesses in connection with the expulsion of the Sudeten Germans and furthermore regret the fact that Law No 115 of 8 May 1946 made it possible to regard these excesses as not being illegal, and that, in consequence of this, these acts were not punished.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0269"></a>

<p>No clear decision has yet been taken concerning the high-speed rail links for Galicia, as regards the routes, the speeds to apply on the different lines, or the construction timetables. The result is a controversy in the region involving economic and social interest groups and even municipal authorities: while mutually exclusive alternatives are being proposed, the regional authorities, the Spanish central government and the EU institutions are being called on to take a clear stand. The Madrid authorities have apparently decided to define 'high-speed' as 300 kph in one case only (the line between Ourense [Orense] and Santiago). The proposed speeds are much lower for the line connecting A Coruña [La Coruña] and Ourense and for the Ourense-Vigo line. These lines, however, are essential for internal communications within Galicia and for the link with Portugal. In view of this, the demand is now being heard in socio-economic and political milieux in southern Galicia for a high-speed line to cover the route Ourense-Vigo-Santiago-A Coruña: this line would connect with central Spain from Ourense, and with Portugal from Vigo. The failure of the authorities of the Spanish state and the European institutions to reach a position is generating conflicts which are dividing Galician society and may have the effect of delaying the construction of the high-speed lines even further. Can the Commission provide information on the state of play concerning decisions which will affect the rail links between Galicia and both Portugal and the European heartland (via central Spain), with respect to the proposed routes, the speeds to apply on each of the lines mentioned, and the construction timetables?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Implementation of the Habitats Directive to the marine environment is being more difficult than expected and it has become evident that both preventive actions and monitoring may need to be supplemented by additional legislation. As by-catch problems need to be addressed through fisheries management measures, it will be more appropriate to use the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) as the legal framework. This will ensure, in particular, the effectiveness of managerial action.</p>
<p>In its proposals for the reform of the CFP, and in particular in the context of environmental integration, the Commission intends to reinforce both the legal basis and the panoply of managerial instruments so that additional monitoring and mitigation measures are put in place. Moreover, the Commission intends to present concrete proposals addressing the problem of cetacean by-catch before the end of 2002 on the basis of the most recent scientific and technical information, expected to become available shortly.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has indeed studied these new proposals and wishes to provide the following analysis in response to the honourable Member’s question.</p>
<p>As regards family reunification, these proposals are directed at third-country nationals resident in Denmark and do not affect EU citizens who reside there, who enjoy the protection of Community law on free movement of people. On the other hand, Danes whose family members are third-country nationals and who have not availed themselves of their right to free movement of people, are not covered by the provisions on the free movement of people. Their position is therefore a matter for national legislation on immigration.</p>
<p>Even though immigration policy has been one of the new Community powers since the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force (Treaty establishing the European Community, Article 63), Denmark, by virtue of the protocol appended to the Treaty, does not take part in the common immigration policy. Nor will it be obliged to apply, once it has been adopted by the Council, the directive on family reunification proposed by the Commission in 1999, in respect of which it submitted, on 2 May, an amended proposal as invited by the Laeken European Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0283"></a>

<p>As far as the possible contribution that nuclear energy can make to combating climate change is concerned, the Commission has set out its position in the Green Paper on the security of energy supply<a href="#defann_24_1" name="refann_24_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Green Paper noted in a general way that “Concerns about global warming have changed the perception of energy supply constraints” and that this was “particularly pertinent for nuclear energy" as its use for electricity generation makes it possible to avoid emissions of greenhouse gases that result from burning fossil fuels. The Green Paper states that nuclear energy saves around 300 million tones of CO2 emissions per year. This is equivalent to taking 75 million cars off the EU roads.</p>
<p>However, this is entirely without prejudice to the sovereign decisions of the countries that have decided to phase out nuclear power plants or put a moratorium on investment in this sector. The present phase-outs do not affect the Community’s ability to fulfil Kyoto objectives by 2012, as long as they take effect after that date.</p>
<p>With the current state of the art, giving up nuclear energy would mean that 35% of electricity produced would have to come from conventional energy sources and renewables.</p>
<p>Finally, the above-mentioned figures concerning the saving of greenhouse gas emissions by nuclear energy in the EU should also be seen in the context of the potential of a broad variety of other measures to reduce emissions. Under its European Climate Change Programme (ECCP) the Commission has identified a set of measures that can potentially cut emission by some 122 to 178 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent<a href="#defann_24_2" name="refann_24_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The suppression of illegal activities involving radioactive materials is a matter for the Member States and is therefore implemented, if required, on the basis of national criminal law.</p>
<p>Although there is no Community directive relating to penalties for possible illegal activities involving the use of radioactive materials, Community rules provide a regulatory framework for action to prevent it. Thus, the Council Directive 96/29<a href="#defann_25_1" name="refann_25_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> requires Member States to set up a system of advance authorisation or declaration in respect of their use, prohibiting those activities regarded as unjustified from the point of view of health and safety, and to use appropriate inspection systems to monitor adherence to standards of protection against radiation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission has recently adopted a proposal for a directive on the control of high activity sealed radioactive sources, which will, in due course, make it possible to increase the competent national authorities' control over high-risk sealed radioactive sources, and to reinforce the responsibilities of the holders of such sources. In particular, the proposal for a directive provides for the adoption by the Member States of effective, proportionate and deterrent sanctions.</p>
<p>On 15 March 2001<a href="#defann_25_2" name="refann_25_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the Commission presented a proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment by criminal law, which provides for the imposition, at national level, of effective, proportionate and deterrent sanctions for environmental crime, if need be under criminal law, in all the Member States. This proposal for a directive passed through its first reading in Parliament on 9 April 2002. Due to its being based on Article 175(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Communities, this proposal does not apply to illegal activities involving radioactive materials, but the Commission does not rule out consideration of when it might be appropriate to make a proposal on the basis of the Treaty establishing the Atomic Energy Community (Euratom treaty).</p>
<p>Finally, the manufacture, possession, acquisition, transport, supply or utilisation of nuclear weapons for terrorist purposes were made criminal offences by the Council draft framework resolution on counter-terrorism, which was the subject of a political agreement dated 6 December 2001, based on the Commission proposal of 19 September 2001<a href="#defann_25_3" name="refann_25_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Such a gradual introduction is necessary to ensure a smooth integration of the new Member States into the Common Agricultural Policy and to allow for restructuring of their agricultural sector. The duration of this transition period should reflect the need to maintain during a significant period after accession sufficient incentives for restructuring. Such a restructuring operation will need to increase the competitiveness of farms and the processing sector, create alternative jobs off-farm and bring semi-subsistence farms into the market.

<p>The tax to which the honourable Member refers is levied each time a private yacht of over seven metres in length enters Greece and approaches Greek ports, harbours or coasts; it also affects boats flying the Greek flag, but not boats permanently at anchor in Greek ports, which boats are defined, for the purposes of this tax, as vessels which spend fewer than thirty days in the year outside Greece.</p>
<p>The Commission takes the view that this tax is incompatible with the provisions of Articles 23, 25 and 133 of the Treaty establishing the European Communities, which prohibit taxes with effects comparable to those of Customs import duties in the context of trade between Community Member States and imports direct from third countries.</p>
<p>Until Law No 2932/2001 entered into force, taxes were levied at EUR 44.02 per metre of the boat's total length where the boat in question, within thirty days of its last entry, re-entered and berthed in Greek ports, harbours or on Greek shores; the boat was thus subject to a surcharge if it entered twice in the same period; such surcharges, being themselves also incompatible with Articles 23, 25 and 133 of the Treaty establishing the European Communities, have been discontinued.</p>
<p>Having, on 12 September 2000, sent the Greek authorities a letter of formal notice on the tax on yachts introduced by Article 11 of the Law No 2743/99, the Commission issued a reasoned opinion, which was sent on 26 July 2001.</p>
<p>On 18 October 2001, the Commission received a reply to this reasoned opinion from the Greek authorities.</p>
<p>Examination of this reply showed that the Greek authorities had not complied with the reasoned opinion, although they had discontinued the surcharge referred to above and introduced numerous exemptions to the tax (so that yachts taking part in races, in training voyages organised by sailing clubs or schools, or in educational programmes run by the ministries of foreign countries are exempted from these taxes by agreement of the minister of mercantile marine).</p>
<p>The breach committed by the Greek authorities has, indeed, been made worse in one respect, in that professionally-manned yachts (with a maximum capacity of 49 passengers, berths other than those for the crew, and for the sole purpose of pleasure voyages and/or excursions, and wholly hired out), are now liable to these taxes, whereas they were not so before.</p>

<p>The Honourable Member raises the question whether the currently applied practice in Spain of replacing Moroccan seasonal workers with applicant countries seasonal worker is compatible with Community law and policy.</p>
<p>Currently there are still no legally binding common European rules pertaining to the issuing of residence and work permits to third country national seasonal workers. This situation will hopefully change once the Commission Proposal for a Council Directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purpose of paid employment and self-employed economic activities (COM 2001(386) of 11 July 2001<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>) is adopted, but this may still take several years. This implies that Spain is currently free to determine the rules on the admission of seasonal workers on its territory, including the setting of priorities according to the state of origin of the third country worker concerned.</p>
<p>According to the European Union Common Position (EUCP) in respect of Chapter 2 on Freedom of movement of persons and the negotiations now provisionally concluded, with candidate countries: “the Member States and the candidate countries will strive to liberalise, under national law, access to their labour markets for each other’s nationals already before accession”. The new Commission initiatives in the migration field had to take into account this political committment of the Union to grant preferential access to citizens of applicant countries and Article 6 of the above mentioned Commission proposal COM 2001(386) of 11 July 2001 contains provisions which ensure that job applications from people from the candidate countries are treated on a preferential basis. As of accession, citizens of new Member States will be citizens of the Union and they will be fully covered by the principle of “Community preference” as set out in Article 6 of this proposal.</p>
<p>Relations between the Community and its Member States and Morocco are governed by the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement, which was signed by the parties in February 1996 and which entered into force in March 2000<a href="#defann_29_2" name="refann_29_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. Title VI of the Agreement includes a number of provisions in the social field. In particular, Article 64 specifies that Moroccan nationals employed in the Member States should receive equal treatment as regards working conditions, remuneration and dismissal. The Agreement does not, however, include provisions or political commitments on access to employment by Moroccan nationals. This remains a question for individual Member States.</p>
<p>It results that the currently applied practice in Spain of replacing Moroccan seasonal workers with applicant countries seasonal worker is in line with the special political commitment undertaken by the Union to give preference to the citizens of its future Member States. It needs to be stressed that this setting of priorities must not be interpreted as a negative discrimination against Moroccans, hampering the spirit of co-operation and partnership between the Union and Morocco, but rather as a positive measure in favour of the Union´s new Member States.</p>
<p>It needs to be added that on the basis of article 73 of the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement with Morocco a working party on social affairs and migration has been created. This working party is responsible for promoting dialogue and cooperation in the social field and provides the opportunity to explain and discuss the existing legal framework and policies concerning admission of seasonal worker with the Moroccan authorities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On the subject of the answer given to his earlier written question <a href="/doceo/document/P-5-2002-0027_EN.html">P-0027/02</a>, the author of this question wishes to remind President Prodi that the euro was not introduced on 1 January 2002: that date refers only to the introduction of the physical currency. In addition, the reference to 11 September 2001 clearly implied a date earlier than 1 January 2002. Given that the euro was launched on the markets on 1 January 1999 and that since that date it has - despite stable prices in the eurozone - fallen substantially against the US dollar, the pound sterling and the Swiss franc - it is necessary to conclude that, as far as the euro is concerned, the general trend has been quite clearly downward.</p>
<p>Can the Commission state whether President Prodi has in fact praised the euro as a stable currency, and, if so, whether it believes that a statement of this nature corresponds to the reality, given the fluctuations which have beset the currency if it is viewed, not in relation to the eurozone countries themselves but in relation to the currencies of non-eurozone countries?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The European Crime Prevention Network (EUCPN) started its activities in the spring of 2001. Exchange of information is a key element of the Network´s mission. The EUCPN thus consists of national representatives designated by each Member State of the European Union. The national representatives meet at least once every six months on the invitation of the current Presidency and decide on the annual programme, including priority fields and the main specific actions.</p>
<p>Immediately after the adoption of the Council Decision of 28 May 2001 setting up the EUCPN the Commission engaged the necessary actions with a view to taking up its responsibilities as defined in the Council Decision. The Commission namely provides for the Secretariat for EUCPN. In addition it has animating, jointly with the Presidency, the work of the Network.</p>
<p>While it is clear that the EUCPN is only at the beginning of its existence, it undertook until the end of 2001 a number of measures to make the network a valuable tool in the area of crime prevention. First steps have been taken to build co-operation with the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction and Europol. A discussion has been launched how to further elaborate the possibility of comparing crime and criminal justice statistics between the Member States. In its first year of operation the Network devoted special attention to gathering best practices in the field of crime prevention, especially on urban, juvenile and drug related crime prevention. A conference, co-funded by the Hippocrates programme<a href="#defann_31_1" name="refann_31_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, to be organised in Denmark in October 2002, will contribute to further analysis of the best crime prevention practices in priority areas of urban, juvenile and drugs related crime, and their dissemination in the Union. In the Commission’s view it is essential that the Network follows this conference up with a series of similar conference in the years to come.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission recalls that one of the top priorities of the Network for the period July 2001 to December 2002 is the establishment of the Network’s website. The website will provide detailed information on general crime prevention, the role of the Network as well as the Member States crime prevention activities. The latter will form an important part of the site notably as regards “best practices”. The necessary preparatory work has been taking place since the summer of 2001 and the site is to become operational in July 2002.</p>
<p>The Network has just published its first annual report, which will of course be available on the EUCPN´s website. The Commission will forward directly a copy of the report to the Honourable Member.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The relevant Treaty provisions are Articles 81 and 82, which lay down the Community competition rules applicable to restrictive practices between businesses and abuses of a dominant position. It should be noted that the competition rules enforced by the Irish Competition Authority mirror those set out in Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty, with the exception that the Irish rules are applicable without having to prove an effect on trade between Member States.</p>
<p>It would appear that the main effects of any alleged agreements and practices are largely confined to one single Member State.</p>

<p>The Commission is aware of the concerns of Norway and others regarding the implications of radioactive contamination of fish resulting from radioactive discharges from Sellafield.

<p>The Commission plays an active part in these discussions and, in order to have a more complete picture of the impact of all discharges to the North European marine environment, the Commission launched the so-called Marina II study in 2000. The final report of this study will be delivered to the Commission shortly. The study will provide additional detailed information on radioactive discharges, concentrations in the marine environment, and an assessment of their significance for human health and for the environment.</p>
<p>The Commission understands that, while the study will indicate extensive variation in the concentration of radionuclides in marine biota, including fish, from place to place (being generally much higher in the Irish Sea than in Norway), this study is unlikely to indicate that the absolute concentrations are of radiological significance to either human health or that of the fish themselves.</p>
<p>The Commission has also arranged that the results of this report will be presented at a special session of the International Conference on Radioactivity in the Environment to be held in Monaco from 1 to 5 September 2002. The results will also be presented to the next meeting of the Radioactive Substances Committee of OSPAR in 2003.</p>

<p>The Union's budget for 2002 provides for reductions in subsidies for sheep and goat meat from 970 million euro to 672 million euro on the grounds of the rise in prices for sheep and goat meat owing to 'mad cow' disease and the resultant crisis on the meat market in Europe (plummeting consumption of beef and a corresponding increase in consumption of other kinds of meat - lamb, veal etc.). Owing to differences in diet in southern and Mediterranean Europe, consumption of sheep and goat meat in Greece is always high and, therefore, the increase in its commercial value resulting from greater demand was slight and did not match the increase for the same meat in northern Europe. These circumstances and the fact that subsidies for sheep and goat meat are to remain the same regardless of actual market prices create problems for sheep and goat farmers in southern Europe, particularly Greece.</p>
<p>Did the Commission take account of the particular circumstances of sheep and goat farmers in Greece when proposing the above cuts and what measures will it take to restore the subsidies to their rightful level?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The situation of the market was very good throughout 2001 and the price of sheep rose by 15.2% in the Union as a whole and by 8.6% in Greece (in national currency).</p>
<p>The ‘loss of revenue’ in comparison with the basic price for the whole of the Union was much less than in previous years, which suggests that the result of the calculation of the premium is somewhat modest (EUR 9 086 per animal in 2001 for non-milk sheep), bearing in mind the high level of prices.</p>
<p>In the Union as a whole, the situation of breeders should be similar to previous years, the revenue in 2001 largely resulting from prices rather than premiums. With regard to Greek producers, the increase in prices was less than in some other Member States for 2001 (higher in other years). It would not be possible to give additional compensation to Greek producers because that would be incompatible with a Community market.</p>
<p>The forecasts for the rest of 2002 indicate that prices are going to remain very high. To the revenue resulting from high prices, we must add the premium for non-milk sheep set at EUR 21 per animal for 2002 and following years (plus EUR 7 for the least-favoured regions and an increase of around EUR 1 via the national appropriation), which will considerably improve the situation of Greek producers.</p>
<p>Budgetary Aspects</p>
<p>The 2002 preliminary draft budget (PDB) had forecast for 2001 an income of EUR 970 million based on the hypothesis of a market price of EUR 370 per 100 kilos.</p>
<p>On the establishment of the letter of amendment to the preliminary draft budget (LA/PDB) 2002, the market price has been raised (EUR 4000 per tonne). This has lead to credits in the order of EUR 672 million.</p>
<p>This amount, as indicated above, is intended to finance solely the aid to breeders for 2001 under the former system. In fact, following the reform decided in December 2001 and the introduction of fixed premiums for breeders, there has been a change of the dates for the granting of this aid, which means a shift in expenses for 2002 following 15 October 2002, when the 2003 financial year begins for the EAGGF-Guarantee. Consequently, the revenue of Greek producers in 2002 is very much increased by the higher budgetary allocations. However, that rise in premiums will only appear in the 2003 budget.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0312"></a>

<p>On 4 April 2002 the multinational company United Biscuits, which owns the Fontaneda biscuit factory in Aguilar de Campo, announced its decision to close the factory without giving any advance notice to workers, who discovered the news in the press. For more than a century, this factory has been producing a make of biscuit which is emblematic in Spain, is inseparably linked to the Aguilar area and represents the only economic possibility for development in this Objective 1 region. The multinational's decision and the way it was announced show that the sole purpose of its acquisition of the factory in 2000 was to acquire the Fontaneda brand, with the aim of winning market share and subsequently closing the factory.</p>

<p>The Honourable Member should be aware that under the terms of Council Directive 98/59/EC dealing with collective redundancies (which consolidates two earlier directives on the issue), an employer contemplating collective redundancies is obliged to begin consultations with the workers' representatives in good time. Such consultations should cover ways of avoiding or reducing the number of workers affected and mitigating the consequences. While the Commission has no specific information on the circumstances of the case to which the Honourable Member refers, any alleged breach of the national legislation implementing the collective redundancies directive would fall to be pursued at national level.</p>
<p>The rights of workers to information and consultation generally will be enhanced following the adoption of Directive 2002/14/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2002 establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the Community<a href="#defann_37_1" name="refann_37_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.

<p>The author of this question recently (on 23 April 2002) consulted the public Internet page of the Commission's DG for External Relations (; only available in English). There is no reference to Cuba in the 'Delegations' menu, but this is to be expected as the Commission has no delegation in Havana. More surprising is the circumstance that, in the 'Regions' menu on the same page, there is no reference to Cuba in the section 'African Caribbean, Pacific', given that the ACP group has accepted Cuba as a full member. Nor, even more strangely, is there any reference whatever to Cuba in the section 'Latin America'. However, what is most astonishing is that Cuba is totally absent from the alphabetically-arranged 'Countries' menu, even though it includes countries and territories such as - to cite entries from various alphabetical groups - Bhutan, the Hong Kong SAR, the Macao SAR and Taiwan. On another page, 'The European Union in the World', Cuba is, again, not mentioned anywhere. All this is surprising, since in this way the Commission is offering a selective vision of the world to the public.</p>

<p>Recent findings by researchers at Stockholm University show that carbohydrate-rich foods which have been heated to very high temperatures may contain high levels of acrylamide, a substance which could cause cancer.</p>
<p>Results of analyses by Sweden's National Food Administration confirm the researchers' findings. Many of the foods in question, notably chips, roast and fried potatoes, cakes, bread and crisps, are eaten in large quantities. Such products are consumed throughout Europe.</p>
<p>In view of these new findings, what steps does the Commission intend to take?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>On 24 April 2002, the Swedish National Food Administration published new findings on acrylamide in foods. High levels were detected in carbohydrate-rich foods produced using high temperatures, particularly frying and baking processes.</p>
<p>Acrylamide is a known possible cancer-causing chemical. Its formation in food has not been highlighted before this study. Improvements and new developments in analytical methods have led to this finding that some cooking practices might cause the formation of acrylamide in food. The mechanism by which this occurs is not clear.</p>
<p>As always for new scientific developments, the new method must be validated and the data must be verified. The Swedish findings are based upon a method which has not been validated. Moreover, the limited number of samples tested might not be representative of foods and cooking practices across the Member States. This issue must be investigated more widely.</p>
<p>The Commission has asked Sweden for further information on these new findings. Also, the Member States and representatives of the industry have been asked to provide available information on this issue. In parallel, the Commission has taken steps to consult the Scientific Committee on Food on the scientific aspects of this issue.</p>
<p>The available information is clearly limited at this stage. A provisional assessment will help determine the extent of risk that might be posed by this newly identified issue. It will also help clarify what actions might be necessary to protect consumers.</p>
<p>Under the current Framework research programme, there are no European collaborative projects on acrylamide in food. The call for proposals for the new Framework research programme could provide for studies on this subject if necessary.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

In many of the applicant countries, wages are lower than in Portugal and working conditions are such that hourly labour costs are far lower than they are in the current European Union.</p>
<p>In view of this, will the Commission state what role the Structural Funds play in the ongoing accession negotiations, and whether there is any readiness in the context of those negotiations to draw up rules to prevent companies from misusing the Funds, as happened in the case of Gislaved?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission and the governments of the Member States appeared to be deeply annoyed recently by the USA's unilateral imposition of tariffs, chiefly affecting European steel production. The possibility was immediately considered of the Union taking countermeasures to make the Americans realise the consequences of a potential economic war and revoke their measures, which would otherwise result in job losses in Europe and distortion of free competition. The European press reported that the likely response from the Union would be to impose tariffs on imports from the USA of textiles, fruit juice, fresh fruit, metal products and steel, motorcycles etc. Why did the Union finally back down and not impose tariffs on imports of some US products? Did it receive assurances of an immediate withdrawal of the measures imposed by the Americans?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The American protective measures for steel announced on 5 March jeopardise the whole of the world steel market and directly affect more that USD 2 billion of European exports by denying them access to the American market.</p>
<p>In reaction to these American measures, the Union has implemented a strategy consisting of three elements.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Union has taken the case to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) by asking, from 7 March, for consultations on the American protective measures for steel and, on 7 May, for the establishment of a Panel to counter these measures.</p>
<p>These measures clearly violate the rules of the WTO. In fact, they involve errors which are the same as those which led to the condemnation of the United States in each of the six cases relating to American protective measures brought before the WTO.</p>
<p>The condemnation of the American protective measures for steel by the WTO will not however take effect before next year. That is why, secondly, on 27 March, the Union adopted provisional protective measures with a view to protecting its market against the distortions in trade caused by the American protective measures for steel.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the United States is obliged to compensate for the negative effects of its protective measures. In the absence of an agreement on appropriate compensation, the WTO rules authorise the Union to suspend equivalent concessions in relation to the United States with a view to countering the negative effects of the American measures.</p>
<p>Although discussions are continuing with a view to acquiring appropriate compensation, the Union is determined to preserve its right to apply rebalancing measures. To this end, the suspensions of the concessions envisaged to counterbalance the negative effect of the American measures must be notified to the WTO before 17 May and a Council regulation must be adopted before 18 June.</p>
<p>It is within this context that we intend to impose higher customs duties on imports of various products originating from the United States. The list of the products in question must however be defined very carefully so as not to penalise the European industries or consumers which use or consume these products.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0325"></a>

Until now, these groups have been poorly and sporadically funded, and they have tended to operate locally and in isolation from each other; thus it has not been possible to develop coherent approaches or to exchange experience.

<p>Regulation (EC) 1260/1999<a href="#defann_50_1" name="refann_50_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> provides that the Commission should be kept informed of such matters on an annual basis. Has the Commission been informed of this matter? Does it intend to carry out checks or make recommendations to the Member State concerned? How will it ensure that the services offered at all the vocational training centres are of high quality and totally efficient?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The articles in the Greek press referred to by the Honourable Member relate to the selection of proposals for vocational training actions for the unemployed following an open call for tender. This specific call for tender was launched under the Operational Programme "Employment and Vocational Training" and allocated an amount of</p>
<p>EUR 100 million for these actions. EUR 100 million represents approximately 4% of the total amount earmarked for the entire Operational Programme. This Operational Programme is only a part of the Community's education and training programmes in Greece, which are funded with over EUR 4 billion.</p>
<p>Following the first technical step of the selection, apparently, the 15 biggest training centres in Greece – representing approximately 7% of all training centres and 33% of capacity – had, among others, submitted tenders and were selected. In accordance with the selection underway they could receive around 35% of the available funding for this particular call. However, the amount they are likely to receive for this specific action represents less than 1% of the funding earmarked for Community education and training programmes.</p>
<p>The Greek initiative to introduce competitive tendering procedures in the field of continuous vocational training is in conformity with Directive 92/50/EEC on public procurement. The Greek authorities have announced that they will proceed with open procedures in all cases of vocational training actions for the unemployed, which are carried out by certified training centres.</p>
<p>The Member State has fully informed the Commission on the open call for tender launched under the Operational Programme "Employment and Vocational Training" within the framework of partnership.</p>
<p>Moreover, in accordance with Regulation (EC) 1260/1999, the 2001 annual report for the specific operational programme will be adopted by the national authorities at the end of June 2002 and will then be submitted to the Commission. Finally, in accordance with the aforementioned Regulation, the content of the report will be discussed extensively at the formal annual review meeting between the managing authority of the operational programme and the Commission, due to take place at the end of this year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is aware of the need for measures to prevent infrastructure projects from impacting adversely on forest biodiversity, and, in particular, on rare wild fauna and flora species.</p>
<p>In the context of the cooperation programmes with the Central African countries, the Commission supports the implementation of a sectoral transport programme based especially on international recognised environmental protection criteria.</p>
<p>Within this overall context of sectoral policy, the Commission has not undertaken, and does not intend to undertake, the financing of any road building project using new routes or any deforestation project in the tropical forest areas of the countries mentioned.</p>
<p>In those countries where the socio-economic and security situation allows, the Commission is financing or has financed projects for the rehabilitation or the current and regular maintenance of the existing national or regional priority road networks.</p>
<p>The list of the most recent projects financed by the Commission in the region is as follows:</p>
<p>- improvement and rehabilitation of the Ngaoundéré-Toubourou-Moundou road; this road, which does not pass through forest land, is part of the regional network structure and links Chad to the rail line and the port of Douala, thus creating access to the sea for one of the world's poorest countries;</p>
<p>- improvement and rehabilitation of the Bertoua-Garoua-Boulaï road in Cameroon; this road, which does not pass through forest land, is part of the regional network structure and links the Central African Republic to the port of Douala;</p>
<p>- support for the restructuring of the road network in Cameroon, giving first place to institutional support for and maintenance of the national priority network; specific provisions have been introduced into this project to integrate environmental criteria into the maintenance work;</p>
<p>- maintenance and rehabilitation of the main routes of the existing priority networks in the Central African Republic and Congo (Brazzaville);</p>
<p>- improvement of the 57-km Lalara-Mitzic road which forms part of the Libreville-Douala axis linking Gabon and Cameroon;</p>
<p>- construction of two bridges in the Gabon-Cameroon-Equatorial Guinea border triangle, in a project complementing the improvement work being carried out in the region by the African Development Bank (ADB) and the French Agency for Development.</p>
<p>The feasibility studies for these projects are accompanied by detailed environmental impact assessments which describe the possible environmental risks and propose corrective measures. These measures have been systematically incorporated into the financing proposals and integrated into the implementation of the projects. The projects financed by the Commission are not located in the equatorial forest zones which are home to the big primate species mentioned in the oral question.</p>
<p>The Commission will be happy to provide Parliament with any additional data or complementary information and access to the environmental impact assessments, in line with its future requests.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The governments of Burundi and Tanzania have reached an agreement on going ahead with the voluntary and organised repatriation of such of the almost 400 000 Burundians living in refugee camps in Tanzania who wish to go home. To date, almost 50 000 refugees have signed requests for voluntary repatriation.</p>
<p>The UNHCR, however, has stated that it does not believe the situation in Burundi to be ideally suited to proceeding with repatriation at the present time. The UN World Food Programme, for its part, has stressed that the regions for which the refugees are destined (Makamba, Ruyigi and Muyinga) are considered to be danger zones. Furthermore, various NGOs are claiming that the repatriation is not particularly ‘voluntary’, given that major pressure has been brought to bear by the two governments, particularly that of Tanzania.</p>
<p>Moreover, in recent talks with the Ugandan President, Yoweri Museveni, the President of Burundi, Pierre Buyoya, said that violence was threatening the peace process in his country.</p>

<p>One of the causes of the Israelo-Palestinian conflict is Israel’s wish to occupy and annex Palestine, a goal it pursues through an illegal policy of colonising and establishing settlements in the richest, most fertile parts of Palestine, leaving the Palestinian people in poverty.</p>

<p>The Commission considers that under international law as applied by the Community, exports from the settlements can not be entitled to benefit from preferential access to the Union market under the Union-Israel Association Agreement. This was reflected in 1997 in a Notice to Importers published by the Commission warning them of the customs duties which might be levied on such imports. In 1998 the Commission sent a Communication to the Council and to the Parliament on this question, indicating in a clear way its view.</p>
<p>After several years of verification by Member States authorities to try to determine which goods came from Israel and which from the settlements, the issue was discussed in July 2001 in the Union-Israel Customs Co-operation Committee. That meeting had to record a difference in interpretation of the Association Agreement between the Union and Israel. The Commission and the Council therefore raised the issue at the Association Council in November 2001. The Commission published a new Notice to Importers on 23 November 2001 setting out more precisely its interpretation of the Agreement and warning them that they could face a customs debt in the future. Customs Authorities in Member States have then systematically asked the Israeli authorities to clarify the origin of certain imports and they have also asked for guarantee deposits equivalent to the potential customs duties on goods originating in the settlements.</p>
<p>The Commission has all along made clear to the Israeli authorities that it is willing to explore any technical solution to this problem which is consistent with our legal interpretation of the Agreement. Regrettably, this has not so far led to any concrete suggestions for a way forward.</p>
<p>It is difficult to quantify with precision at this stage. The Israeli Ambassador to the Union has referred to a figure of $ 140 million. Members of the Israeli Government have referred to a financial loss of around $ 8 million if they had to pay the customs duties without preferential access for products coming from the settlements.</p>
<p>Since there is so much uncertainty the Commission prefers not to venture any estimate from the Commission's side. The easiest way to reach clarity, and indeed to settle this matter once and for all, would be for the Israeli Authorities to help the Community determine more precisely the origin of their exports and to look for a viable technical solution to the problem. But the Israelis must come forward with specific proposals in this respect, as we asked them at the Association Council in November 2001.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0340"></a>

<p>The Commission is working on a draft regulation (Article 133) concerning controls on imports and exports of diamonds. Since the Second World War Belgium has developed an effective system of controls in consultation with the industry. This has improved the quality of the diamond trade and enabled any fraudulent or illegal trade in conflict diamonds to be detected and punished. It seems that the regulation is less strict, is based mainly on certification, does not provide for any physical inspection of the merchandise and does not cover the possible use of electronic data exchange between exporting and importing countries. This weakens the current Belgian legislation and is less efficient in combating frauds and abuses which pose a threat to public order and safety.

<p>At the initiative of South Africa and a few major rough diamond-producing countries an international certification scheme for rough diamonds has been developed within the so-called Kimberley Process.

The purpose of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme is to prevent conflict diamonds from fuelling armed conflicts and to protect the legitimate trade in diamonds against the influx of conflict diamonds.</p>
<p>The Commission is presently in the process of preparing a draft Commission proposal for a Council Regulation implementing the Kimberley Certification Scheme. The Commission proposal will contain the Community rules and procedures for imports and exports of rough Diamonds. The Commission is aiming at a system of controls fully living up to the standards of the Kimberley Process, and where deemed necessary or desirable, going beyond them. The Commission will not propose a system that is less effective in meeting the goals of the Kimberley process than the present import and export controls in the Community.</p>
<p>The Commission has been and still is informally consulting most interested parties - governments as well as the industry - before presenting a proposal. It will take into consideration the experience gained already within Community.</p>

<p>Danish building firms and tradesmen wishing to carry out work in Germany are required to pay fees and an annual subscription to the local chamber of trades in Germany to obtain authorisation to do so.</p>
<p>Germany is persisting with this requirement even though the Court of Justice ruled on 3 October 2000 that approval for membership of a chamber of trades ‘should neither give rise to additional administrative expense nor entail compulsory payment of subscriptions to the chamber of trades’. The judgment concludes therefore that these rules are contrary to the right of freedom to provide services.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s view, is the continued practice of requiring fees and an annual subscription contrary to the rules on freedom to provide services? If so, what steps will the Commission take to restore that freedom?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In its judgment referred to by the honourable Member, the Court of Justice effectively stated that the obligation imposed on a service provider who wishes to temporarily pursue their small craft activity in another Member State to register themselves on the trades register of that State should ‘neither give rise to additional administrative expense nor entail compulsory payment of subscriptions to the chamber of trades’.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore believes that the payment of taxes or annual subscriptions would contravene the rules on the free provision of services, as interpreted by the Court.</p>
<p>In its letter of 17 July 2001, the Commission questioned the German authorities on the measures they intended to take in order to conform to Community law as interpreted by the Court in its ‘Corsten’ judgment. The German authorities replied by letter on 30 November 2001 that a modification of the legislation was under way and that, without awaiting the entry into force of the modified legislation, the competent authorities were no longer applying provisions which did not comply with Community law. To date, the Commission has not received any complaint in relation to this issue.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0354"></a>

<p>The Commission does not seek to know, nor has it the right to know, the political views of its personnel. It should be noted that Article 27 of the Staff Regulations stipulates inter alia that "Officials shall be selected without distinction as to race, political, philosophical or religious beliefs, sex or sexual orientation..." and the Commission, naturally, fulfils those requirements.</p>
<p>However, Commission staff may be judged on the basis of their actions or behaviour. Thus Article 12§1 of the Staff Regulations stipulates that "An official shall abstain from any action and, in particular, any public expression of opinion which may reflect on his (or her) position". This provision fixes limits in relation to the public manifestation by officials of unacceptable or insulting acts or words and it must be respected at all times. Clearly, in keeping with Article 13 of the Treaty, the Commission seeks actively to uphold the principles articulated in that Article and therefore takes these principles into account in discharging its duties as employer.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member may wish to know that, amongst the proposals made by the Commission in the course of the current Reform Strategy, there is provision for a new system to deal with any alleged cases of moral harassment. The Commission is therefore seeking to equip itself with further means of deterring or – if proved to be necessary – of imposing penalties on any person who inflicted moral harassment on others by manifesting extremist views or by taking action inspired by such views.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0355"></a>

<p>Complaints have been made by a non-profit making organisation, based on reports in the main Rumanian newspapers, about contracts concluded by Spanish and Rumanian firms employing seasonal workers and the actual conditions under which thousands of Rumanian workers are living in Spain. According to reports from workers, hundreds of Rumanians were taken to Spain last month to work on the strawberry harvest.</p>
<p>Contrary to the Spanish firm's contractual obligations, once in Spain they were crammed into squalid shacks, forced to wash in buckets of water and unable to cook because of the poor facilities. Although working 16 hours a day, they were left with 50 euro a month after the cost of board and lodging were deducted from 300 euro instead of the 500 euro laid down in their contracts. Moreover, most of them were unable to return because they had already incurred heavy debts in getting to Spain. These conditions are outrageous and unacceptable.</p>

<p>The Commission has no specific information on the working and living conditions of Romanian workers in Spain as described by the Honourable Member.</p>
<p>However there are minimum requirements and provisions on working conditions set out by Community legislation in order to provide appropriate protection for workers. For example, under the working time directive<a href="#defann_58_1" name="refann_58_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that every worker is entitled to a minimum daily rest period of 11 consecutive hours per 24-hour period and the average working time for each seven day period does not exceed 48 hours. Member States shall also ensure that employers fulfil their obligations to inform employees of the conditions applicable to the contract or employment relationship<a href="#defann_58_2" name="refann_58_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. Moreover, the posting of workers directive<a href="#defann_58_3" name="refann_58_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> lays down certain conditions of employment, including minimum rates of pay, health, safety and hygiene at work, which must be observed in the Member State where the posted worker performs his work. It also states that undertakings established in a non-member State must not be given more favourable treatment than undertakings established in a Member State.</p>
<p>Any alleged breach of the Member States' legislation implementing the provisions of Community legislation in a particular Member State is a matter to be addressed to the responsible authority of the Member State concerned.</p>
<p>A Member State has also an obligation according to Article 38 of the Europe Agreement between the Union and Romania to ensure that legally employed Romanian workers in its territory are not discriminated against as compared to its own nationals as regards working conditions and remuneration.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
