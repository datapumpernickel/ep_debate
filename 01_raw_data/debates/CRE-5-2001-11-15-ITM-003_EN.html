<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Figueiredo (GUE/NGL),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur. –</span> <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, as is well-known, and as the recent Commission report on social inclusion confirms, poverty remains at excessively high levels. Although the latest available data on incomes in the Member States does not capture the whole complexity and multi-faceted nature of the scale of poverty and social exclusion, it does show that in 1997, around 18% of the population of European Union, in other words, more than 60 million people, lived in homes in which the income was less than 60% of the average national income and that around half of these 60 million people had lived below the relative poverty threshold for three consecutive years.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation shows how crucial it is that we implement a global strategy for combating poverty and social exclusion, defending human rights in all their aspects, and that this programme is an instrument that must be implemented urgently. One year ago, in this House, we approved at first reading the report on this Community programme of providing incentives for cooperation between Member States in the fight against social exclusion as an important aspect of the strategy to combat poverty which the Council spoke of so much at the Lisbon summit in March of 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, the Member States have given new commitments, with the definition, in Nice, of the objectives of the fight against poverty, and in Stockholm, where they committed themselves to promoting sustainable development and quality jobs, confirming their desire to thereby contribute to reducing the risk of poverty and social exclusion. National plans for social inclusion were also drawn up, identifying a set of factors that considerably increase the risk of poverty and social exclusion, such as unemployment, especially long-term unemployment, low income, low-quality employment, lack of proper housing, unstable health, immigration, early school-leaving, gender inequality, discrimination and racism, disability, old age, family breakdown, drug addiction and alcoholism, and living in a highly disadvantaged area.</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes, these risk factors interact and combine over time, and it is therefore necessary to break the recurring cycle of poverty and to prevent intergenerational poverty and new forms of poverty, including info-exclusion. It is in this context that the programme becomes especially significant, as yet another instrument with which to fight poverty and social exclusion, which as we see, is continuing to increase.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, after overcoming the Council’s intransigence on aspects that Parliament has always considered to be essential, specifically with regard to the programme’s budget, the participation of NGOs and financial support for them, the role of the European Parliament and the promotion of innovative approaches, we have reached the end of a long process that includes a second reading on 17 May this year, various working meetings with the Belgian presidency and conciliation, in which, finally, consensus was reached on 18 September.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the agreement that has been reached, it is important to mention the aspects dealing with the budget and its increase by EUR 5 million to EUR 75 million for the five years of the programme, which is still insufficient, but, given the Council’s intransigence, not reaching an agreement would have meant the programme not coming into force at the beginning of next year. A decision was also reached on promoting innovative approaches and financial support for actions undertaken by NGOs, which has increased from 80% to 90% in exceptional circumstances. It is also worth noting that agreement was reached on the participation of NGOs, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, in preparing and holding the annual Round table on the situation’s development and the programme’s implementation<span class="italic">.</span> It is also important to point out that the role of the European Parliament has been acknowledged, specifically in the timely consideration of the synthesis report for the Spring Council, which the Commission will draw up annually and which will examine the overall coherence of policies with social cohesion, including the progress made under this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank everyone who has taken part and contributed to this proposal’s success and for the consensus reached in the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have urgent challenges to meet. Not only is it unacceptable for so many million citizens in the European Union and candidate countries to be living below the poverty line, but the knowledge society which we are creating and the increasingly multicultural society in which we live in Europe harbour new risks of social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">What is important is that this social programme will give us the chance to process our policies on the basis of modern scientific data, on the basis of statistical studies and on the basis of exchanges of best practices, including with countries outside the European Union, such as those in the European Economic Area. This is particularly important for Member States unused to applying strategies based on social research, the very countries which now face the most serious social problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament, as the rapporteur, Mrs Figueiredo has just said, had high hopes of this Community programme. Nevertheless, it supports the joint text brokered during conciliation with the Council and is satisfied with the constructive part played by the European Commission. The rapporteur has already listed the main points of this conciliation. We particularly wanted to highlight the innovative approach which the European Commission has promised to promote in order to ensure that citizens with special difficulties are integrated into society. The ground which we need to cover between now and 2010, the timeframe and political milestone set in Lisbon, will be a long, hard haul and it is crucial, in our view, that the European Council in Laeken set its stamp very firmly on this effort.</p>
<p class="contents">We have special need of such decisiveness at this time when, as the previous debate highlighted, we are feeling the economic and social fallout from the crisis provoked by 11 September more and more acutely in Europe; at the same time, the Member States need to move into action by instigating public dialogue and integrating the fight against social exclusion into all their policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rocard (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs had quite a struggle over this issue of combating social exclusion. I should like to point out that it was more or less unanimous throughout the procedure, and was served by an excellent rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">However, conciliation, which we had thought would be easy, since we were so much in accord with the Council’s motives when it adopted the Commission’s proposal, proved surprisingly tough and difficult. I should therefore like to remind the House, briefly, of the reasons for our insistence. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and, I am sure, Parliament as a whole, approves the choice of the open-cooperation method. It has proved its worth in this area. We also agree that social exclusion is a complex and multi-facetted process, and that it is necessary to study it in greater depth, particularly as regards its links with poverty. There are people on the margins of society who are not poor, and not all poor people are excluded, but the area of overlapping is a very large one. It is not possible to separate the two problems. However, one of the major strengths of the open-cooperation method is the fact that it allows the exchange of good practice. It is here that Europe has a responsibility, or I would prefer to say a duty, to experiment and to lead by example. The information already collected enables us to launch innovative schemes and pilot projects with confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Commissioner, you are a politician, as we are. How could you imagine for a moment that we could sell to our voters the idea that, on a problem as serious and as evident as social exclusion, Europe is able only to finance studies, and is not able to take any practical action? This sort of thing is suicidal as far as Europe’s image is concerned, hence the innovatory approaches that you have finally conceded to us. Fortunately you have other mechanisms, we know, but given the importance of this preoccupation it was necessary to include it. The controversy over the budget arises from this. You have granted us only five million. Since we know that you had plans ready for carrying out these studies, we would like to have a guarantee that there will be money available for innovative experiments. In the same way, the NGOs must be able to work without having to look for unlikely external sponsors. Well, we have achieved this, and the text has been improved. I wish the Commission all the best in carrying out the task that lies before it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This action programme is a very serious and important step forward for the European Union. It is part of the recognition of the huge problem of social exclusion which is not only the result of poverty, although it is of course linked to it. Some of those links are picked up in the excellent report by Mrs Lynne which we will be debating later, concerning the European Year of Disabled People, and in Mr Nobilia's report which recognises the problems faced by elderly or disabled people in exercising, for example, their freedom of movement because disability benefits are not included in the coordination of social security systems.</p>
<p class="contents">In our discussions on this action programme, Parliament has insisted on the need for civil society to be involved in the programme itself and its evaluation. This involvement is critical. It is clear that the top-down policies, and the hope that overall economic growth would somehow overcome the poverty and lift the poorest out of that state, have not worked. It is the constructive involvement of the people themselves that is part of the solution. We therefore expect that the research and programmes funded with this modestly increased amount of money, a limited range as Mr Rocard has just said, will not just concentrate on policy but also on the process of policy formulation and funding decisions, which in itself could be an innovative dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">I recently attended a local government conference looking at the national social inclusion plans. Speakers representing organisations from groups which often experience social exclusion – poor people, those with disabilities, those from minority ethnic groups etc. – were asked whether they would rather see the implementation of a few policies that have worked elsewhere or have a full programme of real consultation, even if they did not then get what they wanted. The answer, without exception, was that they wanted to be consulted because that implied respect for their experience and their opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also my hope that the activities funded under this programme will not just concentrate on work as the answer to exclusion. It is not a solution if the work is poorly paid and exploitative. I, like many others, look forward to reading and evaluating the results of this programme and hope that they will make real progress in tackling social exclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We think that certain things have been achieved – as always, in conciliation processes not everything we want is achieved – and, although the budget is still low, the budget for NGOs has been raised and the role that the European Parliament plays is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that there is some fine wording in this document: I would remind you of Article 2 – which asks for a high level of employment and a fight against poverty – and point out that the Council considers the current levels of poverty that still exist in the European Union to be unacceptable. However, we are running the risk that applying this action plan – whose implementation next year is welcomed by all of us – will be like putting a small sticking plaster onto a large gaping wound.</p>
<p class="contents">In the previous debate we talked about the virtues of the market in terms of sustaining airlines, yet we talk less of the 12 000 jobs at Sabena. We run the risk of losing much blood whilst we try to stem its flow with a small sticking plaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, Mr President, this plan against social exclusion is very welcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, the speakers referred – and this is important – to the shortcomings and limited potential of this tool as it stands. However, we have to start from the fact that we are talking about a policy area which does not come under European jurisdiction. We have no jurisdiction to exercise policy but, for the first time, the Member States have decided to work together. So, within the framework of this joint decision to work together, three things have happened. First, national action plans against exclusion and poverty are being submitted, for the first time. Secondly, the Social Protection Committee and the European Commission are working together to find a joint policy framework, again for the first time. May I remind you that we do not even have a common definition of the word "poverty" in the European Union. Thirdly, we have the programme, which is a first tool, but an important tool nevertheless. What is important is that, first, the budget has been increased as a result of significant pressure and intervention on the part of the European Parliament and, secondly, we have achieved a common position between the Commission and Parliament during conciliation on 90% funding for organisations which really do not have any resources of their own.</p>
<p class="contents">So what does this tool do? I can sum up the basic elements of this tool in seven points. One, it supports and helps the structures in the Member States to collate data and analyse and research the situation in all the Member States. Two, it helps us work together and develop joint social indicators, for the first time. Three, it supports the procedures used to monitor and implement national action plan programmes on employment. Four, it supports the exchange of best practices and programmes. Five, it involves all the agencies, local authorities, non-governmental organisations, governments, foundations and universities. Six – and I should like to highlight this point – it specifically involves associations of people who are the victims of poverty and exclusion and, seven, it allows us to raise public awareness of the huge problem of poverty, which cannot be dealt with simply by governments and European programmes but which needs to galvanise the whole of society into action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
