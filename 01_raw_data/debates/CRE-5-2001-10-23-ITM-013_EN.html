<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miguélez Ramos (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy is pleased with the initiative to lay down the classification of territorial units for statistics in a Regulation, thereby providing it with a legal basis. Until now, because there has been no such legal basis, changes and updatings have been carried out by means of gentlemen's agreements between Member States and Eurostat.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that statistics are neither neutral nor politically innocent. I therefore believe that this proposed regulation is of great political importance, not only because it will be applied when determining which regions will receive Structural Funds, but also because it provides a certain vision of Europe, of its territorial reality, of its regional and provincial organisation and hence of its disparities and imbalances.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal divides the territory of the States into statistical units organised hierarchically into three levels, and proposes criteria for the definition of these regions in the candidate countries, criteria which demand that they continue to be defined on the basis of territorial organisation and within the current demographic borders.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Regional Policy shares the objectives which the Commission expresses in its proposed Regulation, but nevertheless considers that the classification obtained is not entirely suited to those objectives, which means that it is perceived by some citizens as an artificial division of European territory. In fact, in the annex, the Commission restricts itself to presenting the existing administrative territorial units in each Member State, mixing them with others which do not have the same institutional character, which means that there is a clear lack of homogeneity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Regional Policy believes that the proposal should include a European approach which is capable of overcoming the framework of borders between States. In this respect, NUTS level 1 should take account of large territorial units which transcend these borders, which are intended to serve as a basis for the future planning of European territory. Ladies and gentlemen, NUTS level 1 has clear shortcomings. Only the regions of Germany and Belgium are considered units, while in other Member States, such as Spain, France or Italy, NUTS 1 level corresponds to enormous conglomerates or regions which are totally artificial and almost always arbitrary.</p>
<p class="contents">At the other extreme, the proposal names the Finnish Island of Aland as a NUTS 1 unit, despite the fact that its 25 000 inhabitants are way below the minimum of 3 million required for that demographic bracket. I still believe that the Commission’s proposal should have been more daring, more coherent and, perhaps, if you will allow me, more European.</p>
<p class="contents">There are even more disparities in level 3, where a single Member State, Germany, has more units than eight Member States put together: France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg. In relation to the surface area of the territorial units, the imbalance is also evident, since in the proposal the prevailing criterion is population rather than geographical size. The Committee on Regional Policy urges the Commission and the Member States to work towards the creation of NUTS level 4 and even NUTS level 5, which would represent local bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Regional Policy is presenting Parliament with eleven amendments to this proposal. I must point out that this report was approved in committee by 43 votes in favour and one abstention. As rapporteur, I support these amendments and reject the other amendments presented in Parliament, which were rejected in committee. I believe that the report approved by the Committee on Regional Policy should be accepted by Council and the Commission. Its acceptance could prevent a second reading and a conciliation procedure and would allow the Regulation to enter into force on 1 January 2002. If that is the case, we should be pleased that we have produced a legal text providing the basis for determining the territorial units necessary for gathering statistical information in this great Europe of the future. Let us not fall into the trap of statistics being the art of indicating that two people have eaten well, when, in fact, one of them has eaten two chickens and the other has eaten none. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the basis of a Commission proposal with the best of intentions and leading us in the right direction, I believe that the rapporteur presented the committee with a good draft report and that the result achieved by that committee, as the rapporteur pointed out, is highly satisfactory. It would be a good thing if the Commission and, subsequently, the Council could take up the proposals of this Parliament’s Committee on Regional Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is constructed on the basis of agreements and consensus. We are dealing here with an example of what, in many cases, this way of operating has consisted of: gentlemen’s agreements. But from now on many of these agreements must be reflected in the Treaties, with a relevant legal basis. This is an extremely important issue, as the rapporteur has pointed out very effectively. We are dealing with European territorial construction. For this we need clear, homogenous and geographic criteria. These criteria must be based on politico-administrative criteria – forgive my repetition. We must not create fictitious units which, in the end, only lead to a lack of confidence in European construction on the part of the different States, the different regions and the citizens. I am therefore pleased with the proposal from the committee. I would lastly like to point out an amendment which rather reflects what we are talking about: the amendment by Mrs Cerdeira on the division of the cities of Ceuta and Melilla, which are politico-administrative units, each with its own status. In this specific case I would like to point out how Mr Hernández Mollar, from my group, also fought for this recognition for a long time, and I believe that tomorrow, when the report presented by the Committee on Regional Policy is approved, we will have achieved a satisfactory result. This is an example and a reflection of what we want in terms of the division and structuring of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With the forthcoming enlargement, or to be more precise, enlargements, given that candidate countries will integrate in groups, we need to move towards objective criteria for classifying territorial units, so that new members know the rules of play.</p>
<p class="contents">The simplest way would be to adopt fully unified criteria for each classification level and for all the Member States. However, the many and varied specific characteristics of the countries in the Union make this idea unfeasible and impracticable. So we must agree with the rapporteur and endorse her satisfaction with the Commission initiative which, with the proposed regulation, creates the legal basis for classifying territorial units for statistics.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also congratulate the rapporteur who, with her sense of moderation and what I would call female perspicacity, has proposed and accepted feasible improvements to the Commission opinion in order to achieve a better approach to the basic objective, which cannot be but to formulate truly comparable territorial units, in every sense of the word, so that we can establish a universal European statistics system.</p>
<p class="contents">Given past injustices, the reasonable doubts of European citizens should not be brushed aside with replies along the lines of "this area is supported, even though it is better off than yours because it is a NUTS II territorial unit, whereas yours isn't". Rationalisation at all operational levels in the Union should be our basic and fixed aspiration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has raised important questions and also taken the proposals of others into account. Our group supports the Commission’s proposal and, furthermore, the rapporteur’s view regarding the creation of a proper legal basis for verifying nomenclature.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue is also a timely one, as the applicant countries are receiving guidelines for verifying territorial classification in their own countries. With the present NUTS classification system one problem is that classifications by country have shaped themselves according to each country’s own needs and traditions. One cause for criticism is the fact that the land area of regions has not been used as a basis for statistics. Units vary in size and, for example, a low population density or gradual depopulation are overlooked. The aims of the regulation regarding clear rules, comparability and impartiality deserve support. It is also important to determine rules for dealing with amendments and to ensure that the NUTS classification does not change too often.</p>
<p class="contents">We would ask you to support our group’s amendment, whereby islands and the outermost regions are added to the Subparagraph of Article 3 (4) in order to avoid unnecessary reclassification. Our group stresses the importance of also having flexibility in classification so that administrative factors and, for example, geographical, social and economic circumstances will be taken into consideration as appropriate. Our group supports the rapporteur’s opinion that the Commission should investigate the inclusion of a new level NUTS 4 in the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The goal relating to the comparative classification of territories will be difficult to achieve, and will take time. It is essential, however, that we establish a fair classification, which will help to allocate the right actions to the right areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is about whom will receive European funding in future, how much they will receive, and about who decides how it will be spent. These are pivotal issues for the future of the European Union and of the cohesion policy, and that is why this subject, which we are now discussing at the midnight hour, is more important than has been evident hitherto.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has always adhered purely to statistical criteria for the classification of territorial units and has not taken such political issues into account. So there was ultimately always a tendency to distribute resources from the structural funds using a scattergun approach, rather than concentrating these resources in any efficient way on the regions in greatest need. Looking at the candidate countries, the Objective 1 areas have been extended to include high-income regions and centres such as Warsaw and Riga, and these regions receive just as much by way of funding as the poorest regions of the enlarged European Union, Latgale and Masuria. I am sure that cannot be right. This runs counter to a credible cohesion policy and I regard it as being totally absurd! That is why I would like to ask whether the same agency that grants the authority aid funding should also be the control agency. As I see it, the proposal before us does not adopt a bottom-up approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berend (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regard the proposal for a regulation on the establishment of a common classification of Territorial Units for Statistics, NUTS, as being sensible and clear in terms of both statistics and administration. However, we must ensure that any amendment to the classification also requires the prior approval of the Member States. We must also ensure that the definition of employment market regions under the ‘shared-task’ mechanism can also deviate from NUTS level III in future. The two-year period provided for between an amendment to NUTS being accepted and coming into force should either be significantly reduced or else totally dropped, as Commission financial support for the Member States can depend on the regional structure.</p>
<p class="contents">Otherwise, I am completely satisfied with the Commission proposal, and would in fact be happier without the rapporteur's amendments that were adopted by a majority of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. Although I said ‘by a majority’, they were in fact adopted unanimously with one abstention, and that abstention was mine.</p>
<p class="contents">I voted against certain amendments in committee. This was because the report repeatedly referred to the adoption of additional criteria for the definition of regions as an objective. I regard that as a problem, as taking account of, say, economic, geographical and social criteria in the case of non-administrative units will lead to a blurring of these clear criteria. I believe that a key criterion for the definition of regions should be the number of people living in a region, as in the final analysis they are affected by any decisions regarding the NUTS classification.</p>
<p class="contents">When the rapporteur says in one recital that there should be at least three hierarchical levels, the use of that little phrase ‘at least’ implies that further levels ought to be created for classifying territorial units. However, it needs to be borne in mind that the introduction of new statistics for the areas affected would involve a significant additional administrative burden, something that I believe should if anything be limited. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to start by clarifying two points that seem essential to me. It is up to you to interpret whether statistical classification can have a political impact or not; but I can assure you that that is not the objective of this document, nor was it the Commission’s intention. The document is based on a Eurostat proposal which intends to achieve the most equitable treatment possible for all the countries and regions of the European Union. Nor does this document in any way prejudice regional policy: we do not know who will be objective 1, who will be objective 2 or whether the current regional policy system will be the same in the future. We are talking about statistics here; and we are talking about making the statistics better and as equitable as possible for all the countries of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">What is our intention? Our intention is that a practice we have been applying up until now should become a rule. And we want to do this because it seems essential to us to give a legal character to something which so far has been a consensus between the Member States and the Commission. But it also seems essential to us as a means of establishing principles for enlargement and in order to continue applying the same criteria that have been applied up to this point. Until now, the NUTS had no legal basis, now they are acquiring it: this is the objective of the present regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">What criteria have we used for the definition of the NUTS? Our document is essentially based on three principles. The first is that the NUTS are legislative regions; we have therefore tried to define their territory in accordance with existing legislative political definitions: a good definition, recognised by the Member States, of units which in many cases already have governmental structures and comparable statistics, which makes them sufficiently reliable.</p>
<p class="contents">The second principle is that we propose three hierarchical levels of NUTS. In your amendments you have gone further and asked for at least three levels. With our current room for manoeuvre, from the point of view of producing statistics, to work with more than three levels would create financial problems for Eurostat. This is one reason, but, furthermore, we believe that three levels will provide us with sufficient and valid information.</p>
<p class="contents">The third principle is to try to make the regional statistics comparable. This is why the size of the NUTS has to be as homogenous as possible. But we are also aware that there are historic realities and legal situations in each of the countries which mean that this principle cannot be applied in an automatic or mechanical way, and that specific situations have to be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a consensus between Member States that these principles we have been using until now should also form the ideas behind the new regulation, as I have already mentioned, not only for application in our countries as they stand, but also in the countries which are going to join us in the coming years. That is why the regulation responds to a series of objectives which you have been able to debate in depth and for which you have made some corrections. We are heading towards having NUTS that are classified in accordance with the current regional systems, because we believe that this is the most effective instrument we have today for the collection, calculation and diffusion of regional statistics. Furthermore, in the regulation we set criteria for defining regions in such a way that the candidate countries will have guidelines for regional classification within their own territory. This objective is essential at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress the need for statistics to be as comparable and as impartial as possible. These statistics must not be produced and used for political ends, whatever they may be. It would be very difficult to establish political interests which undoubtedly would lead us to clear contradictions. This issue is essential for the Union’s regional policy, but, as I said before, statistical classification must not prejudice the nature of the Union’s future regional policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We intend to create clear rules for future modifications to the classification of NUTS because this will prevent future disputes, which have arisen in the past. Modifications are inevitable. We cannot speak of absolutely permanent situations, but NUTS must not be modified too often and of course we must have a system which is based on certain rules and certain pre-established principles. We therefore believe it to be appropriate that modifications would not take place within a time period of three years, or else we will be faced with monitoring problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation, as it is drawn up, allows us to move forward and improve on what we have at the moment. You have contributed 11 amendments which, in our opinion, help to clarify and improve the regulation. The Commission can therefore accept the 11 amendments presented by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by stressing that the NUTS Regulation will be an important instrument for achieving comparable and impartial regional statistics in the European Union, on which we will be able to base the regional policy which we will decide on, politically, at the appropriate time. Thank you very much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
