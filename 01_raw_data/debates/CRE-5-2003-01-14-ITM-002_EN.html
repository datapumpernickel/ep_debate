<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">de Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, firstly, as Commissioner responsible for transport, I would like to express my gratitude for being able to present this proposal on the social field in the road transport sector which forms part of the Commission’s policy aimed at increasing road safety and the quality of road transport. There are social consequences in relation to safety in the road transport sector, and I believe we must deal with them.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal includes measures which will promote the efficient and uniform interpretation and application of the current rules, as stated in the White Paper, which will harmonise even further the competition conditions in the road transport sector.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal repeals and replaces the Regulation of 1985. Its aim is to simplify, clarify and update a piece of legislation which was approved 17 years ago. This modification favours effective application of the rules and in particular the introduction of digital speedometers.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to simplify these rules, we have had to reduce the degree of flexibility of the Regulation in force, complex rules on compensation for reduced rest periods have been eliminated and the duration of daily rest has been increased by one hour to 12 hours.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to update the rules, exemptions and exceptions have been reduced to the minimum and have been restricted to small and light vehicles, those used for short distances and those which offer a public service.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the main factors which has inspired this revision has been the increase over the last 17 years in the number of services offered by private companies.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve this more effective application of the rules, the Commission wants to introduce certain new aspects into them, including the tightening of rules on the responsibility of companies and explicit provisions to facilitate the imposition of sanctions in a Member State on drivers who violate the Community rules in another State of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, an explicit provision is introduced so that all Member States adopt the seizure of vehicles as one of the penalties for failing to comply with the law. Immobilising vehicles is a very effective way to penalise not only transport companies, but also transport agencies, which increasingly put pressure on drivers, demanding unreasonable and even entirely illegal driving times.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in order to promote the constant clarification of the rules, a fruitful exchange of experiences and practices in relation to respect for them and active participation by all the Member States in the application of the Regulation, the Commission proposes the creation of an advisory committee made up of national experts from each of the Member States of the Union. This committee will work in collaboration with the existing European-level committee for dialogue with the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to sum up, this is our proposal, the fundamental intention of which is to improve compliance with the rules currently in force, to clarify their content, to increase responsibility and therefore to improve road safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Markov (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in which Parliament found itself when it was asked to draft this report was not a propitious one, because the Commission had drafted its proposal for this regulation without waiting for either the result of conciliation on the Working Time Directive or the Council decision on the digital tachograph. Both documents are – as Mrs de Palacio said – obviously closely related, by virtue of their content, to this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank Mr Andersson, who drafted the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. We had a number of preliminary discussions together. Originally an Enhanced Hughes Procedure was announced, but a few months later this was dispensed with and responsibility for the report was transferred to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">My thanks also go to the Commission staff, Mr Darmis from the committee administration, many European and national institutions, which are affected by this regulation and have played an active part in the debate, and the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups. I believe that it was this cooperation that made it possible for a number of important compromise amendments to be adopted in the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation on the table has to take into account and interlink three different aspects. Firstly, improved road safety; secondly, social protection of workers, and thirdly, fair conditions of competition on the European Union's roads. I believe that a compromise between the groups has been successfully reached and that these three premises have been successfully integrated, although a few Members are proposing to reject the regulation. I would ask you not to comply with their wishes and instead to give the proposed draft the go-ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">What then are the most important points on which a majority of the committee has so far been able to agree? One, the regulation applies to all drivers of vehicles carrying goods or passengers by road, regardless of whether they are employed or self-employed. Two, the regulation also applies to vehicles from third countries when they are in the territory of the European Union. Three, the Commission is instructed to table this regulation for negotiation with the contracting parties to the AETR. Four, the concept of the flexible week that has been newly introduced by the Commission has not been confirmed and instead we retain the calendar week as a basis because this is more practical and easier to monitor. Five, the concept of 'driving time' has been defined by the committee so as to create greater legal certainty. Six – this is a very important point and I hope that it will be retained – all courier and express delivery services, which have contributed to a sharp increase in accidents in the transport sector, are included in the regulation. Seven, the daily rest period has been increased from the proposed 11 hours to 12 hours, although some flexibility is possible as it can be divided into two portions, of nine plus three hours, in a limited number of cases. Eight, the Member States are obliged to define a common range of sanctions to be applied in cases of infringement of the regulation, so as to harmonise the sanctions. Nine, the number of proposed checks on compliance with the regulation has been doubled. Ten, the transport undertakings are obliged to take the steps required to acquaint themselves with the total time worked, even where drivers are employed by several employers. Eleven, the Member States have to take the necessary measures to ensure that relations between shippers, forwarding agents, main customers and subcontractors are regulated by the adoption of binding contracts which enable compliance with the regulation to be monitored. Twelve, it was possible to delete some of the very numerous exemptions and also introduce some necessary new ones, such as, for example, for vintage vehicles and vehicles for humanitarian services.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this considerable number of positive changes – and the ones I have mentioned are just a selection – there are also passages which I and a large proportion of my fellow Members are still not happy with. That is why several amendments have also been tabled in plenary and I would encourage you to support them.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular they concern the permitted driving time of 56 hours per week, which is unquestionably too high, although there is also a limit of not more than 90 hours in two weeks. We are proposing a maximum weekly driving time of 45 hours, which is still considerably more than the number of hours worked in almost any other branch of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I hope, like many of my fellow Members, that the number of exemptions in this regulation will be reduced still further. I know that this regulation does not fulfil all of the wishes of those affected, but I am convinced that the new legislation will increase road safety, improve the social conditions of those concerned, and that it will enable companies to do their job of providing high-quality transport services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are basically concerned here with three issues: health and safety in the working environment, road traffic safety and equal conditions of competition. In the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we have mainly confined ourselves to health and safety, but these issues belong together. Proper driver health and safety whereby, for example, drivers were thoroughly rested when they took the wheel, would promote road safety. Minimum rules throughout the internal market would also guarantee that there was no distortion of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">It is rather odd that there should be proposals to reject this report. There is considerable agreement between the Council, the Commission and, I hope, also the majority in Parliament that this 18-year-old regulation now needs to be changed, partly as a result of digital tachographs now being used. The big problem, and one of the reasons why change is required, is, in actual fact, the poor compliance with the existing regulation. I myself can see that there is poor compliance in my own country. I wish therefore especially to draw attention to a proposal that is very important in the new regulation, namely that the Member States’ supervisory authorities be able to take legal proceedings in cases of rest period infringements, even if the infringement has taken place in the territory of another Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of aspects of the existing report that we Social Democrats, both in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, would like to see strengthened, for example the minimum rest period per 24 hours and the maximum driving time. We have therefore tabled Amendments Nos 105 and 106.</p>
<p class="contents">We also think that the minimum requirement in terms of the working environment is that a driver must not be compelled to spend his long weekly rest period in the cab. We have therefore tabled Amendment No 107. This amendment has unfortunately been wrongly translated in the Swedish version, which is why the English version applies.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 110 is about the need not to remunerate drivers according to a pre-arranged distance to be travelled. Paying drivers on a piecework basis is quite unjustifiable. In conclusion, Amendment No 113 is aimed at requiring the two sides of industry at European level to carry out regular evaluations of this new regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With 300 amendments the work was not easy.</p>
<p class="contents">The main issue raised in this context was the necessity of a new regulation. Opinions differed on the priorities to be addressed, and colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will be taking the floor on this matter again today. In principle, however, the PPE-DE Group is in favour of amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim was to strike a balance between road safety on the one hand and, on the other, flexibility in a profession where even today there are labour shortages right across Europe, perhaps because the conditions are unfavourable, but also because demand is very high. This was a challenge for us.</p>
<p class="contents">There was unanimity – and I should like to underline this here – on at least two points, the first being on checks. All Members agree that we can adopt the best directives in the world here, but if there are no effective checks on compliance in the Member States then we will not achieve anything. Less than 1%, as is the case in certain countries, is not enough. The 2% minimum that has been suggested here should certainly be respected. In addition, a report on implementation should be presented to Parliament at regular intervals, so that we, and also the Member States, can react in good time. It must not be the case, as the French say, that, <span class="italic">'Celui qui triche gagne le plus d'argent'</span>, that is that those who do not comply with these directives make the most money. That is precisely what we want to prevent: unfair competition at the expense of, amongst other things, safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there was unanimity on the scope, namely that we should include third countries: we want to create a European transport area and anyone who uses this area must play by the same rules. We know that for various reasons companies move their headquarters to third countries, not only for economic reasons, but for other reasons too. That is why it is important over time for us to create this European transport area.</p>
<p class="contents">We wanted to build in flexibility. Exemptions have been discussed and obviously I do not want to mention all of them. We do however continue to attach importance to short-distance drivers and taxi drivers being excluded, although of course we also support exemptions in certain areas, such as for farmers, who do seasonal work, and for breakdown services. The concept of safety should not mean that the regulation imposes restrictions on the people who are actually responsible for safety.</p>
<p class="contents">One area where we are still undecided is courier services. Some think that they should be in, while others believe that the numerous accidents are not related to rest periods and driving times but are rather a question of speed. We have also introduced flexibility to the breaks. We did not just want weekends of between 24 and 45 hours, but also 36 hours. We also want to take account of those countries that are not in central Europe, because tomorrow, with enlargement, we have to bear in mind that the centre is going to shift and that it is not only going to be rest periods and driving times that will determine whether a haulage business is efficient or not.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not call into question the 12-hour nightly rest period either, with the related flexibility of nine plus three hours. This also applies to the daily rest periods and the short breaks. We wanted a certain degree of flexibility here, to take account on the one hand of each driver's work rhythm but on the other of the needs inherent in the job.</p>
<p class="contents">Safety was the other aspect that needed to be brought into the equation. Rest periods, daily rest periods and weekend rest periods are issues of safety and it is not unknown for overtired drivers to be involved in accidents. Nevertheless, we should not exaggerate this either. Some statistics show the risk to be very high. Overall we work on the basis of realistic statistics showing that this is the case for around 15% of serious road traffic accidents. This is not about singling out the roads yet again for wholesale condemnation. The initiative being taken here by the Commission and Parliament will, I believe, improve safety.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as infringements are concerned, as we see it taking vehicles out of service is the best approach. This is not at odds with the legislation in the various countries and only one thing is required, namely that the vehicle should be taken out of service until the failure is corrected. In short, I would say that by adopting the stricter rules in this regulation, and by creating new conditions, we can have a positive economic impact on this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">This will, however, do nothing to change the fact that in the future road transport will continue to be one of the major players in transport as a whole. I am referring here to the discussions that we had earlier. This does not in any way mean that if we want to bring about a modal shift it can only be done by adopting legislation on road transport. Instead this must go hand in hand with clear initiatives in the other transport sectors. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It read: fresh goods need fresh drivers. It is actually the case that we are usually more concerned with the economy and competition, and that all too often the issue of safety and the life and health of the public is given short shrift. We recently experienced the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster. When there is an accident at sea or in the air the public in Europe is outraged, but the daily deaths on our roads are something that we have obviously become accustomed to. We should not become accustomed to them, however, because there are – as the statistics show – two main causes of accidents on our roads. The first is HGVs with overtired drivers, who are at the wheel for far too long, and the second, increasingly, is the express services, the so-called sprinter class, which represent the greatest potential for danger on our roads and motorways. That is why it is absolutely crucial for us to include these express services, this sprinter class, in this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the committee we arrived at a consensus on a series of sensible rules for driving times and rest periods that are realistic and geared to the needs of both drivers and companies. I think it is sensible, if at all possible, for drivers to spend their weekly rest periods at home, where they live, with their families. It is also sensible, if they are nearly at a ferry and can spend their rest time there, for the driving times and rest times to allow them to reach that ferry. Obviously it is not sensible to spend a rest time in a travelling vehicle, and we have therefore stated this in the text.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Grosch has already said, we can adopt as many wonderful, detailed, even obsessively detailed, rules as we like, but if they cannot be enforced then they are just words. For me, in any case, this is also one of the most important points. At present we have an average inspection rate of barely 1% and it is actually only possible to carry out real inspections, real checks, if both the roadside check on what the vehicle is doing and the check on the undertaking are done in tandem. However, practice in the Member States of the Community is very variable and it is for this reason, Commissioner, that the transitional period, between our bidding farewell to the traditional tachograph and introducing the digital tachograph, has to be as short as possible, so that we can inspect all of the HGVs in the Community by means of a digital tachograph as soon as possible. The fact that this allows a period of 28 days to be monitored in a roadside check will make a huge contribution to improving safety on Europe's roads.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the rapporteur, Helmut Markov, who has done a good job, was very willing to compromise and united us behind his proposals, and also the other Members who were shadow rapporteurs for this dossier.</p>

He has done a thorough job and, furthermore, listened to those of us who have a different opinion with regard to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Road safety is an important matter. From the point of view of the transport sector it is also essential to improve the social status of drivers and the esteem they are held in. The Commission proposal, however, was badly drafted. In the committee debate we were able to improve the proposal, although, in the opinion of our group, the end result is still not acceptable. The proposal would increase inflexibility and lead to practices that would be difficult to monitor and which would cause the sector to incur additional costs. Furthermore, natural breaks at work cannot be taken advantage of. The new regulation will not improve road safety either.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group is proposing that we reject the Commission proposal and ask the Commission to carry out a thorough study of the need to change current rest periods, taking digital tachographs into account. We have also put forward important proposals for improvements in case the rejection proposal is blocked. The basic idea behind them is that the provisions on rest periods in the current regulation are adequate provided that they are complied with and monitored effectively. More effective monitoring will lead to better results than if the provisions are merely made more stringent on paper. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His report examines rules that will simplify a very complicated area. Driving is one of the hardest and most pressurised jobs there is. The seat behind the wheel in buses and lorries is a back-breaking place of work. The simple new rules proposed by Mr Markov would ease the burden of work. It is to be applauded that Parliament can play a part in simplifying the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Assaults are one of the major problems encountered by drivers when they take rest breaks on European motorways. It is more urgent than ever to cooperate on preventing the increasing violence on our motorways.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to draw attention to increased safety on motorways. This is relevant not only to professional drivers but to all of us who drive on European roads. All too often, we have seen accidents caused by tired drivers. The simple new rules would mean that no one could be in any doubt as to when and for how long drivers were required to take rest breaks. It would be easier for the police to monitor that the rules were being complied with. I very much hope that the police would also increase the level of checks they made.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also say that I am very surprised that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is giving more consideration to the cost of equipping lorries than to the deaths of 40 000 people each year on European highways. What the ELDR Group is displaying here is penny-pinching at its worst. They should be ashamed of themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Safety in road freight transport concerns everyone who lives in the EU, because – and the statistics are clear about this – overtiredness at the wheel kills! A study by the European Safety Council shows that more than 50% of drivers admit that they have fallen asleep at the wheel at least once in their driving careers so far. What then is to be done?</p>
<p class="contents">We Greens think that the working times in this sector, the driving times, need to be reduced. We have tabled an amendment stating that they should be reduced to 80 hours every two weeks with a maximum of 45 to 48 hours in any one week. What we have at the moment is 56 hours per week. That is only the driving time. On top of that there is loading and unloading. There is no other job in industry that presents such a high risk for which we permit such long working hours.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, systematic inspections need to be introduced. As Mr Piecyk mentioned, when the regulation on the digital tachograph is implemented, we must exert pressure on all of the national governments to introduce checks on undertakings, the company card. If you talk to police officers they will tell you that this company card is the only way of effecting systematic checks on undertakings. Obviously we will have to ensure that this European legislation is respected in the competent overarching bodies, for example in the requirements for CEMT licences. I have raised this with Mrs Isabelle Durant, who is currently chairing CEMT, so that this issue is put on the agenda of the CEMT ministerial meeting of 21 and 22 April. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Shippers in particular say that the existing regulation is operating satisfactorily. Changes would have far-reaching consequences for the sector. On the other hand, plenty of reports are appearing which show that the provisions of the regulation are being completely disregarded. On the basis of the first point of view, therefore, no changes are needed, although they are needed on the basis of the second. I think that both interpretations are in some sense correct. In the final analysis there is not so much intrinsically wrong with the regulation. There is, however, something wrong with the way in which Member States interpret and apply the regulation. Partly as a result of limited and inadequate opportunities for control, contraventions of the regulation are not uncommon, with all the consequences this has for road safety, competitive conditions and the viability of this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to improve the situation, I believe that intervention in the existing regulation is inevitable. Two starting points are crucial here. Firstly, most of the current provisions can remain intact. Only a few provisions have proved to be open to multiple interpretations. A clear definition must be found for these elements. I therefore support most of the amendments aimed at reinstating the original text. I also support those amendments that clarify the existing ambiguities, like the separate rest periods. Secondly, we must tighten the provisions in respect of control and international coordination. Different interpretations of the regulation by national regulatory authorities obstruct the creation of a level playing field for competition in the European Union. We therefore support the amendments that aim to achieve qualitative and quantitative improvement of the controls. This also applies to amendments that are intended to achieve international harmonisation amongst regulatory authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, the emphasis must lie on simple, enforceable provisions, adequate controls and identical assessment standards by regulatory authorities. We believe that the report provides a good starting point for this. My thanks to the rapporteur for his work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report, and the original proposal behind it, would have grave implications for business and individuals alike. Even though several important derogations were won in committee, the concept of the proposal remains impractical, untenable and unenforceable.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, along with a number of colleagues, I have submitted an amendment which would have the Commission proposal rejected in its entirety. Indeed it seems to me that recent times have seen the transport industry being hit hard by piece after piece of excessive legislation. The by-word seems to be: if it moves, regulate it.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to justify to my constituents the ethics of a report which originally sought to bind road rescue services and public utility vehicles – all absolutely essential to society – to strict new working hours.</p>
<p class="contents">These requirements about working time prevent professionals from doing their job efficiently by imposing strict terms on when breaks have to be taken. Once again we see Europe hamstringing business rather than liberating it.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of a common range of penalties in particular is worrying. This clearly gives licence to interfere in matters of national sovereignty and national autonomy. Indeed the subsidiarity and extraterritoriality issues apparent in this report are clear examples of the report itself being over-extended.</p>
<p class="contents">British Conservatives by their very nature oppose such restrictive legislation being piled on business. We believe that this particular piece of legislation is unnecessary, highly excessive and has little relevance to the needs of business and employees alike. It takes no account of the need for flexibility in key areas of transport, pays scant regard to the consumer and seems contemptuous of the need for Europe's industry to remain competitive, a cornerstone of the Lisbon Declaration. I therefore have no hesitation in urging this House to support our key amendment to reject the proposal in its entirety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The fundamental axis of this report is road safety. As some honourable Members have said, lack of safety leads to 40 000 deaths and 1 750 000 injuries per year in the European Union. And there is great consensus on the part of all the groups with regard to the need to achieve the objective of safety.</p>
<p class="contents">But here the differences begin, and we are producing proposals which will give the Council work, because the Council will have to take a position on many points on which in this House we are naturally not going to achieve unanimity.</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically, we are talking about one of the factors of safety. It is true that there are technological factors, there are infrastructure factors, there are many agents involved in the question of safety or lack of safety, but I believe we must focus on the essential factor, the human factor, the driver in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of Mr Markov’s proposals, and with his cooperation, the report has developed, leading to greater flexibility for the driver, because it is the driver who is aware of levels of tiredness at any given moment and it must be they who call the shots in terms of rests and the distribution of working time.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a gremlin which creeps into all these debates and that is that sometimes this flexibility can be used by the transport company to counter the driver’s capacity to decide. If this were the case, the system of controls on companies would have to be extremely strict, since we are talking about risking lives, in particular that of the drivers themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also talking about a very important European small or medium-sized enterprise, the transport enterprise, which we must promote and whose competitiveness we must defend. And we are talking about a transport problem in a Europe which is not equal, a Europe which has peripheral areas for which transport has an importance which is different to that of central areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this report has important objectives, but we must continue to work on it until we reach a consensus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it important, however, that, in connection with regulating the safety of road transport, we obtain a clear definition of the rules relating to driving time and rest periods, viewed partly in relation to features supplementary to these rules, such as the rules governing drivers’ working time, as well as checks that the rules governing driving time and rest periods are being complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">My country’s geographical situation is such that it is particularly important for us that transport be efficient at the same time as being safe. It is therefore important that the concept of driving time be defined as the period during which the vehicle’s wheels are turning and that there be no confusion with the rules governing drivers’ working time.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to warn against the proposals to change the present rules so as to extend rest periods because such changes could entail major expenditure without providing drivers with greater safety or better conditions. That is because the quality of a rest is not necessarily directly proportional to its length, and it is also important that drivers themselves be able to organise their rest periods and choose where they are going to rest. Everyone may agree that there are problems with the safety of transport on our highways, but that is not necessarily always because of unduly lax rules but, rather, because of inadequate checks and insufficient efforts to ensure that the rules are being complied with in practice. That is something we must do something about.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to add that I very much agree with my fellow MEP, Mr Blak, that we must also look at another problem for drivers. It is important that they be safer when they take their breaks. It is disgraceful that drivers should live in fear of assault and robbery. The Council has accepted that countries must make efforts in this area, and I am looking forward to seeing some practical initiatives soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know that we have had, and still are having, very great problems supervising and enforcing this. All sorts of special cases such as the Willy Betz formula, the Kralowetz affair, etc., and most particularly the regular occurrence of road accidents with all the consequences of these make it clear that we really have our work cut out.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Markov and Mr Andersson, for their constructive collaboration on this work. It will be clear that we are very much in favour of bringing this proposal into line with the proposal about the organisation of working hours, about which we had such intensive arguments in this Parliament not so very long ago. Of course, this also applies to the reinstatement of a wide range of definitions so that they are not open to multiple interpretations. We do not need flexible weeks; difficult definitions of driving times must be replaced; opting-out clauses must be restricted; and enforcement must be intensified.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, particularly like to focus attention on a couple of amendments which we are in favour of. Firstly, Amendment No 90 on the reduction of the 90-hour driving time over two weeks to 80 hours. We think that this is an important safety issue. Secondly, the amendment concerning improving checks by linking the digital tachograph directive to this regulation. Finally, we have a joint amendment from a number of parties about reducing the shortened daily rest periods of not less than 10 and not more than 12 hours, for which I request your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seems to me that the Commission is no longer content just to set harmonised standards; it is now moving firmly into setting standards and priorities for enforcement. Within the narrow confines of this legislation, ensuring standards for adequate enforcement certainly has its own internal logic, but there is more to it than meets the eye.</p>
<p class="contents">Road transport enforcement is carried out by a variety of agencies, most of which have multiple responsibilities and duties. In this instance, the main burden will fall on police forces whose duties also extend to dealing with a wide range of criminal matters outside the scope of this regulation and the scope of Community law. With resources painfully limited, the decisions on how these resources should be employed should be local decisions, based on an assessment of the needs of the local communities and their different patterns. In this context, where the officers who deal with transport matters also deal with crime, such as burglary and other accident prevention, Community requirements in this specific area will almost certainly lead to a distortion of priorities, dictated not by local needs but by a supranational authority which has neither knowledge nor understanding of local conditions. As a result, national authorities, in their haste to conform with the requirements of the Commission in this area, will be neglecting other duties which are actually far more important.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not unrealistic, therefore, to suggest that burglars will be able to roam free because police management, under pressure from national authorities, is more concerned with satisfying Community requirements. This is simply not acceptable. I will therefore be voting against this regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have objections to the proposal concerning driving times and rest periods in road transport in the form in which it was originally sent to Parliament by the Commission. The amendment by Mr Bradbourn, myself and a large number of fellow MEPs is therefore intended as a signal to the European Commission to stop using this old method of legislating. It is time we became aware of the bureaucracy we are causing. Making new regulations does not mean that they will be enforced any better than the old regulations, which were satisfactory but were not enforced either.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the new regulations cannot be monitored at all. Other regulations are only being amended on account of the technology used for monitoring, which had worked well for 17 years. An example of legislation that cannot be monitored and is therefore poor is the new attempt to tell self-employed contractors how long they may work. My colleague Mathieu Grosch has improved the proposal a great deal, and it will be thanks to him that there will in fact be a directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The question remains, however: what possessed the Commission to come up with such poor legislation in the first place? The last thing the sector needs is more new regulations. What it does need is well –thought through, intelligent and harmonised monitoring that also creates a climate for honest competition, monitoring that will apply equally to the 15, soon to be 25, Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that the European Commission supports attempts to create more extensive and more intelligent monitoring of freight traffic. I also know, however, that cooperation often depends on personal input and sympathies and therefore still takes place on a relatively informal basis. This difficult process must also be given more political support, and it is a pity that business must sacrifice flexibility for the sake of regulation, flexibility being the keyword in the sector. The sector has always managed to make its way through the increasingly stringent requirements and the difficult market with great creativity, but when I look at the profit figures, I fear that even this creativity will miss the mark. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am therefore grateful to all of the Members who have worked on it in the committees to bring us closer to this objective. Allow me, as a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and as someone from a rural constituency, nevertheless to make a number of critical comments.</p>
<p class="contents">At first sight, the title ‘harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport’ does not appear to have any relevance for agriculture policy. However, the Commission proposal contains a number of points which are also important for agriculture. Alongside vehicles that the layperson would imagine to be passenger, goods or towing vehicles in the conventional sense, namely cars or lorries, the Commission proposal also affects vehicles that are used in farming. Hitherto these were excluded by virtue of the old Article 13. If courier and express delivery services are frequently involved in serious accidents then it may well be justified to include them in the scope of this regulation. But for milk collection vehicles and tractors to be made subject to provisions of this kind as well does seem to me to be very arbitrary. Imagine what this means in real life: tractors – and some are really very small – with tachographs, or the driver of a milk lorry, who goes from farm to farm and can no longer have his little chat (rest period) with farmer X because he has to respect a very particular sequence of driving times and rest periods, as if he were travelling from Rotterdam to Munich. Let me give you another example: Article 13 provides for an exemption for the transport of live animals within a 50-kilometre radius. For vehicles transporting animal carcasses and offal there is no such exemption. What is the reasoning behind this? I view the restrictions that are to be introduced on breakdown vehicles in a similarly critical light.</p>
<p class="contents">The current regulation, which provided for exemptions in the areas that I have mentioned, certainly did not penalise the weaker members of society, but it was practicable. Thankfully my group has tabled amendments that mitigate some of these shortcomings in the Commission proposal. Nevertheless, I am certainly of the opinion that there will still be much more to correct before the second reading, precisely in the agricultural sector, if we want legislation that the public will understand and also accept. Anything else just causes bad feeling towards Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That would be the responsibility of Mrs Diamantopoulou rather than me. That is not my competence. I am talking about road safety. That is the objective of this proposal. If the social aspect were the primary objective, we would have to consider other issues. I am talking about safety on our roads in the transport sector and, of course, distortions of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the large number of amendments proposed, I will present a list in writing to the Secretariat of Parliament indicating the Commission’s specific position on each of them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a few general comments on the most important issues which have been raised here today, however.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the adoption of the sectoral directive on types of work, which lays down a method for weekly calculation, makes it necessary to adapt our Regulation, above all the provisions relating to working and rest times. The Commission therefore accepts the amendments – some with modifications to the wording – which clarify the text in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">We also accept those amendments – some reworded – which call for improvements in the control and application of the regulations. We will incorporate these suggestions into the proposal on road controls which we will present soon, bearing in mind that this is a different proposal – and this is my response to one of the speakers who referred earlier to this aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">We also accept the amendments which call for compatibility between the rules of the European Union and those of third countries and which call for the inclusion of smaller international transport vehicles in the legislation, especially those which provide courier services, as well as all those amendments which request a degree of flexibility in terms of permitting all existing practices which do not have a negative effect on the application of the Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we cannot accept the arguments that this proposal is not necessary, however. Seventeen years have passed since the original Regulation entered into force and both the nature of the market and European realities and technological developments, specifically the digital speedometer, have developed and changed considerably. The changes therefore have to be incorporated. The Commission will ensure a balance between flexibility and the control of application.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept those amendments which ask for more controls and imply an excessive increase in administrative burdens. And with regard to the exceptions and derogations, the Commission accepts those which are based on concrete realities, but not the generic ones which could be used to evade the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Markov, for this wonderful work, since he has had to deal with a real sea of amendments, but I believe that in the end he has been able to propose a balanced report which the Commission generally agrees with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
