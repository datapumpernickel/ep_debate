<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Katiforis (PSE)</span></span>  <span class="italic">, rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, Article 93 of the Treaty states that efforts must be made to harmonise excise, that Parliament must be consulted in this procedure and that the aim of the Treaty is to harmonise taxation to the extent that harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and the functioning of the internal market within the time-limit laid down in Article 14. Of course, Article 14 expired a long time ago, back in December 1992; however, as the internal market has not quite been completed, the purpose of the Commission's first proposal was to serve the objectives of Article 93, with which we have no choice but to agree, given that they derive directly from the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Because Parliament has a consultative role in the matter, the Council is pushing for a fast response from us. The Commission too has put pressure on Parliament, brandishing the fact that the Council is in unanimous political agreement on the matter, so all that is left is for us to endorse the Council's and the Commission's <span class="italic">faits accomplis</span>. This was, in my view, an unfortunate way of dealing with Parliament, especially on the part of the Commission, because it is tantamount to asking Parliament merely to endorse a <span class="italic">fait accompli </span>without making any contribution of its own whatsoever. Our purpose in life is not to sign blank cheques, Commissioner. And, may I say to the Council that I trust that its haste in requesting an urgent procedure does not mean that it is merely going through the motions and that it will give serious attention to Parliament's opinion, into which, I can assure you, we have put a great deal of thought.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has already rejected the previous Commission proposal by a large majority. The main tenet of that proposal was to impose a minimum fixed tax of EUR 70 per 1000 cigarettes, alongside the minimum 57% tax charged on the most popular market brand. I do not want to go into the technicalities of how this tax is calculated at this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament rejected the proposal because it accepted the following arguments: first, imposing a minimum fixed tax would put small and medium-sized tobacco companies at a distinct disadvantage. Assuming that the only way a small tobacco company manages to get its most popular brand on to the market is by reducing the price, it immediately faces a heavy fixed tax which bears no relation to its production costs, putting it at a disadvantage in relation to large tobacco companies. Secondly, the immediate effect of the Commission proposal was to increase prices in southern countries, where per capita income is lower than in the northern countries in the main zone of the Union. Insofar as taxes were harmonised, they were harmonised upwards, by increasing prices. Parliament had, in fact, called for this sort of harmonisation in the past, but it was clear from the last vote that the new Parliament voted in took a different view and in 1996 and 1999, Commissioner, the rapporteurs voted against the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Parliament is now convinced that constantly increasing the price of cigarettes does not achieve the objective, which I support, of reducing smoking; all it does is to reduce legal sales of cigarettes and encourage cigarette smuggling which, in some countries, has reached worrying proportions. In addition, the Commission proposal would result in astronomical price increases in candidate countries of 200% to 400%. Consequently, the Commission's old proposal, which in essence forms the basis for the Council's political agreement, does not serve the purpose of Article 93 because it tends to destabilise rather than consolidate the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as the Commission and the Council are determined to stand by their initial position, although they have no reason to do so, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has asked me to table a compromise proposal. This proposal is as follows: the Council can adopt the Commission's initial ideas and Parliament will withdraw its opposition to them. However, it will call for an alternative method of harmonising taxes. This alternative will be based on a combination of minimum excise duty of 57% plus a minimum value added tax of 15% which, once the relevant mathematical formula has been applied, gives a harmonised tax of around 71%. So what we propose is to introduce two methods of taxation and to allow the Member State in question to choose between them.</p>
<p class="contents">The pros of this solution are as follows: first, it will not push up prices and put the industry in certain Member States in the south at a disadvantage. This is, of course, vital to the candidate countries, as I have already said. Secondly, it will help to harmonise prices, in that we already had price convergence with the minimum 57% tax and it was the value-added tax which was causing the fluctuations. Consequently, our new proposal does more for harmonisation than the Commission proposal. Thirdly, it allows Member States to protect their small and medium-sized enterprises from distortions of competition caused by imposing a fixed tax. And by shifting the focus away from price increases on cigarettes, these measures will discourage smuggling.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the Council should show courage and imagination, accept the two different versions and leave the final decision to the Member States. I am positive that the new proposal, which I am confident my fellow Members will support, has so many advantages that the Member States will opt for it and we shall soon have just one system of harmonised taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to finish, Commissioner and members of the Council, by saying that I, too, want to see smoking reduced. But I do not think that we can do so by constantly hiking up prices. Cigarettes are already extremely expensive in Europe and smoking shows no signs of abating. Which is why I am against the amendments tabled by Members trying to support the anti-smoking campaign by raising prices. I do not think the price mechanism can be used to achieve everything. There is much that it can be used to achieve, but not everything, which is why I am against these proposals. This is my compromise proposal to Parliament and I call on the Commission and the Council to take it seriously and not to look on it as a mere formality, because that would be insulting to Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am speaking particularly on behalf of the UK PSE delegation in order to say that we will not be supporting this report for many of the reasons that Mr Katiforis has already outlined. We do not accept the argument that price makes no difference to the amount of cigarettes consumed. In fact, I have figures here from the UK, which show that a 10% increase in the price of cigarettes leads to a 4% decrease in consumption. So there is a link between the cost of smoking and the amount that is actually smoked. That is the case that the UK PSE delegation is making, particularly with regard to Amendments Nos 2 and 3 on reducing the excise duty below that set out in the original report.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for Parliament to vote against this report, because very recently we adopted the tobacco directive, which, as we all know, took various public health measures to reduce smoking. It therefore seems very inconsistent to adopt this report, which seeks to pass measures and form opinions which will, to some extent, go against the measures we have already taken on public health grounds. That is not to say that we do not understand the issues raised about the applicant countries and about small and medium-sized tobacco producers. If voting against this report has an effect on them, that is unfortunate and is not something that we would wish to see. But when we are discussing tobacco we are talking about a product which is harmful to health wherever you happen to live, and that is the main argument. This is a health measure rather than anything to do with production or with harmonising duty, though that we accept the latter as a principle. I felt that I needed to explain our position and say why the UK PSE will be voting against this report later today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maaten (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, it is obvious to us, too, that increased prices lead to a drop in the consumption of tobacco products, particularly cigarettes and hand-rolling tobacco. The situation in the United States and Sweden, where excise is very high and consumption relatively low, illustrate this trend, as well as a study conducted by the World Bank. In two previous resolutions from 1996 and 1997, the European Parliament left no doubt as to the fact that it is seeking an upward harmonisation of tobacco prices by means of increased excise duty. As the Commission proposes in the explanatory note, the new minimum excise amount in euros for cigarettes is based on the average excise yield in the Member States, namely EUR 90 per 1 000 cigarettes and subsequently reduced to EUR 70 per 1 000 cigarettes in order to prevent the majority of the Member States from having to increase their excise duties. It is, in this connection, once again worth mentioning that the excise yield in nine Member States is even more than EUR 70 per 1 000 cigarettes. This is why my group is opposed to a further reduction.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, Commissioner Bolkestein’s proposal is a big improvement on the current situation. He already mentioned health aspects during previous discussions a few months ago. We would like to further reinforce this aspect. We have tabled a number of amendments, in conjunction also with Mr Blokland. Firstly, there is the VAT issue in respect of which the rapporteur has submitted proposals which we support. Secondly, we believe that this matter should be firmly placed in the context of existing negotiations in the World Health Organisation. We are of the opinion that more should be done to combat differences in smuggling prices, since they form one of the reasons for fraud and smuggling, although they are not the only reason. In our view, a system should be considered during the four-yearly review by means of which the use of more harmful products can be discouraged. In the final analysis, and I am taking this opportunity to repeat what I have said before, it remains an unacceptable anomaly, on the one hand, to increase the excise duty on tobacco products, although partly for health reasons and, on the other hand, to continue to heavily subsidise tobacco growing in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it is hypocrisy on the part of the Commission to maintain that it is helping to protect public health by introducing more taxes on tobacco products, which are a widely consumed product, when it leaves consumers at the mercy of very dangerous products in the food chain, imported tobacco products of dubious quality, and is pushing for health to be completely privatised.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is for sure: increasing taxes – and hence the price to the consumer – will not reduce smoking. Otherwise it would surely have happened by now. What will happen if taxes are increased is that consumers on lower incomes will be forced to buy cheaper contraband cigarettes from third countries which are possibly even more damaging to their health. In other words, smuggling will increase, not decrease, as the Commission maintains. The proposed measures will increase the cost of living at a time when consumers' wages are constantly being eroded by the policy of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The campaign against smoking and the campaign against tobacco cultivation in the European Union have become one and the same and we are against that. The campaign against smoking benefits consumers' health, while the campaign against tobacco cultivation benefits large-scale producers and industry, mainly in the USA, to the detriment of tobacco farmers and processors in southern Europe. That is precisely why we are against abolishing or even reducing tobacco-farming subsidies, as many would have us do. That would wipe out tobacco farming in the European Union, which would then be wholly dependent on imported cigarettes.</p>
<p class="contents">These are just some of the reasons why we are against any form of additional excise because, as I have already said, it does nothing to protect public health; in fact, it may well have the opposite effect. Finally, we suggest that revenue from tobacco taxes should be used to fund education, preventive measures and centres where smokers can kick the habit and obtain treatment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, Mr Katiforis’s report lacks this required clarity. However, the report has made it clear that the rapporteur wants to protect the interests of the tobacco industry, and particularly in those countries where products are also available at low prices. The rapporteur’s approach serves the interests of the cigarette industry and not the interests of the citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore very disappointing to note that the rapporteur confines himself to amending the Commission proposal where the level of excise duty is concerned without giving a reasoned consideration. This consideration is something which the European Commission itself does give with regard to increasing excise duty, namely in terms of promoting a well functioning internal market and discouraging smoking by pursuing a consistent and convincing policy. This is underlined in the amendments I have tabled together with Mr Maaten. In the past, Parliament has in two resolutions clearly called for an upward fiscal harmonisation of excise on tobacco. The claim that the increase in excise would encourage smuggling is not proven. Quite the reverse, in fact, smuggling practices occur precisely in those areas where tobacco products are cheap. However, research has shown that the increase in tobacco prices encourages people to quit smoking and deters non-smoking young people from taking up the habit. It will be to the credit of Parliament if the amendments that I have tabled together with Mr Maaten are adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to note once again that, sadly, one billion euros’ worth of tobacco subsidies still go up in carcinogenic smoke. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel that this is a benchmark we must not disregard.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another factor that we must not lose sight of. The British Member said that increasing prices leads to a reduction in cigarette consumption, and this is evidence to prove it. However, what happened in Italy is that an increase in cigarette prices brought about by an increase in taxation did indeed reduce the consumption of cigarettes sold on official markets but only because it greatly increased the consumption of contraband cigarettes. This is especially true in that cigarette smuggling takes place not between European countries with differing excise duty levels – and we would point out that excise duties in the United States vary from State to State – but from outside Europe to inside Europe: cigarettes are smuggled from Montenegro across the Adriatic and by this route to the whole of Europe. Moreover, we will be in danger of exacerbating this phenomenon of criminal, mafia smuggling if we continue to pursue this policy of increasing excise duties. The positive results obtained in terms of public health in the United States – I want the Members to understand this – were pursued and achieved by applying lower rates of excise duty than in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I fully agree with what the rapporteur said about the legislative procedure, the role of Parliament and the need for loyal cooperation between the institutions. I also agree with the rapporteur on his modifications to the Commission’s basic proposals. The Commission proposes a special tax, an abscissa of 50% with a threshold of 70%. Mr Katiforis proposes, firstly, to reduce this threshold to EUR 60 – a proposal which my group agrees with – and secondly, to offer the States which this directive is aimed at an alternative option: to apply the rate of 71%, including within this rate both special taxes and valued-added tax.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this is an innovative and important approach which respects the principle of price proportionality, which to a certain extent puts an end to the minimum threshold, and introduces a degree of clarity into indirect taxation. The accumulation of indirect taxes and value-added tax have been repeatedly condemned by this Parliament and this option – to establish a combined minimum level for the two taxes – seems to me to be a good solution.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with the rapporteur that price plays a part in dissuading people from smoking, but it is not the only method, and we therefore expect the Commission to send us supplementary proposals soon, aimed at putting an end to this habit.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree that the price increase in coastal and border countries may lead to an increase in fraud. I would ask the Commission to strengthen the cooperation procedures in order to eradicate fraud, which is one of the elements that erodes indirect taxation, especially here, but we will talk about that later with Mr Bolkestein, in relation to the Kauppi report.</p>
<p class="contents">Congratulations, Mr Katiforis. On this occasion you can count on the support of my group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, adopting the Commission’s proposal, we would ultimately have made the legislation too inflexible and created great difficulties, particularly for the manufacturing sector, with the result that the cost of national production – especially in southern Europe – would have increased and its quality decreased. There would also be an increase in smuggling, as has already been pointed out. In particular, we feel that the idea of a fixed amount minimum excise tax on cigarettes, as proposed, would not have protected – or rather, would have compromised – equality in the field of competition between very large and small and medium-sized tobacco companies, thus leading to distortion of the principle of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, Mr Katiforis’ report focuses on three goals. Firstly, the goal of tax harmonisation – it proposes a rate of 71% – in that VAT rates are made subject to a common rule for we are imposing a total tax for the first time: excise duties plus VAT; by taking this line, we will achieve greater convergence and avoid indiscriminate price increases and penalising the manufacturing industries of the Member States of southern Europe. Secondly, the goal of combating fraud and smuggling. Thirdly, it also achieves the aim of greater prevention of health risks, which is not obtained through continually increasing taxation but, we feel, especially through specific investment in research too.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we feel that the position on cigars and cigarettes as presented in the Katiforis report is more convincing in that it also avoids potential employment slumps, thus safeguarding the principles laid down in Article 127 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr Katiforis, the Italian members of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, European republicans, democrats, Italy of Values members and liberal socialists will support your report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the year 2000 smuggling of tobacco caused losses of GBP 3.8 million to the British Exchequer. Her Majesty's Customs and Excise have been able to cut the cross-Channel bootlegging of tobacco by an impressive 76% since March 2000. The bootleggers are up in arms at this, but now, with the Commissioner announcing his intention to take action against the United Kingdom for creating barriers to the free movement of goods, the door could be opened even wider to give smuggling an even greater field day.</p>
<p class="contents">The cheap smuggled tobacco has produced new smokers among the young people in the United Kingdom. That is a tragedy. It has also threatened the few remaining jobs in the British tobacco industry. The British tobacco industry should have an even playing field with the tobacco manufacturers in the rest of the European Union and should not be penalised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We will be supporting a number of Mr Katiforis' amendments because they make a bad proposal rather better.</p>
<p class="contents">However, overall, we cannot give our support to this proposal because we do not believe in the upwards harmonisation of tobacco taxes. Tax is a matter for nation-states, for domestic governments, and should remain the preserve of domestic governments, which are democratically elected and democratically accountable, tax being one of the most fundamental aspects of nationhood and statehood.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we are by no means convinced by the health arguments on smoking and tax. We are increasingly concerned that ever-spiralling levels of tax on cigarettes may lead to increased smuggling. Such illegal smuggling of cigarettes from outside the European Union is now causing a great deal of concern and may lead to an increase in smoking, certainly in my constituency and much of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">So the health issues in favour of high tobacco taxes are not clear cut but, even more importantly, we do not believe in the upward harmonisation of excise duties or, in particular, the upward harmonisation of tobacco taxes. Hence, we will be opposing the Commission's proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even those who are not even born are harmed by the fact that their mothers or fathers smoke. Smoking is therefore very much a public health issue. We must therefore do everything to prevent people from starting smoking. I know what I am talking about, Mr Katiforis, for I, myself, have been a smoker.</p>
<p class="contents">The words ‘public health’ do not even appear in the report. Mr Katiforis is a very intelligent and agreeable fellow MEP, but even intelligent MEPs are occasionally wrong. This time, Mr Katiforis is wrong. There is a lot of evidence to show that higher cigarette prices reduce the level of smoking. Less tobacco is consumed, and fewer young people begin smoking.</p>
<p class="contents">In my country, the Public Health Institute has calculated that the one-off effect of the increase in cigarette prices in 1997 was to save 12 500 people from premature death, thanks to the fact that 100 000 people gave up smoking when cigarettes became more expensive. We are talking here simply about my own country, Sweden, which has only 9 million inhabitants. As is well known, taxes in Sweden are, moreover, significantly higher than in the EU generally.</p>
<p class="contents">The arguments are therefore in favour of our being obliged to accept the Commission’s proposals. However, I do not believe it is sensible for the EU to support tobacco cultivation at the same time as great efforts are being made to prevent smoking and reduce the spread of cancer. We must be a little more consistent and not engage too much in double standards. I therefore hope that Parliament will support Mr Maaten’s amendment and, through it, the Commission’s proposal too, albeit in a somewhat stricter form. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the Commission is sticking to its plan to raise the minimum rates of excise duties. Today's are on tobacco; according to my information, the Commission wants to introduce a proposal to increase excise duties and to abolish the zero rate on wine, even though it is a proven fact that wine drinkers are more intelligent and less prone to weakness of mind in old age. What else the Commission plans to cook up the day after tomorrow, I do not know.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal will not achieve the objective set for it, that is, the progressive convergence of excise duties in the internal market, and puts an unnecessary question mark against the balanced compromise achieved in 1992 under Luxembourg's Presidency between supporters of proportional and specific taxation. If this hapless proposal from the Commission were to be implemented, there would also be a massively greater risk of smuggling, especially in the countries of the South and in post-enlargement Central Europe, because the price of cigarettes there would increase by between 200% and 500%.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the campaign against tobacco consumption is concerned, which has to be pressed into service in justification of the Commission's exorbitant proposal, I can only reiterate that there is no proof whatever that cigarette prices slow down tobacco consumption. Far from it, smoking then even becomes a status symbol.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of these considerations, I reject the Commission's proposal. The amendments introduced by our rapporteur, leaving it to Member States to choose between excise duty at EUR 60 per thousand cigarettes and excise duty plus VAT of 71% of the price, represent the lesser evil, and, politics being the art of the possible, I will, of course, follow the rest of my group in voting for Mr Katiforis' report with full conviction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His report now proposes to approve the Commission proposal subject to two amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">The first amendment concerns the taxation of cigarettes and offers Member States a choice between two taxation systems. The Commission is, however, of the opinion that this will lead to less rather than more harmonisation of tobacco taxation. The option proposed would not oblige any Member State to change its level of taxation and would even make it possible for a number of Member States, including Member States applying relatively low tax levels, to lower their rates. This would be in clear contradiction to health policy objectives, as has been pointed out by Mrs Honeyball this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, the Commission cannot accept this first amendment. Moreover, it feels that one of the reasons why it is proposed – in particular the need to conserve the balance between specific and percentage taxation – is already taken into account in its proposal. As I explained previously, Member States affected by the introduction of the fixed amount in euro retain the flexibility they enjoy at present to determine the proportion of the specific and ad valorem components of cigarette taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">To justify the amendment, the report also points to the situation of candidate countries, for which the minimum duty level should be an achievable objective. But offering them a choice between two taxation systems after accession would leave us with a wide gap between their tax and price levels and the tax and price levels of the present Member States, resulting in substantial revenue loss for present Member States. The Commission is aware that achieving the amounts in euro will require a significant effort from most candidate countries and has therefore proposed to the Council that limited transitional periods should be granted to candidate countries to reach the minimum rate of taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second amendment rejects the change in the definition of cigars and cigarillos. However, the Commission remains of the view that products having the characteristics of cigarettes should also be taxed as cigarettes. That change was requested by a number of Member States and has the unanimous support of all the others. It has also received substantial support from the cigars and cigarillo industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to comment upon the two other amendments adopted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. The first one suggests adding a new recital, calling upon the Commission to submit proposals to eliminate fraud and smuggling. The Commission shares the view that rate harmonisation in itself will not eliminate fraud and also that other measures are required to combat fraud and smuggling. However, this does not need to be re-emphasised. A number of initiatives to combat fraud in the sector of excise products, have already been launched following the 1996 report of a High Level Group on fraud in the alcohol and tobacco sector. The most recent example is the Commission proposal of 19 October 2001 for a decision of the European Parliament and the Council on computerising the movement and surveillance of excise products. It will be more appropriate to discuss the issue of fraud, which is a general issue relevant to all excise products, within the context of this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The second amendment concerns the upper limit of the euro amount proposed by the Commission and suggests lowering the amount from EUR 100 to EUR 85. The motivation of the amendment is that EUR 85 is easier to achieve than EUR 100 for the applicant countries, which today apply excise duty levels between EUR 6 and EUR 24. I would point out that this upper limit is not relevant to applicant countries. It is only relevant for Member States already applying a very high amount of duty but which, in spite of this, do not meet the 57% minimum.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I can say that the Commission sees this report as a step forward in comparison with the first report, as it endorses the need for enhanced approximation of rates of excise duty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is totally unfair to our Commissioners who come here to address us after they have listened to our speeches.</p>
<p class="contents">I wonder whether, at the start of this two-and-a-half years of your presidency, you might consider a five-minute break between the end of business and Members coming into this Chamber, because we cannot continue in this way, showing this discourtesy to our Commissioners.</p>

Your suggestion is one possibility. We also need to ask the huissiers to ensure that when Members enter the Chamber they are not engaged in conversation.
