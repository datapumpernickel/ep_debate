As you know, the European Council moved very fast after that with the conclusions from the Lisbon Council in March, containing positions on the transition to a competitive, dynamic, knowledge-based economy, and the initiatives of the European Council in Santa Maria de Feira on e-Europe and <span class="italic">e</span>-Learning. In a sense, therefore, this Commission text has been overtaken by events. In another sense, however, it has given the Committee on Culture of the European Parliament an opportunity to lay down a number of general guidelines relating to the policies of the European Union, which is not just an economic and monetary area; it is also an area of education and the European Union has a role to play in establishing a learning society.</p>
<p class="contents">These general – shall we say – principles and positions are contained in the report which I have drafted and I shall try briefly to set out the ten commandments of what I think are the most important points.</p>
<p class="contents">One: the European Union is not the driving force in the world here; it is lagging a long way behind, especially behind the United States; educational establishments are under-equipped in information and education technologies and, in this sense, we need to sound an alarm so that they go into top gear. An alarm which will result not just in our imitating the United States, but in a model for incorporating these technologies which is based on the political principles of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Two: information and communication technologies give rise to numerous risks of discrimination, inequality, exclusion and a new north/south divide in Europe, this time at technological level. There is a risk of inequality between countries, between regions, between social groups, between minors and adults, between men and women, between pupils and parents and between private and state schools. All these risks must be taken into account so that we design a knowledge-based society inspired by principles of justice, cohesion and equality.</p>
<p class="contents">Three: although we agree that the European Union should be proactive in this area, we must not lose sight, in parallel to these efforts and as we coordinate the efforts of the Member States, of the individual identity of each country and of the cultural identities and diversity which exist in the European Union, especially its linguistic diversity. There is a discrepancy between major and minor languages; we do not want one or more languages to hold sway over the others and we need to consider the specific difficulties of the minor languages which do not use the Latin alphabet.</p>
<p class="contents">Four: it is important that we help to provide the means needed so that these technologies can be easily disseminated, which means cheaper access, special measures such as preferential charges, tax incentives for equipping educational establishments and intervention to reduce telecommunications prices, especially the cost of accessing the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">Five: we must not confine these technologies to primary, secondary and tertiary and traditional forms of education; we must also consider adults, lifelong learning and all the people outside the formal education cycle and process, as well as taking account of the huge role of these technologies in combating unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Six: we need a humane model which is not based on information overload and which can be combined with pupils’ need for free time, with cultivating the imagination, with creativity in all sectors and with developing social conduct in school. Not technologies that individualise, isolate and alienate pupils.</p>
<p class="contents">Seven: special attention to teacher training so as to prevent computer rooms in schools turning into museums. This implies attention both to skills and to the educational and critical approach to these technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">Eight: not just processes emanating from above, but interaction with society owing to the wide range of circumstances and the complexity of the problems involved. These processes should not just put computers in schools and parents’ associations, psychologists and teachers should take part in them.</p>
<p class="contents">Nine: due to the rapid advances and changes in these technologies, we must study questions of budget, technological infrastructure and educational continuity.</p>
<p class="contents">And ten: the Commission, which has taken important initiatives – especially Mrs Reding – should perhaps study the results of these technologies in schools, the role of the Structural Funds, exchanges of experience between Member States etc. more closely.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I should like to say that several Members may perhaps have reservations on various points; I personally have reservations about Paragraph 23 on the general acceptance of the Bologna agreements; however, this report was adopted by a unanimous vote in committee and I hope that Parliament will do likewise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Perry (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, I am sure across this House, and between Parliament, the Commission and the Council, we all agree education is important. President Kennedy said of America: "Our progress as a Union can be no swifter than our progress in education." If that was true for America then, it is certainly true for Europe now.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure we also all agree that education's prime responsibility lies with, and within, the Member States. We should not forget that prime responsibility for education rests with students and scholars themselves. We should also do our best to give as much autonomy as we can to schools and colleges. The question we have to address is: what can Europe do? What can we add to the educational business?</p>
<p class="contents">The very existence of this debate shows that in the European Parliament, and indeed with the Commission and the Council, we have been pushing for more attention to be paid to the role of Europe in education. The prosperity of our Continent depends upon the level of education offered to our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The other reports we are debating this evening deal with the present and the future. My report deals primarily with the past. Some of it is critical, but it is critical of what happened in the past rather than what is happening now. My report is: White Paper "Teaching and learning – Towards the learning society". That is a very impressive title, but I am not too sure that the report was that positive.</p>
<p class="contents">After Lisbon and Stockholm, we are left in no doubt as to the importance Europe places on developing a knowledge economy. I am sure that with Commissioner Reding and her team future Commission activity in response to the increased priority for education agreed at the Lisbon and Stockholm Summits will be better than that detailed in my report. I am afraid that after reading the Commission Communication, I finished with not much more of an idea as to how far Europe had actually come towards the learning society, and which direction we wished to go. Sadly, I found the document vague, indicative of a lack of any real action over past years, although there were some notable exceptions.</p>
<p class="contents">The main objectives which the Commission tried to attain in the implementation of its White Paper seemed laudable: developing employability and boosting knowledge potential. I am not quite sure what was meant by helping to build a people's Europe – that seemed to be a vogue phrase of a few years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Commission's report did not really detail any concrete progress made by the Commission in the five objectives set out. It was rather enthusiastic, but vague in terms of the impact of certain actions. What we and the public – and certainly we as the budgetary authority – want to know is how much was spent? How much of it was new money (as opposed to funds already in existing programmes)? What was the European added value? What results were achieved? And what lessons were learned for the future? I ask the Commission to ensure that we have that information so that in future we as the budgetary authority can press for more funding for this very important work.</p>
<p class="contents">There are certainly many projects mentioned which are worthy of further exploration: the European credit transfer system, for instance. But as the debate we had earlier this evening shows us, 40 years on from the start of the EU, 15 years after the Single European Act, we cannot yet say there is mutual recognition of academic qualifications across Europe</p>
<p class="contents">There are some things that can and should be done at a European level. Europe with its richness of linguistic diversity presents problems as well as strengths. I would say: let us be realistic, rather than too idealistic. Can we ask the Member States to insist that nobody goes into higher education, unless they have a qualification in a modern language other than their own? Because in some Member States that is not yet a requirement. We certainly need to do more work on IT, but that is being addressed in other reports. I will not deal with that.</p>
<p class="contents">The single market requires a much more mobile workforce than we currently have. Mobility in Europe is less than half that of the United States. We must make our workforce more mobile, and that means more resources at a European level for careers advice and for work experience. I am quite sure that the careers services across Europe do not have enough resources to alert students to the opportunities in the single market of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say, however, that it is not just the Commission that can do things. Let me suggest one way in which this Parliament could help. We support, of course, educational exchanges of Erasmus, Socrates and so on in the European Educational Institute in Florence, but not enough students get the opportunity to experience Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I have long thought that the EUR 100m we spend every year on the use of this building for one week a month is a terrible waste of resources. I suggest that we give some thought to turning this building into a European university. That would be good for the students of Europe, the City of Strasbourg, France, this Parliament and Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, I see these elements as the principal merits of the two Commission documents: the communication and the action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">A correct interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity: the <span class="italic">e</span>-Learning action plan has succeeded in finding a niche in the sensitive debate on the use made by the States of their national education systems, demonstrating that the term ‘European educational area’ is a realistic, positive concept in which we must have confidence without fear of undermining the cultural identities of our countries. Moreover, the subject of new technologies is certainly one which we can develop further to enhance these common elements.</p>
<p class="contents">The second positive element lies, in my opinion, in the fact that the <span class="italic">e</span>-Learning action plan favours a positive and – I would add – social approach to certain typical effects of globalisation. In this sense, I must say, the action plan goes some way towards allaying some of Mr Alavanos' concerns, for there is no doubt that it provides for opportunities for access to the knowledge-based society as a way of avoiding imbalance, and, I would add, it gives new meaning to the concept of cooperation between public and private institutions. In fact, to some extent it enhances and focuses on the distinguishing feature of <span class="italic">e</span>-Learning, which is that a nation's education systems and teaching methodologies will always be more important than any other system, even systems of government, and they must therefore receive<span class="bold"> </span>the benefit of the greatest possible input from all the players in the establishment of a welfare community.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, before turning to any specific aspects, I am anxious to thank the Commission, particularly Commissioner Reding and her collaborators, for their willingness to help, and the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities for their extremely valuable contributions in recent months.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that, of the more specific issues covered by my report, that which receives the greatest focus is teacher training. I would like, as far as is possible, to illustrate the importance of this subject with an example. When Dante makes his journey through hell and purgatory, he is accompanied by a guide: Virgil. Virgil is a person with the highest moral attributes who, however, at the time, also has at his disposal all the best that the technology of classical culture can provide. For example, he uses the technology and technique of metaphor, and he does so in order to bring Dante to greater knowledge, to a greater and better understanding of the meaning of the world in which he lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Well then, if we do not now place European teachers in a position to make proper, realistic use of new technologies, we will be turning them into pseudo-Virgils, that is Virgils who will not be capable of guiding Dante – the Dante who is each of their pupils – along the path which will lead him to purification and knowledge, because they do not have access to the new metaphors, the new structures, the new digital technologies that can provide an educational system which is, at last, free from the constraints of a culture which is not infrequently disjointed and disordered.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this sense that the issue of teacher training is absolutely top priority, and the endeavours perceptible on some of the pages of the action plan are certainly to be increased and recompensed. They are to be increased and recompensed because it is the responsibility of all of us to realise that the effect of the <span class="italic">e</span>-Learning action will not just be reform of parts of our education system but genuine reform of the way we think. We will have to find a way to explain why this progression is necessary within the Union's education systems and how very necessary it is. In order to do this, I feel that the endeavours we make, including in terms of the budget and of clarifying the aims of the budget, will certainly have to be considerable.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by thanking our fellow Members once again and entrusting to them the heart of our message, in particular, which is that, as I have stressed, the new technologies are a tool, they are a means – not the end – but a means that is absolutely essential right now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am standing in today for Mr Gargani, who is staying in Italy for reasons you will understand. In this major debate on education we have added a question to the Commission and the Council – unfortunately the Council is unable to be present – because we believe that now, when everyone is suddenly talking about a European educational area, the European Parliament that has always talked about it and fought for it, but which has always been blocked by the Council of Ministers, cannot simply look on while it, the elected representative of the citizens, is bypassed in matters which are very important and which we have been advocating for a long time. I think it was indecent – perhaps that is too strong a word – improper to ask Parliament on 8 February for an opinion on the future objectives of general vocational training systems that was presented to the Council just four weeks later. Things cannot be allowed to continue that way! That is why we called for this debate and why we are asking to be properly included in the discussion in future.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all of the opinion that this report on general vocational training in the European Union is a major step forward after the Lisbon Council because it sets concrete objectives and defines the future role of general vocational training. This is an issue that affects all Europe’s citizens. I repeat once again, this is something we have said all along. As Socrates rapporteur, I fought for this together with my colleagues, ultimately without success. If success is coming at this late stage, I am grateful.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, however, always bear in mind that this is an area of policy that we cannot carry through without the support of the Member States. It involves matters that can be tackled only in the context of subsidiarity. We can give examples, we can make a synopsis of how things look in one country or another. Perhaps the Member States can learn from each other. There is no need to keep reinventing the wheel. We cannot, however, do very much more in these fields.</p>
<p class="contents">We should like to stress that the open method of coordination that the European Council called into being at its Lisbon meeting and in whose context this report was prepared must not be allowed to prevent the institutions provided for in the Treaties from fulfilling their roles. In our opinion, the general consideration of the future role of general vocational training in the context of the open method of coordination must have regard not only for the contributions of the Member States, but also, and, above all, for the contributions of the European Parliament and the Commission, while safeguarding the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">We reiterate that the conclusions drawn by the Stockholm European Council and the strategic objectives that were formulated can form the basis for a working programme for the coming decade. These things cost money, however. I should like to remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that we cannot always confine ourselves to fine words, making grand final <span class="italic">communiques</span> and calling on the Commission to act. At the end of the day, we all stand there and say: I hear the words, but I have no faith in them because the money for all the things we want to do is not there. So I hope that the Heads of Government, having realised that education is tremendously important in the European Union, far more important than many still think, will spend more money on it.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out to the Commission and the Council that we insist that, in the spirit of inter-institutional cooperation between Council, Parliament and Commission, the European Parliament must be involved in producing the follow-up report and in all the measures arising out of it as part of the long-term working programme. I am sure that the Commissioner will do that. I only hope that this will be passed on to the Council and that it will likewise follow in Mrs Reding’s footsteps. I also hope that we can work together on the things laid down in this working programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall limit myself to the recommendations contained in my written opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly: in education more attention should undoubtedly be paid to training in information technology both for pupils and for teachers. Students deprived of such a preparation run the risk of exclusion from the development of the new economy. We still lag far behind the United States as regards the use of information potential in education and business. Since no less than a quarter of newly created positions in the last decade are related to the information society, we must realise that students require thorough preparation. We must therefore also aim for optimum use of government investment in the use of technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: attention has been repeatedly drawn to the need to bring students closer to business in order to train tomorrow’s entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: the setting up of many more second-chance schools has become necessary, as the current number is far too low. Two pilot projects are planned for Spain, France and Germany – the large countries – but the Commission says nothing about the other countries. In view of the size of the large countries, five projects would be desirable while for smaller countries, at least two projects should be planned. By increasing the number of pilot projects, it might be possible to make the second-chance schools a more effective tool for strengthening economic and social cohesion and combating social exclusion more successfully.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally knowledge of languages, one of the principal European aims. Our rapporteur, whom I thank for his report, believes that even knowledge of two languages would be a success. In my opinion, I stated that I should like to go a step further. In order to promote integration and the opportunities for students in the labour market, in my view knowledge of three languages should be regarded as a minimum. Why? Because quite a few Member States have more than one official language. Belgium has three. Learning the official languages of the countries of which the students are citizens is obviously essential for their integration into the work process but an extra language in addition to the official languages is highly desirable. If we look at the most recent survey of knowledge of languages carried out by Eurostat, we see that less than half, only 45%, of citizens of the European Union can conduct a conversation in any but their native language. So there is a great deal of work ahead of us, but that is equally true of the rest of the issues raised in this instructive debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the light of recent job losses across Europe, retraining and education will be even more important in helping to adapt the skills of workers to enable them to find new jobs. For this to be effective sufficient resources have to be made available.</p>
<p class="contents">Lifelong learning has a much wider significance than that: it is also important for personal fulfilment and as a means of developing responsible citizenship, encouraging people to play a full part in their community. So it can help break the cycle of poverty and unemployment. Through informal and non-credited learning it can also be a very effective way of involving both adults and young people in the most disadvantaged areas, who are those most threatened by social exclusion and poverty but who often have very negative attitudes towards formal education and so are least likely to benefit from it.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Commission's White Paper "Teaching and Learning – Towards the learning society" missed the opportunity to produce a comprehensive report, including examples of good practice, which would have been of great value to all those working in the field. It does not contain enough information on how effective or cost-effective various actions were and there is little information on what was done to target specific groups such as women, elderly workers, immigrants, families in disadvantaged areas, the long-term unemployed and disabled people. So whilst there are universities, colleges and community groups as well as regional and local governments across the EU carrying out excellent and pioneering work in this field, this report does not really reflect that. Therefore I agree with the rapporteur that even as an interim report, on what was after all an ambitious White Paper, this is a disappointing summary of progress on this most important issue. I hope future reports will be more positive and can be useful tools in themselves for those working in education. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would remind you that, under the broad economic guidelines for 2002, adopted on 3 April, which are an important political instrument in budgetary matters, specific consideration is given to the <span class="italic">e</span>-Learning initiative as an important stage in the process of achieving the strategic objective established by the Lisbon European Council. This objective was to create a knowledge-based economy capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. In this context, I would ask the Commission to look into the possibility of laying down a more suitable legal framework, which will genuinely complement the action of Member States in this field. This is also the approach adopted in the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, annexed to the Mauro report. I would state once again that an initiative as important as this justifies the creation of a specific programme with its own legal basis. It therefore seems insufficient to use existing programmes, such as Leonardo, Socrates, Culture 2000, research programmes and Structural Funds, as sources of funding for the new initiative, which should stand on its own in terms of funding too. At the same time, we take the greatest interest in the way in which existing preparatory action is implemented in this field in this year’s budget, that is the budget for 2001. Lastly, I wish to congratulate Mr Mauro on his excellent work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities has once again found that women are still largely excluded from the Web. Internet activities and everything that goes with the<span class="italic"> New Economy</span> are still not the brave new world so far as women are concerned, as, incidentally, was also noted recently at a major international conference in Hamburg. Eighteen countries contributed their experience. There is a digital discrepancy. The ratio of women to men on the Internet is in the region of one to four. It is true that access is improving, but among people beginning their studies there are still only around 20% women compared to 80% men. When it comes to the formation of Internet-related companies, the proportion of women is still vanishingly small.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore calling for new access to be created specifically for women, for special software to be developed for women, because they use the Internet differently and because women are still lagging a long way behind in qualifications.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to act on the resolutions of the Lisbon Summit and create a knowledge-based society, we must pay particular attention to women. We must, for example, abandon coeducation in some matters. We must tread new paths here.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is particularly important that we catch up with the Americans. Here, too, we find that American women already have much greater access to the Internet. In some fields they have actually overtaken men. I think we still have a good chance of achieving something here with our action plan. I therefore ask that, in formulating the action plan, particular attention be paid to developing a greater and more specific involvement of women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall reply later to the discussion on the reports.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank Mr Gargani, who is represented today by Mrs Doris Pack, for his oral question concerning the specific future objectives of our education and training systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Above and beyond the question of who received what and when, or which report has been drawn up, Mrs Pack has said something of fundamental importance. She said that the European Parliament was the originator of every campaign to ensure that education is something other than a regional and national element and to ensure not only that the European dimension of education should be a matter for discussion, but that its beneficial effects should be recognised. We are almost there, Mrs Pack, because since Lisbon there has been a sort of silent revolution, an enormous step forward. However, even though we have made this enormous step forward, we must not forget that many structures, especially national structures, have remained in the old world, which is not so old as that, since it dates from only a year or two ago. We still have difficulties, therefore, in achieving a balance between the old-fashioned concept of subsidiarity and the concept of a subsidiarity which is very well able to collaborate with European interests. What I am doing, with your help, is performing a sort of balancing act, by trying to take a very big leap forward, while at the same time trying not to destroy the confidence of certain people who look askance, and with a critical eye, at any possible encroachments upon subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I should like to give a clear reply to the question raised by Mr Gargani. It is true that the European Council in Lisbon asked the Education Council, and not the Commission, to give general thought to the specific future objectives of our education systems and to submit a report to the European Council in spring 2001. It is the Commission’s responsibility to ensure that the Council makes progress, even though the Commission itself was not specifically asked to do anything. In the final analysis, however, it was the Commission which prepared the work of the Council. Perhaps it was because of the initial difficulties that Parliament did not receive the documents in question in time to enable them to react. It received the documents afterwards, immediately afterwards. We have learned a lesson from this situation, which was not the fault of anyone in particular but is inherent in certain procedures. This is why I think that in future we ought to operate slightly differently. After all, ladies and gentlemen, we are aware of the time limits. The Heads of State and Government took the decisions at the European Summit in Stockholm, on 23 and 24 March 2001, on the basis of the text adopted by the Education Council on 12 February.</p>
<p class="contents">It will simply be a question of continuing with the work. In other words, nothing new will be incorporated into the structure. There will be new material in the texts, I hope, but not in the structure, because now there will be follow-up action. Each time, the Education Council will prepare for the summits. The next Education Council, due to take place on 29 November 2001, is already preparing for the Barcelona Summit. Under the Spanish Presidency, and therefore in the very near future, before the Barcelona Summit, there will be another meeting of the Education Council.</p>
<p class="contents">This being the case, Mr President, I very much hope, with all my heart, that Parliament will undertake to prepare to meet these time limits. You know very well that I have tried to inform and involve Parliament in our current thinking regarding the follow-up to this report, and I can honestly say that I shall pay attention to any thoughts which the European Parliament would like to share with me during the course of this year. This is why I always insist that Parliament should be asked for initiatives on this subject, and believe me, at every Council I repeat to ministers how important the elected representatives of the people are in this area. I hope that the collaboration based on the continuation of the relationships that are about to be established will operate in such a way as to ensure that full consideration can be given to the contribution of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I should like to say that the ambitious goal Socrates has pursued for years, the creation of a European educational area, is now almost reality – and I hope it will soon be embodied in the texts. The Council, the Councils of Feira, Lisbon, Stockholm and now also of Nice, have stressed the importance and role of education and training in society and for the knowledge society. I should like to underline that today education and training are, first of all, the European Union’s most important political priorities; secondly, they are a political challenge and an economic challenge, because we all know that without education and training we cannot offer young people training places. Thirdly, they are an opportunity to further develop Europe’s linguistic and cultural heritage and give it European added value.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I want to address is that the Commission and Council really seem to be both maximalists and minimalists. Maximialists in the strategies and political ambitions they develop on paper. On the other hand, however, the European Union and, above all, the Council, is a very great minimalist when it comes to actually giving these great projects financial resources. Then it is always the Commission or Parliament or whoever that come in for criticism, but never the people who with great pomp and ceremony announce to the great councils how important training and education are. If they would provide the money for it the next day, we would all, especially our citizens, be very grateful.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has, in fact, always been mean in the budgets for education. I should like to remind you all of the dreadful Conciliation Committee marathon over the little bit extra we wanted for Socrates. I hope that the revision of this Socrates programme that will probably take place within the next two years will also bring Socrates a little more money. I am pleased, and Parliament can be pleased, that there is now an <span class="italic">e</span>-Learning initiative. We have heard, as Mr Costa Neves has said, that Parliament, represented by the Committee on Budgets, is pressing for this not to be at the expense of any existing programme. These programmes have their purpose! They have the financial resources for that and nothing else! I therefore believe that if we say that <span class="italic">e</span>-Learning is important, and we stress that it is, then there must also be a programme with the proper financial resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is that I regret and deplore the fact that we were not sufficiently involved in the general matters; I said so earlier on Mr Gargani’s behalf. We really must be responsible for the system’s specific objectives, we must help to bring this about and inter-institutional cooperation must be ensured. I assume I am reflecting what you said, Commissioner, you understood it that way and you will include it in future.</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth point is this: In view of the debate on enlargement and the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, we need our work in this European Union to be genuinely visible, we need a European educational area that is visible to the citizen. This means it must be really accessible to the citizen himself, and the citizen needs to be permanently involved in these programmes through the representation of his MEPs. We need the directives, we need ambitious objectives, we need measures, we need action programmes, with their own funding, of course, and if we do all that in education, then we shall not need so many Commission and Parliament information campaigns any more because we shall have reached the citizen where he is. I hope we can go this way together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They also make clear some of the issues which we now face in developing such systems. The first issue is the European educational area which hovers above all the reports rather like a question mark, and we undoubtedly have a variety of views on this: there is no doubt whatsoever, and this is without prejudice to the concept of subsidiarity, that we need to coordinate our education policies in the Union in pursuit of the Lisbon goals. If we do not do this, we cannot attain them: it is as simple as that. We need to have a coherent understanding of what constitutes good and what constitutes bad practice. We need to have an understanding about teaching and learning models, how we want to employ them, and what values we want to impart through them. We need to understand that this will involve considerable change, because of the new styles of education systems that we need today. We need to learn from best practice. We need therefore to have up-to-date hard and soft statistics to ensure that we can provide the most valuable benchmarks so that our systems match the very best.</p>
<p class="contents">These reports also point to the development of educational content. At the risk of courting controversy I would remind you that Cisco Systems and Microsoft are already in our schools providing content. We need to make sure that they are providing the sort of content that we want to see in our schools. We need mobility. It is not just the key to a successful European single market, it is the key to a successful Union in its social and political content as well as its economic content. The mobility report has made considerable progress on this, but, how long has Bologna been around and yet failed to gain widespread application?</p>
<p class="contents">How do we ensure equal access to mobility for all people when Member States do not have equal access to language skills? I would argue that for universal access to mobility we need to have universal access to language teaching and learning. Here, as elsewhere, new technology is one of the keys to unlock all of these solutions. We can install all the hardware and all the infrastructure we like all over Europe, but unless we have the educational systems to teach people skills in schools and in life-long learning, we will not be able to make the most of them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that today we are holding here this combined debate on the new technologies and mobility in education, shows that the European Union is really willing to work seriously towards this and in so doing we underline that importance. The three reports on <span class="italic">e</span>-Learning<span class="italic"> </span>by Messrs Mauro, Perry and Alavanos are excellent. I should therefore like to thank them warmly for the work that they have done. My group, the ELDR, attaches great importance to the <span class="italic">e</span>-Learning<span class="italic"> </span>project for both pupils and teachers. Better equipping of all teaching and training institutions, high-quality content are all components that contribute to a higher participation in the labour market. Obviously the exchange of best practices can play an important part in this and we at the European level can provide a stimulus. It goes without saying that we must not limit ourselves to mainstream educational institutions. Lifelong learning, even after one has withdrawn from the active employment circuit and training opportunities in the new technologies outside mainstream institutions, must both be encouraged. I have made that observation on more than one occasion. The socially and physically deprived must be involved and everyone must be given the guarantee that their efforts will be rewarded with qualifications that are recognised everywhere in Europe. This is important for the internal market. I shall follow the plan of action closely myself and I insist that we are given regular thorough reports and analyses.</p>
<p class="contents">One final point I should like to raise is: in the report on the future objectives of education and educational systems, there are extensive references to the use of ICT. However, it is careless of the Commission and the Council to have omitted to submit the report to Parliament. Although it was agreed in Stockholm that in education and other fields the method of open coordination would be used, it testifies to a great lack of democracy and transparency if that implies that the Council sends the reports to Member States without Parliament having any say. Surely the European Parliament, with its directly elected membership, is the obvious body to involve in open coordination. I understand, however, Commissioner, that you have meanwhile repented. I should, however, like to state clearly that my group feels that the European Parliament should have an input in the follow-up report and we must be very closely involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We live in a time of rapid change, but we cannot allow one half of mankind or perhaps a minority of human beings to keep up and others not. So that the whole question of democratisation confronts us with great problems regarding the technology we are discussing.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous speaker spoke a little while ago about lifelong learning. I read a plea for calling it instead ‘learning as you live’. In fact I prefer that. Because lifelong learning seems to be a mammoth task, while ‘learning as you live’ stimulates our curiosity everyday anew. For children it should be ‘learning as you play’. Also through the playful use of the materials available to ensure development, access to information, learning how to learn. In that connection I was struck by a complaint by one of those odd teacher figures at a school in Flanders who objects that he has now equipped his school with 200 computers and ensured that all those classes are accessible, but that there is no regulation governing the status of staff. There is no such thing as a statutory framework for ICT coordinators. It seemed an excellent idea to put this to you. Because if we simply go hammering on about infrastructure and not about the right way of using it, do not ensure the user-friendliness of teaching material in the educational environment and do not actually make it available and keep it up to date day by day, then it will all come to nothing. I remember the time when language labs were introduced into schools ; it was a great, fashionable surge and all self-respecting schools had such a language lab. You should go and see what a shambles they have become, and you are bound to wonder for how long they were actively in use. I therefore feel that we should be given the facts: what is the position now? It is said that in Flanders there is a computer for one pupil in every ten. I wish that were true, I hope it is true, but what do we want to achieve, where do we want to be in five years’ time and in ten years’ time? I hope there will not be a gulf between people who can keep up and those who cannot. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Luckily, a wave of protest has risen up against this policy in numerous countries of the European Union. In Greece, huge demonstrations by students, pupils and teachers against this reactionary policy to dumb down education have given rise to an explosive situation, rectors have resigned and universities have been occupied or even closed.</p>
<p class="contents">The trend towards mass education in the 60s, 70s and 80s has now been replaced by a new model in keeping with the latest demands of big business, which wants a constant supply of cheap, semi-skilled labour and a small, highly-qualified elite. What is being advocated is a new type of vocational training dictated by the immediate demands of the capitalist market, while scientific knowledge and specialisms are being shifted into expensive post-graduate study which few can afford.</p>
<p class="contents">Knowledge is giving way to skills, i.e. reading, writing, arithmetic and elementary use of computers, together with skills which will allow young people to adapt easily to capitalist restructuring, while teaching them to be well-behaved workers and citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Educational establishments are called on to become more responsive to fast changes on the job market. Abandoning wider subjects and, in general terms, a wider education in favour of skills which will make them employable deprives children – especially children from working class homes – of the rudimentary knowledge they need in order to function as active, thinking citizens and, as factors of social progress. Big business is trying to penetrate education, mainly in the aim of creating new profitable business activities, witness the reference to the famous link between schools and companies.</p>
<p class="contents">The reports under discussion, especially the Perry report, not only fail to oppose the guidelines in the White Paper, their sole criticism is of the delay in implementing them.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the people of the European Union must fight and overturn this anti-educational policy, they must secure their basic right to a free, high-quality, universal state education which is sensitive both to the productive requirements of each country and to individual vocations and talents. We, as members of the Communist Party of Greece, shall do whatever we can to foster this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that one of the most complex aspects of the history of Europe – where the same phenomenon is being repeated – is the tendency towards convergence and fragmentation, the tendency to come together and then move apart, to divide up into a thousand pieces. We are living in an era in which there is once again a process of inward-looking nationalism which is opposed to globalisation – clearly a misunderstood concept – and this process tends to divide States and regions. Culture and education are the main victims, since they become confined within their own borders. However, certain programmes can only be carried out from above.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the principle of subsidiarity is being wrongly interpreted and, in my judgment, is largely being distorted by States and many regions which use it to increase their own power and – it must be said – to enable the State apparatus to exercise control over thought and the education system. Of course the State must provide free education for all, but it must not exercise absolute control.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us imagine that aeroplanes could only fly as far as the provincial, regional or national borders. Well, in education we are endeavouring to prevent our cultural knowledge from travelling beyond the border and the result is clearly a broken and fragmented project. I therefore praise, applaud and believe in the idea that we must support the Commission’s vision through ideas, articles and resources, since the Commission is the only supranational body able to act in this field. I believe that one of our first debates should be on subsidiarity, because there is plenty of legal literature on subsidiarity and not just this current popular interpretation of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I believe that Europe is simply a common way of thinking or, at least, a capacity to communicate. In this respect, I believe – and I would also like to praise the forum which has recently been initiated with companies – that we will not be able to implement this project without private initiative. Since their powers are limited, the States cannot act beyond their own borders. We are now witnessing exactly the same phenomenon in the regions: each region is creating its own intranet (and they are all very proud!), or rather their <span class="italic">egonet</span>. The result is therefore a product which is the sum of many things, but the whole is never the sum of all the parts. I therefore ask for a debate to be opened on the principle of subsidiarity, in order to analyse the extent to which this often limits the freedom of our citizens. The companies are the only ones able, with the help of the Commission, to implement projects which fly like eagles above the mountain tops and have a global vision.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that a European spirit of convergence, and not one of fragmentation, is our only hope of ensuring that this programme is completed and is not a source of endless frustration. We must make sure that in two years’ time we are not talking about what we wanted to do but were not allowed to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not coincidental at all, because it all concerns the question: are we going to take a new initiative or not. What is the issue? In Lisbon, we took a number of important decisions with a number of concrete objectives. The question now whether or not we can realise those objectives? That is what today’s debate is about.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make two observations before I start, two things I find really regrettable. Firstly, and that is understandable in a way, I note the absence of a debate on lifelong learning. That will come later, Parliament will have its say on this, but I regret its absence because the concept of lifelong learning is, in fact, a very important concept that should be an overarching framework for the things we are discussing this evening. I feel the lack of that debate. I also often feel the lack of links to the concept of lifelong learning in a number of the reports. This is understandable because of the timing.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point a great deal less understandable and I will return to it shortly. Is it not strange that we should be debating education here and do not breathe a word about the Bologna Declaration on the eve of the Prague Summit. We simply have nothing to say on the subject, have we?</p>
<p class="contents">Let me return to a number of reports before us, very briefly. Mr Perry rightly said that his report tends to be about the past and to a much lesser extent about the future and the present. Rightly, but we can nevertheless learn a great deal from it. Mr Perry is absolutely right when he says that the Commission has not achieved its objectives. The objectives were not concrete, they were not quantifiable, there were no indicators and where is the European value added of that White Paper? Let us reflect on that for a moment. Let us try to define what European value added is. We are again on the eve of a debate on the future of Europe. Certainly there is talk of the debate on ‘demarcation of competence’. Definitely very actively in Belgium on the eve of the Laken Conference. However, what is ‘demarcation of competence’? What is the debate when we are discussing education? It is about subsidiarity. But then let us define that properly and for goodness’ sake don’t let us beat about the bush, we do that all too often. In the report of the Council on the future of education and training systems, there are number of interesting points, and a number of objectives, which I can support, but once again they are vague objectives, no indicators, no methods of measurement and then we are occasionally in danger of becoming bogged down in endless palaver, and we must absolutely not do so with the debate that we are now conducting, following the lead of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not succeed in moving towards open European coordination with the European employment guidelines as an obvious example, I do not think we will make any progress. In my previous life, I worked for the Flemish Minister for Employment. Well, in that Ministry, people toiled to implement the European employment guidelines. I wish that the education ministries in all the Member States would toil over a number of concrete objectives in order to convert them into policy, then we would have a true European educational area.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to Bologna. It is terribly embarrassing. I am scarcely, if ever, addressed as an MEP on European educational policy, except in respect of Bologna. I have received piles of letters and e-mails. Am I supposed to say, I am sorry, it was an intergovernmental method, the European Parliament has nothing to say about it? I would ask you urgently, Commissioner, to take joint responsibility with us for it, because the Bologna Declaration is not just about a number of concrete objectives, but also about the democratisation of education and lifelong learning. If we are unable to make that link I believe we will be missing a chance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Until now perhaps less weight has been given to it in relation to education. It is, however, becoming increasingly apparent that our children's future is indeed a digital future. Therefore preparing for the use of information and communication technologies is becoming increasingly important.</p>
<p class="contents">The training of teachers in this field is a top priority. I fully support this. But my concern is that once teachers return to their respective schools they return to find that very little ICT facilities are available for them. More often than not they find that they cannot communicate the knowledge acquired through training courses back to the children and make use of ICT in their classes because of lack of resources. Without the necessary tools to meet the aims of the <span class="italic">e</span>-Learning agenda, the goals of the Lisbon Summit will not be achieved. Having no direct jurisdiction over education in the Member States, how will the Commission ensure that these goals are being met and that Member States' governments will provide schools with the necessary equipment to realise these aims?</p>
<p class="contents">Another problems is that technology is advancing at such a rate that it has become necessary to update computer equipment every few years. This has been, and will be, an added problem for schools working within very tight budgets. It is equally important to make training and education in the information society available to all individuals throughout their lives to realise job opportunities and for personal development as well. This is important and reflects the trend and the decrease in heavy industries in favour of the service industries which rely heavily on digitally-literate personnel. Let us reduce the gap between Europe and the United States. Let us create an e-Europe which is accessible to all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am glad we are discussing so many reports together because it brings out so clearly how all the questions raised are interrelated as they impinge upon education policy and our lives. The various aspects of education policy cannot be separated any more than the subjects can be divided into different curricula with each defending his own the strongest. I think this debate shows that very well. I find myself in a pleasant situation today because my country, Austria, leads the field in Europe for schools networking in connection with <span class="italic">e</span>-Learning and the new media. Sixty-one percent of schools – that is 3 860 schools – in my country are connected to the Internet, including secondary schools, of which there are about 1 000. One thousand and ninety already have their own Internet sites. All universities are interconnected via the academic computer network and in that way also have access to the TEN 155 European high speed research network.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased about that, but at the same time it is not enough. It is a correct and important trend that we have started, but more needs to be done and I am therefore very pleased that the Commission and the Swedish Presidency have started the <span class="italic">European School Net</span>, the <span class="italic">e-scola</span> initiative. Only last week we saw how computers and the Internet are actually being used in teaching, to improve the quality of teaching and create new oportunities for learning with the objective of using the compiled teaching and learning materials and practical examples in the future and making them more widely available.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I thank you for your persistence in this matter. We are on the right road together. The destination is known, but we still have a long way to go. This brings me to a number of points in the debate. Firstly, the concept of subsidiarity. I am an ardent champion of the subsidiarity principle and I come from a country with a very marked degree of federalism. However, I also call on all Member States not to use the principle of subsidiarity as an excuse – as often happens – for failing to take necessary steps towards Europeanisation. For me, subsidiarity in this context means being close to the citizen, serving their essential interests regionally and individually, fulfilling necessary common European tasks, so we can face global challenges and fulfill our responsibility towards the younger generation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, education, as this example also shows, is not an end in itself, but education from school to lifelong learning to catering for the new stage in life that is old age is the prerequisite for achieving our goal of a knowledge-based economy that is number one in the world. Education policy is therefore the key to the success of economic policy. Education policy is the prerequisite for today’s young people holding their own on tomorrow’s labour market and for our fulfilling our role as Europe in worldwide competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to say to Mr Korakas, who thinks protests against these objectives are already beginning, that we as politicians must do all we can to tell people that this development is happening and we have to prepare ourselves for it.</p>
<p class="contents">Three points, therefore, to finish. First, as Mrs Martens wanted to say, it is not only about providing computers. There is also the ethical question: How are we to use what computers make available to us? The ethical question of their benefit is, like their handling, an important task for educational policy. We must also see to it that no new social time bombs are created between those who know how to use them and those who do not. If education fails to take the correct social action, that may become the new class war. I therefore also call for industry to sponsor schools so that all can have the computers they need.</p>
<p class="contents">The next point is lifelong learning. Let us do our best to see to it that senior citizens are not forgotten when it comes to training, because only by so doing can we attain the European objectives, keep pace with world competition, make enlargement a success and avoid setting off a new social time bomb. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We want to develop Europe in such a way that all people feel they are involved. For that reason it is natural that education should play a prominent role in the Union’s strategy. Good social policy will not prevent exclusion if the issues of equality of education and its high quality are ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">Investing in education and its availability will mean that the human resources that exist will be made effective use of. It will not then just be a matter of finding talented people and giving them the encouragement they require, necessary as that is: it is just as vital to ensure that everyone is provided with basic knowledge and skills. At the same time, education should help young people and adults too to discover their strengths and to achieve success.</p>
<p class="contents">In February the EU Ministers for Education adopted a report on the concrete objectives of educational systems in the Member States. The work is to continue. A follow up report is to be presented at the European Council meeting in spring 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport are pleased with this development. The Committee has been stressing the importance of a European debate on education for a long time now. We are, however, sorry that Parliament has been passed over in the preparatory work until now. This is not so much a matter of prestige as one of existing resources being underused. I am convinced that Parliament’s involvement in setting targets for education will bring with it an important European angle on the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Although education is covered by the principle of subsidiarity, not only does improved competitiveness need to be taken into greater consideration in the educational policy of different countries but also the point of view of individuals. European educational policy must be developed in such a way that it supports the movement of Union citizens and their mutual interaction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, lifelong learning is becoming more important to people's everyday lives, whether as regards access to opportunities to employment, or in using ATM machines to get cash, or having to go on-line to get banking and other services because local public services are being closed down in an era of competition and liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is important at this juncture in the European Parliament that when we speak about education we make sure that it is all-inclusive. Of course, we must pay due attention to people who are at present within the formal education system, and improving the Erasmus and the Escola programmes and other similar programmes is vitally important. However, we must not forget that we are now in danger of creating a new class of technologically illiterate people, who will be denied access to this new, wonderful information highway and society which we are creating.</p>
<p class="contents">So, over the next ten years – as my colleague has said – the area we should focus on is ensuring that people now in middle age are given the tools of knowledge, information and education in order to be able to live in the altered world which will be coming about. I offer my support to the reports which have been submitted. I know that the Commissioner will be most innovative in bringing forward new ideas for <span class="italic">e</span>-Learning and for education. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Reding,</span></span>  <span class="italic"> Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, much has been said, and indeed, much has been well said. I should have preferred to see a number of ministers sitting here listening to what Parliament had to say on subjects such as the European surplus, or observing the principle of subsidiarity while creating a European policy. I believe it is very important that ministers should hear with their own ears what the elected representatives of the people have to say.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all I should like to thank Mr Perry for his report on the White Paper. The White Paper dates from 1995. That is a long time ago. The revolution, if there was one, Mr Perry, happened last year, over the past twelve to fifteen months, in other words, since Lisbon. Since 1995, the ideas put forward, mainly by the European Parliament – and here I agree with Mrs Pack that the initiator of all this policy was undoubtedly the European Parliament – have been put into practice, at least in part.</p>
<p class="contents">On the recognition of educational qualifications, I am well aware that much remains to be done, but the system of credits within universities has started to work.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as mobility is concerned, I know that in practice we have not made much progress yet, but a decision on mobility was taken at the Nice Summit. We now have something definite to go on, which is much better than simply the grand ideas that we could discuss five, six or seven years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">As for language proficiency, things are moving in the Member States, thanks, amongst other things, to the European Year of Languages 2001, as a result of which everyone is discussing the subject, local authorities, parents, and teachers themselves. There is a change taking place beneath the surface. We can therefore expect to see this change making itself felt in the everyday practice in our schools.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to investment in education, this is an area in which I would let subsidiarity prevail, and I share the regrets of those Members who say that fine words should be followed up with budgetary resources. Yet there is no doubt that either most of the ideas proposed in 1995 are now being put into practice, or else we now have the tools with which to push them forward. So I am not as pessimistic as some Members of Parliament on this point, because I have seen, and I have felt, that the situation has been developing since the Lisbon Summit. A fundamental change is taking place. Of course, it is too slow, but at least things are moving, and that in itself is a major step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of lifelong learning, 1996 certainly represented one of the first steps forward in this area. I presented my memorandum on what Mrs Maes calls ‘learning as you live’. It would be marvellous to be able to implement this idea, but it is not the Commission who will be putting lifelong learning into practice in the Member States and in the regions. The Commission can encourage, it can push, it can come up with ideas, but when it comes to implementation on the ground, that is up to the Ministers for Education, not to mention the trades unions and the social partners. A whole new system of informal training schemes will have to be created in most Member States. Well, I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that in ten years’ time we shall still be talking about lifelong learning, and we shall probably have taken a few small steps forward, but we shall not have succeeded in finding a definitive solution to the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">As for information technologies, I shall come back to this subject in detail later, but here too an enormous amount has happened, from the highlighting of the problem to the recognition that practical action was needed. Look at the Netdays Europe initiative, look at the E-schools. Of course, at the moment there are only a thousand of them. There really ought to be five thousand, ten thousand, a hundred thousand. I am well aware of this. These thousand schools, however, represent experience on the ground. I should like to thank not only the European Parliament, which is pushing things forward, but also all those people who are working ‘at the coalface’, with a great deal of idealism, often alone, with very meagre resources, putting their hearts into it because they believe in progress. They are remarkable people, and I think we should say thank you to all those who, on the ground, are helping to put our ideas into practice. The <span class="italic">e</span>-Learning action plan is also helping to change things. Lastly, we are now in the middle of European Year of Languages 2001. I have already said this, but I will repeat it. We must learn the languages of our neighbours as well as our own mother tongue. Those who are doing nothing about it are beginning to have a guilty conscience. That, at least, is a start. We must continue to nurture that guilty conscience.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Members have mentioned subsidiarity. As far as I am concerned, the interpretation of subsidiarity is very clear. I respect it, but I want to create a European added value, networking, the exchange of information, and the dissemination of good practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to draw your attention, ladies and gentlemen, to the studies made of the quality of primary and secondary education. This is a revolution! Could you have imagined, in 1995, that ministers would ever have agreed to let strangers come and check up on their quality levels in education? Never! Yet this is now being done<span class="italic">.</span> The system is still not perfect, but comparisons make it possible for ministers to identify their strengths and weaknesses, and they are making efforts to correct any shortcomings.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards financial provisions, the White Paper does not contain any. In spite of this, we have drawn up an impressive number of pilot projects, which we have funded and which have often provided the basis for reforms on the ground. In recent years the Commission has wanted to play, and has indeed played, the role of an incubator of ideas, a driving force. In this respect I am thinking of the pilot projects on second-chance schools or the European Voluntary Service.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as second-chance schools are concerned, I had my doubts. I went and had a look at them and I was most pleasantly surprised. They are not intended to replace national education, but rather to solve social problems, and the results are excellent. The staff is very committed, they believe in what they are doing, and what they are doing is rescuing young people. It really is extraordinary. The project was recently the subject of an assessment, Mr Perry, which will shortly be referred to Parliament. This assessment confirms the great success of the pilot project and the thirteen schools. For instance, the index measuring the failure rate is only 6%, whereas in institutions or similar projects the failure rate is between 30 and 50%. So you can really see that progress has been made. In any case, I should like to see this system, which has proved its worth, being introduced in more Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The objectives set out in the White Paper were incorporated into the Luxembourg Process, the Cardiff Process and the Social Agenda. As you know, from now on education ministers will be taking part in debates on social issues, on the same footing as ministers for social affairs and ECOFIN. This represents an enormous amount of progress. It has not had any noticeable effect yet, but the main thing is to be present and to make a contribution. The views of the education ministers have been expressed in the demands they have addressed to the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">So, ladies and gentlemen, it is up to us to define the new priorities, to launch multi-annual programmes, to open up new debates, and to issue new challenges. I believe that we are on the right track, and we have every reason to be positive and optimistic.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this does not mean that we can assume that we have achieved everything already. That is far from being the case. Nevertheless, the machine is in motion and progress has been made. In 1995, all we had were grand ideas, but no practical action on the ground. Now, we are making progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to say a word or two about Bologna. At the first Education Council, which I attended, I found that Bologna was only the subject of an intergovernmental procedure. I made sure that it was incorporated into the Community context by associating the Commission with the process, on a joint basis with the ministerial troika.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the Swedish Presidency, I recognise that the time has come for fresh progress, and I am convinced that the ministerial conference in Prague will enable us to make that progress. I have already been in contact with the Belgian Presidency, because here too there has been some follow-up action, with a view to continuing in this direction. Now we are waiting for the Prague ministerial conference, and then the Belgian Presidency will take over again.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I can well imagine that the European Parliament will be preparing an own-initiative report, for example after the Prague conference. It is not always necessary to wait for the Commission to draw up a report before you act. Parliament has the right to take its own initiatives. Use that power, so that we can hear your voice.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the <span class="italic">e</span>-Learning reports by Mr Alavanos and Mr Mauro, I should like to thank Parliament, its rapporteurs and its committees, many of whom were involved, for the support that they have given me on this issue right from the beginning. Mr Alavanos and Mr Mauro have done a remarkable job, Mr Alavanos earlier, and now Mr Mauro. This is of vital importance, because here too this process helped us considerably at crucial moments, in defining the concept of <span class="italic">e</span>-Learning immediately after the Lisbon Summit, and in formulating the <span class="italic">e</span>-Learning action plan, immediately after the last European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to respond to the three fundamental messages not only expressed by the rapporteurs but also discussed by the Members of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the principle of access for everyone. You know that immediately after the Lisbon Summit the <span class="italic">e</span>-Learning plan gave rise to various initiatives in some Member States, aimed at installing computers in the classroom.</p>
<p class="contents">However, a computer in the classroom is not an end in itself. A computer is only a machine, a tool. It has to be possible to use that computer, and the fact that it exists does not mean that it is being used. In my opinion, therefore, we must never separate the tool from the person who is using it. In short, yes we must equip schools, but we must do more than that. We must equip schools but we must also have electronic communication centres in our local authority areas, because it is not only those who go to school who have to participate in the information society. There are also those who have left school.</p>
<p class="contents">Exchanging scientific information, enhancing the services provided by libraries, creating an accessible European educational network and specific services, these are all essential measures to combat social exclusion. Yet social exclusion will continue to exist if, in order to lend more weight to the statistics, we merely install computers without providing teachers with appropriate training. I have paid careful attention to the report on the position of women and the special training that they will need, in view of their quite different approach to the new technologies. I believe that we need to take this into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also train our teachers. We have discussed this issue a great deal in recent weeks. Teachers are the key to the success of <span class="italic">e</span>-Learning. Yet most of them are not equipped to use computers, and to ensure that those computers, and this software, this content, constitute an aid to learning. It is essential to convince them that they can teach differently by using new technologies. On this subject I should like to quote a phrase used by Mr Rocard, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, when he reiterated the argument that a radical reorganisation of education is called for in terms of physical space, time and substance.</p>
<p class="contents">We are faced with a new world, and there are not many of us who realise what that means. I would like to say here and now that this new world will happen not only as a result of participation by the public services but also as a result of the world of industry becoming more responsible. This is why, last week, I organised the first <span class="italic">e</span>-Learning summit in Brussels, in partnership with both the public and the private sectors. That summit was wonderful, because it provided a platform for some amazing exchanges, and at the same time it demonstrated how the private sector is becoming more responsible, the businesses, and the know-how that exists in this area. The ideal situation, of course, would be one in which there was symbiosis between the two. Though policy decisions have to be taken by those who are responsible for policy-making, the implementation of those decisions could well be the result of interaction between the knowledge of the private sector and the educational knowledge of the public sector. These two types of knowledge, working together, could be highly effective. The idea has been suggested, and I hope that it will be followed by specific projects in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to another subject. Yes, Europe is showing the way, but these theories are not put into practice in some ivory tower in Brussels. They are put into practice in our regions, our towns and our villages. The method used should be the ‘bottom-up’ method. In other words, though policy decisions have to be taken somewhere, they have to be implemented, not from the top downwards, but rather at grass-roots level. Any contribution towards getting specific local projects off the ground will be welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">So you see, ladies and gentlemen, we are standing on the threshold of a great adventure. Things are moving on all sides, though admittedly not always in the right direction, but then we are learning lessons as well. People sometimes ask me for something more specific, but there is already much that is specific at ground level, and this has been the case not only during the past year or so. Specific projects implemented under our Socrates and Leonardo programmes have generated many of the features that we are now finding in our education systems. Basically, these were programmes which you wanted, for which you, together with the Commission, sought and obtained serious funding, and which, despite all the administrative problems which you regularly bring to my attention, are positive elements.</p>
<p class="contents">So, dear colleagues, we have had the right idea for many years now. We are travelling together in the right direction. We are taking giant steps forward, much more rapidly than anyone could have imagined two or three years ago. There are a few small problems here and there. Let us tackle them together, but tackle them in a spirit of optimism, because things really are improving. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
