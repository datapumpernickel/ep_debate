<p class="contents">First it was Brittany, now other <span class="italic">départements</span> have been affected, but it is the <span class="italic">département</span> of the Somme, and the town of Abbeville and the surrounding <span class="italic">communes</span> in particular, which have been hardest hit. Hundreds of residents have been forced to leave their homes, have lost all their possessions and are destitute. Every economic and social sector has been hit: road and rail infrastructures have sustained tremendous damage, shops and businesses have closed and farms are in serious trouble. There is much uncertainty as to whether they will be able to regain their original production levels. The persons hit hardest are those who were already the worst off and who have no family to give them financial or moral support.</p>
<p class="contents">And just as we thought that things were quickly getting better, another disaster has struck and may last for several more weeks. The financial consequences are unquantifiable as yet. There is a great deal of solidarity between the local residents and a great deal of intervention on the part of the government and the French administration, the local authorities, the police, the army, rescue organisations and the community, but it is unable to absorb the effects of this disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I think that Europe needs to do more than just offer words of support and compassion; we need to send out a strong message of our desire to stand by the people suffering the physical and psychological effects of this disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to do so, the European Union needs to provide one-off financial aid so that infrastructures can be quickly restored and economic activity can resume.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important for us to reaffirm our concern at the rise in the number of serious natural disasters over recent years both in Europe and across the planet as a whole. The European Union owes it to itself to do everything to respect and ensure that others respect the Kyoto commitments by the stated deadlines and to implement a policy of sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First there is the question of urgency; the previous speaker reminded us of the need to take into consideration the financial cost of the crisis in people’s lives. However, we also urgently need to take the measures needed to prevent the disaster caused by exceptional climatic conditions in France from turning into a crisis which permanently affects the families and enterprises in question. I obviously welcome the financial efforts already proposed and I hope that Europe will not be absent from them. We also need to strengthen our means of detection, so that we can react rapidly, and develop the best possible technologies, so that we have means of intervention which can be mobilised at once in any country of Europe. We have seen how far rapid reaction facilities are lacking.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament therefore looks forward to receiving the text on European civil defence, which could form the basis for transnational monitoring and solidarity. However, most importantly, we need to study the issue in depth. These disasters remind us, not that we need reminding, of just how important it is to review our regional planning policies, which will take a great deal of courage, and to implement the commitments made in Kyoto. Europe should not relax in its efforts to persuade its partners that a lack of respect for nature can have terrible social, environmental and economic consequences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the <span class="italic">département</span> of the Somme, where there was three times the normal rainfall between October 2000 and April 2001, several dozen <span class="italic">communes</span> are still under water. Thousands of people have been evacuated, often having lost everything. The damage to infrastructures, houses and crops has been put at several billion francs. Human and material resources have been deployed at all levels to cope with the crisis which families have been suffering for months now. This wave of solidarity, however, which many citizens have been involved in, is still not enough. The European Union should, I think, as others have already said, take an active part in this solidarity by paying emergency aid to the people affected, so that infrastructures can be restored and economic activity restarted.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the main demand in the resolution by our group, which also stresses the need to step up action to protect ecosystems and fight the pollution which are partly to blame for increasingly frequent climatic disasters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The floodwaters are abating very slowly, as you have heard and, as I speak, 140 <span class="italic">communes </span>are still affected, with nearly 3 500 homes under water. The floods have caused huge damage – estimated at several hundred million euros. Houses are subsiding. Numerous infrastructures have been damaged or destroyed, companies have lost and must replace their means of production, not to mention the damage to the countryside itself. At local level, solidarity has been in evidence for a long time, providing humanitarian, food and material aid, but what the region needs most now is money. It is because I really am close to the ground and have been directly affected by this disaster that I called for European solidarity in Brussels on 2 May. Madam President gave me a positive reply and I thank her for that. I should also like to take the opportunity to thank the honourable Members who finally rallied to this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I have asked the prefect of the region to allow me to help with any changes to the single programming document for the Structural Funds in Picardie, so as to find a suitable response to the problems encountered. I expect the same on the part of Europe: an urgent and, more importantly, a specific response to this disaster. This initiative should not – I repeat should not – be a simple declaration of intent. It should be backed as quickly as possible by practical decisions and tangible action.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I am delighted that the Commission, in collaboration with the local authorities, has authorised changes to the zoning of the Structural Funds so that appropriations can be channelled to all sectors of activity and to all the <span class="italic">communes</span> flooded. At the same time, I hope that it will speed up payment of these appropriations, which should normally be staggered up to 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, one-off financial aid should be released by the European Union, to complement local, regional and national aid and meet the most urgent demands. Finally, measures should also be taken to fight the consequences of climatic change. The international commitments made in Kyoto should be respected by all countries without exception and I trust that the conference to be held in Bonn in July will be where this happens. That is the purpose of my amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am from a neighbouring region, and my father was born in Abbeville. I have regular contact with the <span class="italic">département</span> of the Somme. It is to be expected that we should express our desire for solidarity with this resolution. We are bound to express our sorrow when confronted with an urgent situation, with a crisis and with suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as well as this urgent situation, I think that we really must understand that the European Union will face problems of this kind over the long term, since the fundamental characteristic of this tragedy is, in fact, that it is not exceptional, that these events are no longer exceptional occurrences. We are faced with a future of sustained, unsettled weather in the same way that we talk about sustainable development. This crisis is not exceptional because it is going to continue. This is a disaster that is going to go on and on, and it will not go away. And this crisis is not an exception in itself, because the Somme has not been the only place in France or in Europe to be affected by the floods.</p>
<p class="contents">In our capacity as Europeans responsible for European policies, we directly face the need to take action in the three main areas, namely the common agricultural policy and rural development, structural planning and structural actions, and lastly, international action designed to put into practice the commitments given in Kyoto.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take both immediate and long-term action. The proposed resolution must not be something that we simply consider for ten minutes and which we then forget. We have given commitments over several years to eliminate this type of danger, to prevent this type of threat and to solve the awful problems that people face. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Everything must be done in order to assist these people, who have suffered considerably.</p>
<p class="contents">We can also support the observation in the resolution, which pinpoints disastrous flooding as the cause of these increasingly common situations and we have to look into the natural character of these happenings. The exceptional levels of rainfall do not explain everything and it is easy to attribute the repeated disasters to thoughtless planning policies which have disregarded and, all too often, still disregard the important role of the natural environment and the instability of high-risk zones, such as those liable to flooding, in alleviating flooding, for example. It is a sign of progress that everyone here today acknowledges this. It is absolutely imperative, however, that future regional planning policies incorporate this new information on environmental considerations and sustainable development, particularly within the framework of the Structural Funds and the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore appeal today to my fellow Members, who are aware of these dangers, to bear in mind, when they come to vote on the guidelines for the common agricultural policy, the Structural Funds and the ERDF, the consequences of the policies that we are implementing when we provide aid packages. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lang (TDI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, 114 municipalities in the Somme region are flooded, 2 800 homes are affected, more than 1 000 people have been evacuated and placed in temporary accommodation and the local economy has been paralysed. This is the toll inflicted by the floods that have hit the Somme valley.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the understandable solidarity that has been shown towards the people who have been affected and the businesses that are, to all intents and purposes, out of action, these people are waiting for compensation to be paid out as soon as possible – in other words, as soon as the committee of inquiry into natural disasters has completed its report and issued its conclusions. Once the water levels have subsided, it will be time to work out who is responsible. For example, why has the Somme’s maintenance department not maintained the region’s riverbanks and why has the river not been dredged for decades? Why have the municipalities allowed building in an area at risk from flooding, disregarding the most basic rules of land use planning? Why have embankments, hedges and ditches been destroyed as part of land consolidation, which has, moreover, been carried out in favour of intensive farming? Why has a reservoir not been built in the Somme bay and why have no real measures been implemented to prevent rising water levels and flooding? To cite fate, high tides or exceptional levels of rainfall is not enough. People who are isolated, re-located in precarious conditions, deserve more than fine-sounding words from the French President or the few million given grudgingly by the French government. Insurance policies should, of course, pay for the damage caused by natural disasters within a reasonable timeframe, but, for the future, we must learn to respect and take account of the necessary and incontrovertible laws of nature, and prepare ourselves to prevent these natural disasters. The only way to respond to the suffering of the people is with practical, swift and effective action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission regrets the problems and damage caused by the bad weather, which were particularly severe in the <span class="italic">département</span> of the Somme in the region of Picardie. The Commission has said that it is prepared to use all the measures at its disposal to facilitate the reconstruction of the area affected and the restoration of economic productivity. I refer here to measures within the framework of regional policy, agricultural policy, rural development policy and state aid policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Within regional policy and rural development policy, much of the <span class="italic">département</span> affected is eligible under Objective 2 of the Structural Funds for the 2000 to 2006 programming period. The programme for the region of Picardie, which has a Community contribution of 1.7 billion francs for the period from 2000 to 2006, already contains measures against natural disasters. The Commission is waiting for suggestions from the French authorities and calls on the French authorities to present these proposals, so that the means provided for in the programme for the economic restoration of the areas affected can be supplied. As far as agricultural policy is concerned, the Commission has already taken the initiative to give producers a great deal of flexibility as regards the eligibility of aid for large scale arable farming and set aside. For the rest, the Commission has approved certain interpretations of current legal provisions by the French authorities. The Commission has also introduced measures to extend the seed time beyond 15 June.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as state aid for the areas affected is concerned, the Commission shall do everything in its power within the framework of legal provisions to deal quickly with notifications of and approval for any state aid to remedy the damage caused.</p>
<p class="contents">A few members of the House addressed the question of immediate assistance for families in the areas affected. Unfortunately, the Commission cannot see how it can accommodate this request. As you know, it is several years since state posts for disasters and immediate aid in the Member States were reported in the budget of the European Union and I do not think that Parliament will call on the Commission to make payments which it is not legally authorised to make.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the fact that there are other ways of providing Community aid for this sort of disaster, the Commission takes the view that it would be premature, given the financial and human resources currently at its disposal, to re-table such a proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
