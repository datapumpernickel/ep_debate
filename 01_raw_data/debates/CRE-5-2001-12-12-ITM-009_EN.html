Also the Council, who are not represented this evening, but it should go on record how helpful the Belgian Presidency has been. I should also like to say how helpful the French presidency was in making sure that we made rapid progress. I should also like to thank my colleagues in the European Parliament who stood together through this process, with the difficult challenges we faced, but which we overcame together. Because of that we are able tonight to celebrate a historic victory for the European institutions in the field of maritime safety. Together we have achieved a great deal.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not dwell on the other reports. My fellow rapporteurs will do that. I should like to focus on my report on port state control, which is an essential part of our regime to make sure that events such as that involving the Erika never happen again.</p>
<p class="contents">Two years ago today the Erika was a symptom of a failed system of maritime safety. It was not the first of its kind, nor, sadly, was it the last maritime disaster of its kind. It symbolised to me and my colleagues in the European Parliament the fact that the flag state controls had failed. The classification society controls had failed. The port state controls had failed and the IMO itself had failed. It is only because of the collective action of the European Union and its institutions that we have stimulated in the last two years unparalleled levels of activity in the field of maritime safety. Without the European Union, we would not be as advanced today as we are. We should all be very pleased that we have the European Union to spearhead action in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">What do we have to be so pleased and proud about? I want to list some of the achievements that we have secured in respect of port state control. Firstly, there is going to be mandatory inspection for certain ships. That is an innovation and I welcome it. It means that the most dangerous ships will be inspected in future. Secondly, enhanced inspection for other categories of ships and, thirdly, the guidelines on inspections themselves will become mandatory. In other words port state control authorities will have to inspect certain types of ships in certain ways.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we want the Member States that have been a weak link in the system to train and recruit adequate numbers of port state control inspectors. They will have until 2003 to do that, but it is a challenge for them and it is a challenge, I hope, that they can rise to.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly – and this is absolutely critical to the success of this new regime – we want public access to the information. Again that is in the amended directive and will be made available via the Equasis database.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly, we want the Member States and the port state control authorities in particular, to convey the information to the Commission so that the Commission can do its job in making sure the amended directive is uniformly implemented across the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The seventh point, which I mention with a certain pleasure, concerns the ability to ban and detain certain ships – banning the most dangerous ships, particularly those that fly the flags of blacklisted flag states. I welcome the strong controls we have to ban certain ships from European Union waters if they have a poor detention record. That effectively will be a warning shot across the bows of these blacklisted flag states: over a period of time their ships will be banned one by one if they do not improve. A very important message will be going out from this Parliament. But also there will be the power to detain, in particular the power to detain ships which, by 2008, do not have a fully functioning voice data recorder, a black box. Again the message can go out tonight that by 2008 all categories of ships, if they want to come to a European port, must have a black box voice data recorder. If they do not have one, we will detain the ship until one is secured. Once more, I welcome the fact that we have all worked together to secure that particular achievement.</p>
<p class="contents">The black box will change the culture of shipping. It will not just be a tool whereby we can learn lessons from disasters and apply them in the future. A ship with a black box is a safe ship. Our common aim tonight is to make sure the Erika and disasters like it never occur again.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that we will achieve that simply by adopting these reports tomorrow but we will have gone a long way to securing our goal to protect lives at sea and to protect the marine environment. But we must remain vigilant. Our duty now must be to make sure that the laws we pass tomorrow are implemented by everyone – the Commission, Member States and port state control authorities. That is our duty and responsibility. I hope we can live up to that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ortuondo Larrea (Verts/ALE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, after the sinking of the oil tanker Erika on 12 December 1999, this Parliament and the Council requested a significant strengthening of the Community rules on maritime safety and the prevention of pollution. The Commission responded quickly to these demands by presenting the three proposals known as the Erika I package, which we are still debating two years after that disaster, although we have finally reached agreements on each of them in Council, which are definitive in the case of the first two.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the modification of the Directive on the common rules and standards for organisations which classify, inspect and examine ships on behalf of the maritime administration, from the outset, the parliamentary amendments to Commission’s original proposal focussed, above all, on the practical aspects of the application of the classification system, on improving the transparency of the information relating to the quality of inspections, on the periodic auditing of those organisations and the withdrawal of their Community recognition in the event of serious accidents, as well as the financial liability of those organisations for damages and accidents where is has been proved that that there has been negligence in inspections.</p>
<p class="contents">After the Council’s adoption of its common position, we moved on to second parliamentary reading, where we insisted on issues relating to resolving the conflicts of interest which may arise between classification societies or organisations and the owners and/or charterers of ships, as well as on financial liability in cases of negligence or omission in judgements.</p>
<p class="contents">When the Council communicated that it could not accept all Parliament’s amendments, we moved on to the stage of conciliation between the representatives of the two Community institutions. The discussion focussed firstly on the issue of the conflict of interests, where the Council finally accepted that a classification organisation must not be controlled by owners or builders of ships or by other persons or entities which are commercially involved in the construction, equipping, repair or operation of ships. It also focussed on the idea that, at the point of requesting recognition, the classification society and its inspectors should commit themselves in writing, on an individual basis, to not accepting regulatory duties where there is a risk of a conflict of interests and, in particular, where those societies are the owners of the ship which is to be inspected, or have commercial, personal or family connections with those owners.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, the parliamentary delegation, while considering that much of the work of the inspectors should be done by the maritime administration and that the latter should have subsidiary responsibility, accepted that it should not be obligatory for the Member States to establish a maximum limit for the financial liability of classification societies in the event of damages due to slight negligence in inspections, although in the event that those Member States wish to establish that maximum limit, that limit should not be less that EUR 2 million and EUR 4 million respectively, depending on whether the damage only affects material objects or also people.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the delegations of the two institutions considered that this issue should be examined within the framework of the evaluation report, which the Commission will present within three years, on the economic impact of the liability regime and, in particular, its consequences for the financial equilibrium of recognised organisations. If necessary, the Commission will present, in the light of the said evaluation, a proposal for a modification of this directive which deals specifically with the principle of liability and the maximum limit for the financial contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I believe that the European Parliament should be satisfied with the final result of the conciliation, since the majority of our amendments have been incorporated, either fully, in a revised form or in spirit, into the joint text, and we therefore propose that this latter text be approved by the House at third reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to draw the attention of the relevant legal authorities to the fact that certain people harmed by the Erika accident are yet to receive any compensation for the damage suffered, despite the fact that two years have passed since this tragic event took place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jarzembowski (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Madam Vice-President and dear fellow-believers – I can call you that, because all of those sitting here are those who have moved this project forward over the years and who are committed to making ships safe. Speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats, I would like to observe – it being two years since the Erika disaster – that we may be a little late with the adoption of this legislative package, but we have not done at all badly in terms of keeping to the timetable if you consider the difficulties that have been involved. Even then, two areas of the legislation have involved us having to go through a second reading and the conciliation procedure. Today, we can see that, on the basis of the Commission's initial proposals submitted two years ago now after the tanker crashed, our joint efforts have brought progress, and I again wish to thank you, Commissioner de Palacio, for the committed support you and your colleagues gave us in the conciliation process. By means both of these two results from the conciliation process and the common position, we have significantly increased not only the safety of ships, but also that of their crews, the environment and of people who live in coastal regions. I believe that enhanced port state control, more stringent regulations for classification societies and the progressive introduction of double hull tankers mean that we really have moved ahead in preventing accidents like that of the Erika, or at least alleviating their consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would like to say this about port state control. I believe it was a good thing that, in the conciliation process, we – and especially Mark Watts – insisted on sorting out the ‘black box’ issue now. You will see that the ‘Erika II’ package does not quite go that far. I hope it soon will do, but you will be aware that it is still causing a few difficulties. That being so, we were right to insist on the requirement for a ‘black box’ being incorporated into the ‘Erika I’ package.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleagues are aware that I am less happy about the result of the ship classification issue. We may well not have an upper limit, but we do have an appeal clause. I trust that the Commission will, after three years, produce a report submitting new proposals to us on how damage can be compensated for. This affects shipping companies, shipping agents, and classification societies – how about a fair compromise on who should shoulder the damage?</p>
<p class="contents">We were, I think, very wise when it came to the common position on double hull tankers. We should let the whole world know that. We are always being accused of drafting European norms and disregarding worldwide conventions. No! We have accepted that the IMO sets the ground rules and have only made minor changes affecting implementation and time limits. What we have insisted on as regards implementation looks quite harmless in comparison with what the Americans forced through!</p>

Nonetheless, I think that we have finally done so in a most satisfactory manner, which has gone beyond all our expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, we have managed to find an effective response to the concerns of the citizens of Europe, especially in France following the shipwreck of the Erika, as regards environmental protection. At the same time, we have taken fundamental measures in maritime safety because, as all sides agree, double-hull tankers may not be a panacea but they are at least proven to be safer than single-hull tankers.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we also achieved another objective: the objective of protecting the competitiveness of the shipping industry. We must not forget that this is a vital sector of our economy, a sector which employs tens of thousands of workers throughout Europe and one of our priorities must be to protect it.</p>
<p class="contents">We also achieved something else which I think I should highlight: we managed to find an international solution to a problem which goes beyond national borders. We have before us a solution which has now been adopted by all the countries in the International Maritime Organisation. I think that credit for this has to go to the European Commission, the Member States and the European Parliament because, thanks to our initiative, thanks to our – how shall I put it? – our threat that we would proceed unilaterally if the International Maritime Organisation failed to act, the International Maritime Organisation which, we must admit, has not always acted quite as fast as we would all like it to act, has pushed ahead and adopted a number of measures which mirror the initial proposals submitted by the Commission and the Member States. So clear, efficient measures are being taken for all the classes of tanker which have concerned us and I am happy to say that today we have achieved something which did in fact appear to be beyond reach just a short time ago.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, I think that people in France are relatively satisfied with the measures we are adopting and that every European with an environmental conscience is satisfied with the significant progress made while, on the other hand, industrial factors, people engaged in shipping, seamen and shipowners, feel that we have not gone too far and undermined the interests of this important sector of the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">So I should like to thank all the honourable members with whom we cooperated so efficiently that we now have this text before us and, of course, to thank and congratulate the Vice-President of the European Commission, Mrs de Palacio, for the way in which she has handled this issue and for her decisiveness and excellent disposition towards the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That today is, of all days, the anniversary of the sinking of the Erika, is not something that should fill us entirely with pride, for two years have passed before today's debate and tomorrow's vote. Then it will take a bit longer for it all to be implemented. It should be done more quickly next time!</p>
<p class="contents">The results are actually quite respectable. We are getting the safe double hull tankers more quickly. The old single hull tankers will be phased out with effect from 2003, and port state control will at last live up to its name.</p>
<p class="contents">Stricter controls mean for me that blacklists will be used rigorously and, in consequence, black sheep, or black ships, will no longer be welcome in European ports. Classification societies for ship types will be subject to stricter conditions. Although we know that the majority of these societies do sound work, they must no longer be permitted to be slipshod in what they do.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States now have 18 months in which to transpose all this. The legal framework is in place. Yet laws that only exist on paper are, in the final analysis, ridiculous. What use is port state control without controllers? I therefore believe – and here we are putting our trust in you, Commissioner – that you will have to check very punctiliously how the Member States transpose the things we have just brought into being. It will cost the Member States money, but safety at sea must be worth the expense.</p>
<p class="contents">So here are two more points. One is something I have already mentioned. Erika II must not be allowed to last as long as Erika I did. Accidents involving oil are one thing, but damage to people, nature, fisheries and tourism are something else, and result not only from accidents involving oil, but also from those involving chemicals and other hazardous substances. So we should implement more quickly the proposals Parliament has made.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that enlargement of the EU is almost upon us, involving as it does two candidate states, Malta and Cyprus, which have cropped up in discussions again and again. So I would again implore the Commissioner to apply the so-called <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> very stringently to these states too in the event of their becoming members of the EU, so that there may be no black sheep, only white ones. I have said already that we have a saying to the effect that one is in the hand of God at sea and in court! As far as the sea is concerned, we can give the Almighty a bit of a helping hand, so that everything will be safer, and that is what we should be doing with the Erika package.</p>

These statutory proposals belonging to the "Erika I" package contain essential measures for the increasing of marine safety. These matters have also made reasonably rapid progress, and in conciliation the essential changes to the texts demanded by Parliament have been incorporated.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the classification societies, the Community's authority needs to be increased with regard to the approval and control of these societies. As the rapporteur stated, the classification society must not be under the authority of the owners or builders of the vessels, or of others engaged in commercial activity in the sector. Inspections of vessels must also be increased. Extended inspections must be directed specifically at vessels which represent a risk. In the case of vessels on the "black list" which are associated with a high risk, the criteria for entry of the vessel to a port must be stricter. In order that accidents can be prevented in advance as effectively as possible, we need an advance notification obligation for vessels and mandatory inspections of high-risk vessels. The port control directive will improve the uniformity and effectiveness of the inspection procedure of port States. It is appropriate that vessels be furnished with Voyage Data Recorders in future, and that access to EU ports can be denied to vessels which are clearly in a poor condition. An accelerated phasing-in of double hull vessels must be managed in such a way as to avoid generating insurmountable problems with the scrapping of ships and the building of new ones. At the same time, the flexibility of oil transportations must be safeguarded. The safety of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution may be promoted by the flag States enforcing the currently valid conventions so as to make them obligatory. Along with the further tightening of regulations, care must be taken that the decisions to be made are realistic and feasible.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the points of emphasis of the EU's White Paper on transport is the favouring of water traffic in transportation. Because of its environmental friendliness, water traffic is indeed very suitable for heavy goods transportation. In the event of accidents, however, water routes are highly vulnerable, and environmental damage recognises no borders. For this reason, decisions made only within the Union are not sufficient; instead, questions of responsibility for marine safety must be dealt with on a worldwide basis. We need international agreements which also involve (for example) Russia, whose vessels will in future be sailing more and more in the world's seas via the Gulf of Finland and the Baltic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I regularly suffer nightmares. When I wake up, I just hope and pray that another oil tanker has not run aground. I hope that will not be the case in the next three years either, for – everyone has already said it – it has been long enough, it is actually taking too long before we can lay down legislation, and we are only halfway. Speeding up processes of this kind can do no harm at all.</p>
<p class="contents">A disaster such as the one involving the <span class="italic">Erika</span> is simply a real disaster, not only environmentally, but also economically and socially, and it can be entirely traced back to 80 000 ships, some ten percent of which, 8 000 ships, are absolutely sub-standard. This is to a certain extent where the problem lies, or in large part at any rate. Despite the fact that classification bureaux were involved and despite what has happened with, and is suggested about, double hulls, I should briefly like to focus on the port state control, for in the final analysis, what matters is that inspections should become effective. Mr Piecyk, but also others, have already drawn attention to this. Actually, we want 25% of inspections by way of a yardstick. But what mainly matters is that these inspections are carried out by well-trained people, and that they are carried out in the first place. We should, for example, call the French Transport Minister to account for the fact that his country scores exceptionally low in the percentage of inspections that are carried out. Although we now have a perfect and itemised list, enforcement still appears to be a problem. This is often the case when we draft legislation, but particularly so now. I therefore intend to monitor annual surveys of the Paris memorandum of understanding and other matters in the next few months with the help of others, and check whether inspection of this kind is, in fact, on the increase. I would also ask the Commissioner to ensure that we receive an annual overview, so that we can be active and pro-active to ensure that what we want to achieve actually happens.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would mainly call for a prompt completion of the <span class="italic">Erika II</span>, and for accelerating the process in the light of the tiresome pace on the part of industry with regard to separate funding and such like.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish off with one point. Malta and Cyprus have been mentioned in connection with enlargement. There are still two that, let us say, are on the waiting list, including Romania. Romania is another country with an exceptionally bad track record on this black list, and I would call for extra attention to be paid to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the stormy night of 12 December 1999, this oil tanker, which was flying a Maltese flag, certified by an Italian classification society, manned by an Indian crew, insured by a company registered in the Bermudas, financed by a Scottish bank, chartered by a Shell company that sub-chartered it to a foreign subsidiary of the Total Group, which was transporting extremely polluting hydrocarbon belonging to another subsidiary of Total, sank off the French coast, thus polluting 400 kilometres of coastline and causing considerable damage estimated to cost more than FFR 5 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">So, what progress has been made, two years after this tragedy? Hardly any of the victims have received compensation. The IOPC Fund will only cover FFR 1.2 billion out of the FFR 5.5 billion of damages caused, and procedures are turning out to be lengthy, complicated and inefficient. The remainder will be borne by the victims, the local authorities and the French Government, pursuant to the application, not of the polluter pays principle, but of the perverse principle dictating that the victim pays.</p>
<p class="contents">The various measures that we are currently debating in the three reports by Mr Watts, Mr Ortuondo Larrea and Mr Hatzidakis have taken too long. Yes, we must strengthen State port controls, Mr Watts; yes, we must ensure the work of classification societies is more efficient, more reliable and more transparent, Mr Ortuondo Larrea; yes, Mr Hatzidakis, we must take concerted action at international level to phase out single hull oil tankers, whilst bearing in mind that double hull tankers cannot guarantee that ships will not sink or run aground. But why will we have had to wait more than two years after the disaster for such basic measures to be taken in these three areas?</p>
<p class="contents">And, more importantly, there are two fundamental questions that remain unanswered, and it has also not yet been established whether it is appropriate to take these decisions at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">The first question relates to compensation. All the victims must be fully compensated. Today, however, there are considerable differences of opinion at European level. Some people are in favour of setting up a specific European fund, whilst others prefer to increase the IOPC Fund. The differences of opinion persist and we cannot move ahead with this issue, whereas the United States, on the other hand, has unilaterally set up a very efficient and comprehensive compensation system, which is effectively funded by consumers of oil products, which is perfectly logical and legitimate. In Europe, Member States have different ideas about the risks of maritime pollution and it would therefore be perfectly legitimate for the countries that are at the forefront of this risk to take the necessary measures themselves. I urge them to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The second fundamental question that is yet to be resolved relates to the issue of responsibility. We cannot allow events, such as that involving the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, to ever happen again, where the front company was based in a tax haven, the flag of convenience was sub-chartered, the sub-contractor was an off-shore subsidiary and no less than 11 different companies had an interest in the ship and its cargo, thus creating a real labyrinth, in which the real decision-makers and those bearing the actual responsibility could hide. This situation is particularly hazardous. The Member States that are most concerned must ensure, as a matter of urgency, that there is clarification and transparency in the area of responsibility. This must also be done at a global level, as, Mr President, only the threat of very heavy and very severe penalties will be enough to deter the potential polluters of the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are going down the right track as regards the safety of ships. We have already clearly defined the first measures that may lead to substantial improvements in safety at sea. One considerable contribution to this is the introduction of the black box, with which we are familiar from aircraft, as well as of the double hull tanker. Parliament has emphasised certain features – where necessary in the Conciliation Committee, as Mr Ortuondo Larrea mentioned. Does this, though, also apply to the settlement of liabilities? You are all familiar with the regular technical examination of private cars. It is a similar position that the classification societies take with regard to safety at sea.</p>
<p class="contents">The extent of liability in the event of accidents at sea is based on inspectors' evaluations of the condition ships are in. This brings us at once to the core of the discussion, for the issue of the classification societies' standard upper limits for liability, particularly in cases of minor negligence, needs to be resolved finally and coherently. The decartelisation of the interests of the classification societies, the shipowners and the other actors means that we are now already achieving a high degree of transparency and independence for the inspectors. Decartelisation of interests must not, though, be allowed to go so far that the actors are played off against each other and end up eventually outdoing each other. The liability issue becomes of fundamental importance at this point.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in the final analysis the classification societies that occupy the most vulnerable position in the liability chain. Their assessment is admittedly decisive in determining the extent of liability, but, for example, they have no police powers, so that they could not, for example, confine a ship to port if that were to prove necessary. In the end, responsibility for the condition of the ship and for its handling remains with the owners. The classification societies and the shipping companies must act jointly with the other parties involved in this, and we must create the conditions for this to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">There are at present different upper limits for liability in each Member State, but it would be fair to limit liability to one standard across the board. In three years' time we will be re-examining this regulation on a varying upper limit. The knowledge and experience we will have gained by then will influence our further action and leave their mark on it. I see this as our task for the immediate future. We want to end up with a balanced chain of liability and responsibility. We need this binding regulation in order to enhance competition and limit risks, both indispensable to a functioning market and safety at sea. It is true that we are subjecting the classification societies to tighter control, but, at the same time, we should make it possible for them to calculate their risks. I consider this regulation to be a fair one, which takes all sides into account in an appropriate way. Having chosen our road ahead, we must now go down it and pursue it to the end.</p>

<p class="contents">We have taken a moderate line and brokered a series of realistic measures, seeing shipping not as an ‘enemy’ but as a friend who could do better, given that, may I remind you, shipping is only responsible for 12% of total maritime pollution. So, ships which seriously endanger our seas will be denied entry to Community ports and voyage data recorders will be fitted to all ships, so that their course can be checked following an accident, God forbid. Compulsory double hulls will be phased in and the rules governing ship survey and control organisations will be improved. Clearly, the catalyst behind this successful outcome, or at least one part of it, was the International Maritime Organisation, which took the right stand thanks to the initiative taken by the Member States of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">So now we need to concentrate on fast implementation, and here we are putting our faith in fast reaction on the part of the Commission, not forgetting that five Member States which, I may add, do not include Greece, have been charged by the Commission with not applying a previous, more lenient directive. May I also remind you and highlight the fact that Greece, whose economy, as you know, is far more dependent on shipping than that of any of our partners, is leading the way and is at the vanguard in the fight for maritime safety and efforts to protect human life and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also give special thanks to everyone who helped to bring this endeavour to a successful conclusion, especially the Commissioner, and I trust that we shall not forget that the seas of Europe are not a separate entity from the other seas on our planet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Concerning the Watts report, we are particularly pleased that the European Parliament’s delegation succeeded in making black boxes compulsory, which was not the easiest thing to do. This means that, from now on, a ship will be detained if it is not fitted with a functioning VDR system. With regard to Mr Ortuondo Larrea’s report, the question of the conflict of interests has been resolved in such a way that classification societies can no longer have any links with shipbuilders, shipowners, operators or charterers. Likewise, there is the question of the limits of the financial liability of these companies with regard to the financial balance of recognised organisations. There is also the problem that Mr Souchet mentioned of providing compensation payments from the IOPC Fund or from a European fund in a more efficient manner.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a matter of urgency, as Mr Hatzidakis said, to settle, at third reading, the problem of single hull ships, mainly in view of the 2015 deadline, as maritime safety issues cannot wait any longer – it is already two years to the day since the sinking of the <span class="italic">Erika</span>. Intermittent spills and substandard ‘dustbin ships’, such as the one that recently sunk off the coast of Brest, are still all too topical and it is a test of the EU’s credibility to resolve this situation once and for all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This concern led to the Commission’s proposals and I would therefore now like to congratulate the Commission and its Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio, since we have all witnessed the tenacity with which she has personally dealt with these issues. I also congratulate the rapporteurs on the wonderful work they have done, completing this package of measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, during my intervention in the May part-session, I said that we could be relatively satisfied with the way we have responded to the expectations of our citizens, in trying to approve these initiatives as quickly as possible – in inverted commas – by Community standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The Erika I package and future approval of the Erika II package will make it possible to create a genuine European area of maritime safety and must guarantee an optimum level of protection for the maritime environment and the European coastal regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Today I simply wish to repeat part of what I said then, since the circumstances have not changed. This Parliament has shown its great interest throughout the negotiation process. We must now continue to work in this direction and promote the measures which are yet to be approved. We must not rest on our laurels and we must call on the Council so that progress can be made on the Erika II package and, in this respect, Commissioner, your role and your tenacity will be very important if we are to try to convince the Council once again, so that we may have the Erika II package more quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament will have had a great influence on these documents. I would also like to thank the Commissioner, Mrs Loyola de Palacio who, I believe, has worked as quickly as possible within the procedures laid down. Mr Souchet thought that the progress made was slow. I think that he is right. On the other hand, we had reached the end of a parliamentary procedure, which is very difficult to cut down when we embark on conciliation. I therefore believe that we have worked as quickly as possible and yet, it will take a total of three and a half years to draw up a text on <span class="italic">Erika I</span> after the law has been transposed by the national governments. All this leads me to make some comments on governance. We discuss this elsewhere, outside the context of transport, and I think that these subjects require the codification of urgent parliamentary procedures that will allow us to proceed legally. I think that this is a proposal which is expected from bodies such as ourselves or which could be drawn up by them. We see that we have the same problem with the tunnels and the revision of the Seveso Directives. Ladies and gentlemen, I think that we must spend time considering the urgent procedures which will be included in the Treaties. I also think that we must ensure that these directives are transposed into national law. We now have a body of texts and of maritime law without equal at European level, and also the <span class="italic">Erika II</span> package which is currently under discussion. The Member States will no longer be able to play hide and seek with the European Commission, as they could at the beginning of the <span class="italic">Erika I</span> crisis. Furthermore, we have no guarantee – as President Prodi recently said – that the directives are being transposed into national law within the time allowed. And, at the end of the day, if we can be satisfied that we have produced some good European legislation today, we still do not know whether all these measures will be implemented, and within what time scale. The victims of the oil spills and accidents have been waiting for these measures for a long time. Lastly, I think that the controls do not give enough reassurance, and this is true of all the operating provisions. These usually involve self-regulation at national level, and I think that, in terms of governance as well, and if we truly wish to move forward, we must ask ourselves the question of how we are to monitor the monitoring systems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I stand by my earlier reflection that it is better to act before an accident occurs than to react after it. Both the rapporteur and the Conciliation Committee have done an excellent job with regard to the Commission’s proposal to further improve various measures, and Parliament has improved the proposal even further. We have now pushed through our view with regard to conflicts of interest. We have, moreover, succeeded in getting the lower limit for classification societies’ liability for damages to the level at which we always wanted it. This must be seen as clear progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The report on port State control also looks significantly better now. In conciliation, Parliament managed to push through the requirement for black boxes, which I believe is a particularly positive move.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution regarding the third issue of introducing double hulls or such like for single-hull oil tankers has also been considerably more positive than it long appeared would be the case. In this case too, Parliament has had almost all its amendments included in the Council’s common position.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, I would like to say that, on these issues, Parliament has clearly shown its capacity to act. Each of the proposals alone would not have sufficed, but together they constitute a significant step in the right direction. In a tangible way, we have taken developments in the right direction towards safer and better seafaring and a better marine environment. Hopefully, this will ensure that accidents such as those involving the Erika or the Levoli Sun will not occur in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the proposals being debated today will not help in this type of case. This is a classic example of a discharge from an unknown source, and despite the restructuring of port and pilotage fees which we have adopted at EU level, these small discharges have increased in the Baltic Sea. The risk of being prosecuted is also very small.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we are now, unfortunately, seeing the opening of the port in Primorsk. This port has severely icy conditions, and we know that the package which we are approving today may not perhaps lead to vessels having double hulls until 2017. However, double hulls are no help now, as the ice has already formed in Primorsk port. Only through compulsory pilotage, effective strengthening of the hull against ice, efficient traffic monitoring and good teamwork between the rescue services can we do anything for this port and this unique part of the world. I would ask you, Commissioner, in your continued contacts with Russia, to focus attention on the safety of traffic to Primorsk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also highlighted the inadequacy of safety controls and the lack of transparency in sea transport practices, as well as the profound discontent of the populations affected, owing to the slowness of compensation. As the rapporteur, Mr Ortuondo, has quite rightly pointed out, the victims of this accident have yet to receive their money.</p>
<p class="contents">It was also a test of the European Union’s capacity to react quickly and to offer its citizens a suitable response to their concerns. I must say that, despite the fact that all has not gone perfectly, that perhaps we could have adopted it on first reading – as I would have liked –, that perhaps both Parliament and the Council could have shown greater flexibility, the reality is that, despite everything, within one and a half years of the Commission presenting its initiative, today, two years after the accident, we are finally approving the Erika I package.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, we must remember that there was a serious disaster off the same coast ten years ago and initiatives were presented by the Commission, but they did not overcome the hurdle of the Council. I would therefore like to point out that the considerable success of approving this Erika I package today would certainly not have been achieved had it not been for the insistence and firmness of this Parliament, which has maintained systematic pressure on the Council throughout the negotiation process.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to expressly thank Mr Watts, Mr Hatzidakis and Mr Ortuondo Larrea for their work and tenacity over these two years. Their determination, which I welcome, has allowed us to persuade the Council to approve texts which initially enjoyed only a very small majority yet have been able, at the end of the day, to overcome any reservations.</p>
<p class="contents">We have considerably strengthened the European Union’s legislative arsenal. Furthermore, the texts approved will have significant specific consequences, whose effects will be immediately noticeable. The Member States must recruit a large number of inspectors in order to deal with greater obligations in controlling ships in ports. Furthermore, shipowners, charterers, flag States and classification societies who are complacent or negligent in their operation or monitoring of ships will henceforth be liable to severe penalties such as the prohibition of ships not meeting minimum requirements from entering European ports, the publication of the names of negligent charterers or the withdrawal of the authorisation of classification societies in the event of poor performance.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe it is important to highlight another point of fundamental importance: Europe has once and for all made its mark as an indispensable partner in the international arena in the field of safety and all aspects relating to the maritime sector. In this regard, on the delicate issue of double hull ships, the States of the Union have not only reached an agreement so that, from 2015, no single hull oil tanker will be able to stop in any Community port, but also, and above all, the Union has persuaded the International Maritime Organisation to approve these requirements for all the oil tankers in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is also important to point out that the Erika II package which completes the whole initiative has made considerable progress recently. Last Friday the Transport Council approved a common position, pending final and formal approval next week, with regard to the Community system for monitoring traffic and the European Maritime Safety Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the proposed regulation on the Community fund for compensating damages resulting from accidental pollution, it is true that we are once again waiting for things to move ahead within the International Maritime Organisation. But I would like to say that it is already a great success that the Community initiative has led the current international debate – specifically within the IMO – towards the creation of an international fund which takes up the principles of the Commission’s proposal. Of course, we must ensure that the final result in the IMO conforms to our demands and ambitions. We are working on this and, just as we have ensured that things move ahead in the Union – thanks to Mr Watts’ insistence – in relation to black boxes, we also hope that the same will happen on this issue within the IMO.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to clarify certain matters. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say publicly that Malta and Cyprus are making a considerable effort to update their ship’s registers and to exclude and expel those that do not conform to the requirements of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end my speech by thanking Parliament and the three rapporteurs, who have worked brilliantly, for their support to the Commission. I would also like to ask them to cooperate with the other parliamentarians so that the Erika II package may pass through this House as soon as possible and that it may enter into force without delay. I would also like to publicly thank the services of the Commission, whose efforts have been wonderful. For your information, I am going to give you a piece of information on the subject of governance: the services relating to the maritime sector in the Directorate-General for Transport – including secretaries – comprise no more than 40 people, and they are the human team behind all these initiatives, as well as a series of other tasks and functions relating to the maritime, port and other sectors. This may give you an idea of the workload and the efforts made throughout this time.</p>
<p class="contents">This time the European Union has demonstrated that we have taken the fight against marine pollution seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by saying that, two years after the Erika tragedy, the satisfaction and success represented by the approval of the Erika I package today really must be a homage to all the citizens whose lives have been affected as a result of the sinking of the Erika two years ago. It must be a homage to all Europeans, who, over recent years, have seen the systematic repetition of huge disasters involving pollutants without any suitable or tangible measures, with sufficient rigour and sufficient demands, being taken, and also those of us who are genuine lovers of the sea and of the environment, who are thinking not just of today but of future generations. Thank you very much to all of you for your cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
