<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hughes (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, on 9 June 2004 the College of the Commission decided to dismiss 43 language teachers with almost immediate effect. Nine days later the officials responsible reported this decision to the teachers themselves at a general assembly in Brussels. I should like to quote directly from what two of the teachers said on that occasion:</p>
<p class="contents">'We denounce the flagrant lack of openness on the part of the Commission, who waited until today to announce the breaking of the teachers' contracts. In a Europe which claims to be social, we also denounce the cynicism of the Commission, which has plunged these workers into great difficulties - workers, some of whom are main bread-winners with children, many of whom are women. Most of these teachers are of an age at which it would be extremely difficult to find suitable employment. In the March 1997 trialogue agreement the teachers showed their willingness to collaborate in return for a promise by the Commission to maintain their contracts until retirement. Not so long ago Miss Morelli, in charge of training in the Council, in the presence of Commission representatives, reaffirmed on several occasions that the jobs of the teachers were guaranteed until they retired. We wish to record formally the breaking of these promises by the Commission.'</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that lengthy quote sums up a sad story very well. I have met with the dismissed teachers many times in recent months and have read a great deal of documentation from the time leading up to their dismissal. From that a number of things stand out. First, that for the teachers this decision came like a bolt from the blue. They were given absolutely no prior information about the plans for their dismissal. They were not consulted at all about those plans. Documents from throughout 2003 and the first half of 2004 show that at a whole series of meetings the teachers were given the impression that everything was fine, it was business as usual. One set of papers from mid-2003 actually dismisses rumours of planned restructuring. Other papers show the perfectly normal forward-planning of language training for the 2004-05 period but suddenly, in June 2004, the teachers learned of their abrupt dismissal.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it stands out that the Commission clearly feels that it is above and beyond the law. Any private entity behaving in the way that the Commission has would find itself in breach of EU laws on information and consultation, collective redundancies and transfer of undertakings. No doubt we will be told today that the Belgian laws giving effect to these EU directives do not apply to the Commission as a public administration, and yet these teachers were employed on Belgian employment contracts that are subject to Belgian employment law. This is the same institution that asks the corporate world to act in a socially responsible way and yet the way in which it has handled this matter so far has been totally socially irresponsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Commission has shown a total lack of regard for the plight of these people. Over 60% of them are aged over 55. Six months after the Commission decision their worst fears about not finding work at their age have proved only too real. Worse still, because of the restricted hours they were allowed under the contracts the Commission agreed with them it appears, according to a document I have received, that: 'the teachers may not be entitled to unemployment benefits, early retirement and social security cover'. That would leave them without cover until the age of 65, when their entitlement would become about EUR 500 per month. Clearly a number of the families dependent on these teachers face the real prospect of poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in relation to the trialogue agreement of 1997, the teachers and their representatives had the clearest understanding that they would be employed until retirement in exchange for agreeing new work practices and to work being put out to outside firms as teachers left. This was widely published at the time – in trade union newsletters, for example – and no-one from the Commission seemed to have contradicted that. A Commission official said something telling to us when we questioned her on this in committee. She said that sometime after the trialogue agreement the Commission's legal service was asked to give an opinion on whether such a guarantee was possible. The service said that it was not possible. An important question arises from that. Why was the legal service asked to give an opinion if such a guarantee had not been given at the trialogue?</p>
<p class="contents">It seems clear that, whether committed to writing or not, such a guarantee was indeed given and that the Commission, having sat silent at the many meetings at which that guarantee has been mentioned since, was quite content to allow everyone to continue with that understanding until it became opportune to go back to that legal opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has behaved in a disgraceful manner. However, it is never too late. I understand that a meeting will take place tomorrow between the Commission and the unions in Brussels. I hope that will be the first step towards reinstatement of these teachers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Potočnik,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, on 9 June 2004 the previous Commission took the decision to terminate the contracts of 43 language teachers. This decision has been perceived by certain parties as 'untransparent' and 'unjustified'. In this respect the questions put by the chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs reflect the concerns expressed by the teachers themselves. Before I reply in detail to the questions put by the honourable Member, I would like to make four introductory points.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the decision was taken in order to conform to the principle of sound financial management. Since 1997, Commission language courses have been delivered either by internal teachers with direct contracts with the Commission or by language schools selected via an open tender procedure. Each formula accounts for approximately 50% of the courses.</p>
<p class="contents">Quality-wise, surveys have shown there to be no difference between the courses given by internal trainers and those given by language schools. On the other hand, there is a significant difference in budgetary terms: one hour's training delivered by an internal trainer costs four times as much as an hour delivered by a language school. On a yearly basis, taking 2003 as the reference year, the costs are approximately EUR 3.5 million as opposed to EUR 900 000.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the language teachers have been granted generous compensation. The Commission offered compensation payments that went well beyond the minimum legal requirement. Minimum compensation would have been three months' salary per five years of service. That would have resulted in compensation equivalent to between 12 and 19 months' salary.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission opted, however, to calculate the compensation on the basis of the maximum amount ever granted by Belgian courts. This resulted in compensation of between 14 and 24 months' salary. This means gross amounts of between approximately EUR 19 000 and EUR 152 000. Furthermore, the Commission opted to pay this compensation without requiring the teachers to serve out their period of notice.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the decision to terminate the contracts in question is not a unilateral initiative by the Commission, but rather the outcome of moves initiated by the budgetary authority in the mid-1990s. In order to understand the decision of 9 June 2004 one must go back to the origins of this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole process started in the early 1990s, when Parliament externalised its language training in Luxembourg. At this time, the language courses at the Commission and the Council were delivered by internal trainers who were granted private law contracts, without any call for tender or selection procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">In the mid 1990s, the Committee on Budgets criticised both the Commission and the Council for the costs associated with this practice. After lengthy discussions, the trialogue – the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, the Secretary-General of the Council and the Commissioner in charge of personnel – concluded that gradual full externalisation was desirable. As a first step the parties agreed to launch a call for tenders for the supply of language courses, and also, by way of derogation from this principle, to allow existing internal teachers to continue their activities within their existing contract framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, the trialogue agreement did not constitute a commitment on teachers benefiting from lifelong employment. In detail, the trialogue agreed to allow the language teachers to continue working under contracts of indefinite duration without having to participate in the call for tender. This point was made explicit to the unions at the time, as the minutes of meetings show. At the same time, the possibility of terminating a contract of indefinite duration is governed by Belgian law and cannot be waived. Any agreement between parties not to apply the law is null and void.</p>
<p class="contents">After that basic introduction, I will now turn to the specific questions asked. The first is: did the Commission inform and consult the Council and Parliament before unilaterally breaching the trialogue agreement? There are three elements that need to be considered here. Firstly, the Commission did not breach the trialogue agreement because this agreement did not constitute a commitment on teachers benefiting from lifelong employment. Secondly, the Commission accepts that it could have informed the trialogue co-signatories – the Committee on Budgets and the Council – of its intention to proceed with the second phase of externalisation. Nevertheless, the Commission considers that its decision was broadly in line with the stated orientations of the trialogue and the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question is: when did the Commission inform the teachers' representatives, the union representatives and the Local Personnel Committee? The Commission informed the teachers' representatives, together with the teachers concerned, at the general assembly held on 18 June 2004, before the decision was notified. Under the social dialogue agreement, staff representatives and the Local Personnel Committee represent persons employed under the Staff Regulations. Since language teachers do not fall into this category, no staff representatives were involved in the case in point.</p>
<p class="contents">The third question is: what kind of information was communicated to the teachers' representatives? The Commission informed the teachers and their representatives of the decision taken on 9 June 2004, giving the reasons for this and explaining the practical consequences and arrangements, which included the Commission's plans for compensation payments.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth question is: does the Commission consider that its handling of this matter stands as a good example of best practice in terms of prior consultation and the provision of information in good time? Looked at from a legal point of view, then I would reply in the affirmative: the Commission complied in full with all the relevant obligations, even if, as already stated, the Commission could have informed the co-signatories of the trialogue agreement before adopting the decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The fifth question is: does the Commission feel it has fully faced up to its social responsibility to the teachers concerned? The Commission has not only fulfilled all its legal obligations but has also interpreted its obligations in the most favourable way for the persons concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The sixth and last question is: can the Commission comment on and provide copies of any opinions given by the Commission's Legal Service on the dismissal of the teachers requested by DG ADMIN? The opinions given by the Commission's Legal Service are governed by the rules applicable to relations between lawyers and their clients. Therefore, the Commission will not release the opinions or comments of its Legal Service.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commission's position can be summarised as follows. Firstly, as regards the substance of the matter, the Commission considers that the decision to terminate the contracts concerned was sound. It was no longer tenable to continue a dual system where half of the courses were provided by internal teachers at a cost approximately four times greater than the courses provided by language schools, with no difference in quality.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission implemented this decision in full compliance with its legal obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Commission accepts that it could have informed the co-signatories of the trialogue agreement before adopting the decision. However, the Commission considers that its decision was broadly in line with the orientations of the trialogue and the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission has no intention of reducing the number of courses. It reaffirms its commitment to multilingualism and to continuing to provide its staff with opportunities for a high standard of language learning without compromising on quality. Obtaining better value for money without any loss of quality is obviously a means of attaining this goal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission, over which, at the time, Mr Prodi presided, acted without prior warning and without consulting and informing the employees in due time, something that was in flagrant contravention of the 1997 trialogue agreements, which I have here in my hand. This was an agreement between the institutions, signed by Mr Samland for the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgets, Mr Trumpf on behalf of the Council, and Commissioner Liikanen on behalf of the Commission, which assured the teachers that their contracts would run until they reached pensionable age.</p>
<p class="contents">The language teachers have, by the way, told me that, as a contribution to the sound financial management that you have just mentioned, they made the savings demanded of them by working four extra hours a week unpaid. On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and following discussions with the persons concerned, I will ask, as I have done before, what alternative employment there actually was for these teachers in view of the fact that the deadlines for appointments to other institutions had already expired at the end of June.</p>
<p class="contents">Your intervention has done little to dispel my misgivings as to whether Belgian law, according to which redundancies without agreed financial provision are legally void, has been complied with. The employer did nothing to discharge its obligations. Was the teachers’ lawyer consulted in due time, for example? I doubt it. How does your conduct square with the principle of good and responsible governance, and with the accountability of public authorities? Is the Commission even acquainted with the precise terms of its own communication on corporate social responsibility? Commissioner, the guardian of the Treaties is meant to set an example; it is meant to set standards rather than undermine them. Something urgently needs to be done about this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as I am aware, this House was given no advance information about this either, and it is pretty dubious that the decision to dismiss the teachers was taken at the last meeting of the Commission before the European elections, as if it had been assumed that we would then hear nothing more about it.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing I want to say is that I do not think it acceptable that the Commission, which is, after all, engaged alongside us in the fight for a social Europe, should ditch its social responsibility and its obligations as an employer when it comes to safeguarding its own interests. How else is one to explain the fact, to which reference has already been made in this debate, that the teachers were not informed in advance of their dismissals, not to mention the way in which, for years on end, returns to the Belgian authorities described them only as part-time employees, so that their actual working time could not be taken into account?</p>
<p class="contents">We are told, thirdly, that teaching is, in future, to be provided only by language schools. The first tenders have already been invited, and it is reported that the first contracts have already been awarded. We can now therefore reckon with the possibility of some of the Commission’s language teaching being provided by the British Council, and, as that body has, as we know, a new head, it is interesting to consider the implications of this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commission to have an independent inquiry into this whole affair, in order, if possible, to conclusively refute the accusations that have been made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The matter has been discussed several times in that committee, but it has in actual fact also been discussed in the Committee on Budgets in which we perhaps had to approach it at a rather more difficult angle, given that we also, of course, wanted to see administration that was as efficient and inexpensive as possible. When, as justification for this dismissal of the 43 teachers, the Commission refers to considerations of sound financial management and the need to ensure both that the costs do not get badly out of hand and that the language courses are obtainable at a third or fourth of the former price, it is difficult for people involved with the budget not to say that the decision is apparently a sensible one.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we in the Committee on Budgets have paid attention first and foremost to the way in which matters have proceeded. The administration must of course be efficient and inexpensive and, in recent years, we in Parliament have exerted considerable pressure to ensure that the Commission implements reforms and that, through these reforms, a more open and transparent system is obtained, which also means a system that is perhaps better in tune with the world around us. There is of course a general prejudice among our electorate that Commission employees are very cosseted, privileged and highly paid, and we must therefore do our best to ensure that remuneration is reasonable and that things are not bought at a higher price than they need to be. That is an important point of departure.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, I would point out that the Commission should also be an attractive place of work and should also comply with the current ground rules designed to protect employees. We have been assured that the Belgian rules have been complied with. I presume that this fact is reflected in the compensation that has been given to the teachers and which, according to the Commissioner, is apparently by far the most generous ever seen. That no doubt also reflects the fact that matters have not proceeded properly in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Hughes has pointed out, the Commission must also comply with some of the requirements we make of employers outside the confines of the Commission. The Commission too must demonstrate social responsibility and sound management. I would therefore recommend that an amicable solution be found regarding this matter, thus ensuring that it is properly resolved. Ways should also, however, be looked into of ensuring, in the future, proper administration that complies with the requirements of the law, is inexpensive and is suitably in keeping with the organisation’s social responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have heard the Commission’s reply. It is the usual reply of employers to laid-off employees, to the effect that all the conventions have been respected. In fact, that is not the case. Rather, this is a genuine labour dispute. These language teachers have worked for the Commission for decades. They have trained various Commissioners in the languages of the various countries, and yet they are being kicked out. That is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot believe for one single moment that the Commission might be compared to what are known pejoratively in France as the bosses. That is not possible. This is a labour dispute, so there need to be more negotiations and further discussion. I can well believe that there are unavoidable issues of progressive externalisation, but a few years might have been allowed to elapse before progressive externalisation led to language teachers within the Commission being dismissed. Where most of them were concerned, a delay of five, six or ten years would have been in order. There have, therefore, to be discussions in a dispute such as this.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I believe that, if the Commission wants attention to be paid to its views on the social dimension, which is defended by the European Parliament and by Europe as a whole, then there has to be discussion, and the Commission has, today in particular, a duty, at this level, to set an impeccable example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 30 June last year, the chairman of my group, Mr Wurtz, sent letters to the Presidents of the Commission and Parliament, saying that the brutal decision to dismiss 43 language teachers at the Commission with open-ended contracts was in breach of the commitments undertaken by the Commission, the Council and Parliament in the trialogue of 18 March 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement stipulates that ‘representatives of the three institutions agree not to damage the contractual framework in which linguistic training is organised in the Commission and the Council as regards those employees currently benefiting from open-ended contracts’.</p>
<p class="contents">What, in that case, does the future hold for the credibility of this type of institutional agreement if one of the parties damages it unilaterally, using the argument that it complies with Belgian law? What kind of credibility can an institution have that claims to combat social dumping when its approach to budgetary savings is to outsource services? In so doing, it is jeopardising the social rights of people with 10, 20 or 30 years’ service, it is treating them like a disposable product to be thrown away after use, and it is overlooking the actual budgetary savings of around 25% that these workers achieved with unpaid work.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, how can the Commission claim to defend social dialogue and the rights of workers, women and the family, when, without prior warning and without any careers advice or alternative employment, it dismisses people most of whom have family responsibilities and are at an age when it is difficult to find a new job. Is this the management model and the model of social Europe that the Commission claims to defend, when it rides roughshod over the right to work and its social responsibilities? Is this the example that it wishes to set of a responsible public body, committed to linguistic training and to culture, when it dismisses people of great learning and of acknowledged professional and cultural ability and seeks to hire others at rates so low that it actually runs the risk of exploiting teachers?</p>
<p class="contents">Is this because the new executive Commission hopes to reemploy those workers who were unfairly dismissed by the previous executive? Our group will go straight to the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, to find out how he will …</p>

The way in which these people were dismissed is reprehensible, and the Commission should apologise for the manner of their dismissal. I repeat, the Commission should apologise for the manner of their dismissal. From a legal point of view, however, the Commission had every right to dismiss them, and it did so not for its own satisfaction or to attract our criticism. The money saved will make it possible to create more jobs, as it cannot be denied that the EU is an over-generous employer. Outside the confines of the European institutions in Belgium an average of EUR 30 per hour would be paid for the same work, or in other words four times less than the figures quoted here. We wronged these people by dismissing them in such a tactless fashion, and they deserved compensation for this. It would be fair to ask, however, whether feeling guilty is sufficient reason to overturn a Commission decision. I thank you.</p>

The Commission maintains that it has fulfilled its legal obligations and acted in accordance with the principles of sound financial management, requiring high-quality courses at a reasonable price.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally wonder about the procedure used to calculate the cost of externalising or privatising this service, compared with the cost of the previous contracts. I would also point out that we miss no opportunity in this House to denounce the externalisation or privatisation of services that is undertaken by national or international companies in our Member States. Our institutions too engage in privatisation and externalisation, but without putting in place the social plans such as we – at least in my own country – impose upon our companies following negotiation with the unions.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that it is necessary to devise a social plan for the interested parties in order to put an end to the veritable impoverishment to which the families concerned have been exposed. My fellow MEPs have talked at length about this.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I have a very specific question. How has the restricted invitation to tender been organised for the purpose of selecting the firms invited to replace the former teachers no later than February 2005? Is it true that the bidders in response to this invitation to tender of 30 June include the British Council,<span class="italic"> </span>where one of the posts of responsibility is at present occupied by the former Commissioner responsible for administration who arranged for these sudden redundancies?</p>
<p class="contents">In my capacity as Quaestor responsible for language courses in Parliament, I should also like to add that, there too, we are confronted with a similar problem.

Please take account of the fact, Commissioner, that you have only talked to us about the budgetary elements of the issue, and you have completely forgotten the social elements relating to this problem, and consider as well, Commissioner <span class="bold">–</span> and this is my contribution <span class="bold">–</span> the cultural elements. This complete externalisation of services is being carried out and justified on the basis of budgetary arguments, and those arguments alone are being taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">In this Parliament there is also a Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and a Committee on Culture and Education which you must listen to. With regard to the Committee on Culture and Education, Commissioner, there is a real risk that multilingualism, and quality multilingualism, may be affected by this decision. It is not possible to continue taking decisions of this calibre solely on the basis of monetary considerations. Multilingualism is a jewel which must be maintained, and it is not the case nor has it been proven that all needs can be covered by means of external sources; and it is not the case, Commissioner, that quality is equivalent, because all the analyses have been carried out on the basis of differing elements, comparing situations and languages which are not equal.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we shall be watching very carefully to ensure that, in the future, this Commission does not continue in the same way as the previous Commission, thinking solely in budgetary terms and always dealing with budgetary issues rather than quality, jobs and the weakest categories of workers in this Union.</p>

This response by the Commission truly illustrates that there are no arguments and exposes it irreparably vis-à-vis the employees.

For this reason we must not remain indifferent, irrespective of the reasons that led to this decision.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the dismissal of the language teachers by the Commission, I have received widely differing information, so I have found it difficult to decide who, in fact, is in the right. In spite of this I think that the status of the dismissed teachers has to be regulated, especially since they had contracts for permanent employment and also in view of their past work and the fact that some of them had worked for the Commission for more than 20 years. In the European Union we strive for the equal treatment of all institutions, and so the Commission and the European Parliament must be examples of such treatment. In addition, the new Constitution, which the majority of us support, states in Article 90: ‘Every employee shall have the right to protection from unfair dismissal in accordance with the legislation of the Union and national laws.’</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I propose that the case of the 43 teachers be re-examined and that, in view of their past work, an appropriate solution be found for them. Enlargement has brought about an increase in the number of Member States, so I cannot believe that there is suddenly no need for these teachers. I also recognise that the Commission has to act in a thrifty and economical manner, but this should not be at the expense of breaking the law. In view of the fact that the contracts were drawn up on the basis of the trilateral agreement, it would seem appropriate to find a solution within such a framework. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I endorse what other Members of this House have said and, for the sake of brevity, shall move on to mention other potentially unwelcome political consequences of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Multilingualism will suffer if we dispense with the work performed by skilled and experienced professionals in their difficult and complex job and outsource that work to people with dubious profile, experience and competence. After all, nobody can guarantee that the work will be done to the necessary standard expected and when it comes to the recruitment procedure and to guarantees of competence, there does not appear to be any accurate information available.</p>
<p class="contents">This matter should concern all of us and not only with regard to the teachers, but also to what might be happening here in Parliament. It might be useful for us to pay a little attention to what is happening with the interpreters, in particular the freelancers, who are highly qualified, have been providing professional services for many years, and the turnover of whom is lower and lower.</p>
<p class="contents">This is no way to solve financial problems that may arise in any of these situations. The construction of Europe, as we wish to see it, will be no more than a fantasy compared to the one that the Commission is offering us now, given the way in which it does not deem the trialogue as binding for the parties to it. Quite apart from the multilingualism issue, this is also a very serious problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are not in court here, Mr Potočnik; we are in the European Parliament. I will make just two comments about the culture that your report expresses. First, if your arguments prevailed in every country in Europe, we would have neither the Lisbon Charter nor even probably the Human Rights Charter. We would have a return to an industrial relations system based on rules that are unacceptable to all the political groups in Parliament, as I have heard.</p>
<p class="contents">The second remark I would like to make to you is this: you should realise that a decision like the one you insist on making sends a terrible message to Parliament, namely that a rule is coming into force in Europe, in Parliament and in the European institutions that was typical of peoples’ democracies during the Soviet era throughout the twentieth century, that is to say: ‘give little and expect little’. The signs are there already in the structures and relations concerning translations, and these are the results.</p>

We know of examples where employees have been unjustly thrown out of work. But they have not been lucky enough to have their cases taken up by a plenary session of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be grateful that the European Commission language teachers have brought their case to us. It gives us the chance to consider how to prevent wrongs within the European institutions. We are not just talking about some company or other which fires some employees in order to increase its profits. We are talking about the guardian of the treaties, charged with monitoring the proper application of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. The problem with the language teachers is just one sad example of administrative mistakes in the European Commission. Let us not forget that other problems persist. Remember the case of Mrs Andersen and Mr van Buitenen, the Eurostat, OLAF and Blue Dragon affairs. If we, as Members of the European Parliament, are charged with overseeing the European Commission, then we must act in these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I call upon the parliamentary Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to give priority attention to this matter at the highest level, to look at all cases similar to this one and to take the necessary steps. We must ensure that employment law is applied and that public servants and employees of the institutions are protected.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it would be desirable to invite all public servants, whatever their rank, to contact Members of the European Parliament they have elected and give them clear information about administrative shortcomings within the European institutions.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, there are a few reasons why we cannot rehire the teachers, the first of which is financial: such hiring would be incompatible with the Financial Regulation in two aspects, the first of which is procurement and the second is the principle of sound financial management.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason is legal. If the teachers were rehired, language courses would continue to be delivered by internal teachers and teachers employed at the language schools. This coexistence has always constituted a legal risk. The difference in salary and other conditions was significant. In this respect, there is a risk that such a difference of treatment between employees who essentially carried out the same duties would be considered by the Belgian courts as an illegal contractual construction.</p>
<p class="contents">The third reason concerns assessing whether rehiring the teachers would mean having to negotiate new conditions. Experience shows that internal teachers were not particularly flexible vis-à-vis the Commission, despite the advantageous conditions it offered.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there was the question about procurement restrictions. This was not a restrictive procedure. The Financial Regulation obliges the Commission to issue an open call for tenders where the four-year amount is in excess of around EUR 155 000. In fact, the call for candidates was opened and published in the Official Journal. The selection procedure was conducted on the basis of financial and technical criteria. The successful candidates were then allowed to compete and, finally, contractors for different lots were then chosen on the basis of cost and quantity.</p>
<p class="contents">I will very briefly address the issue of total savings. They were calculated in terms of the difference between what it would cost to maintain the teachers' contracts and the cost of severance payments. The savings were calculated on the basis of the costs for 2003. The total savings also took into account the total cost of the language-training programme, each teacher being replaced at retirement age by a contractor employee, and the total cost of the same language-training programme executed exclusively by contractors as from September 2004. Finally, account was taken of the sum of annual savings over the 2004-2031 period, when the fewest teachers would, theoretically, retire. At the beginning there would be many such teachers, but the number would decrease towards the end of that period. The final calculation under this scheme showed that the savings would come to EUR 23.8 million.</p>
<p class="contents">A remark was made about the exaggerated figure. On the contrary, the EUR 23.8 million – cited in the documents prepared for the Commission decision – to which I referred corresponds to the cost of continuing teachers' contracts, and that was reduced to EUR 20 million. The decision was taken on that basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The real amount also depends on individual decisions by teachers to take early retirement or to leave on personal grounds of invalidity and sickness, and, lastly, on the salary and contract cost evaluation. In this context we wanted to err on the side of caution.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point raised concerns the British Council and its work. According to information provided by the contractors, I can assure you that no previous or present Commissioner is a member of the management board of any of the previous or current contractors. In 2004 the British Council tendered for English courses, but the contracts were awarded to CLL and Lerian Communications. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
