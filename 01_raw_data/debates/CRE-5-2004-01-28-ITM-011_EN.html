<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Avilés Perea (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, today we are examining a report which stems from the decision taken on 8 April 2003 to postpone granting discharge for the Committee of the Regions’ accounts. This happened because we received information at the eleventh hour about certain irregularities in the accounts. When the report had virtually been completed, we were informed that the accounts could contain irregularities; the informant was concerned that there could be irregularities in the reimbursements of travel expenses and daily allowances and potentially some instances of fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this suspicion, we in the Committee on Budgetary Control asked for the discharge of the accounts to be postponed in order to carry out a detailed audit and to be able to establish a full picture regarding the suspected irregularities. The audit was eventually carried out by the Court of Auditors, who looked at the general budget of the Committee of the Regions and at the financial and administrative management of that budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of the audit did not identify any serious irregularities. At the same time, OLAF produced a report regarding the possibility of fraud in the Committee of the Regions and did not find any evidence of fraud for personal gain or any intentional fraud on the part of Committee of the Regions staff. A few internal administrative deficiencies were identified, but were of little real significance, particularly given that between 2001, the period in question, and our meeting, the Committee of the Regions had amended its own internal rules and introduced a number of changes specifically designed to prevent the kind of irregularities that could have occurred in the past, and also promised to change the internal administration and provide training for staff to prevent any irregularities occurring.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to acknowledge – and I personally have to state – that the Committee of the Regions has made an effort to clarify its internal organisation so as to improve accounting and it has produced regulations to prevent problems or duplications when reimbursing travel expenses and daily allowances for members of the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The fraud that was actually identified was of very little significance: a small amount, most of which has been cleared up, and the problem of the tiny sum still requiring clarification is currently being resolved in collaboration with a former Committee member.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore saw a rapid response on the part of the Committee of the Regions at all times, and a willingness to work with us, with Parliament, to improve compliance with the rules, and to achieve greater transparency and to allow us to feel that this problem was being addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this, I recommend that Parliament approves the report I am presenting today on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control and approves the discharge for the Committee of the Regions accounts together with the recommendations we have included in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Following advice from Parliament’s Legal Service, we have deleted from the report all specific references to the OLAF report. It seemed inappropriate to refer to a report which, by its very nature, is confidential. These quotes were therefore taken out immediately and we will not even be voting on whether they should be omitted – instead they will not be considered admissible, which does not alter the report significantly.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the amendments that have been submitted, I can tell you that I support Amendments Nos 3, 4, 5 and 6, but oppose all the others.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope you will study this report carefully. It is the fruit of the labour and cooperation of most of the Committee on Budgetary Control. At all times we sought to improve accounting in the Committee of the Regions – both in our own interest as Members of Parliament and in the interest of the committee itself, given its importance as one of the European institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Committee of the Regions is the newest EU institution, and it is also a small one. In terms of its composition, it is extremely heterogeneous, at least as regards the political status and rank of its members in their home states. Could this be why we had so many difficulties with the 2001 discharge? Shortcomings and even irregularities were drawn to the attention of the Committee on Budgetary Control as it was about to vote last spring on the resolution giving discharge to the Committee of the Regions for 2001. The rapporteur, Mrs Avilés Perea, put on the brakes and recommended the postponement of the discharge and an audit of the practices being undertaken in the COR, preferably by the European Court of Auditors – a recommendation which the plenary took up. In the meantime, the rapporteur and the committee have carried out detailed work and are now proposing that discharge be granted to the Committee of the Regions for 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet this does not mean that the dubious incidents in the COR are forgiven and forgotten. They are likely to come to light again in the context of the 2002 discharge, especially as the Court of Auditors proposes to undertake a more detailed audit, something it felt unable to do in 2001. Mrs Avilés Perea’s report takes account of a number of recommendations by OLAF and makes clear demands of the COR. There are no indications of personal enrichment or the loss of financial resources. The incorrect calculation of travel allowances has now been regulated through recoveries, although in future, the maintenance of presence lists and the calculation of members’ allowances must be carried out scrupulously and be verifiable. Payment procedures must be in line with the financial regulations. There must be respect for the institutional role of the Internal Auditor. The President of the Committee of the Regions has announced the implementation of an action plan to improve administration and management, and this includes rules on dealing with whistleblowers. Whether or not there are to be disciplinary proceedings is something for the COR itself to decide. Overall, the Committee on Budgetary Control is very concerned about the extent to which an amateurish improvisatory approach has prevailed in the administration to date.</p>
<p class="contents">We will monitor the improvements which have been called for, and which have been pledged, benevolently but with close attention so that the 2001 discharge is right and proper, thus encouraging the COR to keep to the rules in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Hulten (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, in March 2003 when the Committee on Budgetary Control was about to vote on the resolution giving discharge to the Committee of the Regions for 2001, I received a telephone call from the internal auditor of the Committee of the Regions, Mr Robert McCoy, as did several of my colleagues. Mr McCoy had alarming news for us: the information provided to Parliament by the Committee of the Regions in the course of the discharge procedure was incorrect.</p>
<p class="contents">The next day, the Budgetary Control Committee decided that the vote should be postponed to give Mr McCoy a chance to present his views. He did so, and issued what he called a cry for help. He said that his views had been misrepresented by the Secretary-General and the Finance Director of the Committee of the Regions, and that, despite a series of reforms, the COR still flouted basic financial rules, in particular in relation to tendering procedures and Members’ expenses.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of Mr McCoy’s intervention, the Budgetary Control Committee, and subsequently plenary, decided to postpone discharge for the COR and called on that institution to commission – and I quote – 'a detailed, full and independent audit, to be carried out by an external and recognised institution – preferably by the European Court of Auditors – on the Committee's overall budget implementation, as well as the financial and administrative management; considers that the audit should examine, inter alia, the areas listed above and attest to the sound financial management of the institution'. At the same time I decided to refer the case to OLAF.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of these investigations were shocking. In the case of the Court of Auditors it was shocking because we received a one-page document consisting of 300 words which basically gave the COR a clean bill of health. This was not what we had asked for. The OLAF report painted a quite different picture. It had found an endemic culture of unprofessionalism and improvisation. It uncovered evidence of tampering with tendering procedures by COR officials and false expenses claims by members – including former presidents – of the COR. It went on to say that the efforts of the administration had been focused on discouraging or destabilising the messenger of the bad news, in this case the financial controller, rather than to change things for the benefit of the COR.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr McCoy was therefore right when he came to see us and he deserves an unreserved apology for the treatment he has been subjected to, and applause for his courage in coming forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The COR has now begun to improve things: the Secretary-General has been removed from his post for different reasons – although the bungled process of his appointment was also likely to be a result of the administrative chaos at the COR; the President of the COR has announced a preliminary enquiry into the opening of disciplinary proceedings; a reform process has been set in motion involving all COR staff who wish to be involved and a former Member of the Court of Auditors is to advise the COR on the adequacy of the reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons the COR and its President deserve the benefit of the doubt. That is why my Group will be voting to grant discharge tomorrow, but will do so with very little enthusiasm.</p>

<p class="contents">As a result of the refusal to grant discharge, two bodies carried out investigations: the European Court of Auditors and OLAF. I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed by the investigation by the Court of Auditors. An investigation that can be expressed in a couple of sentences is not what I would call ‘thorough’; it was rather too superficial an investigation for my taste. I have greater respect for the report by OLAF, which has examined the matter in greater detail.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been a great many abuses; the great hope is that these will now disappear. In this regard, I agree with the previous speakers who said that the role of the Financial Controller is essential. It was a bad omen that, when the Financial Controller brought the abuses to light, one of the first things that the Administration of the Committee of the Regions did was to dismiss a member of his staff.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased, therefore, that this Parliament has adopted an amendment to the 2004 budget by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to give that Financial Controller, right now, two extra members of staff for the coming financial year. We consider the role of the Financial Controller essential in all the European institutions. It cannot be emphasised enough that this person must act completely independently – independently of the hierarchy – in order to express his or her opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall be supporting the critical tone of Mrs Avilés Perea’s resolution, because we think that she has done a good job.

It is a very critical report that indicates the sensitive areas when it comes to procurement and to cheating in connection with the reimbursement of travel expenses. We draw the same conclusion as the ELDR Group: no discharge should be granted. The criticism is too serious.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as with the Eurostat story, we have been made aware of these problems through what is known as a whistle blower<span class="italic">.</span> If the Committee of the Regions’ financial controller had not contacted us, we should never have discovered how bad things were. We should just be grateful that there are EU employees willing to take the risks involved in pointing out what is wrong. These assertions are also well corroborated in OLAF’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">If we were to grant discharge, we should also be doing so to the Committee of the Regions’ Secretary General. That is something we think cannot be done. It is the Secretary General against whom OLAF believes that a disciplinary procedure should be instituted, so it would be out of place. We shall vote against granting discharge to the Committee of the Regions. We think there is too much that has not been cleared up and that a still stronger desire should be shown to devise better procedures for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have gone a long way since February 2003. The first plan was to grant it discharge for satisfactory management, but the reports from the Court of Auditors and OLAF have confirmed the need for the report. None of this would have been possible without the high professional and moral qualities – yes, you have to be able to stand up to pressure! – of Mr McCoy, the financial controller, who today deserves all the European Parliament’s gratitude.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments which I have tabled are in line with the report and are based on proven facts. In that, their adoption is essentially a technicality and I hope that a large number of Members will be able to support them. On the other hand, it seems to me premature to grant discharge. The Casaca report is a cruel reminder to those who saw fit to grant discharge to the Commission last April that it cannot be granted by giving the benefit of the doubt. We should not vote for discharge if there is no enthusiasm for it and not blow only the fuses.</p>
<p class="contents">The Parliament, which has to check that the budget has been properly executed, must be certain of the progress made, of the measures taken, of any sanctions imposed, and not be content with promises or statements of intent. And as the Commission is attentively following our debates, I will take advantage of the fact to point out that this comment applies to everyone. It is not addressed to the Committee on the Regions alone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that we were very prompt in our response as soon as justified doubts arose – to which previous speakers have already made reference – about the way in which the Committee of the Regions managed public funds. I think it is important to make this point for once in this House. We have a Committee on Budgetary Control, and it is sensitive and flexible enough to exercise its responsibility within a matter of hours. I do not believe that any problems were caused by the decision to postpone discharge for the Committee of the Regions as a result of the concerns addressed to us. Indeed, I believe it showed that occasionally, there are small institutions within the European Union – so-called small institutions, although our taxpayers would probably take a different view – which might have a budget of EUR 30 million, where the members turn up once every few months and perhaps deliver an important speech before a plenary, and where otherwise, there is a great temptation to indulge in petty empire-building within the European Community.</p>
<p class="contents">I am most grateful to the President and his staff at the Committee of the Regions for having drawn the right conclusions from our comments, but I think it will be a lesson for us in other cases as well. I endorse the comments made by the previous speakers, and will gladly vote for Mrs Avilés Perea’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
