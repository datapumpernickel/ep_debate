<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Barthet‐Mayer </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Commissioner, Mr President, as rapporteur for the Committee on Agriculture on the extension of Regulation 2092/91 to organic production, I would remind you that we obtained very wide consensus in Parliament on this text. To the great satisfaction of Members, the Commission then took over a large number of our amendments and included them in its amended proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">During 1998, the successive versions of the text discussed in the Council unfortunately resulted in a significant shift. So the purpose of my two oral questions today is to alert the Commission and the Council on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture, and I want to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture for their confidence and support in taking this action that meets their concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">This shift relates to three areas. First, the transitional conversion periods are considerably extended. It does not take 15 years to reduce the number of chickens in a building. Next, there is an increase in the number of derogations, which could end up distorting the proposal. This applies, for example, to the sensitive issue of feed. In principle, this should be entirely organic in this type of production, and in this respect the Commission"s proposal is already sufficient derogation in itself, since it recommends 90 % organic feed. Finally, standards and thresholds going far beyond the Commission"s proposal have been progressively introduced. There is also a risk of it becoming a form of catch‐all regulation authorising intensification in organic agriculture, which is a contradiction in terms.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware of what is at stake economically in connection with consumers" recent interest in this sector of production in the European Union, and also in connection with potential future exports. I thus felt bound to react to put the legislators on their guard against the internal risk from such a flimsy and incoherent regulation, which is likely to distort competition according to different national or regional interpretations and methods of control that are not harmonised.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to put them on their guard about the fact that the application of a complete regulation is being delayed even further, with the risk that the European Union – a pioneer in this field – might have only have to meet the general standards of the <span class="italic">codex alimentarius</span> , its text being currently under discussion, with all that that also involves in terms of the actual nature of imports from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As in other agricultural sectors, the lack of a strong common proposal threatens to weaken the Union later on in the World Trade Organisation, because we know the debate is going on in the United States to try to impose GMOs, the use of urban sludge, irradiation of foodstuffs, and even natural hormones on organic farming. All this is very different from our European conception of this sector. Organic farming must undoubtedly remain a symbol of the most demanding, the strictest and the most thoroughly controlled quality, to the benefit of all who want it, both producers and consumers. It is a voluntary approach and everyone is free to adhere to it or adopt another type of quality production.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, I call on the Commission to stand by its proposal, and even withdraw it if it is being excessively distorted by the Council. But I do hope that it will not be necessary to go that far. And I am also very hopeful when I call on the Council to have another in‐depth look at this proposal, in the knowledge that we are, of course, in agreement with its proposal of last December, which lays down the principles of organic breeding. But we very firmly reiterate our request that the Council"s text be revised, and we hope, in line with what Mr Funke gave us to understand this morning, that the Presidency‐in‐Office will heed the combined voices of Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, Mr President‐in‐Office, please do not let cut‐price organic farming develop.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Funke, </span>  <span class="italic">President‐in‐Office of the Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Barthet‐Mayer, we dealt with this issue in the Agriculture Council of 14‐15 December and, as you know, agreed on guidelines, but we also urged that it should be adopted as soon as possible in the spring of this year, in accordance with your wishes, as the Council also saw the need for speedy adoption.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, we cannot currently predict what the substance of the text of the regulation ultimately submitted will be. We shall have to wait and see, but the opinion of the Council was that, as you requested, we need a clear demarcation between organic production and conventional production. I fully agree with you on this. However, on the other hand, we must proceed with the necessary flexibility and simply appraise the situation as we go along. We must also be flexible in facilitating the transition for those who wish to change over to organic livestock production. For this reason we also discussed appropriate transitional periods. One side called for fifteen years. If I remember correctly, we agreed on twelve years. I know that there was a lengthy, in‐depth discussion about this twelve‐year period and – you are shaking your head anxiously – that we can of course also call for shorter periods. On the other hand, however, we know that it was as a result of practical experience that we decided to favour longer periods. I assure you that we will implement this quickly in accordance with your wishes and that we will monitor observance of the demarcation very strictly.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fischler, </span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Funke has already indicated, there were various problems in the discussions in the Council with the proposal submitted by the Commission following debate in Parliament. The main problem is really that some of the elements of our proposal cannot be readily introduced in all Member States. We therefore had a debate on transitional derogations to allow the national provisions that currently exist in most Member States to be brought into line with future Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the amendments concern in particular the origin of the animals, as animals or feedingstuffs can come from conventional holdings. We must not forget that in a number of Member States organic farming has hardly been practised up to now. We must give these countries an opportunity to start organic farming if they wish to do so. This is really why we want a transitional provision of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress that harmonisation can only progress gradually, particularly if the relevant livestock production has hitherto been governed predominantly by national or regional rules. Certain amendments were proposed in order to solve this problem. They concern in particular the tethering of animals and requirements in terms of the lying area and litter area that should be provided for each animal.</p>
<p class="contents">Do not forget that for centuries tethering was the normal way to keep animals, particularly on small holdings. And if a farmer has his small farm in the middle of a village it is not always easy to provide the appropriate litter areas. Nor should you forget that it is the smaller holdings that today are already recognised as organic farms, but that this recognition would have to be revoked if they did not have a litter pen. So here we must be prepared to reach a compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to point out that derogations always apply for a transitional period only and that these are by no means unprecedented. Such provisions also exist for example for seeds and plants or for conventional ingredients in organic foodstuffs. With regard to future action I would simply like to clarify that the Commission is of course prepared to defend its proposal and if necessary to justify why certain exceptions are necessary on a temporary basis.</p>

<p class="contents">All this – you know that I defend the Commission and also the Council on all important issues – fell victim to propaganda in my home town during the election. It was said that ropes were banned from cowsheds, so of course people moaned about the nasty Eurocrats again. I am pleased that this subject is now closed and that common sense has prevailed in Europe. Thank you. We can now at long last continue to support a very reasonable method of production.</p>

The basic conditions should be created to ensure that they do not remain outsiders, with the exception of ideologues. Flexibility, which you mentioned, Mr Funke, is right, necessary and sensible, but it should take the right direction and should not be a form of protection for large industrial concerns that wish to maintain forms of production that admittedly lead to relatively low unit prices in economic terms but ultimately harm public health. I believe this is what you meant by flexibility. In any case that is how I see it.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the transition periods are too long. Pointless conditions that make organic farming much more difficult should be abolished or not introduced in the first place. But I believe that marketing and promotion are vitally important and necessary, both to change consumer habits and, in the form of commercial initiatives, to create sales opportunities for small farms, as most of the farms concerned are small holdings.</p>
<p class="contents">Four weeks ago a study was presented to us by the chamber of commerce in Bozen in the south Tyrol. It was a comparative study of 1 500 cooperatives in the Alps, from France to Slovenia, and we learned that the farms that were involved in these cooperatives fared much better than the others in terms of income security. Since mainly small farms are involved we would need to introduce greater support for cooperatives in this area. If you do not yet have this study, I would be glad to provide you with a copy.</p>
<p class="contents">In Austria we have learned that almost 20 % of current production comes from areas of organic production. I believe we are moving in the right direction. It is an advantage for our consumers, for health, for better extensification of farmland and, I believe, it offers good future prospects for young farmers too, particularly as the average age of more than half of those employed in agriculture is over 55 years.</p>

There are already rules in Europe on fruit and vegetables, and almost everyone knows what the definition of these is. This is far from being the case with animal products. I think it is very important that we should allow as few derogations from the rule as possible. If there are derogations, I think consumers will lose all confidence, and it will also mean that there is no proper competition. I think that Mr Funke"s suggestion just now that we should look at all this again in the spring is a very welcome one.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly not all countries will be able to start at the same time. But that is not the issue here. The issue here is whether we can sell customers things which satisfy their expectations and which are able to meet certain standards for organic production. Other countries can join in later. But it is important that consumers should have the assurance that there is a specific definition consistent with their expectations, and that producers should know the requirements to which they must produce. That is it, really. Anyone who cannot meet those expectations will not sell these products and will not produce them either. Once again, we look forward with interest to the spring.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Graefe zu Baringdorf </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, the history of the regulation on organic farming began in 1992. Initial discussions led to the regulation on plants, then followed the commitment by Parliament and then by the Commission that animals would be covered a year later. It is now 1999, and as the President‐in‐Office said earlier, all we have to do now is to adopt it. But please, Mr Funke, do not put urgency before quality since we have been working on this for so long already!</p>
<p class="contents">What is the current situation? We are now at the stage of the legislative procedure where Parliament has adopted a position on this issue. The Commission has adopted some of Parliament"s amendments. The Council requires a unanimous vote to reject this modified proposal containing Parliament"s amendments, if the Commission keeps to its proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to discuss two points: tethering and gene technology. Tethering is not mentioned at all in the Commission"s proposal. This means that it will have to be inserted later and the Commission will have to be prepared to compromise so that this problematic issue can be covered, because it is a subject that has been neglected completely, at least for cattle. I would ask you not to insist excessively on animal welfare, which essentially has nothing to do with appropriate ways of keeping animals. Appropriate tethering is perfectly possible, but exact details must be given, and we must not throw the baby out with the bath water.</p>
<p class="contents">For the use of genetically modified organisms the principle is different. The Commission adopted the proposal that we do not want the use of genetically modified organisms to be included in this regulation and therefore in organic production. This is therefore a ban. There is a ban on using genetically modified organisms, and it should remain.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet we have the problem of what to do with potentially contaminated organisms. This is where we begin to weaken. With regard to tethering I am in favour of a moderate approach, but here I am in favour of a strict approach, because if we allow contamination and then in the novel foods regulation, to which it relates, allow a certain percentage that need not be labelled, we are allowing the use of genetically modified organisms through the backdoor; if tests then show that products do indeed contain such organisms, we will lose our markets. Here I would ask that we proceed with caution. Furthermore, the question of contamination is dependent on what measures are taken to ensure that other areas are not contaminated during<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span> release experiments. I would ask for a very strict approach to be adopted here, Commissioner. It is in your hands. If you do not seek a compromise with the Council on this, the Council"s hands are tied. We may postpone the matter once again, but then we must not act in haste but give priority to quality.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Souchet </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations has also signed the joint motion for a resolution on organic livestock production because the Commission"s proposal is much too lax. It provides for far too many derogations and it is in contradiction to the rigour of the national standards established by a number of Member States, including France. Even if the final revised version allows Member States to maintain stricter national provisions than those to be applied at European level, we are bound to fear a levelling down.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group is aware of the potential of organic livestock production for the agriculture of Member States. After what has happened with BSE and GMOs, the consumer wants a level of food safety that organic production can guarantee.</p>
<p class="contents">But before signing the joint motion for a resolution, the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations called for the incorporation of a certain number of points that it considers essential. Derogations must be strictly and entirely limited to production subject to the external constraint of extreme and exceptional climate conditions. Transitional regimes must be limited in terms of their duration to allow producers to adapt their system of production to European standards that are stricter their own specifications.</p>
<p class="contents">With the <span class="italic">codex alimentarius</span> due to determine the rules relating to production, labelling and marketing of organic products as from the end of June 1999, the Union needs to adopt a clear position that incorporates strict standards. Finally, as regards labelling, our group is opposed to the harmonised European logo for organic products that some people want. As national specifications are different, the harmonised European logo would be a source of confusion for the consumer and would involve a levelling down of the health standards of organic livestock products.</p>
<p class="contents">Through its national legislation, the United States has tried to authorise the incorporation of GMOs into feed for animals intended for organic production. American consumers have succeeded in getting this proposal withdrawn and our group welcomes that fact. Thanks to the constraints it imposes in terms of specifications and the traceability of products, organic farming represents an attractive opportunity for some producers. It represents one means of linking agriculture closely to the land and permitting an agricultural price differential higher than standard world prices. Mr President, this dual advantage must not be abandoned to the benefit of the purely mercenary approach adopted by certain Member States towards organic production.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pinel </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, two types of farming coexist today. The first is one that responds to the demands of the multinationals, which are mainly American, that poisons the ground and foodstuffs, and that intends, for the first time in history, to patent living creatures and alter genetic heritage. It also plans to market non‐reproducible seeds, has been spreading cancer for the last 50 years and has cut human sperm production in half through pesticides, herbicides and fungicides. Then there is the other kind of farming, the form of peasant, traditional farming, which respects employment, the environment and human health, but which has been systematically marginalised by the lobbies, right down to its very name – organic – which is an ambiguous and opaque term as far as the general public is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The National Front prefers to talk about traditional and natural farming and chooses the farming that has shaped our civilisation down through the millennia. Farmers are the main victims of chemical methods. The socialists are the leading accomplices of this system: in France, for instance, they only grant FRF 100 per farm per year for conversion to organic farming. For the leading agricultural nation in Europe, faced with the challenge of a rapidly expanding market, this is ridiculous. Consumers want something other than mad cow disease, hormones and GMOs. These substances should be banned. In the face of the challenges of pollution, urban overcrowding and the destruction of the countryside, organic farming makes only a vague appearance in Agenda 2000 and that is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">So what should be done? Firstly, we must increase the level of resources set aside for conversion.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must oppose all levelling down and any derogation that will endanger the quality and credibility of organic farming networks of any kind. French standards are excellent in this respect, and must not be undermined. We say ‘no" to cut‐price organic farming!</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is scandalous that in 1999, products that guarantee jobs and protect the environment and public health are taxed at the same rate as doctored products that are full of hormones and that are the result of chemical, transgenic methods that are tragically destructive for consumers and for natural environments. So no tax or VAT should therefore be levied on organic farming.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hardstaff </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, the UK currently lags behind most EU countries in its production of organic food. Currently only about 1 % of our farm output is recognised as organic. However, the demand for such produce has risen enormously over the last few years, and not just because of the BSE crisis: our supermarkets simply cannot obtain enough organic produce to keep pace with this rising demand from their customers, even when looking to other Member States to meet the shortfall.</p>
<p class="contents">The demand is there and consumers are prepared to pay high prices for what they regard as a healthier and higher‐quality product. However, the transitional period for farmers switching to organic production is often very difficult, as they incur extra costs for some years before being able to obtain recognition as a fully organic producer and so able to command the higher prices. On the other hand, consumers need to know that they are paying more for a genuine organic product.</p>
<p class="contents">Here I want to join my colleagues in urging both the Commission and the Council to take speedy action to implement the measures to further organic husbandry, as recommended by the Committee on Agriculture, for which Mrs Barthet‐Mayer has been such an eloquent spokeswoman on this issue.</p>

I think we can say that the EU Agriculture Council has essentially succeeded in dealing with the new EU eco‐regulation. In our opinion the Federal Government has found acceptable compromises, particularly from a national point of view, in order to achieve vital objectives relating to livestock farming, feedingstuffs and veterinary medicine. I consider this intermediate step to be an initial reaction. An acceptable basis has been found for sustainable basic conditions for improved ecological livestock production. Several speakers considered this to be long overdue. It is now possible to conclude the amendment of the EU eco‐regulation under the German Presidency in the first half of 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">I have another question concerning the quality mark. But perhaps I am simply not well enough informed. Are we again to have all the different national quality marks and an additional quality mark that can be recognised EU‐wide, as Mr Mulder requested before in his report? I think it would be helpful to have an answer from you on this issue. But perhaps it is already in the text. Will there be different national quality marks or a harmonised EU quality mark?</p>
