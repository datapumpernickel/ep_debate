<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Busquin,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission wishes above all to express its solidarity with the citizens affected by the flooding that has recently affected several parts of southern France. Unfortunately, my colleague Michel Barnier has not been able to come to Strasbourg today. As you know, this question of natural disasters was debated at length here in this very place on 1 September at the end of a scorching summer.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been actively working on the question of natural disasters for the last few years in close cooperation with the European Parliament. In the face of the seemingly increasing rate of disasters, two key words underlie the Commission’s action: repair and prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as repairs are concerned, it is a matter of solidarity. Following the summer 2002 floods in Austria, the Czech Republic and Germany, on Michel Barnier’s initiative the Commission proposed the creation of the Solidarity Fund. Thanks to the support of your Assembly and the Council, this new instrument has now been in operation for a year, and since its creation its mobilisation has been requested 14 times; it has been effective in eight cases.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, the Commission does not yet have sufficient information about the recent flooding in the South of France to be able to say whether it will be possible to mobilise the Fund. In any case, we can only act if officially requested by the French national authorities. If we receive such a request, we will examine it as quickly as possible. Rest assured that we will take the situation in southern France into account in the review we will be presenting at the conference to be organised by the European Commission on 5 March 2004. The purpose of that conference is in fact to review the use made of the Solidarity Fund by several regions of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also point out that the regions of Languedoc-Roussillon and Provence Alpes-Côte d’Azur are already receiving a large amount of EU aid under Objective 2 of the Structural Funds. For the period 2000-2006, this aid amounts to EUR 316 million for Languedoc-Roussillon and EUR 340 million for Provence Alpes-Côte d’Azur. At the time of the floods that affected those regions in September 2002, specific measures were provided to repair the damage caused.</p>
<p class="contents">The mid-term review provides the opportunity to again put the emphasis on prevention or repair. If, as seems likely, the regions in question receive money from the performance reserve and if the programmes in question perform well, that could provide around an extra 4% on top of their allocation, that is EUR 10.8 million for Languedoc-Roussillon and EUR 12.3 million for Provence Alpes-Côte d’Azur. The distribution will be proposed to the Commission by the French State before 31 December next. Significant regional development measures may be financed.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the second key word: we must not be content with repairs, we must also give priority to prevention. These natural disasters raise the fundamental question of climate change and prevention, for which research is required. I want to assure you of my commitment and that of Mrs Wallström and the Commission as a whole in this matter. As Mr Barnier has recently told your Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, he intends proposing that a ‘prevention of natural risks’ line be included in every Structural Funds programme for a future programming period. In like vein, the third report on economic and social cohesion, which will be adopted by the Commission early next year, will propose that risk prevention be made one of the objectives of the Structural Funds during the next programming period, after 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also thinking of strengthening European coordination of civil protection, including the formation of a common European civil defence force, an idea on which Mr Barnier is particularly keen and on which he is working closely with Mrs Wallström. This new initiative, which is to be unveiled early next year, would have to build on existing structures, giving them sufficient resources to act quickly and promptly in the event of a disaster of any kind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The seriousness of this sadly repeated flooding affects us deeply.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like here to express again our deepest sympathy to all the victims, but also our gratitude to the civil defence services and volunteers, who have shown extraordinary dedication. We can only congratulate the rescue and European mutual assistance services on their good coordination, which was really effective. Our Parliament was also very active in this respect in asking for that mutual assistance to be put in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again in this Chamber we are having to deal with natural disasters, the consequences of which could nevertheless be better contained. Temporarily cleaning up, immediately reinstating the infrastructures, providing temporary accommodation, all that is only repair work. But we know that repairs cost a lot more than prevention. Prevention requires political courage, a command of urban planning and coherent regional development. Prevention costs less than repair, but we still need to be able to call on the resources.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true, as you reminded us, Commissioner, that at European level using the Structural Funds is one good way of rebuilding dykes, strengthening them, of quite simply maintaining waterways, of making retention basins. But there are two limits to this Structural Funds policy. The first lies in the fact that the Structural Funds are currently subject to the zoning rule and do not therefore place all victims on an equal footing. The second is that the amount available from these funds is not always sufficient. You only have to look at my own region, the Rhône-Alpes region, which unfortunately has not been mentioned today, even though it was severely affected at the same time as Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur and Languedoc-Roussillon. It was stricken recently, but will have no more Structural Funds to draw on for 2003-2006: it has all been spent.</p>
<p class="contents">I am now speaking to my parliamentary colleagues who are sometimes tempted to delete or reduce the regional policy budget. I say to them: be careful, make no mistake. This funding affects our fellow citizens very intimately, it is an expression of European solidarity, the foundation of the Union. We must all back Commissioner Barnier in his proposal to overhaul the Structural Funds. You said so yourself, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">These funds should not be constrained by zoning in future but should serve precise objectives, one of which would be concerned with the environment and risk prevention. Given the changes our planet is undergoing, we need collective courage to meet these ecological challenges. I hope that the Commission as a whole will go along with Commissioner Barnier’s proposals and that our Parliament will be able to adopt the budget the Structural Funds need.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, we must carry out repairs with the suffering families in mind. Europe created a Solidarity Fund for regions and states that have suffered natural disasters. It must also pool the technologies for prevention, based on the successful experience of the Netherlands, for example, putting in place cross-border cooperation. I hope, Mr President, Commissioner, that we will not have debates on natural disasters in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, I am much less optimistic than she is. Much less optimistic because I know very well that you were making a wish, Mrs Grossetête. However, wishes are not enough when we see the climate change that is taking place on our planet. I was in my region of Languedoc a few days ago and people told me that what we are seeing now did not used to happen once in a hundred years. We have now seen it three times in two years. It is therefore clear to see that there is a change of frequency, magnitude and scale.</p>
<p class="contents">I am always surprised to see the authorities, not just in my country, that would be too easy, but in all the countries affected, running a little bit behind the disaster. This summer, in the regions that were affected in south eastern France, the locals were already piling up sandbags. How was it that the local people knew, but the authorities did not act until disaster happened? There is clearly a gap between those who are on the ground and suffer the destruction and the decision makers, who are obviously still far away from it.</p>
<p class="contents">With heat waves, storms and sudden floods, the climate is changing. I do not have the impression that public policies are changing at the same rate. I think a whole arsenal of measures need to be taken to deal with it, taxation in particular. How many times have we, the Greens and regionalists, said in this House that the tax weapon really should be used to change behaviour that poses a threat to the climate? And we are still waiting for that tax on pollution, that tax on discharges that change the atmosphere of our planet and which, in the end, are destroying entire regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Aids are in the process of changing. I do understand, Commissioner, that we have indeed little by little, disaster after disaster, deployed finance for repairs and prevention. Repairs are good, prevention is better, my fellow Members have said. However, and I agree with them entirely on this point, prevention is inconceivable without a far-reaching reform of the Structural Funds. So long as there is zoning it will be ineffective. You must understand that storms and floods often care nothing for the zones we have so cleverly drawn on a map far away in Brussels or elsewhere. So these funds definitely need to be reformed and perhaps all those Structural Funds that do not find any use on the ground but are paid back into Community and then national budgets could be better employed in prevention to meet this climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I was saying that these problems have obviously changed in frequency and scale. Even if European public policies are changing, which I note and welcome, I do not have the impression that they are changing at the same speed and to the same extent, and I regret that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The provisional toll of this disaster is particularly high: 30 departments are affected, eight of them severely, in particular Bouches-du-Rhône, Vaucluse and Gard. So far as the population is concerned, seven people have died and 32 500 have been displaced or taken to safety.</p>
<p class="contents">We might wonder about the origin of these tragedies and their frequency. Some will mention global warming or masses of hot air from the Mediterranean colliding with masses of cold air over my own region, Roussillon. But what can we do about it? Others will mention man’s mania for urbanisation, always wanting to build more at the expense of the countryside and indifferent to its population. However, forecasters considered this bad weather exceptional because it combined a number of factors: its duration – almost four days – its geographical extent and its intensity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight the unacceptable administrative inertia of the authorities in the face of the revelations made in the Lyon technical assistance office’s November 2002 report. That report in fact made a full diagnosis of the dangers of the river and recommended a number of measures to reduce the damage caused by any flooding. But that study, to which many people contributed and which cost EUR 3.5 million, has remained a dead letter and failed to worry the authorities concerned, or at least to do so soon enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again this bad weather has demonstrated the passivity of men in the face of disasters which, remember, cost seven people their lives. No notice was taken of the strong signal given more than a year ago highlighting the urgent need for a harmonious development of the rural environment taking the whole of the territory and its inhabitants into account. The French Government has released EUR 24 million to repair the dykes of the Rhône delta, which gave way at several points under the effect of the rising waters. But that sum is already proving inadequate on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the European Union’s Solidarity Fund, which was set up after the devastating floods of August 2002, will help, at European level, to provide swift and fair compensation for the victims and enable them to resume a normal life. But for how long? Some are making their third damage claims and doing their third clean up in the space of a few months. I was interested in what the Commissioner outlined just now, in particular about using the Structural Funds, but I second what Mrs Grossetête and Mr Onesta said regarding their limits.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course the damage must be repaired, but should we not be immediately starting major prevention works for this Mediterranean region that has been stricken regularly in recent years? Nîmes, Vaison-la-Romaine, Aramon, Lezignanais, Narbonnais, Minervois, Rennes-les-Bains, Couiza, Estagel, Saint-Laurent-de-la-Salanque, and these days Arles, Marseille, Montpellier, eloquent names and images, unbearable tragedies, much damage and loss of life.</p>
<p class="contents">This is becoming unacceptable in an age of satellite warning and forecasting, surveillance radar, specialist services and, moreover, the massive mechanisation that ought to make protective works possible. The Roman aqueduct at Ansignan, close to where I live, the better known pont du Gard and many other testimonies to human genius have withstood every assault. How can it be that the structures of the last century are not sufficiently reliable? It is no longer the time for words but for action, with the necessary resources, even if the scale of them should be exceptional. A Europe that believes in solidarity must stop letting its citizens die for lack of precautions and prevention. That, it seems to me, is a priority and a must. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that we have benefited from the solidarity of German and Italian firemen, but the reality as I speak to you now, the reality there even now is that there are hundreds and hundreds of dead bulls and sheep that people are still unable to recover from the flooded pastures and farms.</p>
<p class="contents">The reality is that in many small villages, like Codole in Gard, 98% of the houses were destroyed seven days before Christmas, hundreds of families are homeless, with definite budgetary realities. EUR 700 000 are needed for just one kilometre of dyke, EUR 150 000 in one small village to rebuild the roads, millions of euros to reconstruct public buildings, schools, multipurpose rooms, water treatment plants and sewer networks. The reality in a small village is EUR 5 000 every day to feed the homeless, the security services, families, even the military who are on guard to prevent looting; it is at least EUR 40 000 to 80 000 for every damaged house, and there are thousands of them. That is the most important of it. What is to be done? Who will pay? From which budget? Will it be the local authorities, the region, France or Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">In theory, Mr President, Commissioner, there are solidarity mechanisms. There is even a solidarity principle in Article 2 of the treaty. There are mechanisms on paper: the ERDF, Objective 2, the EAGGF guarantee which came into play for mad cow disease, direct advances for farmers that were used after the August 2002 floods, the 2000-2004 programme for civil defence and the new Solidarity Fund. In this connection, we all know, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that the Fund’s strict eligibility criteria and the modest EUR 1 billion allocated to it, which, incidentally, has already been swallowed up by the fires in Portugal or the earthquakes in Italy, are leaving my compatriots of Languedoc-Roussillon very much alone as Christmas approaches.</p>
<p class="contents">If, in the case we are concerned with, we have seen the coming of the floods but not of the euros, we must at least work for the future. First, by funding a real time information system, which does not exist since the mayors were not alerted. In these days in which we are living we need an electronic computer system from Lyons to Arles that will allow all the rivers, dykes, canals, arms and tributaries of the Rhône basin to be monitored in real time and the local elected representatives to be alerted in case of danger. The province of Murcia in Spain has done it, Mr President; we ought to be able to.</p>
<p class="contents">The crux of the matter lies elsewhere, however. Beyond prevention, reconstruction and compensation we must see that the floods of water mask the reality of a demographic flood. The senior citizens of northern Europe, not to mention the executives of the Paris region, come and make their homes in Languedoc-Roussillon, in Provence and throughout the south of France. Land is expropriated, the ground concreted over, 150 000 hectares of vines have flooded, and this is why, to cut a long story short, the area is swamped. What is more, the Dutch, English, Belgian and northern active European seniors will become truly aged citizens and demand extensive health care infrastructures in our region.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the overhaul of the Structural Funds must anticipate this territorial justice: if populations are transferred from north to south, the funding must be transferred as well, otherwise we will become the Palestinians of Europe, seeing colonies of senior citizens from Northern Europe settled among us. We do not want to be a permanently devastated West Bank in the South of France! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are now beginning to assess the scale of the damage, which has been considerable. Seven people have died and around 100 000 have been affected by the disaster. Tens of thousands have been forced to shelter in gymnasiums or other makeshift accommodation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the town of Arles alone, a third of the population has been evacuated. Thousands of jobs have disappeared under the water. Hundreds of flooded businesses have had to close their doors, plunging their employees into the uncertainty of temporary unemployment. The Camargue, with its fragile eco-system, is completely submerged: 250 km of dykes have been damaged, 560 hectares of farmland are under water, over 1000 animals have drowned, the entire rice sector has been destroyed. Damage in the region has been put at more than EUR one billion.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must show solidarity, in accordance with Article 2 of the regulation establishing the Solidarity Fund. This is an unprecedented disaster, as the region has fallen victim to the River Rhône’s ‘centennial flood’ – the most serious for a century. On behalf of the French Socialists, I ask the EU to make funds quickly available. Those stricken in the Rhône Delta expect nothing less. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should first like to express my utmost sympathy to the victims of these disasters. Although the French Government has taken the necessary emergency steps and declared a state of emergency, we need European solidarity. This has already been seen on the ground, and I wish to thank the German, Italian, Belgian and Czech teams that have gone to the aid of the victims. Hopefully, European solidarity will also manifest itself in the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund. The French Government is in the process of preparing a request to this end, which will be submitted at the beginning of 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">My region has already benefited from such funds, following the storms and appalling floods of September 2002, and I can assure you that these funds are of enormous importance. Whilst the Structural Funds enable the cofinancing of some preventative and aid measures, zoning and normal consumption of funds limit their scope. They are thus insufficient to help the stricken populations and regions. Nonetheless, I hope that the prevention of natural disasters will, in future, become an integral part of their aims: while we have a duty to repair the damage, the only real aid policy is prevention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
